24,30697459,Evaluation of planar bioluminescence imaging and microPET/CT for therapy monitoring in a mouse model of pigmented metastatic melanoma.,"Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is widely used for in-vivo monitoring of anti-cancer therapy in mice. [18F]MEL050 is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) radiotracer which specifically targets melanin. We evaluated planar BLI and [18F]MEL050-PET/CT for therapy (pro-apoptotic peptide LZDP) monitoring in a mouse model of metastatic pigmented melanoma. Twelve B6-albino mice were intravenously injected with B16-F10-luc2 cells on day 0 (D0). The mice received daily from D2 to D17 either an inactive peptide (G1, n=6), or LZDP (G2, n=6). They underwent both BLI and [18F]MEL050-PET/CT imaging on D2, D8 and D17. The number of visible tumors was determined on BLI and PET/CT. [18F]MEL050 uptake in tumor sites was quantified on PET/CT. After sacrifice (D17), the number of black tumors was counted ex-vivo. On D2, BLI and PET/CT images were visually negative. On D8, BLI detected 8 tumor sites in 4/6 mice of G1 vs 5 in 3/6 mice of G2 (NS); PET/CT was visually negative. On D17, BLI detected 17 tumor sites in 5/6 mice of G1 vs 10 in 4/6 mice of G2 (NS). PET/CT detected 18 tumor sites in 4/4 mice of G1 vs 14 in 3/4 mice of G2 (NS). Mean %ID/g of [18F]MEL050 in tumor sites was lower in G2 than in G1 on D17 (P<0.001), whereas bioluminescence intensity was not different between the 2 groups. Ex-vivo examination confirmed lower number of tumors in G2 (P<0.03). In the small number of animals tested in this study, [18F]MEL050-PET/CT and ex-vivo examination could affirm anti-tumoral effect of LZDP, but not BLI.",1,0,1,1
30,30713500,Activin Receptor Ligand Blocking and Cancer Have Distinct Effects on Protein and Redox Homeostasis in Skeletal Muscle and Liver.,"Muscle wasting in cancer cachexia can be alleviated by blocking activin receptor type 2 (ACVR2) ligands through changes in protein synthesis/degradation. These changes in cellular and protein metabolism may alter protein homeostasis. First, we elucidated the acute (1-2 days) and 2-week effects of blocking ACVR2 ligands by soluble activin receptor 2B (sACVR2B-Fc) on unfolded protein response (UPR), heat shock proteins (HSPs) and redox balance in a healthy mouse skeletal muscle. Second, we examined UPR, autophagy and redox balance with or without sACVR2B-Fc administration in muscle and liver of C26 tumor-bearing mice. The indicators of UPR and HSPs were not altered 1-2 days after a single sACVR2B-Fc administration in healthy muscles, but protein carbonyls increased (p < 0.05). Two weeks of sACVR2B-Fc administration increased muscle size, which was accompanied by increased UPR markers: GRP78 (p < 0.05), phosphorylated eIF2α (p < 0.01) and HSP47 (p < 0.01). Additionally, protein carbonyls and reduced form of glutathione increased (GSH) (p < 0.05). On the other hand, C26 cancer cachexia manifested decreased UPR markers (p-eIF2α, HSP47, p-JNK; p < 0.05) and antioxidant GSH (p < 0.001) in muscle, whereas the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione increased (GSSG/GSH; p < 0.001). Administration of sACVR2B-Fc prevented the decline in GSH and increased some of the UPR indicators in tumor-bearing mice. Additionally, autophagy markers LC3II/I (p < 0.05), Beclin-1 (p < 0.01), and P62 (p < 0.05) increased in the skeletal muscle of tumor-bearing mice. Finally, indicators of UPR, PERK, p-eIF2α and GRP78, increased (p < 0.05), whereas ATF4 was strongly decreased (p < 0.01) in the liver of tumor-bearing mice while sACVR2B-Fc had no effect. Muscle GSH and many of the altered UPR indicators correlated with tumor mass, fat mass and body mass loss. In conclusion, experimental cancer cachexia is accompanied by distinct and tissue-specific changes in proteostasis. Muscle hypertrophy induced by blocking ACVR2B ligands may be accompanied by the induction of UPR and increased protein carbonyls but blocking ACVR2B ligands may upregulate antioxidant protection.",1,0,1,2
32,30723481,Blockade of TNFα to Improve Human CD34+ Cell Repopulating Activity in Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation.,"Early release of TNFα after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) correlates with development of acute graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). Here we tested the effect of TNFα and alloreactive T cells on early hematopoietic HSC genotype and function. Addition of TNFα (10 ng/ml) in liquid cultures with CD34+ cells for 6-72 h resulted in the downregulation of genes associated with stem cell activity, such as DNMT3A, DNMT3B, TET1, TET2, SOX2, NANOG, and OCT4, whereas no significant effect was observed on DNMT1 and GATA2 expression. These findings were reversed by using an anti-TNFα antibody. Similar gene downregulation was observed when CD34+ cells were co-cultured with alloreactive T cells CD34+ cells for 48-72 h, and this effect was partially prevented by rapamycin and an anti-TNFα antibody. CD34+ cells pre-incubated with TNFα for 48 h and transplanted in irradiated NOD-SCID ɤnull (NSG) mice showed a reduced myeloid engraftment compared to control mice. By using a xenograft model recently developed in our lab, we co-transplanted CD34+ cells and allogeneic T lymphocytes at 1:0.1 ratio in one group that also received etanercept (TNFα inhibitor) at 100 μg intra-peritoneum (i.p.) on days -1,+1,+3,+5 post-HSCT, and in the control group. At 6 weeks post-transplant, mice that received etanercept had a significantly higher number of marrow huCD45+CD34+CD38- early stem cells (p = 0.03) and a reduced number of huCD45+CD3+ splenic T cells (p = 0.04) compared to controls. The repopulating activity of marrow cells from mice treated with etanercept vs. controls was tested in secondary transplants. Although the overall engraftment was similar in the two groups, CD34+ cells isolated from recipients of marrow from the etanercept group showed a significantly greater expression of stem cell-associated genes and a higher number of CD45+CD34+CD38- cells than in controls (p = 0.03). Our findings suggest that early TNFα increase post-transplant can affect long-term stem cell engraftment, and that blockade of TNFα early after transplant may limit a cytokine-mediated suppressive effect on repopulating stem cell function.",1,0,1,3
29,30705647,Dynamic Patterns of Threat-Associated Gene Expression in the Amygdala and Blood.,"Stress and trauma profoundly influence psychiatric biobehavioral outcomes. The identification of treatment and biomarker targets would be accelerated by a broad understanding of the biological responses to these events. The goal of this study was to determine genes responsive to auditory fear conditioning (FC), a well-characterized amygdala-dependent rodent model of threat-exposure, in the presence or absence of prior stress history, providing insight into the physiological processes underlying response to trauma. RNA-sequencing was performed in blood and amygdala from mice that underwent fear conditioning with (Immo+FC) and without (FC) prior immobilization stress, a paradigm that induces HPA axis, and behavioral stress sensitization. In the amygdala, 607 genes were regulated by FC vs. home-cage (HC) controls, and 516 genes differed in stress-sensitized mice (Immo+FC vs. FC). In the former, we observed an enhancement of specific biological processes involved in learning and synaptic transmission, and in the latter processes associated with cell proliferation and the cellular response to drugs. In the blood of stress-sensitized animals, 468 genes were dynamically regulated when compared to FC, and were enriched for the biological pathways of inflammation and cytokine signaling. This study identified genes and pathways that respond to threat in the amygdala and blood of mice with and without a prior stress history and reveals the impact of stress history on subsequent inflammation. Future studies will be needed to examine the role of these dynamically regulated genes may play in human clinical stress and trauma-related disorders.",1,0,1,4
40,30814882,Bone marrow-derived lineage-negative cells accelerate skin regeneration in vivo.,"Cell-based therapy is a promising strategy for promoting tissue regeneration when conventional treatments are not effective. ehT choice of the accessible source to obtain a sufficient cell amount and the use of suitable biomaterials to improve the cell delivery efficiency are the main tasks for safe, effective, and reliable application of stem cell therapy. In this study, we have compared the influence of bone marrow-derived Lin¯ cells on skin regeneration after local transplantation with or without type I collagen-based gel in a BALB/c mice full-thickness wound model. Lin¯ cells were isolated using magnetic-associated cell sorting and identified by flow cytometry. Cytokine gene expression was examined using real-time PCR. Our results show that the bone marrow-derived Lin¯ cell population demonstrates the properties to stimulate the skin tissue regeneration. Significant accelerated wound closure was revealed after cell transplantation (P < 0.05). Histological analysis indicated the earliest inhibition of inflammation, accelerated reepithelialization, and evenly distributed skin appendages in the neodermis after Lin¯ cell transplantation with type I collagen gel. eTh significant changes in mRNA levels of cytokines TNF-α, IL-10, TGF-β, and VEGF after Lin¯ cell transplantation were confirmed by RT-PCR (P < 0.05). eTh ability to positively control the reactions taking place during the wound healing process gives the advantage to the bone marrow Lin¯ cell population to be used as a cell source for therapy.",1,0,1,5
41,30886760,Enhanced cortical bone expansion in Lgals3-deficient mice during aging.,"Imbalances between bone formation and bone resorption, which can occur due to aging or sex hormone deprivation, result in decreased bone mass and an increased risk of fracture. Previous studies have suggested that the β-galactoside binding lectin, galectin-3, is involved in bone remodeling. We compared bone parameters of mice having null alleles of the galectin-3 gene (Lgals3-KO) with those of their wild-type littermates. Lgals3 deficiency increased cortical bone expansion at 36 weeks (wk) and preserved or enhanced bone mass in both male and female mutant mice. In addition, female Lgals3-KO mice were protected from age-related loss of trabecular bone. Histomorphometry and ex vivo primary cell differentiation assays showed increased osteoblastogenesis with little-to-no effect on osteoclastogenesis, suggesting the increased bone mass phenotype is primarily due to increased anabolism. Our study identifies galectin-3 as a negative regulator of bone formation and suggests that disruption of galectin-3 may be useful in preventing bone loss during aging.",1,0,1,6
18,30692914,Sirtuin 1 and Autophagy Attenuate Cisplatin-Induced Hair Cell Death in the Mouse Cochlea and Zebrafish Lateral Line.,"Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is one of the major adverse effects in cisplatin chemotherapy, and hearing protective approaches are unavailable in clinical practice. Recent work unveiled a critical role of autophagy in cell survival in various types of hearing loss. Since the excessive activation of autophagy can contribute to apoptotic cell death, whether the activation of autophagy increases or decreases the rate of cell death in CDDP ototoxicity is still being debated. In this study, we showed that CDDP induced activation of autophagy in the auditory cell HEI-OC1 at the early stage. We then used rapamycin, an autophagy activator, to increase the autophagy activity, and found that the cell death significantly decreased after CDDP injury. In contrast, treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) significantly increased cell death. In accordance with in vitro results, rapamycin alleviated CDDP-induced death of hair cells in zebrafish lateral line and cochlear hair cells in mice. Notably, we found that CDDP-induced increase of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the HEI-OC1 cells modulated the autophagy function. The specific SIRT1 activator SRT1720 could successfully protect against CDDP-induced cell loss in HEI-OC1 cells, zebrafish lateral line, and mice cochlea. These findings suggest that SIRT1 and autophagy activation can be suggested as potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CDDP-induced ototoxicity.",0,1,1,7
33,30733722,BET Bromodomain Inhibitors Which Permit Treg Function Enable a Combinatorial Strategy to Suppress GVHD in Pre-clinical Allogeneic HSCT.,"A recent approach for limiting production of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been to target bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins. These epigenetic readers of histone acetylation regulate transcription of genes involved in inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Development of BET inhibitors (BETi) has generated enormous interest for their therapeutic potential. Because inflammatory signals and donor T cells promote graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), regulating both pathways could be effective to abrogate this disorder. The objective of the present study was to identify a BETi which did not interfere in vivo with CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion and function to utilize together with Tregs following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) to ameliorate GVHD. We have reported that Tregs can be markedly expanded and selectively activated with increased functional capacity by targeting TNFRSF25 and CD25 with TL1A-Ig and low dose IL-2, respectively. Here, mice were treated over 7 days (TL1A-Ig + IL-2) together with BETi. We found that the BETi EP11313 did not decrease frequency/numbers or phenotype of expanded Tregs as well as effector molecules, such as IL-10 and TGF-β. However, BETi JQ1 interfered with Treg expansion and altered subset distribution and phenotype. Notably, in Treg expanded mice, EP11313 diminished tnfa and ifng but not il-2 RNA levels. Remarkably, Treg pSTAT5 expression was not affected by EP11313 supporting the notion that Treg IL-2 signaling remained intact. MHC-mismatched aHSCT (B6 → BALB/c) was performed using in vivo expanded donor Tregs with or without EP11313 short-term treatment in the recipient. Early post-transplant, improvement in the splenic and LN CD4/CD8 ratio along with fewer effector cells and high Treg levels in aHSCT recipients treated with expanded Tregs + EP11313 was detected. Interestingly, this group exhibited a significant diminution of GVHD clinical score with less skin and ocular involvement. Finally, using low numbers of highly purified expanded Tregs, improved clinical GVHD scores were observed in EP11313 treated recipients. In total, we conclude that use of this novel combinatorial strategy can suppress pre-clinical GVHD and posit, in vivo EP11313 treatment might be useful combined with Treg expansion therapy for treatment of diseases involving inflammatory responses.",1,0,1,8
13,30687643,TLR3 Is a Negative Regulator of Immune Responses Against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) comprise the best-characterized pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) family able to activate distinct immune responses depending on the receptor/adaptor set assembled. TLRs, such as TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9, and their signaling were shown to be important in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infections. However, the role of the endosomal TLR3 in experimental paracoccidioidomycosys remains obscure. In vitro assays, macrophages of the bone marrow of WT or TLR3-/- mice were differentiated for evaluation of their microbicidal activity. In vivo assays, WT or TLR3-/- mice were infected intratracheally with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis yeasts for investigation of the lung response type induced. The cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells was assessed by cytotoxicity assay. To confirm the importance of CD8+ T cells in the control of infection in the absence of tlr3, a depletion assay of these cells was performed. Here, we show for the first time that TLR3 modulate the infection against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis by dampening pro-inflammatory response, NO production, IFN+CD8+T, and IL-17+CD8+T cell activation and cytotoxic function, associated with granzyme B and perforin down regulation. As conclusion, we suggest that TLR3 could be used as an escape mechanism of the fungus in an experimental paracoccidioidomycosis.",1,0,1,9
8,30687029,The Expression of Transcription Factors Mecp2 and CREB Is Modulated in Inflammatory Pelvic Pain.,"Early activation of transcription factors is one of the epigenetic mechanisms contributing to the induction and maintenance of chronic pain states. Previous studies identified the changes in a number of nociception-related genes, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) in the pelvic organs after transient colonic inflammation. The gene and protein expression of these neuropeptides could be modulated by transcription factors Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). In this study, we aimed to evaluate time-dependent changes in the expression levels of Mecp2 and CREB in the lumbosacral (LS) spinal cord and sensory ganglia after inflammation-induced pelvic pain in rat. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) to induce transient colonic inflammation. LS (L6-S2) spinal cord segments and respective dorsal root ganglias (DRGs) were isolated from control and experimental animals at 1, 2, 6, 24 h and 3 days post-TNBS treatment. Immunohistochemical (IHC) labeling and Western blotting experiments were performed to assess the expression of Mecp2, CREB and their phosphorylated forms. Total Mecp2 expression, but not phosphorylated p-Mecp2 (pS421Mecp2) expression was detected in the cells of the spinal dorsal horn under control conditions. Colonic inflammation triggered a significant decrease in the number of Mecp2-expressing neurons in parallel with elevated numbers of pS421Mecp2-expressing cells at 2 h and 6 h post-TNBS. The majority of Mecp2-positive cells (80 ± 6%) co-expressed CREB. TNBS treatment caused a transient up-regulation of CREB-expressing cells at 1 h post-TNBS only. The number of cells expressing phosphorylated CREB (pS133CREB) did not change at 1 h and 2 h post-TNBS, but was down-regulated by three folds at 6 h post-TNBS. Analysis of DRG sections revealed that the number of Mecp2-positive neurons was up-regulated by TNBS treatment, reaching three-fold increase at 2 h post-TNBS, and eight-fold increase at 6 h post-TNBS (p ≤ 0.05 to control). These data showed early changes in Mecp2 and CREB expression in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and sensory ganglia after colonic inflammation, suggesting a possible contribution Mecp2 and CREB signaling in the development of visceral hyperalgesia and pelvic pain following peripheral inflammation.",1,0,1,10
2,30675169,Establishment and Identification of a CiPSC Lineage Reprogrammed from FSP-tdTomato Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs).,"Safety issues associated with transcription factors or viruses may be avoided with the use of chemically induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSCs), thus promoting their clinical application. Previously, we had successfully developed and standardized an induction method using small-molecule compound, with simple operation, uniform induction conditions, and clear constituents. In order to verify that the CiPSCs were indeed reprogrammed from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and further explore the underlying mechanisms, FSP-tdTomato mice were used to construct a fluorescent protein-tracking system of MEFs, for revealing the process of CiPSC reprogramming. CiPSCs were identified by morphological analysis, mRNA, and protein expression of pluripotency genes, as well as teratoma formation experiments. Results showed that after 40-day treatment of tdTomato-MEFs with small-molecule compounds, the cells were presented with prominent nucleoli, high core-to-cytoplasmic ratio, round shape, group and mass arrangement, and high expression of pluripotency gene. These cells could differentiate into three germ layer tissues in vivo. As indicated by the above results, tdTomato-MEFs could be reprogrammed into CiPSCs, a lineage that possesses pluripotency similar to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), with the use of small-molecule compounds. The establishment of CiPSC lineage, tracked by fluorescent protein, would benefit further studies exploring its underlying mechanisms. With continuous expression of fluorescent proteins during cellular differentiation, this cell lineage could be used for tracking CiPSC transplantation and differentiation into functional cells.",1,0,1,11
15,30687649,Eosinophil-Associated Innate IL-17 Response Promotes Aspergillus fumigatus Lung Pathology.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a common widespread microorganism with environmental, biological and clinical relevance. After inhalation, swollen conidia can germinate, colonize and invade pulmonary tissues. Eosinophils have been described as key cells in A. fumigatus lung infection. However, their specific role in protecting or damaging lung tissue as well as their relatioship among different A. fumigatus strains is poorly understood. Previously, it has been reported that eosinophils are able to produce IL-17 and mediate an innate response that protected mice from infection using Af293 and CEA10 strains. Here, we have developed a set of new experiments with the CEA17-derived A1163 strain of A. fumigatus. Using ΔdblGATA1 mice, we demonstrate that eosinophils produce IL-17 and are involved in control of neutrophil, macrophage and lymphocyte recruitment. We found that eosinophils also induce high levels of cytokines and chemokines, generating an intense inflammatory process. Eosinophils are responsible for increased pulmonary dysfunction and elevated lethality rates in mice. Curiously, fungal burden was not affected. To address the role of IL-17 signaling, pharmacological inhibition of this mediator in the airways with anti-IL-17 antibody was able to reduce inflammation in the airways and protect infected mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that eosinophils control IL-17-mediated response and contribute to lung pathology after A. fumigatus infection. Therefore, eosinophils may represent a potential target for controlling exacerbated inflammation and prevent tissue damage during this fungal infection.",0,1,1,12
35,30745874,Treatment With Naringenin Elevates the Activity of Transcription Factor Nrf2 to Protect Pancreatic β-Cells From Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetes in vitro and in vivo.,"Chronic hyperglycemia and unusually high oxidative stress are the key contributors for diabetes in humans. Since nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) controls the expression of antioxidant- and detoxification genes, it is hypothesized that targeted activation of Nrf2 using phytochemicals is likely to protect pancreatic β-cells, from oxidative damage, thereby mitigates the complications of diabetes. Naringenin is one such activator of Nrf2. However, it is currently not known whether the protective effect of naringenin against streptozotocin (STZ) induced damage is mediated by Nrf2 activation. Hence, the potential of naringenin to activate Nrf2 and protect pancreatic β-cells from STZ-induced damage in MIN6 cells is studied. In MIN6 cells, naringenin could activate Nrf2 and its target genes GST and NQO1, thereby inhibit cellular apoptosis. In animals, administration of 50 mg/kg body weight naringenin, for 45 days, significantly decreased STZ-induced blood glucose levels, normalized the lipid profile, and augmented the levels of antioxidants in pancreatic tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis measuring the number of insulin-positive cells in pancreas showed restoration of insulin expression similar to control animals. Furthermore, naringenin promoted glycolysis while inhibiting gluconeogenesis. In conclusion, naringenin could be a good anti-diabetic agent, which works by promoting Nrf2 levels and by decreasing cellular oxidative stress.",0,1,1,13
12,30687454,"The Endothelin Receptor Antagonist Macitentan Improves Isosorbide-5-Mononitrate (ISMN) and Isosorbide Dinitrate (ISDN) Induced Endothelial Dysfunction, Oxidative Stress, and Vascular Inflammation.","Organic nitrates such as isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISMN) and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) are used for the treatment of patients with chronic symptomatic stable coronary artery disease and chronic congestive heart failure. Limiting side effects of these nitrovasodilators include nitrate tolerance and/or endothelial dysfunction mediated by oxidative stress. Here, we tested the therapeutic effects of the dual endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist macitentan in ISMN- and ISDN-treated animals. Organic nitrates (ISMN, ISDN, and nitroglycerin (GTN)) augmented the oxidative burst and interleukin-6 release in cultured macrophages, whereas macitentan decreased the oxidative burst in isolated human leukocytes. Male C57BL/6j mice were treated with ISMN (75 mg/kg/d) or ISDN (25 mg/kg/d) via s.c. infusion for 7 days and some mice in addition with 30 mg/kg/d of macitentan (gavage, once daily). ISMN and ISDN in vivo therapy caused endothelial dysfunction but no nitrate (or cross-)tolerance to the organic nitrates, respectively. ISMN/ISDN increased blood nitrosative stress, vascular/cardiac oxidative stress via NOX-2 (fluorescence and chemiluminescence methods), ET1 expression, ET receptor signaling, and markers of inflammation (protein and mRNA level). ET receptor signaling blockade by macitentan normalized endothelial function, vascular/cardiac oxidative stress, and inflammatory phenotype in both nitrate therapy groups. ISMN/ISDN treatment caused activation of the NOX-2/ET receptor signaling axis leading to increased vascular oxidative stress and inflammation as well as endothelial dysfunction. Our study demonstrates for the first time that blockade of ET receptor signaling by the dual endothelin receptor blocker macitentan improves adverse side effects of the organic nitrates ISMN and ISDN.",1,0,1,14
43,31949646,TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling promotes collagen synthesis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle by down-regulating miR-29b.,"Deposition of fibronectin and collagen in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the proliferation, migration, and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) result in pulmonary arterial (PA) hypertrophy and muscularization, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). MicroRNA29 (miR-29) is reported to be associated with diseases such as liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and cardiac fibrosis in which collagen synthesis plays an important role. Due to the possible link between PAH and collagen, in this study, we examined the role and therapeutic potential of miR-29b in vitro and in a rat model of pulmonary hypertension induced by monocrotaline (MCT). Results revealed that miR-29b treatment PAH rats showed a lower level of collagen synthesis. Furthermore, in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), TGFβ1/Smad3 signaling negatively regulated the expression of miR-29b, and miR-29b suppressed collagen synthesis by directly targeting collagen I and blocking PI3K/AKT signaling. In addition, TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling promoted collagen synthesis in PASMCs by down-regulating miR-29b. Interestingly, Smad3 decreased the expression of miR-29b by interacting with its promotor. In conclusion, our results revealed that miR-29b plays an important role in collagen synthesis and may be a therapeutic target for PAH when regulated by the TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway.",0,1,1,15
31,30723413,A Metabolomics Approach to Investigate Kukoamine B-A Potent Natural Product With Anti-diabetic Properties.,"Due to the surge in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), treatments for chronic metabolic dysregulations with fewer side-effects are sought. Lycii Cortex (LyC), a traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) herb has a long history of being widely prescribed to treat T2DM as alternative medicine; however, the bioactive molecules and working mechanism remained unknown. Previous studies revealed kukoamine B (KB) as a major and featured compound for LyC with bioactivities for anti-oxidation and acute inflammation, which may be related to anti-diabetes properties. This study aims to understand the efficacy and the mode of action of KB in the diabetic (db/db) mouse model using a metabolomics approach. Parallel comparison was conducted using the first-line anti-diabetic drugs, metformin and rosligtazone, as positive controls. The db/db mice were treated with KB (50 mg kg-1 day-1) for 9 weeks. Bodyweight and fasting blood glucose were monitored every 5 and 7 days, respectively. Metabolomics and high-throughput molecular approaches, including lipidomics, targeted metabolomics (Biocrates p180), and cytokine profiling were applied to measure the alteration of serum metabolites and inflammatory biomarkers between different treatments vs. control (db/db mice treated with vehicle). After 9 weeks of treatment, KB lowered blood glucose, without the adverse effects of bodyweight gain and hepatomegaly shown after rosiglitazone treatment. Lipidomics analysis revealed that KB reduced levels of circulating triglycerides, cholesterol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and increased levels of phosphatidylcholines. KB also increased acylcarnitines, and reduced systemic inflammation (cytokine array). Pathway analysis suggested that KB may regulate nuclear transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB and/or PPAR) to reduce inflammation and facilitate a shift toward metabolic and inflammatory homeostasis. Comparison of KB with first-line drugs suggests that rosiglitazone may over-regulate lipid metabolism and anti-inflammatory responses, which may be associated with adverse side effects, while metformin had less impact on lipid and anti-inflammation profiles. Our research from holistic and systemic views supports the conclusion that KB is the bioactive compound of LyC for managing T2DM, and suggests KB as a nutraceutical or a pharmaceutical candidate for T2D treatment. In addition, our research provides insights related to metformin and rosiglitazone action, beyond lowering blood glucose.",1,0,1,16
44,31949651,miR-148a-3p exhaustion inhibits necrosis by regulating PTEN in acute pancreatitis.,"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a necro-inflammatory disorder with high mortality rate. With advances in understanding the pathogenesis of AP, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play an essential role in AP progression. However, the mechanism that allows miR-148a-3p to regulate necrosis in AP remains unclear. Caerulein treatment was used to induce AP in mice or cells. miR-148a-3p-/- mice or miR-148a-3p inhibition in wild type mice were used to investigate the effect of miR-148a-3p on AP. The expression of miR-148a-3p was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The abundances of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and hallmarks of necrosis or apoptosis were measured by qRT-PCR or western blots (WB). Cell necrosis, apoptosis, serum amylase or lipase activity and inflammatory cytokines levels were investigated by commercial assay kit. Inflammatory infiltration was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The interaction between miR-148a-3p and PTEN was probed by luciferase activity. miR-148a-3p was highly expressed in AP and knockout of miR-148a-3p inhibited water content, cell necrosis, amylase and lipase activity while inducing PTEN expression. Moreover, miR-148a-3p deletion attenuated inflammatory infiltration and necrosis by promoting apoptosis. In addition, miR-148a-3p knockdown protected against cell necrosis, amylase, and lipase activity in AP. Intriguingly, PTEN was a target of miR-148a-3p and interference of PTEN reversed the effect of miR-148a-3p deficiency on AP in vitro. miR-148a-3p inhibition repressed necrosis by regulating PTEN expression in AP, providing a novel biomarker of therapeutics for AP treatment.",1,0,1,17
36,30761008,Integration of Metabolomics and Transcriptomics Reveals the Therapeutic Mechanism Underlying Paeoniflorin for the Treatment of Allergic Asthma.,"Objectives: Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease, which is characterized by airway remodeling, hyperreactivity and shortness of breath. Paeoniflorin is one of the major active ingredients in Chinese peony, which exerts anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory effects in multiple diseases. However, it remains unclear whether paeoniflorin treatment can suppress allergic asthma. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the effect of paeoniflorin on lung function and airway inflammation in asthmatic mice. These asthmatic Balb/c mice were first sensitized and constructed through ovalbumin (OVA) motivation. Subsequently, we determined the mechanism of action of paeoniflorin in treating allergic asthma through integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic data sets. Results: Our results demonstrated that many genes and metabolites were regulated in the paeoniflorin-treated mice. Moreover, the potential target proteins of paeoniflorin played important roles in fatty acid metabolism, inflammatory response, oxidative stress and local adhesion. Conclusion: Paeoniflorin has a beneficial effect on asthma, which may be achieved through regulating fatty acid metabolism, inflammatory response and the adhesion pathway at system level.",1,0,1,18
1,30671473,LincRNA-p21 Inhibits Cell Viability and Promotes Cell Apoptosis in Parkinson's Disease through Activating α-Synuclein Expression.,"Long intergenic noncoding RNA-p21 (lincRNA-p21) has been reported to be increased in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the function and underlying mechanisms of lincRNA-p21 remain not clear. In order to explore the role of lincRNA-p21 in PD, we used 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce in vivo PD model (C57BL/6 mice) and utilized N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) to create in vitro PD model (SH-SY5Y cells). Results showed that the expression level of lincRNA-p21 was increased significantly in PD models. High abundance of lincRNA-p21 inhibited viability and promoted apoptosis markedly in SH-SY5Y cells treated with MPP+. Mechanistically, further experiments demonstrated that upregulation of lincRNA-p21 could sponge miR-1277-5p and indirectly increase the expression of α-synuclein to suppress viability and activate apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. In short, our study illustrated that lincRNA-p21/miR-1277-5p axis regulated viability and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells treated with MPP+ via targeting α-synuclein. LincRNA-p21 might be a novel target for PD.",0,1,1,19
7,30687016,Idebenone Alleviates Neuroinflammation and Modulates Microglial Polarization in LPS-Stimulated BV2 Cells and MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice.,"Background: Idebenone is an antioxidant and a coenzyme Q10 analog that has been used to treat neurodegeneration disease. Some studies show idebenone exerts anti-inflammatory effects. However, whether idebenone can be used to reduce the neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been little studied. Methods: The study investigated the potential anti-inflammatory effects of idebenone in vitro and in vivo, using cell models of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-simulated BV2 cells and animal models of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD with or without idebenone. To verify how idebenone exerts its effects on the BV2 cell activation and PD model, we performed the mechanistic studies in vitro and in vivo. Results: In vitro study showed that pretreatment with idebenone could attenuate the production of pro-inflammatory factors in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells and promoted a phenotypic switch from the M1 state to the M2 state. Mechanistically, idebenone reduced the activation of the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway upon LPS stimulation. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that pretreatment with idebenone could ameliorate MPTP-induced neurodegeneration and modulate microglia phenotypes through inhibition of the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway in the SN. Conclusion: These results suggest that idebenone ameliorates the neurological deficits related to PD and this effect is partly mediated by inhibiting the neuroinflammation and modulating microglia phenotypes.",0,1,1,20
23,30697364,Profiling of Argonaute-2-loaded microRNAs in a mouse model of frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17.,"Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the pathological aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. These include more than 20 diseases, with Alzheimer's disease being the most frequent. While pathological and neurotoxic effects of tau are well documented, the mechanisms by which tau can promote neurodegeneration are less clear. Increasing evidence suggests a functional role for microRNAs in the pathogenesis of tauopathies, with altered expression and function of microRNAs in experimental models and patient brain. To determine whether a pathological expression of tau leads to altered microRNA expression, we investigated a mouse model (VLW), which overexpresses tau carrying three mutations identified in patients suffering from frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17. Argonaute-2-bound microRNAs were co-immunoprecipitated using hippocampal tissue to identify active microRNAs within the model and quantified using a genome-wide high-throughput qPCR-based microRNA platform. While similar numbers of microRNAs are present between wild-type and VLW mice, a prominent increase in Argonaute-2-bound levels of microRNAs could be observed in VLW mice. This included microRNA-134, microRNA-99a and microRNA-101. Subsequent experiments revealed this increase in Argonaute-2 loading of microRNAs to correlate with increased microRNA expression. Our in vivo study suggests that a pathological tau overexpression may lead to an increase in active microRNAs, possibly contributing to dysregulation of gene expression and tau-induced pathology.",0,1,1,21
20,30692927,Deficiency of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Protects Cardiac Function Impaired by LPS-Induced Acute Inflammation.,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a bacterial wall endotoxin producing many pathophysiological conditions including myocardial inflammation leading to cardiotoxicity. Linoleic acid (18:2n6, LA) is an essential n-6 PUFA which is converted to arachidonic acid (20:4n6, AA) by desaturation and elongation via enzyme systems within the body. Biological transformation of PUFA through CYP-mediated hydroxylation, epoxidation, and allylic oxidation produces lipid mediators, which may be subsequently hydrolyzed to corresponding diol metabolites by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). In the current study, we investigate whether inhibition of sEH, which alters the PUFA metabolite profile, can influence LPS induced cardiotoxicity and mitochondrial function. Our data demonstrate that deletion of soluble epoxide hydrolase provides protective effects against LPS-induced cardiotoxicity by maintaining mitochondrial function. There was a marked alteration in the cardiac metabolite profile with notable increases in sEH-derived vicinal diols, 9,10- and 12,13-dihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (DiHOME) in WT hearts following LPS administration, which was absent in sEH null mice. We found that DiHOMEs triggered pronounced mitochondrial structural abnormalities, which also contributed to the development of extensive mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac cells. Accumulation of DiHOMEs may represent an intermediate mechanism through which LPS-induced acute inflammation triggers deleterious alterations in the myocardium in vivo and cardiac cells in vitro. This study reveals novel research exploring the contribution of DiHOMEs in the progression of adverse inflammatory responses toward cardiac function in vitro and in vivo.",1,0,1,22
11,30687331,Treatment Effects of the Second-Generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Dasatinib on Autoimmune Arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as persistent synovitis and progressive joint destruction. Imatinib exhibited a therapeutic effect in murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) via selective inhibition tyrosine kinases. The second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib exhibits more durable hematological and cytogenetic effects and more potency compared to imatinib. However, the effect of dasatinib on CIA is poorly understood. The present study investigated the treatment effect of dasatinib on autoimmune arthritis. We demonstrated that dasatinib alleviated arthritis symptoms and histopathological destruction in CIA mice. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, and promoted the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Dasatinib treatment also suppressed the expression of anti-mouse CII antibodies including total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG2b, in CIA mice. We further demonstrated that dasatinib inhibited the migration and proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from RA patients and promoted FLS apoptosis. The mRNA expression of MMP13, VEGF, FGF, and DKK1 was down-regulated in FLS treated with dasatinib. Our findings suggest that dasatinib exhibited treatment effects on CIA mice and that FLS are an important target cell of dasatinib treatment in autoimmune arthritis.",1,0,1,23
37,30763491,[The prospective of using plant polyphenols as functional food ingredients].,"In this review we briefly discuss the publications dedicated to experimental evaluation of hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and antioxidant properties of different plant polyphenols. The stages of preclinical studies of their efficacy are presented: in silico studies with molecular docking methods and in vivo studies with the use of genetic and medicamental models of type 2 diabetes. The results of own studies present the substantiation of prospects of using the plant polyphenol extracts as functional food ingredients for diet therapy and treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. It was shown using genetic fatty Zucker rats model that extract consumption led to lower blood glucose level, had beneficial effect on glucose sensitivity and also improved the reaction of insulin-sensitive tissues on exogenous injection of glucose and insulin. Hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties of bilberry leaves extract were characterized on male Wistar rats model of carbohydrate metabolism disorder (streptozotocin injection accompanied with consumption of 10% fructose solution). The results of previous studies showed the beneficial effects of bilberry leaves extract on carbohydrate metabolism and determined the task to enhance the efficacy of developed polyphenol ingredient by the way of sorption on protein food matrix - brown buckwheat flour. Thus, a brief review of presented in this article results of foreign and domestic experimental studies shows the prospect of using the individual plant polyphenols and polyphenol plant extracts as phytonutrients for diet therapy and treatment of diseases associated with disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.",0,1,1,24
34,30740090,"Anti-arrhythmic Cardiac Phenotype Elicited by Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia Is Associated With Alterations in Connexin-43 Expression, Phosphorylation, and Distribution.","Remodeling of the cellular distribution of gap junctions formed mainly by connexin-43 (Cx43) can be related to the increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias. It has been shown that adaptation to chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (IHH) attenuates the incidence and severity of ischemic and reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias and increases the proportion of anti-arrhythmic n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) in heart phospholipids. Wistar rats were exposed to simulated IHH (7,000 m, 8-h/day, 35 exposures) and compared with normoxic controls (N). Cx43 expression, phosphorylation, localization and n-3 PUFA proportion were analyzed in left ventricular myocardium. Compared to N, IHH led to higher expression of total Cx43, its variant phosphorylated at Ser368 [p-Cx43(Ser368)], which maintains end to end communication, as well as p-Cx43(Ser364/365), which facilitates conductivity. By contrast, expression of non-phosphorylated Cx43 and p-Cx43(Ser278/289), attenuating intercellular communication, was lower in IHH than in N. IHH also resulted in increased expression of protein kinase A and protein kinase G while casein kinase 1 did not change compared to N. In IHH group, which exhibited reduced incidence of ischemic ventricular arrhythmias, Cx43 and p-Cx43(Ser368) were more abundant at end to end gap junctions than in N group and this difference was preserved after acute regional ischemia (10 min). We further confirmed higher n-3 PUFA proportion in heart phospholipids after adaptation to IHH, which was even further increased by ischemia. Our results suggest that adaptation to IHH alters expression, phosphorylation and distribution of Cx43 as well as cardioprotective n-3PUFA proportion suggesting that the anti-arrhythmic phenotype elicited by IHH can be at least partly related to the stabilization of the end to end conductivity between cardiomyocytes during brief ischemia.",1,0,1,25
27,30705620,Fragile-X Syndrome Is Associated With NMDA Receptor Hypofunction and Reduced Dendritic Complexity in Mature Dentate Granule Cells.,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability. It is caused by the overexpansion of cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) trinucleotide in Fmr1 gene, resulting in complete loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Previous studies using Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1 KO) mice have suggested that a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) hypofunction in the hippocampal dentate gyrus may partly contribute to cognitive impairments in FXS. Since activation of NMDAR plays an important role in dendritic arborization during neuronal development, we examined whether deficits in NMDAR function are associated with alterations in dendritic complexity in the hippocampal dentate region. The dentate granule cell layer (GCL) presents active postnatal neurogenesis, and consists of a heterogenous neuronal population with gradient ages from the superficial to its deep layer. Here, we show that neurons with multiple primary dendrites that reside in the outer GCL of Fmr1 KO mice display significantly smaller NMDAR excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) and a higher α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) to NMDA ratio in comparison to their wild-type counterparts. These deficits were associated with a significant decrease in dendritic complexity, with both dendritic length and number of intersections being significantly reduced. In contrast, although neurons with a single primary dendrite resided in the inner GCL of Fmr1 KO mice had a trend toward a reduction in NMDAR EPSCs and a higher AMPA/NMDA ratio, no alterations were found in dendritic complexity at this developmental stage. Our data indicate that the loss of FMRP causes NMDAR deficits and reduced dendritic complexity in granule neurons with multiple primary dendrites which are thought to be more mature in the GCL.",1,0,1,26
16,30687711,Effect of Hypoproteic and High-Fat Diets on Hippocampal Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability and Oxidative Stress.,"Worldwide, millions of people are exposed to dietary imbalance that impacts in health and quality of life. In developing countries, like in Brazil, in poor settings, dietary habits, traditionally hypoproteic, are changing rapidly to western-type high-fat foods. These rapidly changing dietary habits are imposing new challenges to human health and there are many questions in the field that remain to be answered. Accordingly, we currently do not know if chronic consumption of hypoproteic (regional basic diet, RBD) or high-fat diets (HFD) may impact the brain physiology, contributing to blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and neuroinflammatory events. To address this issue, mice were challenged by breastfeeding from dams receiving standard, RBD or HFD from suckling day 10 until weaning. Immediately after weaning, mice continued under the same diets until post-natal day 52. Herein, we show that both RBD and HFD cause not only a peripheral but also a consistent central neuroinflammatory response, characterized by an increased production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, BBB hyperpermeability, accounted by an increase in hippocampal albumin content, a decrease in claudin-5 protein levels and collagen IV immunostaining, was also observed together with an upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). Interestingly, we also identified a significant astrogliosis, manifested by upregulation of GFAP and S100β levels and an intensification of arbor complexity of these glial cells. In sum, our data show that dietary imbalance, related with hypoproteic or high-fat content, impairs BBB properties potentially favoring the transmigration of peripheral immune cells and induces both a peripheral and central neuroinflammatory status. Noteworthy, neuroinflammatory events in the hippocampus may cause neuronal malfunction leading to cognitive deficits and long-term persistence of this phenomenon may contribute to age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",1,0,1,27
9,30687032,Experience-Dependent Effects of Muscimol-Induced Hippocampal Excitation on Mnemonic Discrimination.,"Memory requires similar episodes with overlapping features to be represented distinctly, a process that is disrupted in many clinical conditions as well as normal aging. Data from humans have linked this ability to activity in hippocampal CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG). While animal models have shown the perirhinal cortex is critical for disambiguating similar stimuli, hippocampal activity has not been causally linked to discrimination abilities. The goal of the current study was to determine how disrupting CA3/DG activity would impact performance on a rodent mnemonic discrimination task. Rats were surgically implanted with bilateral guide cannulae targeting dorsal CA3/DG. In Experiment 1, the effect of intra-hippocampal muscimol on target-lure discrimination was assessed within subjects in randomized blocks. Muscimol initially impaired discrimination across all levels of target-lure similarity, but performance improved on subsequent test blocks irrespective of stimulus similarity and infusion condition. To clarify these results, Experiment 2 examined whether prior experience with objects influenced the effect of muscimol on target-lure discrimination. Rats that received vehicle infusions in a first test block, followed by muscimol in a second block, did not show discrimination impairments for target-lure pairs of any similarity. In contrast, rats that received muscimol infusions in the first test block were impaired across all levels of target-lure similarity. Following discrimination tests, rats from Experiment 2 were trained on a spatial alternation task. Muscimol infusions increased the number of spatial errors made, relative to vehicle infusions, confirming that muscimol remained effective in disrupting behavioral performance. At the conclusion of behavioral experiments, fluorescence in situ hybridization for the immediate-early genes Arc and Homer1a was used to determine the proportion of neurons active following muscimol infusion. Contrary to expectations, muscimol increased neural activity in DG. An additional experiment was carried out to quantify neural activity in naïve rats that received an intra-hippocampal infusion of vehicle or muscimol. Results confirmed that muscimol led to DG excitation, likely through its actions on interneuron populations in hilar and molecular layers of DG and consequent disinhibition of principal cells. Taken together, our results suggest disruption of coordinated neural activity across the hippocampus impairs mnemonic discrimination when lure stimuli are novel.",1,0,1,28
0,30671128,A Novel Integrative Processing Technology for the Preparation of Rehmanniae Radix Slices.,"The traditional processing method for the slices preparation of Rehmanniae roots is time- and energy-consuming and is prone to result in loss of active components during twice water-treatment (once for wash and the other for softening) and drying steps. In this study, we firstly explored an integrative processing technique for Rehmanniae Radix by 2x3 factorial experiment based on the contents of catalpol and verbascoside as measured by HPLC. The potential differences between the traditional stepwise processing technique and the integrative processing technique for catalpol and verbascoside in the prepared slices were investigated. To further confirm the effectiveness of drugs using the integrative processing technique, some pharmacological variables, such as rectal temperature, hematologic parameters (RBC, HGB, HCT, and blood viscosity), and coagulation parameters (TT, APTT, PT and FIB), were detected in a blood-heat and hemorrhage syndrome rat model. Two-way ANOVA analysis showed that drying for 18 h at 50°C was considered as the best combination of process conditions. The mean catalpol and verbascoside contents in the integrative method-processed samples (4.30% and 0.33%, respectively) were higher than those in the traditional method-processed samples (2.61% and 0.21%, respectively). Significant increases in rectal temperature, and hematologic parameters, TT, APTT, and FIB, were observed in the model group rats, compared to the blank group animals (P<0.01). Both in the integrative groups and traditional groups, the extracts caused significant decreases in rectal temperature, RBC, HGB, and HCT with increased concentration compared to the model group animals. All coagulation parameters tested were shortened in model rats received two kind prepared slices. There were no significant therapeutic differences between the integrative and the traditional method-processed slices on the hemostasis and hemorheological parameters in this blood-heat and hemorrhage syndrome rat model, indicating that our integrative method may be a feasible technique for processing Rehmanniae Radix slices.",1,0,1,29

3,30684346,General comparative anatomy of human and white rat digestive systems: a bibliographic analysis.,"Introduction: The gastrointestinal tract of humans has much in common with most species of laboratory animals, particularly at the level of microscopic study. White rats are widely used in the experiments to determine the influence of the environmental factors on the human. The aim: Study the general comparative anatomy of the digestive system of the human and the white rat through the bibliographic analysis of the publications. Materials and methods: Current scientific publications on the study of the human and the white rat gastrointestinal tract morphology were used as the material for the research by analyzing, synthesizing and generalizing the information obtained. Review and conclusions: Generally, the anatomical structure of the white rat digestive system is similar to the human one. Phylogenetically, the digestive systems of humans and rats are the homologous functional system that are much in common regarding the structure and functions of the organs, the significance of which is in the perception, mechanical and chemical (enzymatic) digestion and absorption of the nutrients into the body.",0,1,0,32
26,30703768,The Effect of the Prethanol Extract of Trifolium pratense Leaves on Interleukin-1β-Induced Cartilage Matrix Degradation in Primary Rat Chondrocytes.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease, characterized by cartilage degradation and inflammation. The proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1β, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of OA by inducing the release of other catabolic factors that contribute to cartilage degradation. Trifolium pratense L. (red clover) has been used as a medicinal plant in many countries and as a source of nutraceuticals to alleviate the symptoms of menopause. Ob-jectives: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the anticatabolic effect of 40% prethanol extract of T. pratense (40% PeTP) on IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes. Primary rat chondrocytes were pretreated with 40% PeTP for 1 h before stimulation with IL-1β (20 ng/mL). The production of nitrite, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and aggrecan was measured by using Griess reagent and ELISA. Protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif (ADAMTS)-4, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 subunit was measured by using Western blotting. PeTP (40%) significantly inhibited the IL-1β-induced expression of nitrite, iNOS, PGE2, COX-2, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-4 in isolated primary rat chondrocytes. Furthermore, 40% PeTP decreased the IL-1β-induced degradation of aggrecan, the phosphorylation of MAPKs, and the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit. These results suggested that 40% PeTP has a chondroprotective effect on inflammation and may be a potential preventative agent for OA progression.",1,0,0,33
28,30705640,Milk From Cow Fed With High Forage/Concentrate Ratio Diet: Beneficial Effect on Rat Skeletal Muscle Inflammatory State and Oxidative Stress Through Modulation of Mitochondrial Functions and AMPK Activity.,"Milk and dairy products are relevant components of daily diet and are part of dietary recommendation in many countries due to their content of key nutrients. However, the relatively high content of saturated fat of the milk and its extensive usage for every age group raises concerns about its potential negative health effects. Therefore, in the last years, several researchers dedicated their attention to milk production and quality. Milk fatty acids profile depend on cow feeding and in particular on the type of forage and concentrate and forage/concentrate ratio. It was demonstrated that feeding dairy cows with a 70/30 forage/concentrate ratio yields milk with a low ω6:ω3 ratio and high CLA levels. In this work, we demonstrated that the supplementation of rats diet with this high forage milk (HFM) results, in the skeletal muscle of these animals, in a reduced lipid content and inflammation levels, and an improved mitochondrial lipid oxidation, and redox status through modulation of AMPK activity.",1,0,0,34
42,30991389,Assessing Cerebral Metabolism in the Immature Rodent: From Extracts to Real-Time Assessments.,"Brain development is an energy-expensive process. Although glucose is irreplaceable, the developing brain utilizes a variety of substrates such as lactate and the ketone bodies, β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, to produce energy and synthesize the structural components necessary for cerebral maturation. When oxygen and nutrient supplies to the brain are restricted, as in neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI), cerebral energy metabolism undergoes alterations in substrate use to preserve the production of adenosine triphosphate. These changes have been studied by in situ biochemical methods that yielded valuable quantitative information about high-energy and glycolytic metabolites and established a temporal profile of the cerebral metabolic response to hypoxia and HI. However, these analyses relied on terminal experiments and averaging values from several animals at each time point as well as challenging requirements for accurate tissue processing.More recent methodologies have focused on in vivo longitudinal analyses in individual animals. The emerging field of metabolomics provides a new investigative tool for studying cerebral metabolism. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has enabled the acquisition of a snapshot of the metabolic status of the brain as quantifiable spectra of various intracellular metabolites. Proton (1H) MRS has been used extensively as an experimental and diagnostic tool of HI in the pursuit of markers of long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Still, the interpretation of the metabolite spectra acquired with 1H MRS has proven challenging, due to discrepancies among studies, regarding calculations and timing of measurements. As a result, the predictive utility of such studies is not clear. 13C MRS is methodologically more challenging, but it provides a unique window on living tissue metabolism via measurements of the incorporation of 13C label from substrates into brain metabolites and the localized determination of various metabolic fluxes. The newly developed hyperpolarized 13C MRS is an exciting method for assessing cerebral metabolism in vivo, that bears the advantages of conventional 13C MRS but with a huge gain in signal intensity and much shorter acquisition times. The first part of this review article provides a brief description of the findings of biochemical and imaging methods over the years as well as a discussion of their associated strengths and pitfalls. The second part summarizes the current knowledge on cerebral metabolism during development and HI brain injury.",0,1,0,35
10,30687269,Elucidating the Immune-Related Mechanisms by Which Probiotic Strain Lactobacillus casei BL23 Displays Anti-tumoral Properties.,"We have recently described antitumor properties of Lactobacillus casei BL23 strain in both a mouse allograft model of human papilloma virus (HPV)-induced cancer and dimethylhydrazine-associated colorectal cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects are still unknown. Interestingly, in vitro cellular models show that this bacterium is able to stimulate the production of high levels of IL-2. Because this cytokine has well-known antitumor properties, we decided to explore its role in the anti-cancer effects of BL23 using the HPV-induced cancer model. We found a negative correlation between IL-2 and tumor size confirming the necessity of IL-2 to protect from tumor development. Then, we blocked IL-2 synthesis using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies in mice that were challenged with lethal levels of tumor cells; this led to a significant reduction in the protective abilities of BL23. Next, we used a genetically modified strain of Lactococcus lactis to deliver exogenous IL-2 to the system, and in doing so, we were able to partially mimic the antitumor properties of BL23. Additionally, we showed the systemic role of T-cells in tumor protection through a negative correlation between tumor size and T-cells subpopulations and an increasement of BL23-specific local Foxp3 levels in tumor-bearing mice. Finally, we observed a negative correlation between tumor size and NK+ cells, but local recruitment of NK cells and cytotoxic activity appeared specific to BL23 treatment. Taken together, our data suggest that IL-2 signaling pathway plays an important role in the anti-tumoral effects of probiotic strain L. casei BL23. These results encourage further investigation in the use of probiotic strains for potential therapeutic applications to clinical practice, in particular for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, our approach could be extended and applied to other potential beneficial microorganisms, such as gut microbiota, in order to better understand the crosstalk between microbes and the host.",1,0,0,36
25,30700973,The Effect of Fucoidan on Cellular Oxidative Stress and the CatD-Bax Signaling Axis in MN9D Cells Damaged by 1-Methyl-4-Phenypyridinium.,"Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of fucoidan (FUC) on the oxidative stress response and lysosomal apoptotic pathways in the Parkinson disease (PD) cell model. Methods: The Dopaminergic nerve precursor cell line(MN9D) cells that served as a PD model in this study underwent damage induced by 100 μM 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridine (MPP+). Cell viability was assessed after FUC treatment and intracellular SOD GSH was measured via immunofluorescence assay. Cellular changes in cathepsin D, Autophagy marker Light Chain 3-II (LC3-II), and apoptotic protein Bax were assessed by Western blot. The expression of Cat D, LC3-II, and B cell lymphoma-2-associated x protein (Bax) was also measured after addition of the cathepsin inhibitor, pepstatin A. Results: The results indicated that MN9D cell viability decreased by 50% within 24 h after 100 μM MPP+ induced toxicity. Pretreatment with 100 μM Fucoidan reduced cellular expression of LC3-II and CatD in 3 h and suppressed the induction of Bax protein. After pepstatin A treatment, Bax expression was significantly downregulated.FUC reversed the reduction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) L-Glutathione(GSH), decreased cell viability, and apoptosis induced by MPP+ in 6 h, suggesting that Fucoidan can attenuate damage to MN9D cells induced by MPP+. Conclusions: Fucoidan protected lysosomes, reduced the expression of LC3-II, inhibited the expression of CatD-Bax and the oxidative stress response, suppressed apoptosis, and thus conferred protective effects for dopaminergic neural cells. FUC may have neuroprotective effects on PD and further research is needed.",0,1,0,37
5,30686979,Radiation Induces Distinct Changes in Defined Subpopulations of Neural Stem and Progenitor Cells in the Adult Hippocampus.,"While irradiation can effectively treat brain tumors, this therapy also causes cognitive impairments, some of which may stem from the disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis. To study how radiation affects neurogenesis, we combine phenotyping of subpopulations of hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells with double- and triple S-phase labeling paradigms. Using this approach, we reveal new features of division, survival, and differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells after exposure to gamma radiation. We show that dividing neural stem cells, while susceptible to damage induced by gamma rays, are less vulnerable than their rapidly amplifying progeny. We also show that dividing stem and progenitor cells that survive irradiation are suppressed in their ability to replicate 0.5-1 day after the radiation exposure. Suppression of division is also observed for cells that entered the cell cycle after irradiation or were not in the S phase at the time of exposure. Determining the longer term effects of irradiation, we found that 2 months after exposure, radiation-induced suppression of division is partially relieved for both stem and progenitor cells, without evidence for compensatory symmetric divisions as a means to restore the normal level of neurogenesis. By that time, most mature young neurons, born 2-4 weeks after the irradiation, still bear the consequences of radiation exposure, unlike younger neurons undergoing early stages of differentiation without overt signs of deficient maturation. Later, 6 months after an exposure to 5 Gy, cell proliferation and neurogenesis are further impaired, though neural stem cells are still available in the niche, and their pool is preserved. Our results indicate that various subpopulations of stem and progenitor cells in the adult hippocampus have different susceptibility to gamma radiation, and that neurogenesis, even after a temporary restoration, is impaired in the long term after exposure to gamma rays. Our study provides a framework for investigating critical issues of neural stem cell maintenance, aging, interaction with their microenvironment, and post-irradiation therapy.",0,1,0,38
21,30693038,Fasudil Promotes BMSC Migration via Activating the MAPK Signaling Pathway and Application in a Model of Spinal Cord Injury.,"Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are considered as transplants for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) trauma, but the therapeutic effect is restricted by their finite mobility and homing capacity. Fasudil (FAS), a potent Rho kinase inhibitor, has been reported to alleviate nerve damage and induce the differentiation of BMSCs into neuron-like cells. However, the effect of FAS on the migration of BMSCs remains largely unknown. The present study revealed that FAS significantly enhanced the migration ability and actin stress fiber formation of BMSCs in vitro with an optimal concentration of 30 μmol/L. Moreover, we found that activation of the MAPK signaling pathway was involved in these FAS-mediated phenomena. In vivo, cells pretreated with FAS showed greater homing capacity from the injection site to the spinal cord injury site. Taken together, the present results indicate that FAS acts as a promoting factor of BMSC migration both in vitro and in vivo, possibly by inducing actin stress fiber formation via the MAPK signaling pathway, suggesting that FAS might possess synergistic effect in stem cell transplantation of CNS trauma.",0,1,0,39
39,30799984,Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant alkaline shock protein 23 from Staphylococcus aureus in a murine model.,"The diversity and severity of infections caused and the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance necessitates the development of a vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus. None of the antigens tried as vaccine candidates so far has been translated into a clinically viable vaccine. Recent research data suggest that antigens with the potential to activate cell mediated immunity along with humoral immunity would be the key to the development of a vaccine. Alkaline shock protein 23, a membrane-anchored protein involved in the stress response, has been identified as a CD4+ T cell antigen from S. aureus. In the present study, we report the evaluation of immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant alkaline shock protein 23 from S. aureus in mouse models. The gene coding for the protein was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, purified using immobilized metal iron affinity chromatography, sequence-confirmed using mass spectrometry and intraperitoneally administered to BALB/c mice. Serum titers of IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a in response to the protein were measured on post-immunization days 21, 35 and 42 using indirect ELISA and compared to control mice injected with PBS. Our results showed that the protein induced significantly higher (p < 0.01) antibody responses in immunized mice compared to the control mice. The mean serum antibody titers of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a three weeks after the last immunization were found to be 25600, 25600 and 12800 respectively. Moreover, we found that immunization with Asp23 protected mice from a lethal dose of S. aureus strain USA300.",1,0,0,40
19,30692926,High Throughput mRNA Sequencing Reveals Potential Therapeutic Targets of Tao-Hong-Si-Wu Decoction in Experimental Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion.,"Background: Experimental and clinical studies have shown that Tao-Hong-Si-Wu decoction (THSWD) improved neurological deficits resulting from Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO). However, the mechanisms of action of THSWD in MCAO have not been characterized. In this study, the mRNA transcriptome was used to study various therapeutic targets of THSWD. Methods: RNA-seq was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). MCAO-induced up-regulated genes (MCAO vs. control) and THSWD-induced down-regulated genes (compared to MCAO) were identified. Intersection genes were defined as up-regulated differentially expression genes (up-DEGs) identified as MCAO-induced gene expression that were reversed by THSWD. Genes down-regulated by MCAO and up-regulated by THSWD were grouped as another series of intersections. Biological functions and signaling pathways were determined by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. In addition, several identified genes were validated by RT-qPCR. Results: A total of 339 DEGs were filtered based on the 2 series (MCAO vs. control and MCAO vs. THSWD), and were represented by genes involved in cell cycle (rno04110), ECM-receptor interaction (rno04512), complement and coagulation cascades (rno04610), focal adhesion (rno04510), hematopoietic cell lineage (rno04640), neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (rno04080), cocaine addiction (rno05030), amphetamine addiction (rno05031), nicotine addiction (rno05033), fat digestion and absorption (rno04975), glycerophospholipid metabolism (rno00564), and others. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network consisted of 202 nodes and 1,700 connections, and identified two main modules by MOCDE. Conclusion: Cell cycle (rno04110), ECM-receptor interaction (rno04512), complement and coagulation cascades (rno04610), focal adhesion (rno04510), hematopoietic cell lineage (rno04640), and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions (rno04080) are potential therapeutic targets of THSWD in MCAO. This study provided a theoretical basis for THSWD prevention of neurological deficits resulting from intracerebral hemorrhage.",0,1,0,41
6,30687003,Ferroptosis Contributes to Isoflurane Neurotoxicity.,"The underlying mechanisms of isoflurane neurotoxicity in the developing brain remain unclear. Ferroptosis is a recently characterized form of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis or autophagy, characterized by iron-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation secondary to failure of glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses. The results of the present study are the first to demonstrate in vitro that ferroptosis is a central mechanism contributing to isoflurane neurotoxicity. We observed in embryonic mouse primary cortical neuronal cultures (day-in-vitro 7) that 6 h of 2% isoflurane exposure was associated with decreased transcription and protein expression of the lipid repair enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4. In parallel, isoflurane exposure resulted in increased ROS generation, disruption in mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell death. These effects were significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with the selective ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Collectively, these observations provide a novel mechanism for isoflurane-induced injury in the developing brain and suggest that pre-treatment with Fer-1 may be a potential clinical intervention for neuroprotection.",1,0,0,42
17,30687812,Oral Ibuprofen Interferes with Cellular Healing Responses in a Murine Model of Achilles Tendinopathy.,"The attempted healing of tendon after acute injury (overloading, partial tear or complete rupture) proceeds via the normal wound healing cascade involving hemostasis, inflammation, matrix synthesis and matrix remodeling. Depending on the degree of trauma and the nature of the post-injury milieu, a variable degree of healing and recovery of function occurs. Post-injury analgesia is often achieved with NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen, however there is increasing evidence that NSAID usage may interfere with the healing process. This study aimed to investigate the cellular mechanism by which IBU therapy might lead to a worsening of tendon pathology. We have examined the effect of oral Ibuprofen, on Achilles tendon healing in a TGFb1-induced murine tendinopathy model. Dosing was started 3 days after initial injury (acute cellular response phase) and continued for 22 days or started at 9 days after injury (transition to matrix regeneration phase) and given for 16 days. Cellular changes in tendon and surrounding peritenon were assessed using Hematoxylin/Eosin, chondroid accumulation with Safranin O and anti-aggrecan immunohistochemistry, and neo-vessel formation with GSI Lectin histochemistry. Markers of inflammation included histochemical localization of hyaluronan, immunohistochemistry of heavy chain 1 and TNFα-stimulated glycoprotein-6 (TSG6). Cell responses were further examined by RT-qPCR of 84 NFκB target genes and 84 wound healing genes. Biomechanical properties of tendons were evaluated by tensile testing. At a clinically-relevant dosage, Ibuprofen prevented the process of remodeling/removal of the inflammatory matrix components, hyaluronan, HC1 and TSG6. Furthermore, the aberrant matrix remodeling was accompanied by activation at day 28 of genes (Col1a2, Col5a3, Plat, Ccl12, Itga4, Stat3, Vegfa, Mif, Col4a1, Rhoa, Relb, F8, Cxcl9, Lta, Ltb, Ccl12, Cdkn1a, Ccl22, Sele, Cd80), which were not activated at any time without the drug, and so appear most likely to be involved in the pathology. Of these, Vegfa, Col4a1, F8, Cxcl9 and Sele, have been shown to play a role in vascular remodeling, consistent with the appearance at 25 days of vasculogenic cell groups in the peritenon and fat pad stroma surrounding the Achilles of the drug-dosed mice. Tensile stiffness (p = 0.004) and elastic modulus (p = 0.012) were both decreased (relative to age-matched uninjured and non-dosed mice) in mice dosed with Ibuprofen from day 3 to day 25, whether injured or not. We conclude that the use of Ibuprofen for pain relief during inflammatory phases of tendinopathy, might interfere with the normal processes of extracellular matrix remodeling and cellular control of expression of inflammatory and wound healing genes. It is proposed that the known COX2-mediated anti-inflammatory effect of ibuprofen has detrimental effects on the turnover of a pro-inflammatory HA matrix produced in response to soft-tissue injury, thus preventing the switch to cellular responses associated with functional matrix remodeling and eventual healing.",1,0,0,43
14,30687644,Entamoeba histolytica Cyclooxygenase-Like Protein Regulates Cysteine Protease Expression and Virulence.,"The intestinal protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) causes amebiasis associated with severe diarrhea and/or liver abscess. Eh pathogenesis is multifactorial requiring both parasite virulent molecules and host-induced innate immune responses. Eh-induced host pro-inflammatory responses plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis by causing damage to tissues allowing parasites access to systemic sites. Eh cyclooxygenase (EhCox) derived prostaglandin E2 stimulates the chemokine IL-8 from mucosal epithelial cells that recruits neutrophils to the site of infection to exacerbate disease. At present, it is not known how EhCox is regulated or whether it affects the expression of other proteins in Eh. In this study, we found that gene silencing of EhCox (EhCoxgs) markedly increased endogenous cysteine protease (CP) protein expression and virulence without altering CP gene transcripts. Live virulent Eh pretreated with arachidonic acid substrate to enhance PGE2 production or aspirin to inhibit EhCox enzyme activity or addition of exogenous PGE2 to Eh had no effect on EhCP activity. Increased CP enzyme activity in EhCoxgs was stable and significantly enhanced erythrophagocytosis, cytopathic effects on colonic epithelial cells and elicited pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice colonic loops. Acute infection with EhCoxgs in colonic loops increased inflammation associated with high levels of myeloperoxidase activity. This study has identified EhCox protein as one of the important endogenous regulators of cysteine protease activity. Alterations of CP activity in response to Cox gene silencing may be a negative feedback mechanism in Eh to limit proteolytic activity during colonization that can inadvertently trigger inflammation in the gut.",1,0,0,44
45,31949675,Expression of miR-9 in the serum of patients with acute ischemic stroke and its effect on neuronal damage.,"This research was aimed to measure the expression of miR-9 in serum of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients and explore the role of miR-9 on OGD-induced neuronal damage. In the present study, we measured the expression of miR-9 in serum of 65 AIS patients by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and the effect of miR-9 on oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neuronal injury was detected by CCK-8 in vitro. Western blot was used to measure the expression of protein. We found that the serum level of miR-9 in 65 AIS patients was significantly higher than that in control group (no-AIS), and was positively correlated with NIHSS score (r=0.627, P<0.001), infarct volume ((r=0.576, P<0.001), serum IL-8 (r=0.376, P=0.002), TNF-α (r=0.418, P<0.001), IL-6 (r=0.545, P<0.001), and IL-1β (r=0.592, P<0.001). miR-9 expression levels were upregulated in cultured neurons with OGD treatment. The downregulation of miR-9 significantly alleviated OGD-induced neuronal injury. Dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that SIRT1 was a target gene of miR-9, and miR-9 negatively regulated SIRT 1 expression and positively regulated p65 expression. All in all, our data showed that downregulation of miR-9 protected neurons against OGD/R-induced injury by the SIRT1-mediated NF-kB pathway.",0,1,0,45
4,30686969,Tracking Neural Progenitor Cell Migration in the Rodent Brain Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging.,"The study of neurogenesis and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is important across the biomedical spectrum, from learning about normal brain development and studying disease to engineering new strategies in regenerative medicine. In adult mammals, NPCs proliferate in two main areas of the brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular zone, and continue to migrate even after neurogenesis has ceased within the rest of the brain. In healthy animals, NPCs migrate along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) from the SVZ to the olfactory bulb, and in diseased animals, NPCs migrate toward lesions such as stroke and tumors. Here we review how MRI-based cell tracking using iron oxide particles can be used to monitor and quantify NPC migration in the intact rodent brain, in a serial and relatively non-invasive fashion. NPCs can either be labeled directly in situ by injecting particles into the lateral ventricle or RMS, where NPCs can take up particles, or cells can be harvested and labeled in vitro, then injected into the brain. For in situ labeling experiments, the particle type, injection site, and image analysis methods have been optimized and cell migration toward stroke and multiple sclerosis lesions has been investigated. Delivery of labeled exogenous NPCs has allowed imaging of cell migration toward more sites of neuropathology, which may enable new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for as-of-yet untreatable neurological diseases.",0,1,0,46
