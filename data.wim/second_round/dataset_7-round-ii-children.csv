28,30774282,The Impact of Housing Instability on Child Maltreatment: A Causal Investigation.,"More than a half million children are confirmed as victims of maltreatment by the child welfare system each year. Children from unstably housed families are over-represented in child mal-treatment reports, and a growing body of evidence links housing problems to maltreatment and Child Protective Services (CPS); investigation. The present study applies two propensity score analysis approaches-greedy matching and propensity score weighting-to data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study to move toward a causal explanation of child mal-treatment behaviors among mothers in low-income households. Utilizing two separate methods to correct for overt selection bias, the present study finds that housing instability leads to a small increase in maltreatment behaviors, yet this small positive net impact on child maltreatment does not fully explain the over-representation of unstably housed families in the child welfare system. Families experiencing housing problems likely have a range of needs that require earlier, targeted intervention to mitigate consequences of poverty, domestic violence, and maternal depression. Child welfare services should invest resources in housing assistance programs in-house as well as through partnerships with local public housing authorities to stabilize families, reduce housing-related strain on caregivers, and promote family preservation.",0,1,1,1
53,31093056,[Maternal and child health care in Cuba: achievements and challengesCuidados de saúde materno-infantil em Cuba: conquistas e desafios].,"In Cuba, maternal and child health care is based on the priority granted by the State, the implementation of the National Maternal and Child Health Program and the guarantee of equitable access to health services. This article describes the Cuban experience in this field, as well as its main achievements, challenges, and lessons learned. Among the most relevant results up to 2015 are the reduction of infant mortality rate and under-five mortality rate to 4.3 and 5.7 deaths per 1 000 live births, respectively; 5-year survival of 99.4%; more than 10 prenatal check-ups per delivery; 5.3% of low birth weight; 99.9% of institutional births; and being the first country to validate the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS and congenital syphilis. The main challenges are to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding; to reduce anemia due to iron deficiency in children and pregnant women; to reduce overweight in children; to prevent accidents; and to reduce maternal mortality, adolescent fertility rate, and voluntary abortion. Among the lessons learned are the priority given by the State to health, the programmatic management of maternal and child care, the guarantee of universal coverage, the systematic collection of information for decision-making, the integration of sectors and social participation in health. Sustaining and improving the results achieved will contribute to the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030. Em Cuba, os cuidados de saúde materno-infantil baseiam-se na prioridade concedida pelo Estado, na implementação do Programa Nacional de Saúde Materno-Infantil e na garantia de acesso equitativo aos serviços de saúde. Este artigo descreve a experiência cubana neste campo, bem como as principais conquistas, desafios e lições aprendidas. Entre os resultados mais relevantes até 2015 estão a redução da mortalidade infantil e mortalidade em menores de 5 anos para 4,3 e 5,7 mortes por 1 000 nascidos vivos, respectivamente; sobrevivência a 5 anos de 99,4%; mais de 10 exames pré-natal por nascimento; 5,3% do baixo peso ao nascer; 99,9% dos partos institucionais; e seja o primeiro país a validar a eliminação da transmissão materno-infantil de HIV/AIDS e sífilis congênita. Os principais desafios são aumentar a taxa de aleitamento materno exclusivo; reduzir a anemia devido a deficiência de ferro em crianças e mulheres grávidas e reduzir o excesso de peso infantil; prevenir acidentes; e reduzir a mortalidade materna, taxa de fertilidade adolescente e aborto voluntário. Entre as lições aprendidas estão a prioridade dada pelo Estado à saúde, a gestão programática dos cuidados materno e infantil, a garantia de cobertura universal, a coleta sistemática de informações para a tomada de decisões, a integração de setores e a participação social em saúde. Sustentar e melhorar os resultados obtidos contribuirá para o cumprimento da Agenda de Desenvolvimento Sustentável para 2030.",0,1,1,2
55,31093127,"[Fertility in adolescent women and social inequalities in Mexico, 2015Fecundidade entre adolescentes e desigualdades sociais no México, 2015].","To determine the association between teenage pregnancy and socioeconomic factors and to estimate social inequalities among adolescents in Mexico in 2015. A study involving women from 15 to 19 years of age was conducted using data from birth records for 2015. The fertility rate was determined and disaggregated by quintiles for each socioeconomic variable. Absolute and relative measures of inequality were estimated; negative binomial regression analysis was used to obtain risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The fertility rate was 73.21 births per 1000 women between the ages of 15 and 19 years in Mexico. Coahuila was the state with the highest birth rate (99.3 per 1000 adolescents). A statistically significant association was found between fertility rate and the gap in access to health services, especially in quintile 5 (risk ratio [RR] = 45.68), whereas a greater association with the gap in education was found in quintile 4 (RR = 27.36). No significant differences were found in terms of the gap in access to social security. Marginalization and poverty are significantly associated with teenage pregnancy and fertility rate. However, wide inequalities exist among the different social groups, making it necessary to implement actions geared towards promoting measures to improve the social, political, and economic environment. Determinar a associação entre gravidez na adolescência e fatores socioeconômicos e estimar as desigualdades sociais nas adolescentes do México em 2015. Um estudo foi realizado a partir dos registros de nascimentos de 2015 em adolescentes do sexo feminino com idade de 15 a 19 anos. Foi determinada a taxa de fecundidade desagregada por quintis para cada variável socioeconômica. Foram calculadas medidas absolutas e relativas de desigualdade e analisado um modelo de regressão binomial negativa para as razões de risco e intervalos de confiança de 95%. A taxa de fecundidade encontrada foi de 73,21 nascimentos por 1.000 mulheres com idade de 15 a 19 anos no México. O Estado de Coahuila teve a maior taxa de nascimento (99,3 por 1.000 adolescentes). Observou-se uma associação estatisticamente significativa entre a taxa de fecundidade e defasagem no acesso aos serviços de saúde, sobretudo no quintil 5 (risco relativo [RR] 45,68), enquanto que o atraso educacional foi maior no quintil 4 (RR 27,36). Não houve diferença significativa na defasagem no acesso à previdência social. O estado de marginalização e pobreza têm uma importante associação com gravidez e taxa de fecundidade em adolescentes. Existem, no entanto, grandes lacunas de desigualdade entre os grupos sociais, sendo necessário implementar ações direcionadas a promover a melhoria dos entornos sociais, políticos e econômicos.",0,1,1,3
12,30687796,Metabolic profiling of adolescent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.,"Background: Adolescent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors. The association between adolescent NAFLD and a wide range of metabolic biomarkers is unclear. We have attempted to determine the differences in metabolic profile of adolescents with and without markers of NAFLD. Methods: We performed cross-sectional analyses in a sample of 3,048 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at age 17. We used three indicators of NAFLD: ALT >40 U/l; AST >40 U/l and ultrasound scan-assessed steatosis. Associations between each measure of NAFLD and 154 metabolic traits, assessed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, were analyzed by multivariable linear regression, adjusting for age, sex and BMI. Results: All three indicators of NAFLD were associated with ~0.5 standard deviation (SD) greater concentrations of all extremely large to small very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) measures. ALT >40U/l was associated with ~0.5SD greater concentrations of very small VLDLs, intermediate-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoproteins. Concentrations of most cholesterols, including remnant cholesterol, all triglycerides and monounsaturated fatty acids, in addition to glycoprotein acetyls (inflammatory marker), were also higher in participants with NAFLD. Conclusions: We have identified differing metabolic profiles between adolescents with and without indicators of NAFLD. These results provide the foundations for future research to determine whether these differences persist and result in adverse future cardiometabolic health.",1,0,1,4
38,30840955,Body Composition and Circulating Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids at Age 6 Years: A Longitudinal Pilot Study.,"Maternal polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status during pregnancy may influence birth outcomes and offspring adiposity during childhood. Cord blood PUFA levels associate positively with maternal PUFA and negatively with the newborn's abdominal adiposity. However, longitudinal, prospective studies consistently evaluating maternal and cord blood and PUFA levels in childhood and their association with the child's body composition are so far lacking. In a population of 16 apparently healthy children born appropriate for gestational age and followed longitudinally since birth, we assessed circulating PUFA (by gas chromatography) in maternal, cord, and peripheral blood at age 6 years and studied their correlation with body composition (by absorptiometry) and endocrine-metabolic variables at age 6 years. No associations were found among parameters of body composition and endocrine-metabolic variables at age 6 years and maternal, cord blood or circulating PUFA in peripheral blood. Maternal levels of n-6 linoleic acid, total n-6, and the ratio of n-6:n-3 correlated with their corresponding PUFA levels at age 6 years. In conclusion, in this pilot study, maternal, cord blood, and children's circulating PUFA do not appear to have an impact on body composition and endocrine-metabolic status at the age of 6 years. The close association between maternal PUFA and offspring PUFA at that age may reflect a similarity in nutritional habits in the mother and child.",1,0,1,5
46,31007811,A cross-sectional study of traditional practices affecting maternal and newborn health in rural Nigeria.,"Certain traditional practices which have negative effects on maternal and child health continue to be practiced in sub-Saharan African countries. A survey was carried out in a rural village in Nigeria to understand the scale and range of these practices. This was a cross-sectional study in which trained interviewers administered pre-tested questionnaires on child-bearing women using questionnaires embedded on android devices. The median age of marriage and pregnancy were 15 and 16 years respectively. Home births were high (90.4%) while non-skilled birth attendant was 87.4%. The community had a son preference index ratio of 1:4.1. Up to 81.5% of mothers responded that one form of unhygienic traditional procedure or the other was performed on their children. Time to initiation of breast feeding was in hours in the majority (76.3%) of mothers, with a high rate of use of prelacteal feeds (85.2%). Being an adolescent mother (AOR 0.403, 95%CI 0.203, 0,797) and utilizing a skilled provider at birth (AOR 0.245, 95%CI 0.088, 0.683) were associated with less likelihood of having an unhygienic procedure performed on children. The findings of our study suggest that traditional practices which could have negative effects on maternal and child health are still ongoing in the study community. Child protection laws and safeguarding principles could help to reduce these practices and would need to be developed and implemented in these settings where these practices are still prevalent.",0,1,1,6
54,31093123,Bullying involvement and substance use among Brazilian adolescent students.,"Although bullying involvement has been associated with adolescent substance use, most of this evidence comes from high-income countries. Little is known about substance use among perpetrator-victims in low- and middle-income countries. This study explores the association between types of bullying involvement and adolescent substance use in Brazil. Data for this cross-sectional study came from the 2015 Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde do Escolar [National Adolescent School-based Health Survey] (PeNSE), a nationwide school-based survey of Brazilian ninth graders. Substance use was analyzed as any substance use (i.e., use of alcohol, cigarettes, or marijuana in the previous 30 days) and substance co-use (i.e., use of all three substances). Logistic regression analyses were conducted, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated, adjusting for demographic characteristics and student loneliness. Odds of any substance use for bullying perpetrators-only and for perpetrator-victims, respectively, were significantly higher compared to no bullying involvement (aOR = 2.99, 95% CI = 2.71-3.30 and aOR = 2.52, 95% CI = 2.31-2.75). Adjusted odds of substance co-use were also significantly higher among perpetrators-only and perpetrator-victims (aOR = 4.04, 95% CI = 3.05-5.35 and aOR = 3.49, 95% CI = 2.71-4.51, respectively). Victimization-only was associated with a 14% increase in the odds of any substance use (aOR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.07-1.22). The results underscore the complex relationship between adolescent bullying involvement and substance use. Findings also indicate the type of bullying involvement, as well as demographic and psychological factors, should be taken into consideration when assessing adolescent health-risk behaviors. Aunque la participación en el acoso escolar (bullying) se ha asociado con el consumo de sustancias en los adolescentes, la mayor parte de los datos científicos al respecto provienen de países de ingresos altos. Poco se sabe acerca del consumo de sustancias en los perpetradores y las víctimas en los países de ingresos bajos y medianos. En este estudio se explora la asociación entre algunos tipos de participación en el acoso escolar y el consumo de sustancias por los adolescentes en Brasil. Los datos para este estudio transversal provinieron de la Encuesta Nacional de Salud de los Escolares del 2015, una encuesta llevada a cabo en las escuelas a nivel nacional en los estudiantes brasileños del noveno curso. El consumo de sustancias se dividió en uso de una sola sustancia (a saber, consumo de alcohol, cigarrillos o marihuana en los 30 días anteriores) y uso concomitante (es decir, consumo de los tres tipos de sustancias). Se realizaron análisis de regresión logística y se calcularon las razones de posibilidades ajustadas (aOR), con ajustes para las características demográficas y la soledad de los estudiantes. Las probabilidades de consumo de cualquier sustancia en los perpetradores del acoso y los que eran a la vez perpetradores y víctimas, respectivamente, fueron más altas (con significancia estadística) en comparación con quienes no participaban en el acoso (aOR = 2,99, IC de 95% =2,71-3,30; y aOR = 2,52, IC de 95% = 2,31-2,75). Las probabilidades ajustadas de consumo concomitante de las sustancias también fueron significativamente más altas entre los perpetradores exclusivos y los perpetradores víctimas (aOR = 4,04, IC de 95% = 3,05-5,35; y RPa = 3,49, IC de 95% = 2,71-4,51, respectivamente). La victimización exclusiva se asoció con un aumento de 14% en las probabilidades de consumo de cualquier sustancia (aOR = 1,14, IC de 95% = 1,07-1,22). Los resultados subrayan la compleja relación entre la participación de los adolescentes en el acoso y el consumo de sustancias. Los resultados también indican que deben tenerse en cuenta el tipo de participación en el acoso, así como los factores demográficos y psicológicos, al evaluar los comportamientos de riesgo para la salud de los adolescentes. Apesar de a prática de bullying ter sido associada ao uso de substâncias psicoativas em adolescentes, grande parte das evidências obtidas é oriunda de países de alta renda. Pouco se sabe sobre o uso de substâncias psicoativas em agressor-vítimas em países de baixa e média renda. O objetivo deste estudo foi investigar a associação entre os tipos de prática de bullying e o uso de substâncias psicoativas em adolescentes no Brasil. Os dados para este estudo transversal foram obtidos da Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde do Escolar (PeNSE), um inquérito realizado com adolescentes do 9° ano do ensino fundamental em todo o país. O uso de substâncias psicoativas foi analisado como sendo o uso de qualquer tipo de substância psicoativa (como uso de álcool, cigarros ou maconha nos 30 dias anteriores à pesquisa) e o uso concomitante de substâncias psicoativas (ou seja, uso dos três tipos de substâncias). Foram realizadas análises de regressão logística e calculadas razões de chances ajustadas (OR aj) segundo características demográficas e grau de solidão dos estudantes. As chances de uso de qualquer tipo de substância psicoativa entre os exclusivamente praticantes de bullying e agressor-vítimas foram significativamente maiores em comparação aos que não praticam bullying (OR aj = 2,99, IC 95% = 2,71–3,30 e OR aj = 2,52, IC 95% = 2,31–2,75, respectivamente). As chances ajustadas do uso concomitante de substâncias psicoativas foram também significativamente maiores entre os exclusivamente praticantes de bullying e agressor-vítimas (OR aj = 4,04, IC 95% = 3,05–5,35 e OR aj = 3,49, IC 95% = 2,71–4,51, respectivamente). Exclusivamente vitimização foi associado a uma chance 14% maior de uso de qualquer tipo de substância psicoativa (OR aj = 1,14, IC 95% = 1,07–1,22). Os resultados deste estudo chamam atenção à complexa relação entre a prática de bullying e o uso de substâncias psicoativas em adolescentes. Os achados do estudo também indicam que o tipo de prática de bullying e fatores demográficos e psicológicos devem ser considerados ao serem avaliados os comportamentos de risco à saúde dos adolescentes.",0,1,1,7
17,30693309,"The relationship between childbearing motivations with fertility preferences and actual child number in reproductive-age women in Mashhad, Iran.","Motivation is directly involved in women's childbearing decision. Considering the lack of information about reproductive-age women's childbearing motivations with preferences and actual child number in Iran, this study was conducted to determine the relationship between childbearing motivations with the fertility preferences and actual child number of reproductive-age women. The participants in this descriptive-correlational study were 844 reproductive-age women (aged 15-49 years) who were married for the first time and came from a wide range of areas in Mashhad. Multistage and convenience samplings were applied and the data were collected using Miller's childbearing motivation and fertility preferences and actual child number questionnaire. The results of the study reveal that positive- and negative-childbearing motivation were correlated with preferences (P < 0.001) but were not correlated with actual child number. Furthermore, the interactional variable derived by a combination of positive and negative motivations showed a significant relationship with the ideal and actual child number (P < 0.05). Childbearing motivations affect the fertility preferences in reproductive-age women but do not appear to have any influence on the actual child number. Furthermore, the interactional variables affect the ideal and actual child number.",0,1,1,8
18,30705610,"Traditional gender roles and substance-use behaviors, attitudes, exposure, and resistance among early adolescents in large cities of Mexico.","This study investigated the associations between traditional gender roles (TGRs) and substance use among early adolescents in Mexico's largest cities. The sample of seventh grade students (n = 4,932) attended 26 public schools in Mexico City, Guadalajara, or Monterrey in 2014. Outcomes included recent alcohol, binge drinking, cigarette and marijuana use, and lifetime poly-substance use; substance-use intentions, norms, attitudes, and expectancies; and substance-use exposure (peer use, offers) and resistance (refusal confidence, refusal skills, and decision-making skills). A TGR scale assessed endorsement of a polarized gender division of family labor and power. As hypothesized, among males, TGRs were consistently associated with poorer outcomes, and this association was usually stronger for males than for females. In contrast, among females there was no evidence that TGRs were associated with desirable outcomes. Contrary to expectations, TGRs predicted poorer outcomes for both females and males, and to equivalent degrees, for binge drinking, cigarette use, positive substance-use expectancies, and friends' approval of substance use, and they predicted poorer outcomes for females but not for males on parental disapproval of substance use and drug-resistance skills. Interpretations highlight the persisting aspects of TGRs in the family and conflicting messages for females as Mexico undergoes changes in its gender order.",0,1,1,9
52,31086630,"Human immunodeficiency virus awareness and condom use among female adolescent prostitutes in Lagos, Nigeria.","The cornerstone of HIV prevention among female adolescent prostitutes is awareness promotion complemented with advocacy on consistent and correct use of condom. The study aimed at reviewing HIV awareness and condom use among female adolescent prostitutes in Lagos communities, Nigeria. It was a mixed-method study realized through a questionnaire-based survey and in-depth interviews of adolescent sex workers in Oyingbo and Yaba communities of Lagos State, Nigeria; conducted between 1st of April, 2014 and 30th of September, 2014. SPSS version 17.0 and content analysis were used in analyzing quantitative and qualitative data respectively. 97.3% had heard about HIV/AIDS; with 86.9% being tested for HIV in the preceding 6 months. While there was consistent use of male condom in 99.7% of the respondents, 90% had experience with the use of female condom, however, 95.5% would allow non- use of condom for higher financial reward. Although the level of awareness of HIV/AIDS was high among the respondents, there is need to improve on the level of awareness and preventive strategies for HIV/AIDS, with more emphasis laid on the consistent and correct use of condom in this highly vulnerable class of people.",0,1,1,10
11,30687684,Understanding Family-Level Effects of Adult Chronic Disease Management Programs: Perceived Influences of Behavior Change on Adolescent Family Members' Health Behaviors Among Low-Income African Americans With Uncontrolled Hypertensions.,"Background: Despite improvements in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and treatment, low-income African Americans experience disparities in CVD-related morbidity and mortality. Childhood obesity disparities and poor diet and physical activity behaviors contribute to CVD disparities throughout the life course. Given the potential for intergenerational transmission of CVD risk, it is important to determine whether adult disease management interventions could be modified to achieve family-level benefits and improve primary prevention among high-risk youth. Objective: To explore mechanisms by which African-American adults' (referred to as index patients) participation in a hypertension disease management trial influences adolescent family members' (referred to as adolescents) lifestyle behaviors. Design/Methods: The study recruited index patients from the Achieving blood pressure Control Together (ACT) study who reported living with an adolescent ages 12-17 years old. Index patients and adolescents were recruited for in-depth interviews and were asked about any family-level changes to diet and physical activity behaviors during or after participation in the ACT study. If family-level changes were described, index patients and adolescents were asked whether role modeling, changes in the home food environment, meal preparation, and family functioning contributed to these changes. These mechanisms were hypothesize to be important based on existing research suggesting that parental involvement in childhood obesity interventions influences child and adolescent weight status. Thematic content analysis of transcribed interviews identified both a priori and emergent themes. Results: Eleven index patients and their adolescents participated in in-depth interviews. Index patients and adolescents both described changes to the home food environment and meal preparation. Role modeling was salient to index patients, particularly regarding healthy eating behaviors. Changes in family functioning due to study participation were not endorsed by index patients or adolescents. Emergent themes included adolescent care-taking of index patients and varying perceptions by index patients of their influence on adolescents' health behaviors. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that disease management interventions directed at high-risk adult populations may influence adolescent family members' health behaviors. We find support for the hypotheses that role modeling and changes to the home food environment are mechanisms by which family-level health behavior change occurs. Adolescents' roles as caretakers for index patients emerged as another potential mechanism. Future research should explore these mechanisms and ways to leverage disease management to support both adult and adolescent health behavior change.",0,1,1,11
3,30672351,Quality of Life and Depression in Turkish Patients with β-Thalassemia Major: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Thalassemias are the most common monogenic disorders worldwide. Thalassemia patients experience difficulties in their schooling, finding jobs and/or marriage because of functional and physical limitations caused by this disease. It is expected that the quality of life (QoL) of patients with thalassemia will be lower than those without this disease. The aim of this study was to benefit worldwide thalassemia patients in terms of QoL and mental health. This cross-sectional study was performed in Turkey. The study population consisted of of 57 β-thalassemia major (β-TM) patients and the control group. The short form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire and Beck depression inventory (BDI) were used. The mean age of the patients was 21.6 ± 6.6 (age range 15-39) and the male-to-female ratio was 0.7. The mean SF-36 scores of the patient and the control groups were 59.2 ± 12.4 and 75.7 ± 11.8, and the mean BDI scores of the patients and controls were 13.5 ± 6.4 and 6.1 ± 3.7, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the total SF-36 and BDI scores of patients and controls. We aimed to investigate the effects of the decrease in morbidity and mortality of β-thalassemia (β-thal) due to regular transfusions and chelation therapy on the QoL and mental health of patients. The β-TM patients have a comparatively worse QoL score than the normal population. Improving QoL should be the target of clinicians who are monitoring adolescent or young adult β-TM patients.",0,1,1,12
5,30686978,Dietary Long-Chain Omega-3 Fatty Acids Are Related to Impulse Control and Anterior Cingulate Function in Adolescents.,"Impulse control, an emergent function modulated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), helps to dampen risky behaviors during adolescence. Influences on PFC maturation during this period may contribute to variations in impulse control. Availability of omega-3 fatty acids, an essential dietary nutrient integral to neuronal structure and function, may be one such influence. This study examined whether intake of energy-adjusted long-chain omega-3 fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] was related to variation in impulse control and PFC activity during performance of an inhibitory task in adolescents (n = 87; 51.7% female, mean age 13.3 ± 1.1 years) enrolled in a longitudinal neuroimaging study. Intake of DHA + EPA was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and adjusted for total energy intake. Inhibitory control was assessed using caregiver rating scale (BRIEF Inhibit subscale) and task performance (false alarm rate) on a Go/No-Go task performed during functional MRI. Reported intake of long-chain omega-3 was positively associated with caregiver ratings of adolescent ability to control impulses (p = 0.017) and there was a trend for an association between intake and task-based impulse control (p = 0.072). Furthermore, a regression of BOLD response within PFC during successful impulse control (Correct No-Go versus Incorrect No-Go) with energy-adjusted DHA + EPA intake revealed that adolescents reporting lower intakes display greater activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate, potentially suggestive of a possible lag in cortical development. The present results suggest that dietary omega-3 fatty acids are related to development of both impulse control and function of the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus in normative adolescent development. Insufficiency of dietary omega-3 fatty acids during this developmental period may be a factor which hinders development of behavioral control.",1,0,1,13

Materials and methods: The study of the level of school anxiety in adolescents was carried out according to the method of diagnosing the level of school anxiety by Phillips; the level of psychosocial stress and emotional and social support in the adolescents - to the questionnaire Interaction parents-child (I. M. Markovskaya). Results: The increased level of school anxiety was most pronounced in adolescents with episodic primary headache. With an increase in the frequency of headache episodes, a low physiological stress resistance was observed more often (r=+0,45, <0.05). Adolescents with a primary headache noted high demanding mom and increased severity of the measures that were applied to them. Adolescents with episodic primary headache, in contrast to the control group, indicated a mother's strict control (17,9 ± 2,4 and 15,1 ± 2,2 points, respectively, <0,05). Adolescents with chronic primary headache noted emotional distances, lack of cooperation, low degree of satisfaction with their relationship with their mother and father (<0,05). Conclusions: Lack of basic security extends the individual significance of stress events for adolescents with primary headache and affects the formation of inadequate and limited pain coping strategies.",1,0,1,14

Only households who had children under 5 years of age were included. Data were collected through interviews with parents and guardians of eligible children using a tested and validated questionnaire. we interviewed 210 households. No family had a vaccination record notebook of their children. However, 97% reported vaccinated children who had participated in mass vaccination campaigns. About 97% were aware of poliomyelitis disease and 98% knew vaccination campaign. The most cited channels of information were radio (98%) and vaccinators (72%). Only 3% of parents reported refusing vaccination. There was an association between the negative influence of the relatives and the non-vaccination of children (p = 0.005). disease and vaccine knowledge is good in Chad despite the existence of rumours about, in particular, vaccine effects. The lack of immunization cards limited the analysis of survey results which were only declarative with a very high declared vaccination rate.

25,30766762,Feasibility of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Older Adolescents and Young Adults with Poorly Controlled Type 1 Diabetes.,"The purpose of the study was to assess the acceptability and feasibility of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a group-delivered intervention, to reduce stress and improve illness management among urban, older adolescents and young adults with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes (T1D). Ten older adolescents and young adults (9 females, 1 male) were recruited to participate in an MBSR group. Acceptability and feasibility were assessed based on recruitment and retention, treatment satisfaction and changes in stress, diabetes management and health status using a mixed-methods approach. Satisfaction with MBSR was high based on both quantitative and qualitative data. Preliminary evidence was found to suggest that MBSR reduced stress and improved blood glucose levels. Findings from a small feasibility study suggest that MBSR could be delivered to urban older adolescents and young adults with T1D with high rates of satisfaction. Additional testing in adequately powered controlled clinical trials appears warranted.",0,1,1,16
36,30815424,"Cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension, smoking and obesity: Emerging concerns among Pathan and Persian young adults?","Background: Hypertension was considered as a disease of the elderly but due to unhealthy dietary and lifestyle changes its incidence has increased in younger population. Smoking and obesity are emerging concerns the world is facing globally in younger age groups. This study is therefore aimed to identify these cardiovascular risk factors among Pathan and Persian young adults.

35,30815414,"Evaluating fear of hypoglycemia, pediatric parenting stress, and self-efficacy among parents of children with type 1 diabetes and their correlation with glycemic control.","Background: This study was designed to determine the level of fear of hypoglycemia (FoH), pediatric parenting stress and selfefficacy in parents of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 61 families of children with T1D who had been diagnosed for at least 6 months recruited from Gabric Diabetes Education Association in Tehran. Sixty mothers and 41 fathers of 61 children (26 girls, age: 6.0-12.7 years) were assessed using the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey-Parent (HFS-P), Pediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP) and Self-Efficacy for Diabetes Scale-Parent (SED-P) questionnaires. Pearson correlation analysis was used to compute the correlation between HFS-P, PIP and SEDP scores separately for mother and fathers. Results: Only 8.3% of children had controlled diabetes. Internal reliability of the Persian version of all questionnaires was good. FoH were higher for mothers. Mothers whose children had diabetes for less than two years had significantly lower mean HFS-Behavior subscale (HFS-B) scores than mothers whose children had diabetes for more than two years. There was a positive correlation between fathers' mean HFS-B score and children's total insulin dose per day. Parents' FoH score was positively correlated with increased pediatric parenting stress. Findings also showed considerable emotional distress in 51% of mothers and 29.7% of fathers. Frequency of selfmonitoring blood glucose tests (SMBG) correlated negatively with HbA1c. Conclusion: We concluded that parents with high levels of FoH and stress may benefit from diabetes education. Important implications for education are considering psychological adjustment, recognizing diabetes-related fear and stress in parents, encouraging fathers to become actively involved in the child's diabetes management and emphasizing the importance of SMBG.",1,0,1,18
59,31304311,Using photoplethysmography data to estimate heart rate variability and its association with organ dysfunction in pediatric oncology patients.,"Pediatric oncology patients are at high risk of developing clinical deterioration and organ dysfunction during their illness. Heart rate variability (HRV) measured using electrocardiography waveforms is associated with increased organ dysfunction and clinical deterioration in adult and pediatric patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Here, we explore the feasibility of using photoplethysmography (PPG)-derived integer pulse rate variability (PRVi) to estimate HRV and determine its association with organ dysfunction in pediatric oncology patients in the ward and pediatric ICU. The advantage of using PPG sensor data over electrocardiography is its higher availability in most healthcare settings and in wearable technology. In a cohort of 38 patients, reduced median daily PRVi was significantly associated with increase in two pediatric organ dysfunction scores after adjusting for confounders (p < 0.001). PRVi shows promise as a real-time physiologic marker of clinical deterioration using highly-available PPG data, but further research is warranted.",1,0,1,19

8,30687201,"A Pilot Study of Behavioral, Physiological, and Subjective Responses to Varying Mental Effort Requirements in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.","Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is presumed to involve mental effort application difficulties. To test this assumption, we manipulated task difficulty and measured behavioral, as well as subjective and psychophysiological indices of effort. Methods: Fifteen adolescent ADHD boys and 16 controls performed two tasks. First, subjective estimates and behavioral and pupillary measures of effort were recorded across five levels of N-back task difficulties. Second, effort discounting was assessed. In the latter, participants made repeated choices between performing a difficult N-back task for a high reward versus an easier N-back task for a smaller reward. Results: Increasing task difficulty led to similar deteriorations in performance for both groups - although ADHD participants performed more poorly at all difficulty levels than controls. While ADHD and control participants rated the tasks equally difficult and discounted effort similarly, those with ADHD displayed slightly different pupil dilation patterns with increasing task difficulty. Conclusion: The behavioral results did not provide evidence for mental effort problems in adolescent boys with ADHD. The subtle physiological effects, however, suggest that adolescents with ADHD may allocate effort in a different way than controls.",1,0,1,21
41,30859164,Subclinical rheumatic heart disease: A single center experience.,"Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. The aim of the present study was to investigate asymptomatic RHD cases diagnosed by echocardiography without any acute rheumatic fever (ARF) history and to present the follow-up results. Children who had been admitted to the pediatric cardiology department between 2011 and 2017 for various reasons (e.g., sport participation and palpitation) and diagnosed with RHD by echocardiography without a history of ARF were included the study. Echocardiographic findings of the patients were evaluated retrospectively. A total of 75 (55 girls and 20 boys) patients were included in the study. The median age of the cases was 13.6 (minimum 5 and maximum 18) years. The median follow-up period was 19.2 months, whereas the longest follow-up period was 66 months. At the time of admission, pathological valvular insufficiency was present only in the mitral valve in 69 (89.3%) cases, only in the aortic valve in 2 (2.7%) cases, and in both aortic and mitral valve in 6 (8%) cases. Of the cases, 40 (60%) were diagnosed as borderline RHD at the time of admission, and 30 (40%) as definite RHD according to the World Heart Federation criteria. Of these cases, 88% remained the same as borderline RHD, and the findings of two patients improved from definite to borderline RHD. RHD of four patients deteriorated from borderline to definite RHD, and in two patients, valvular insufficiency completely resolved during the follow-up period. None of the cases needed valvular replacement. RHD is still a serious health problem in Turkey. The sensitivity of echocardiography in detecting subclinical mild or asymptomatic cases is well known. For this reason, although it is not yet applied as a routine study, it is important to start the nationwide echocardiographic screening program.",1,0,1,22
9,30687205,Atypical Frontotemporal Connectivity of Cognitive Empathy in Male Adolescents With Conduct Disorder.,"Background: It has been suggested that adolescents with conduct disorder (CD) may have a deficit in the affective and cognitive domains empathy, but studies exploring networks within the key brain regions of affective and cognitive empathy in adolescents with CD are lacking. Methods: Functional connectivity (FC) analyses among key brain regions of the affective and cognitive empathy with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were conducted in 30 adolescent boys with CD and 33 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs). Results: Atypical FC within the key brain regions of affective empathy was not observed in CD adolescents. However, we found that CD adolescents showed decreased frontotemporal connectivity within the key brain regions of cognitive empathy in relation to HCs, that is, the FCs between right temporoparietal junction and ventromedial prefrontal cortex as well as dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Conclusion: These findings may provide insight into neural mechanism underlying a cognitive empathy deficiency of CD adolescents from the perspective of FC.",1,0,1,23

Our study aims to focus on the clinical features and the importance of screening in patients with this rare deficit. We report the cases of two brothers with this deficit. Child aged 8 years, born to non-consanguineous marriage who was the youngest of two children. He had a history of post-circumcision bleeding and was admitted to our Department for the treatment of recurrent nosebleeds occurred over the last 4 years. Screening tests of hemostasis showed low Prothrombin (PT), normal Activated thromboplastin time (ATT), while factor assay revealed factor VII deficiency with a rate of 26%. The patient underwent spaced fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions due to nosebleeds and wounds. Family screening was not performed. The eldest brother, aged 11 years, presented with very abundant nosebleeds. Somatic examination was unremarkable. Given his history, the patient underwent factor VII assay revealing a rate of 55% and parent screening was scheduled. The diagnosis of congenital factor VII deficiency in a patient motivates family screening in order to perform screening tests in other carriers of factor VII deficiency.

We report a case of late revelation of urea cycle disorder in a 13 years old female patient hospitalized for convulsions and failure to thrive. The patient underwent an interview revealing chronic vomiting associated with behavioral disorders, ideomotor slowdown and headaches. Clinical examination showed ataxia. Lumbar puncture and head CT scan were normal. The patient had substantially elevated blood ammonia level at 75 micromoles/L (11-50). Chromatography of amino acids in the blood showed increased glutamine and alanine. Chromatography of amino acids in the urine showed increased basic amino acids evoking a deficit of the urea cycle due to deficit of the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. The patient was treated as an emergency, exclusively with glycolipid-diet and sodium benzoate, allowing improvement of patient's clinical condition and weight resumption. The seizures were controlled by phenobarbital. Family interview revealed that patient's sister, aged 20 years, had a 3-year history of seizures treated with phenobarbital. She underwent metabolic assessment in our department, which showed the same urea cycle abnormality as hes sister. Urea cycle deficiency should be suspected in patients of any age with encephalopathy associated with epilepsy, vomiting, weight stagnation and hyperammonemia.

20,30713516,Gender Differences Regarding the Impact of Math Anxiety on Arithmetic Performance in Second and Fourth Graders.,"The development of math skills is crucial for adequate functioning in academic and professional settings as well as in daily life. A factor that has been shown to negatively influence performance and acquisition of math skills is math anxiety. With the high prevalence of math anxiety in society and the long lasting effects on math performance, it is important to study the relation between math anxiety and math performance in young children. Since math anxiety is often more pronounced in women than in men, it is essential to take the effect of gender into account. While the effect of gender on the relation between math anxiety and math performance has been studied in adults and adolescents, less research has focused on children, especially children at young ages. To fill this gap, the current study examined how the relation between math anxiety and math performance differed between boys and girls in early elementary school years. Math anxiety and math performance was assessed in 124 second- and fourth-grade children (67 girls and 57 boys). Although boys and girls showed more or less equal levels of math anxiety and performed similarly at the arithmetic task, correlation analyses showed that only in girls, math anxiety significantly correlated with math performance. Analyses investigating if math anxiety moderated the effect of gender and grade on math performance revealed significant differences between boys and girls. Higher levels of math anxiety only significantly and negatively moderated math performance in girls, with the greatest effect observed in 2nd grade girls. These findings highlight the importance of taking gender differences into account when studying the effect of math anxiety. The results showed that math anxiety is already negatively linked to math performance in girls as early as second grade. The present findings emphasize the importance of the early identification and remediation of math anxiety in girls to prevent long lasting effects. Possible causes for the gender related differences will be discussed.",1,0,1,28

34,30815402,Impaired nonverbal working memory in high-functioning autism spectrum disorder.,"Background: Past studies have documented working memory impairment in participants with high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders (IQ>70), but inconsistent findings have been reported. One possibility is the existence of verbal responses in the evaluation of working memory performance. The aim of the current study is to examine the working memory performance and its correlation with a prominent deficit in participants with high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders by non-verbal working memory tasks compared with typically developing samples. Methods: The current study is a cross-sectional, comparative study. The working memory performance of the 30 participants with high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders (7-16 years) and 30 typically developing was compared by working memory subtests of the Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised in Tehran, Iran. Two groups were matched for age and gender. ANOVA, ANCOVA, repeated measures ANOVA and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used to analyze the data statistically. The significance value was set at p<0.05. Results: The results showed that if the effect of FSIQ (full-scale intelligence quotient) were controlled individuals with highfunctioning Autism Spectrum Disorders exhibited significant impairment in the Reverse Memory subtest (p=0.001). Also, unpredictably Forward Memory (r=0.38, p=0.03) and Reverse Memory tasks (r=0.38, p=0.03) displayed a significant positive correlation with the Social interaction subscale of the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (Second Edition). Conclusion: It seems that nonverbal working memory is impaired in persons with high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders. Results of the current study revealed that factors like complexity and cognitive load of tasks may influence working memory performance in individuals with high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders.",1,0,1,30

42,30886955,A phase II trial protocol of Tocilizumab in anti-TNF refractory patients with JIA-associated uveitis (the APTITUDE trial).,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease in children. Children with JIA are at risk of intraocular inflammation (uveitis). In the initial stages of mild-moderate inflammation uveitis is asymptomatic. Most children with mild-moderate uveitis are managed on topical steroid drops with or without systemic methotrexate (MTX). When children with moderate-severe uveitis are refractory to MTX, monoclonal anti-tumour necrosis factor agents have been trialled, interim analysis data showed positive results. However, several children with severe recalcitrant disease or non-responsive to anti-tumour necrosis factor agents remain and are at greater risk of significant ocular complications and visual loss. Further evidence of alternative therapies is needed with evidence of a potential role of anti-interleukin-6 agents in the management of severe refractory uveitis. The trial will be conducted following a two-stage Simon design. The trial will register at least 22 patients aged 2 to 18 years with active JIA-associated uveitis, who have taken MTX for at least 12 weeks and have failed an anti-TNF agent. It will take place in 7 centres across the UK. All participants will be treated for 6 months, with follow up of 9 months from registration. Participants will receive a stable dose of MTX and those weighing ≥30 kg will be dosed with 162 mg of Tocilizumab every 2 weeks and participants weighing < 30 kg dosed with 162 mg of Tocilizumab every 3 weeks. Primary outcome is treatment response at 12 weeks. Adverse events will be collected up to 30 calendar days following treatment cessation. This is a novel adaptive design study of subcutaneous IL-6 inhibition in anti-TNF refractory JIA associated uveitis which will be able to determine if further research should be conducted. This is the first trial to look at ophthalmology outcomes in the efficacy of Tocilizumab in uveitis.This is the first paediatric clinical trial to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab with MTX in JIA associated uveitis.

37,30828645,Functional antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites are associated with a longer time to qPCR-detected infection among schoolchildren in Burkina Faso.,"Background: Individuals living in malaria-endemic regions develop immunity against severe malaria, but it is unclear whether immunity against pre-erythrocytic stages that blocks initiation of blood-stage infection after parasite inoculation develops following continuous natural exposure. Methods: We cleared schoolchildren living in an area (health district of Saponé, Burkina Faso) with highly endemic seasonal malaria of possible sub-patent infections and examined them weekly for incident infections by nested PCR. Plasma samples collected at enrolment were used to quantify antibodies to the pre-eryhrocytic-stage antigens circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and Liver stage antigen 1 (LSA-1). In vitro sporozoite gliding inhibition and hepatocyte invasion inhibition by naturally acquired antibodies were assessed using Plasmodium falciparum NF54 sporozoites. Associations between antibody responses, functional pre-erythrocytic immunity phenotypes and time to infection detected by 18S quantitative PCR were studied. Results: A total of 51 children were monitored. Anti-CSP antibody titres showed a positive association with sporozoite gliding motility inhibition (P<0.0001, Spearman's ρ=0.76). In vitro hepatocyte invasion was inhibited by naturally acquired antibodies (median inhibition, 19.4% [IQR 15.2-40.9%]), and there were positive correlations between invasion inhibition and gliding inhibition (P=0.005, Spearman's ρ=0.67) and between invasion inhibition and CSP-specific antibodies (P=0.002, Spearman's ρ=0.76). Survival analysis indicated longer time to infection in individuals displaying higher-than-median sporozoite gliding inhibition activity (P=0.01), although this association became non-significant after adjustment for blood-stage immunity (P = 0.06). Conclusions: In summary, functional antibodies against the pre-erythrocytic stages of malaria infection are acquired in children who are repeatedly exposed to Plasmodium parasites. This immune response does not prevent them from becoming infected during a malaria transmission season, but might delay the appearance of blood stage parasitaemia. Our approach could not fully separate the effects of pre-erythrocytic-specific and blood-stage-specific antibody-mediated immune responses in vivo; epidemiological studies powered and designed to address this important question should become a research priority.",1,0,1,35
15,30693027,Is a Combination of a GnRH Agonist and Recombinant Growth Hormone an Effective Treatment to Increase the Final Adult Height of Girls with Precocious or Early Puberty?,"The aim of treatment for idiopathic central precocious puberty (ICPP) is to increase final adult stature, for which gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is the gold standard. Early puberty is frequently similar to ICPP, with pubertal onset only slightly advanced. Short stature may result from early pubertal onset. Some studies have suggested that recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) should be combined with a GnRHa to improve adult height, while others have not. Here, the aim was to compare the efficacy of combined GnRHa and rhGH treatment with GnRHa or rhGH treatment alone, or no therapy, for the improvement of the final height of girls with ICPP or early puberty. Electronic databases of randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials, in which the efficacy of GnRHa preparations was compared with that of rhGH for the treatment of children with precocious or early puberty, were searched and a meta-analysis conducted. Five studies of early puberty and four studies of ICPP were identified. There were no statistically significant differences between final adult height standard deviation score and initial height standard deviation score in the treatment of early puberty (GnRHa and rhGH versus rhGH alone or no treatment). The overall analysis of the data failed to indicate any benefit of combined therapy, while individual reports suggested that in specific instances combined therapy may be beneficial in preserving or reclaiming growth potential and improving adult height.",1,0,1,36

However, iodine deficiency is a nutritional deficiency and the solution of this problem lies in the organization of rational nutrition of the population. The purpose of this study was to examine the food features of the population of the mild iodine-deficient region from the standpoint of adequacy of iodine sufficiency. The analysis of nutrition of the population of Tyumen Region in 2005 and 2016 was carried out according to official statistics of Tyumenstat; results of sanitary-hygienic and biomedical monitoring for the period from 1994 to 2016. A sociological study was conducted on a representative nested sample using the questionnaire method. The study involved schoolchildren (n=744) and their parents (n=677), students and full-time students (n=623). Probabilistic was sampling and nesting. Statistical sampling error does not exceed 4%. Analysis of the level of food consumption by residents of the Tyumen region over the period from 2005 to 2016 showed an increase in consumption per capita of fish and fish products (from 23.8 kg in 2005 to 33.1 kg in 2016 at recommended level of 22 kg). At the same time, a sociological study showed that only 1-4% of the population consumed iodine-rich products daily and only 53% of respondents regularly used iodized salt. The analysis of the results of biomedical monitoring over the 20-year period of the existence of preventive programs in the Tyumen region showed significant improvements in the situation in the region: median of ioduria increased significantly from 77 to 125 μg/l and the incidence of goiter in pre-pubertal children decreased from 85% in 1994 to 6.8% in 2016 (р=0,001); the incidence of neonatal hyperthyrotropinemia significantly decreased from 44.3% in 1994 to 3.9% in 2017 (р=0,001). However, most indicators did not reach the target values recommended for iodine-rich region, which indicated the insufficient effectiveness of the existing voluntary prevention system.

The charts of 10 eyes of 8 children aged 9 to 17 with central corneal opacity from various pathologies who underwent a standardized OCT-guided transepithelial PTK technique at a single private practice institution were retrospectively reviewed. The corneal topographic findings, OCT measurements, and visual results with refractive outcomes were analyzed 6 months after the PTK treatment. All 10 eyes tolerated the procedure well without any significant intraoperative or postoperative complications. Uncorrected and best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) significantly improved postoperatively (p < 0.0001 and p=0.0045, respectively). The absolute value of spherical equivalent on cycloplegic refraction significantly improved postoperatively as well (p=0.0014), but there were no significant changes in topographic measurements. Seven out of the 10 eyes had complete resolution of the central corneal opacity on OCT imaging. None of the subjects lost any lines of BSCVA and developed recurrence of the corneal opacity from the primary disease condition or required keratoplasty during the follow-up period. OCT-guided transepithelial PTK can provide excellent visual outcomes in pediatric patients with central corneal opacities.",1,0,1,39

While it could be caused by both bacterial and viral pathogens, antibiotics are improperly prescribed regardless of the pathogen. Inappropriate usage of antibiotics has risen the concern of microbial resistance and the need for stricter guidelines. Many guidelines have been validated for this reason, and the Centor score (Modified/McIsaac) is most commonly implemented. This study aims to assess the adherence and enumerate the reasons behind the suboptimal adherence to guidelines (Centor/McIsaac score) of pediatric emergency department physicians in the diagnosis and management of GABHS pharyngitis to lay the groundwork for future actions and to employ educational programs and implement local guidelines for the prevention of the development of multi-drug resistant microorganisms. We surveyed pediatric emergency department physicians of ten teaching hospitals of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We used convenient sampling and estimated a sample size of 170 physicians, and interns and medical centers without pediatric emergency department were excluded from the study. Elements of the Centor score (Modified/McIsaac) were used as a part of the assessment of physicians' knowledge of the guidelines. Adherence was assessed by requiring the participants to answer questions regarding their usage of diagnostic means when they suspect a bacterial cause of pharyngitis, as recommended by the guidelines. A total of 243 physicians answered the questionnaire, 43 consultants (17.6%) and 200 non-consultants (82.4%). On the knowledge score, 9.1% scored 0, and the majority of both groups, 46.5%, earned a score of 1. The remainder 44.4%, earned a score of 2. Adherence to guidelines was defined as when diagnostic tests (throat culture or rapid antigen detection test) were always requested prior to prescribing antibiotics when acute bacterial pharyngitis was suspected. Only 27.3% (n = 67) of our sample are adherent to guidelines, whereas the majority, 72.7% (n = 175), are non-adherent. Several factors were assessed as reasons for lack of adherence. Lack of knowledge and adherence to guidelines is prevalent in our setting, with awareness, knowledge, and behavior of physicians playing as major factors behind this low adherence. Studies should aim towards the assessment of adherence towards locally developed guidelines.",0,1,1,40
30,30815080,Characterizing the Utilization of the Problem List for Pediatric Trauma Care.,"The EHR problem list has the potential to support care coordination among the multidisciplinary care team that cares for pediatric trauma patients. To realize this potential, the need exists to ensure appropriate utilization by formulating acceptable usage and management policy. In this regard, understanding the prevailing utilization pattern is pivotal. To this end, we analyzed EHR in tandem with trauma registry data at a Level I pediatric trauma center. Almost all (97.8%) of the actions executed on the problem list were addition of items. Among the 517 patient encounters in the cohort, 263 (48.9%) encounters involving sicker patients had at least one problem list item added, mostly within the first 4 hours of arrival, while in the emergency department, and by providers in the service of record. This represents a foundation to build upon. Subsequent research will explore completeness, accuracy, and the impact of the utilization on patient outcomes.",1,0,1,41
31,30815106,Leveraging Horizontal Density Differences between Ontologies to Identify Missing Child Concepts: A Proof of Concept.,"Previously, we investigated pairs of ontologies with local similarities where corresponding is-a paths are of different lengths. This indicated the possibility of importing concepts from one ontology into the other. We referred to such structures as diamonds of concepts. In this paper, we address the question whether pairs of identical concepts in pairs of ontologies have the same children in both. Separate reviews of SNOMED CT and NCIt relative to eight other ontologies uncovered differences in child sets. We provide quantitative data concerning these differences. In cases where there are many identical children in two ontologies, the questions arise why one has more children and whether these children are missing in the other ontology. We performed randomized controlled trials in which a human expert evaluated the fit for import of such potentially missing child concepts. In two out of four studies, statistical significance was achieved in support of algorithmic import.",0,1,0,42
43,30895255,Intention of having a second child among infertile and fertile women attending outpatient gynecology clinics in three major cities in China: a cross-sectional study.,"What is the intention to have a second child among women attending outpatient gynecology clinics in three major cities in China? In total, 69.3% of the participants expressed the intention to have a second child and this was related to infertility status, pronatalist attitudes, and sociodemographic factors. In 2016, the new universal two-child policy was introduced in China enabling all Chinese couples to have a second child. A government-led national survey revealed that the majority of women included under the policy would be 35 years old and older and thus would be at higher risk of infertility. Previous studies found that fertility intention differs by infertility status. A cross-sectional survey was performed to examine the intention of having a second child and its associated factors among infertile and fertile women attending gynecology outpatient clinics in three major cities in China. Clinical nurses approached eligible women in person while waiting for their consultations. Recruitment and data collection were conducted from April to August 2016. The survey involved four gynecology outpatient clinics in Beijing, Shenzhen, and Hohhot. Married women aged 20-45 years who were seeking outpatient gynecology care for non-malignant problems were invited to participate. Data from 974 women were included in the analysis. A total of 69.3% of the women expressed the intention to have a second child, and infertile women were more likely to want a second child compared to fertile women (76.6% vs 61.9%, respectively; P < 0.001). Greater ideal parity facilitated the intention for a second child in both groups, while pronatalist attitudes (meaning that they preferred to have their first childbirth at a younger age and attached greater significance to traditional childbearing beliefs), unexplained infertility, presence of a living child and religious affiliation were associated with greater intention among infertile women. In contrast, in the fertile group, older age, full-time work and lower confidence in achieving parity goals diminished the intention for a second child. Although infertile women displayed greater agreement with pronatalist attitudes and desired a higher ideal parity, they had less confidence in achieving their parity goals than their fertile counterparts. In addition to self-report and self-selection bias, our participants were recruited from urbanized areas and were more educated than the general population. Owing to the extremely busy environment in the clinics, difficulties were encountered in keeping track of the number of women whom the nurses approached, and the response rate was therefore unavailable. With the introduction of the universal two-child policy, there is a need to enhance fertility awareness and to encourage reproductive life planning, as well as to lower the cost of childcare, in order to increase the birth rate in China. Effort is required to make childbearing more compatible with current employment, career and educational development, the burdens of family care (e.g. for elderly parents), social environments and cultural expectations. This is particularly relevant for families who already have a child, as our findings show that their hesitation toward a second child was largely related to difficulties with extra childcare within the woman's current work and family life. This study did not receive any funding. The authors declared no competing interests. Not applicable.",0,1,0,43
65,31516434,An evaluation of school-based e-cigarette control policies' impact on the use of vaping products.,"Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use among youth is common, and so efforts to regulate its use and availability are continually being made. The school environment represents an important domain for advancing health policy among youth populations. This study examines the impact of school-based e-cigarette control policies on student e-cigarette use in the context of a natural experiment. Using three years of longitudinal student and school level data (2013/2014 to 2015/2016), from a sample of 69 secondary schools in Ontario, Canada, a generalized estimating equation approach examined the impact of school-based e-cigarette control policy changes on the prevalence of youth e-cigarette use. The main outcome of interest was current e-cigarette use, while covariates included age, gender, ethnicity, and amount of spending money in dollars per week the student has. Tests of proportion (t-tests) were used to examine whether there were any significant differences in the changes for each intervention school relative to the sample of schools that report no changes in school-level e-cigarette control policies. Estimates from the generalized estimating equation approach suggest that students had lower odds of using e-cigarettes in schools where an e-cigarette control policy was implemented. That is, the e-cigarette control policy decreased the adjusted odds of being an e-cigarette user (OR=0.68; 95% CI: 0.48-0.97). Examining school-specific impact, at four of six schools that had an e-cigarette control policy, the ban on the use of e-cigarettes may have lowered the prevalence of e-cigarette use. This is the first study to use longitudinal data to study school-level e-cigarette use and the impact of e-cigarette control policy. These results provide new evidence that school-level policies banning the use of e-cigarettes on school property may be effective in reducing e-cigarette use (or preventing it) in their current form, as seen in this natural experiment.",1,0,0,44
10,30687520,Are parenting practices associated with the same child outcomes in sub-Saharan African countries as in high-income countries? A review and synthesis.,"There is increasing interest in the transferability of parenting interventions from high-income countries (HICs) to low-income countries (LICs) in order to improve child development and health outcomes. This is based on the premise that associations between parenting practices and child outcomes are similar in both settings. Many parenting interventions in HICs are evidence-based, but less evidence exists on associations of parenting practices with child outcomes in LICs, in particular, sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. This review synthesises evidence on the association of parenting practices with child outcomes in SSA in order to compare findings with those from HICs. We searched electronic databases-Web of Science, ASSIA, Embase, IBSS and PsycINFO-to identify studies from SSA that reported quantitative associations between parenting practices and child health or psychosocial outcomes (eg, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), mental health, conduct disorders). Due to inconsistent conceptual framing of parenting across studies, we used a modified version of the international WHO classification of parenting dimensions to guide synthesis of the results. Forty-four studies met our inclusion criteria. They were conducted in 13 SSA countries and included cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, and were predominantly descriptive studies rather than intervention research. Synthesis of results showed that associations between patterns of parenting ('positive'/'harsh') and child outcomes (including SRH, mental health and conduct disorders) in studies from SSA were broadly similar to those found in HICs. These findings suggest that the impacts of parenting practices on child outcomes are similar across contrasting global regions and, therefore, parenting interventions from HICs might be successfully transferred to SSA, subject to appropriate adaptation. However, this review also highlights the paucity of evidence in this area and the urgent need for higher quality studies to confirm these findings to help develop effective parenting interventions in SSA.",1,0,0,45
51,31086628,"Lactating Mothers' Perception Toward Diarrheal Disease in Bench-Maji Zone, Southwest Ethiopia: Mixed study design.","Acute diarrheal diseases are the leading cause of preventable death, especially among children under-five in developing countries. Worldwide and nationwide diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of death in under-five year children. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess perception of lactating mothers' toward diarrheal disease in Mizan-Aman District, South-West Ethiopia. Community based cross-sectional quantitative study supplemented by qualitative study was employed. A total of 383 selected households with the lactating mothers were involved in the study. Data was collected through face-to-face interview technique by trained data collectors. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 16. Multiple logistic regressions analysis was used to identify the independent predictors. Odds ratio, with 95% confidence level and P < 0.05 were used to determine statistically significant association. The majority of the respondents had primary education (44.4%) and from rural area (52.2%). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the residence area [AOR = 4.79, CI (1.33,7.78), P<0.003], educational status [AOR = 0.72, CI (0.55,1.29), P<0.045], Wealth index [AOR = 8.9, CI (0.99,17.45), P<0.001], knowledge [AOR = 2.34, CI (1.2-4.3) P<0.023]. Perceived susceptibility [AOR = 0.44, CI (0.33,11.33), P<0.001] and perceived severity of their child towards diarrheal disease [AOR= 0.24, CI (1.23,7.99), P<0.033] had significant associations with the perception of the diarrheal diseases among lactating mothers. Lactating mothers' perceptions toward their children of getting diarrheal disease and danger of the disease with primary education and above were better protected than mothers with no education. Thus, implementing effective information educational communication (IEC) programs that emphasize on the benefit of complying with nationally recommended practice to prevent diarrheal disease is important to reduce the risk.",0,1,0,46
7,30687190,"The More Similar, the Healthier: The Effect of Perceived Parent-Child Facial Resemblance on Parental Physical Health.","Parent-child facial resemblance (PCFR) is one of the direct cues used to assess the genetic relationship between two individuals. Due to the inner fertilization of humans, fathers are liable to suffer from paternal uncertainty. When a father perceives low father-child facial resemblance, he would become anxious, which is detrimental to his immune system and physical health. For a mother, however, she can assure her genetic relationship to her children and does not need any external cues to verify her maternity. Thus, the mother-child facial resemblance does not influence the mothers' physical health. To test these hypotheses, we examined the moderating effect of parental gender and the mediating effect of trait anxiety on the relationship between PCFR and physical health of parents. The results showed that fathers' PCFR positively predicted their physical health, whereas the mothers' PCFR failed to show any predicting effect on mothers' physical health. Furthermore, trait anxiety mediated the relationship between fathers' PCFR and their physical health. The implications for paternal uncertainty, gender difference, and public policy were discussed.",0,1,0,47
48,31016010,Protocol: New approaches to managing the social deficits of Turner Syndrome using the PEERS program.,"Turner Syndrome (TS) is a sex chromosome aneuploidy (45,X) associated with social skill difficulties. Recent clinical care guidelines recommend that the Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS) social skills intervention programme be trialled in this population. PEERS has been successfully used in adolescents with autism spectrum conditions without intellectual disabilities. The PEERS program will be piloted with adolescents and young women with TS aged 16-20 using an uncontrolled study trial with a multiple-case series design. The program will be delivered face to face and online. The assessment battery is designed to measure social skills comprehensively from diverse informants (parent, teacher young person). It includes measures of social performance, social knowledge and social cognition. Parents and young people taking part in the intervention will also feedback on the acceptability and feasibility of the pilot. The outcomes of this small scale pilot (n=6-10) will be used to adapt the programme based on feedback and estimate the sample for a future randomised controlled trial.",1,0,0,48

We conducted a survey to explore diversity in adolescent privacy policies and identify common approaches in health information technology management for adolescent patients. Through descriptive analyses of survey data, we found a wide range of institutional policies regarding adolescent patient privacy, and large variations in health IT executives' baseline knowledge of access policies. A majority of respondents agreed that formal guidelines pertaining to adolescent health record privacy would be helpful. Respondents suggested that these guidelines can be developed through the synthesis of multiple perspectives, including those of pediatricians, adolescent specialists, privacy experts, parents, patient advocates, and other professional entities.",1,0,0,50
0,30671097,Assessment of Self-Medication Practices and Its Associated Factors among Undergraduates of a Private University in Nigeria.,"Self-medication is the use of drugs to treat self-diagnosed disorders or symptoms or the intermittent or continued use of prescribed drug for chronic or recurrent disease or symptoms, and it is mostly common in developing countries. This study therefore assessed the practice of self-medication among undergraduate students of a private university in Nigeria. The study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design. A pretested questionnaire was self-administered to 384 undergraduate students of the university. Data were analysed and summarised using descriptive and inferential statistics such as chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. Overall, 297 (81.8%) undergraduate students practiced self-medication. About 71% of the students had used analgesic, antibiotics (10.5%), and antimalarial drugs (33%) without prescription within one month prior to the survey. The most commonly used drug for self-medication was paracetamol (75.1%). Furthermore, self-medication was found to be significantly associated with age (p=0.021), gender (p < 0.001), college (p=0.025), and year of study (p=0.004). Some of the reasons why undergraduate students practiced self-medication were because of the unfriendly attitude of health care workers (27.7%), lack of time to go to school clinic (26.7%), school clinic is too far from hostel (15.3%), and drugs prescribed in the school clinic do not improve health condition (15.3%). Majority of the students attributed the practice of self-medication to unfriendly attitude of health care workers in the university clinic.",0,1,0,51
58,31304286,"Mothers explanatory models of infant stress & adversity in rural Haryana, India: qualitative findings from the Early Life Stress sub-study of the SPRING cluster-randomised controlled trial (SPRING-ELS).","Background   Exposure to a range of biological and psychosocial adversities in early childhood is of negative consequence through the lifecourse. This is particularly important for children in low- and middle-income countries where at least 250 million children are at high-risk of not meeting their developmental potential. Minimal evidence describes mothers' views of this. We therefore elicited an explanatory model exploring mothers' perceptions of infant stress and adversity in rural Haryana, India. Methods We did eight focus-group discussions to explore the perspectives of mothers in the general population of this rural area of India using a discussion guide based on Kleinman's explanatory model. Data were coded by two analysts and arranged in themes for presentation. Illustrative quotations were used for presentation of findings. Results All mothers identified several causes of adversity and stress for children, including poverty, neglect and violence. They described the consequences of this for emotions, behaviour and school readiness of children, and that some of the consequences were reversible with appropriate management. Mothers described younger children as being unable to be affected by adversity, because they were too young to understand. Conclusions Mothers agreed with much of the current biomedical model for early childhood development, however the predominant view was that young infants were too young to understand is an important deviation. These findings are of importance in designing behaviour change strategies for this crucial period of early childhood which is rising up the global policy agenda with the aim of giving every child the opportunity to thrive.",0,1,0,52
29,30788326,The effectiveness of PMT program on parent-child relationship in parents with ADHD children: A randomized trial.,"Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder in children that creates problems in parents-children relationships. Improving familial and social interactions of these children needs mental and social interventions, and parents' management training (PMT) program is one of these interventions. The present study aimed at determining the effectiveness of PMT program on parent-child relationship of parents with ADHD children. Methods: Through an experimental research, 40 parents with ADHD children were selected based on purposeful sampling. A total of 20 parents were randomly placed in intervention group and received 8 sessions of intervention course (60 minutes per session) and the other 20 parents were grouped in the control group and received no training intervention. Research tools included a researcher-designed demographics questionnaire and Parker's Bonding Instrument (PBI). Data were collected at pretest, posttest, and follow- up stages and analyzed using descriptive and covariance analysis. Results: The results revealed that PMT program was significantly effective in reducing excessive support and increasing parent care index in parents with ADHD children (p<0.05). Conclusion: The results of the present study supported the effectiveness of PMT program on parent-child relationship of the parents with ADHD children.",1,0,0,53

2,30671424,Scoping Review of Pediatric Early Warning Systems (PEWS) in Resource-Limited and Humanitarian Settings.,"Pediatric Early Warning Systems (PEWS) aim to identify hospitalized children at increased risk of deterioration by assigning a score based on vital signs and clinical status and guiding interventions using a response algorithm to improve outcomes. When implemented with quality improvement methodology, these systems have been shown to be effective in high-resource settings and have the potential to improve the care of children in humanitarian and resource-limited settings (RLS). The purpose of this review is to summarize the current evidence for use of PEWS in RLS and identify areas for further research. A review of the current PEWS literature in RLS was performed using Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, Portal Regional da BVS, and TRIP Database. While there is limited research available on this topic, eight studies on the use of PEWS, or a PEWS score in a pediatric population in low- or middle-income countries were identified. Two studies assessed the clinical effect of implementation of PEWS; one reported a reduction in clinical deterioration events and the other a reduction in mortality. The remaining studies assessed the association of a PEWS score with signs of clinical deterioration or mortality without a response algorithm. Further research on the impact of PEWS implementation on inpatient care and outcomes in RLS is needed.",1,0,0,55
14,30692958,Coping With Depressive Symptoms in Young Adults: Perceived Social Support Protects Against Depressive Symptoms Only Under Moderate Levels of Stress.,"Introduction: The interrelationship between social support, depressive symptoms, stress and self-esteem in young adults remains unclear. This study aims to test the mediating role of self-esteem in the relationship between social support and depressive symptoms and the moderating role of perceived stress in the relationship between the two. This is important to inform components of future intervention development targeting youth depression. Methods: Three hundred forty-four (N = 344) young adults in Cyprus aged 17-26 (78% female) completed measures of self-esteem, social support, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. Structural equation models were used to examine the interactions between social support and depressive psychopathology, whereas mediational analyses were run to examine the mediating role of self-esteem. Latent moderated mediation models were applied to examine the potentially moderating role of perceived stress. Results: Perceived social support from family and friends were significantly related to lower depressive symptoms. Self-esteem fully mediated the relationship between perceived family support and depressive symptoms. Perceived stress moderated the model, and perceived social support was found to be more protective against depressive symptoms when moderate levels of stress were presented. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that social support is protective against depressive symptoms. Self-esteem and perceived stress are important mechanisms that interact with this effect. Implications include the efforts to increase perceived family support during college years and management of stress levels before working with depressive symptoms.",0,1,0,56
16,30693293,Effects of problem-solving skill training on emotional intelligence of nursing students: An experimental study.,"Nursing students are generally trained to acquire the knowledge, skills, and approaches required for solving problems and contradictions in life and at work. In fact, problem-solving skills are the core of effective nursing activities. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of problem-solving training on the promotion of emotional intelligence in nursing students. This interventional case-control study used a pretest-posttest design. All senior nursing students (n = 43) attending the seventh semester of their undergraduate studies at Hazrat Fatemeh School of Nursing and Midwifery of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences were recruited in the present study. The participants were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (n = 20) or the control group (n = 23). The collected data were analyzed with SPSS software version 16. While the mean standardized scores of Emotional Quotient Inventory of the two groups were not significantly different before the intervention, the scores were significantly higher in the intervention group both immediately and 2 months after the intervention. Comparison of the standardized emotional intelligence scores revealed the intervention group to have significantly higher mean scores immediately and 2 months after the intervention compared to baseline scores (105.87 ± 9.82 and 109.44 ± 9.56 vs. 101.22 ± 10.93; P < 0.001). Such significant differences were absent in the control group.

33,30815152,A Comparison of Existing Methods to Detect Weight Data Errors in a Pediatric Academic Medical Center.,"Dosing errors due to erroneous body weight entry can be mitigated through algorithms designed to detect anomalies in weight patterns. To prepare for the development of a new algorithm for weight-entry error detection, we compared methods for detecting weight anomalies to human annotation, including a regression-based method employed in a real-time web service. Using a random sample of 4,000 growth charts, annotators identified clinically important anomalies with good inter-rater reliability. Performance of the three detection algorithms was variable, with the best performance from the algorithm that takes into account weights collected after the anomaly was recorded. All methods were highly specific, but positive predictive value ranged from < 5% to over 82%. There were 203 records of missed errors, but all of these were either due to no prior data points or errors too small to be clinically significant. This analysis illustrates the need for better weight-entry error detection algorithms.",1,0,0,58
60,31304329,Sociomarkers and biomarkers: predictive modeling in identifying pediatric asthma patients at risk of hospital revisits.,"The importance of social components of health has been emphasized both in epidemiology and public health. This paper highlights the significant impact of social components on health outcomes in a novel way. Introducing the concept of sociomarkers, which are measurable indicators of social conditions in which a patient is embedded, we employed a machine learning approach that uses both biomarkers and sociomarkers to identify asthma patients at risk of a hospital revisit after an initial visit with an accuracy of 66%. The analysis has been performed over an integrated dataset consisting of individual-level patient information such as gender, race, insurance type, and age, along with ZIP code-level sociomarkers such as poverty level, blight prevalence, and housing quality. Using this uniquely integrated database, we then compare the traditional biomarker-based risk model and the sociomarker-based risk model. A biomarker-based predictive model yields an accuracy of 65% and the sociomarker-based model predicts with an accuracy of 61%. Without knowing specific symptom-related features, the sociomarker-based model can correctly predict two out of three patients at risk. We systematically show that sociomarkers play an important role in predicting health outcomes at the individual level in pediatric asthma cases. Additionally, by merging multiple data sources with detailed neighborhood-level data, we directly measure the importance of residential conditions for predicting individual health outcomes.",0,1,0,59
24,30761275,Potential and Limitations of Atrial Natriuretic Peptide as Biomarker in Pediatric Heart Failure-A Comparative Review.,"Although B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), N-terminal-proBNP (NT-proBNP), and mid-regional-proANP (MR-proANP) are included in current guidelines on heart failure in adults, no guideline considering these biomarkers in pediatric heart failure is available. A new drug class of neprilysin inhibitors as fixed-dose combination (Sacubitril/valsartan) has been introduced and is currently being investigated in children suffering from heart failure. Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) is discussed as a more useful alternative to BNP because it may grants better insights into the effects of this treatment. Thus, this review aimed to provide an overview of the current knowledge concerning ANP in pediatric heart failure and compares its suitability regarding diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure. A literature search using PubMed resulted in 147 publications of which 22 studies were classified as relevant. The review presents available ANP, NT-proANP, and MR-proANP level data in children (0-18 years). Summarizing, ANP shows only minor differences as marker for diagnosing and monitoring pediatric heart failure if compared to BNP. Due to its fast release, ANP offers the advantage of displaying rapid changes during therapy or operation. ANP is -like the other natriuretic peptides- influenced by age, presenting with the highest levels in very young infants. ANP also correlates with atrial pressure and volume overload in children. In addition, ANP determination in saliva appears to be a promising alternative to blood sampling. Similarly to NT-proBNP, NT-proANP, and MR-proANP offer better stability but only few data has been published in children and thus their potential is only presumable so far.",1,0,0,60

6,30687040,Behind the Scenes of Developmental Language Disorder: Time to Call Neuropsychology Back on Stage.,"Although the Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), also known as Specific Language Impairment in children has been the focus of unceasing scientific attention for decades, the nature and mechanisms of this disorder remain unclear. Most importantly, we still cannot reliably identify children requiring urgent intervention among other 'late talkers' at an early age and understand the high prevalence of comorbidity with psychiatric phenomena such as Autism Spectrum Disorder. One of the main reasons for this is the traditional 'diagnosis-by-exclusion,' resulting in heterogeneity of the DLD population. This paper proposes an alternative approach to the diagnosis, treatment and research of DLD, claiming that it is these children's multiple deficits in neuropsychological development, which impede the spontaneous acquisition of their first language. Specifically, this review of the state-of-the-art in DLD research demonstrates deep and systematic interconnections between the speech and other higher cognitive functions developing in early childhood, including perception, attention and executive functions. In the proposed framework, speech is, therefore, considered as one of neuropsychological abilities, and the delay in its development is explained by other neuropsychological deficits, resulting in highly individual clinical profiles. By considering DLD as a complex neuropsychological syndrome, whose successful treatment depends on a holistic approach to diagnosis and intervention, we may significantly increase the efficacy of speech therapy, and also better understand the flexibility of the developing brain, its compensatory mechanisms and hence the comorbidity of DLD with psychiatric symptoms. Implications for using this paradigm in future scientific research are discussed.",0,1,0,62
13,30687800,Improving outcomes for neonates with gastroschisis in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review protocol.,"There is a significant disparity in outcomes for neonates with gastroschisis in high-income countries (HICs) compared with low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Many LMICs report mortality rates between 75% and 100% compared with <4% in HICs. To undertake a systematic review identifying postnatal interventions associated with improved outcomes for gastroschisis in LMICs. Three search strings will be combined: (1) neonates; (2) gastroschisis and other gastrointestinal congenital anomalies requiring similar surgical care; (3) LMICs. Databases to be searched include MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Thesis Global, and the Cochrane Library. Grey literature will be identified through Open-Grey, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry and ISRCTN registry (Springer Nature). Additional studies will be sought from reference lists of included studies. Study screening, selection, data extraction and assessment of methodological quality will be undertaken by two reviewers independently and team consensus sought on discrepancies. The primary outcome of interest is mortality. Secondary outcomes include complications, requirement for ventilation, parenteral nutrition duration and length of hospital stay. Tertiary outcomes include service delivery and implementation outcomes. The methodology of the studies will be appraised. Descriptive statistics and outcomes will be summarised and discussed. Ethical approval is not required since no new data are being collected. Dissemination will be via open access publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal and distribution among global health, global surgery and children's surgical collaborations and international conferences. This study will systematically review literature focused on postnatal interventions to improve outcomes from gastroschisis in LMICs. Findings can be used to help inform quality improvement projects in low-resource settings for patients with gastroschisis. In the first instance, results will be used to inform a Wellcome Trust-funded multicentre clinical interventional study aimed at improving outcomes for gastroschisis across sub-Saharan Africa.

23,30737935,"health and lifestyle of students' youth: status, problems and ways of solution.","Introduction: The current negative trends in the health of students' youth, which according to many researchers is a social group with an increased risk of diseases, indicate the need to address the problem of preserving and strengthening the health of students through the introduction of effective approaches to the prevention of diseases, risk factors for their development and the formation of the principles of a healthy lifestyle. The aim: Substantiation of measures aimed at prevention of non-communicable diseases and risk factors for their development in students by studying their health and lifestyle, evaluation of international experience in this field. Materials and methods: We have analyzed the sources of domestic and foreign research literature and conducted sociological research among 332 students of higher education institutions: linguistic, medical and technical universities. It had been used bibliosemantic, sociological and medical-statistical methods. Conclusions: Under conditions of the current intensification of the educational process in higher education universities, which is accompanied by a tense education regime, increase of educational load and negative impact on the health of students, the importance of solving the problem of preserving and strengthening the health of student youth is increased. Therefore priority attention is needed the complex realization of measures to the effective prevention of diseases and risk factors for their development among students, creation of pre-conditions for forming in students the principles of healthy way of life and health-protecting behavior, improvement of medical care and implementation of monitoring the health status of students.",0,1,0,64
57,31236031,Turkish Neonatal Society guideline for the follow-up of high-risk newborn infants.,"Developments in perinatal and neonatal care have increased the survival rate of high-risk newborns but led to a rise in chronic diseases seen in these infants. A significant number of them attend primary and secondary health care centers after discharge; however, there are very few standard protocols for the long-term follow-up of these babies. Therefore, we aimed to establish a follow-up guideline that emphasizes on universal screening schemes and takes into consideration national data. The guide presented here provides brief recommendations for physicians in light of evidence-based data for the follow-up of high-risk newborn infants. The steps taken to monitor and solve the problems of all high-risk infants may vary. We hope the use of such a standard approach in evaluating each infant in daily routine will improve the life quality of these high-risk infants. Perinatal ve neonatal bakım alanındaki gelişmeler sonucunda riskli yenidoğanların yaşam oranı yükselmiş, ancak beraberinde bu bebeklerde görülen kronik hastalık oranı da artmıştır. Taburcu edildikten sonra birinci ve ikinci basamak sağlık merkezlerine başvuran hastaların önemli bir oranını oluşturmaya başlayan bu bebeklerin uzun süreli izleminin nasıl olması gerektiği ile ilgili ne yazık ki standart protokoller pek azdır. Bu nedenle evrensel izlem şemalarına ağırlık verdiğimiz ve ulusal verilerin de göz önüne alındığı bir izlem rehberi oluşturmayı amaçladık. Burada özetini sunduğumuz yüksek riskli bebek izlem rehberi uygulayıcıya kanıta dayalı veriler ışığında öneri niteliğinde bilgileri sunmaktadır. Tüm riskli bebekler için izlem ve sorunların çözümü için atılacak adımlar farklılıklar gösterebilir. Her bebeğin ayrı ayrı değerlendirildiği standart yaklaşımların güncel uygulamalarda kullanılmasının yüksek riskli bebeklerin yaşam kalitelerini artıracağını ummaktayız.",1,0,0,65
56,31236025,Turkish Neonatal Society guideline on parenteral nutrition in preterm infants.,"Postnatal growth failure due to inappropriate and insufficient nutrition is a risk for preterm infants, especially for very-low-birth-weight or extremely-low-birth-weight infants. This extrauterine growth failure causes negative effects on long-term neurodevelopment. Early initiation of intensive parenteral nutrition with appropriate protein and energy supply is a nutritional emergency when enteral feeding cannot be achieved. This approach prevents protein catabolism and helps achievement of positive protein balance and postnatal growth. Protein, lipid, and glucose initiation with appropriate doses that reach timely goals constitute the major elements of parenteral nutrition. The transition to enteral nutrition with the mother's milk at the earliest convenience must be targeted in parenteral nutrition. Prematürelerin özellikle çok düşük doğum ağırlıklı ve aşırı düşük doğum ağırlıklı bebeklerin uygun ve yeterli beslenememelerine bağlı postnatal dönemde büyüme geriliği riskleri vardır. Bu ekstrauterin büyüme geriliğinin prematürede uzun dönem nörogelişimsel olumsuz etkileri gösterilmiştir. Enteral beslenmenin başarılamadığı durumlarda, erken ve yoğun parenteral beslenmenin uygun protein ve enerji sağlayarak başlanması, bu riskli prematüreler için yaşamsal bir acil durum kabul edilmektedir. Bu sayede protein katabolizması önlenmekte, pozitif protein dengesine erişmelerine ve büyümelerine olumlu katkı sağlanmaktadır. Parenteral beslenmede protein, lipid ve glukozun uygun dozda başlanarak belli hedeflere erişmesi prematüre bakımının ana elemanlarından biridir. Parenteral beslenen bebeklerin en kısa zamanda anne sütü ile enteral beslenmeye geçişleri de hedeflenmelidir.",1,0,0,66
