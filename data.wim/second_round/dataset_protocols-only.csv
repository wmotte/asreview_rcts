2,31093568,OPTimal IMAging strategy in patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department: chest X-ray or ultra-low-dose CT (OPTIMACT)-a randomised controlled trial chest X-ray or ultra-low-dose CT at the ED: design and rationale.,"Chest X-ray has been the standard imaging method for patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department (ED) for years. Recently, ultra-low-dose chest computed tomography (ULD chest CT) has been introduced, which provides substantially more detailed information on pulmonary conditions that may cause pulmonary disease, with a dose in the order of chest X-ray (0.1 vs. 0.05 mSv). The OPTimal IMAging strategy in patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department: chest X-ray or CT (OPTIMACT) study is a randomized trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of replacing chest X-ray for ULD chest CT in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the ED. Two thousand four hundred patients presenting at the ED with pulmonary complaints and suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease will be enrolled in this multicenter, pragmatic, randomized trial. During randomly assigned periods of one calendar month, either conventional chest X-ray or ULD chest CT scan will be used as the imaging strategy. Randomization will rely on computer-generated blocks of 2 months to control for seasonal effects. Chest X-ray and ULD chest CT will be performed in a standardized way, after obtaining the clinical history and performing physical examination and initial laboratory tests. The primary outcome measure is functional health at 28 days. Secondary outcome measures are mental health, length of hospital stay, mortality within 28 days, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) during the first 28 days, correct diagnoses at ED discharge as compared to the final post hoc diagnosis, and number of patients in follow-up because of incidental findings on chest X-ray or ULD chest CT. In an economic evaluation, we will estimate total health care costs during the first 28 days. This pragmatic trial will clarify the effects of replacing chest X-ray by ULD chest CT in daily practice, in terms of patient-related health outcomes and costs, in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the ED. The OPTIMACT trial is registered in the Netherlands National Trial Register under number NTR6163. The date of registration is December 6, 2016.",1,0,1,1
1,31093566,Detection of physiological deterioration by the SNAP40 wearable device compared to standard monitoring devices in the emergency department: the SNAP40-ED study.,"In recent years, there has been increasing focus on the earlier detection of deterioration in the clinical condition of hospital patients with the aim of instigating earlier treatment to reverse this deterioration and prevent adverse outcomes. This is especially important in the ED, a dynamic environment with large volumes of undifferentiated patients, which carries inherent patient risk. SNAP40 is an innovative medical-grade device that can be worn on the upper arm that continuously monitors patients' vital signs including relative changes in systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, movement, blood oxygen saturation and temperature. It uses automated risk analysis to potentially allow clinical staff to easily and quickly identify high-risk patients. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the SNAP40 device is able to identify deterioration in the vital sign physiology of an ED patient earlier than current standard monitoring and observation charting techniques. Single centre, teaching hospital ED open label, prospective, observational cohort study recruiting 250 high acuity participants aged 16 years or over presenting to the ED. Participants will be approached and enrolled in the ED and after consent will have the SNAP40 wearable monitoring device attached which will be used alongside standard care monitoring. Participants will be observed throughout their time in the ED. Any SNAP40 device alarm, standard monitoring alarms or standard practice vital sign observations indicating a deterioration in a patient's vital sign physiology (defined as an increase in NEWS score) will be recorded. Primary outcome is time to detection of deterioration. Secondary outcomes include staff time spent performing observations and responding to standard monitoring alarms, clinical escalation of care when deterioration is detected and participants and staff rating of experience of both SNAP40 and current monitoring. The SNAP40-ED study aims to recruit 250 patients. It will be the first study to compare the ability of a novel ambulatory monitoring device to detect deterioration compared to standard care in the ED. It may allow the earlier detection of deterioration in the clinical condition of ED patients and therefore earlier treatment to reverse this deterioration and prevent adverse outcomes.

3,31234170,Comparison of DNA Extraction Efficiency and Reproducibility of Different Aeration Diffuser Biofilms Using Bead-Beating Protocol.,"An existing bead-beating DNA extraction protocol was employed to compare the DNA extraction recovery and fragment quality of 6 different aeration diffuser biofilms. Escherichia coli, Gordonia amarae, and mixed liquor were used as controls. The fraction of total DNAbiofilm decreased monotonically with increasing number of beat beatings (BB) when the amount of DNA present was sufficient (>4 μgDNA/cm2), excluding the ceramic disk. While controls required only 2 BBs, 3 out of 5 BBs achieved ≥70% of total DNA (70.3 ± 1.7%) for 5 out of 6 biofilms. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of 353 and 1,505 basepair (bp) amplicons from pure culture extracts showed target copy numbers were not degraded for the first 2 BBs, but the third BB decreased amplicon concentrations by 0.65 and 1.12 log for E. coli, and 0.39 and 0.40 log for G. amarae, respectively. The 353 bp fragment amplification from biofilm samples showed minimal degradation for the first 3 BBs. PCR and gel electrophoresis confirmed integrity of amplified 1,505 bp DNA fragments over the 5 BBs, except in the EDPM (75 mm diameter, tube) diffuser biofilm (4.98 ± 0.62 μgDNA/cm2). Taken together, this study showed type of diffuser membrane biofilms had no effects on extraction efficiency, but low DNA concentrations reduced extraction performance.",0,1,0,3
0,30815172,Defining and Developing a Generic Framework for Monitoring Data Quality in Clinical Research.,"Evidence for the need for high data quality in clinical research is well established. The rigor of clinical research conclusions rely heavily on good quality data, which relies on good documentation practices. Little attention has been given to clear guidelines and definitions to monitor data quality. To address this, a fit-for-use data quality monitoring framework (DQMF) for clinical research was developed based on a holistic design-oriented approach. An integrated literature review and feasibility study underpinned the framework development. Ontology of key terms, concepts, methods, and standards were recorded using a consensus approach and mind mapping technique. The DQMF is presented as a nested concentric network illustrating concept relationships and hierarchy. Face validation was conducted, and common terminology and definitions are listed. The consolidated DQMF can be adapted according to study context and data availability aiding in the development of a long-term strategy with increased efficacy for clinical data quality monitoring.",0,1,0,4
