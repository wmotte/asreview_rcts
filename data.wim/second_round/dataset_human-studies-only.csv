9,30756094,Economic evaluation plan of a randomised controlled trial of intra-nodular injection of anti-TNF and placebo among patients with early Dupuytren's disease: Repurposing Anti-TNF for Treating Dupuytren's Disease (RIDD).,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a common fibroproliferative condition of the palmar and digital fascia of the hand; however, there is currently no approved treatment for early stage DD. The objective of this paper is to describe the methods applied to assess the cost-effectiveness of adalimumab injections compared to usual care for controlling the progression of early stage DD in the Repurposing Anti-TNF for Treating Dupuytren's Disease (RIDD) trial. Measure of effectiveness and resource use will be obtained from a randomised clinical trial, carried out in three healthcare centres, and recruiting a minimum of 138 patients aged 18 years and above with a diagnosis of early stage DD. Resource use and utility measures (quality-adjusted life years) will be collected at 3, 6, 9, 12 (primary outcome endpoint) and 18 months post-randomisation. A within-trial cost-utility analysis (CUA) will be conducted at 12 months and if the intervention is effective, a decision analytic model will be applied to estimate the lifetime effectiveness and costs. The analysis will be performed from a health system (National Health Service and personal social services) perspective. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess the robustness of the results. RIDD is the first randomised controlled trial with an economic evaluation conducted among patients with early stage DD. The protocol described here records our intent to conduct both a within-trial CUA alongside the RIDD study and a lifetime CUA using decision-analytic modelling.",0,1,1,1
20,30886955,A phase II trial protocol of Tocilizumab in anti-TNF refractory patients with JIA-associated uveitis (the APTITUDE trial).,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease in children. Children with JIA are at risk of intraocular inflammation (uveitis). In the initial stages of mild-moderate inflammation uveitis is asymptomatic. Most children with mild-moderate uveitis are managed on topical steroid drops with or without systemic methotrexate (MTX). When children with moderate-severe uveitis are refractory to MTX, monoclonal anti-tumour necrosis factor agents have been trialled, interim analysis data showed positive results. However, several children with severe recalcitrant disease or non-responsive to anti-tumour necrosis factor agents remain and are at greater risk of significant ocular complications and visual loss. Further evidence of alternative therapies is needed with evidence of a potential role of anti-interleukin-6 agents in the management of severe refractory uveitis. The trial will be conducted following a two-stage Simon design. The trial will register at least 22 patients aged 2 to 18 years with active JIA-associated uveitis, who have taken MTX for at least 12 weeks and have failed an anti-TNF agent. It will take place in 7 centres across the UK. All participants will be treated for 6 months, with follow up of 9 months from registration. Participants will receive a stable dose of MTX and those weighing ≥30 kg will be dosed with 162 mg of Tocilizumab every 2 weeks and participants weighing < 30 kg dosed with 162 mg of Tocilizumab every 3 weeks. Primary outcome is treatment response at 12 weeks. Adverse events will be collected up to 30 calendar days following treatment cessation. This is a novel adaptive design study of subcutaneous IL-6 inhibition in anti-TNF refractory JIA associated uveitis which will be able to determine if further research should be conducted. This is the first trial to look at ophthalmology outcomes in the efficacy of Tocilizumab in uveitis.This is the first paediatric clinical trial to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab with MTX in JIA associated uveitis. The Trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN95363507) on the 10/06/2015 and EU Clinical Trials Register on the 03/07/2015 (EudraCT Number: 2015-001323-23).",0,1,1,2
19,30863532,A study update newsletter or Post-it® note did not increase postal questionnaire response rates in a falls prevention trial: an embedded randomised factorial trial.,"Background: Participants not returning data collection questionnaires is a problem for many randomised controlled trials. The resultant loss of data leads to a reduction in statistical power and can result in bias. The aim of this study was to assess whether the use of a study update newsletter and/or a handwritten or printed Post-it® note sticker increased postal questionnaire response rates for participants of a randomised controlled trial. Method: This study was a factorial trial embedded within a host trial of a falls-prevention intervention among men and women aged ≥65 years under podiatric care. Participants were randomised into one of six groups: newsletter plus handwritten Post-it®; newsletter plus printed Post-it®; newsletter only; handwritten Post-it® only; printed Post-it® only; or no newsletter or Post-it®. The results were combined with those from previous embedded randomised controlled trials in meta-analyses. Results: The overall 12-month response rate was 803/826 (97.2%) (newsletter 95.1%, no newsletter 99.3%, printed Post-it® 97.5%, handwritten Post-it® 97.1%, no Post-it® 97.1%). The study update newsletter had a detrimental effect on response rates (adjusted odds ratio 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.48, p<0.01) and time to return the questionnaire (adjusted hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99, p=0.04). No other statistically significant differences were observed between the intervention groups on response rates, time to response, and the need for a reminder. Conclusions: Post-it® notes have been shown to be ineffective in three embedded trials, whereas the evidence for newsletter reminders is still uncertain.",0,1,1,3
2,30684339,Risk markers of reproductive loss in women with hyperandrogenism.,"Introduction: The frequency of the pathological course of pregnancy with hyperandrogenism ranges from 21 to 48%. With the predominance of androgens against the background of lowering the normal products of steroidogenesis, a pro-inflammatory immune imbalance is formed, which causes a premature termination of the development of pregnancy. Many studies indicate that hyperandrogenism is a factor in the development of obstetric pathology, including placental dysfunction. The severity of obstetric complications of pregnancy in women with hyperandrogenism depends on the duration of the disease and the quality of preparation for pregnancy. Establishing early markers of endocrine hyperandrogenic imbalance in the body of a future mother and conducting timely therapy is the key to the successful completion of pregnancy. The aim: the establishment of hormonal-immunological changes and morphological and receptive structure peculiarities of the endometrium correlations in women with PCOS at the pregnancy planning stage. Materials and methods: 139 women with PCOS were screened at the stage of pregnancy planning. Diagnosis of PCI was conducted in accordance with the International Recommendations of Endocrine Society 2013 and the Rotterdam criteria of 2003. Endometrial aspiration was studied for the study of T and B lymphocyte populations, cytokine levels and endometrial receptors. Hormonal parameters were determined using the radioimmunological method using Immunotech (Czech Republic) and Siena Ire Sorin (France) kits. Normal values of the studied hormones in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer. In order to study the populations of T and B lymphocytes and endometrial receptors the aspirate, obtained by endometrial biopsies, was used taken on the 5-7 and 21-24 days of the menstrual cycle. The cytokines levels (INF-y, TNF-a, Il-4, Il-6, Il-8, Il-10) were estimated in the endometrium with the help of the test system Protein contour on immunoenzymatic analyzer Multyskan EX (Germany). The assessment of estrogens receptors at stroma and glands and progesterone receptors at stroma and glands was performed by H -Score system, lymphocytes count was carried out by the light microscope at 400 x 3 fields-of-view expansion. Statistical material analysis was carried out on the personal computer using the standard software package with applied statistical analysis (Excel 2003 and Statistica v. 6.0). The assessment of variables connection was carried out by Pirson's coefficient correlations. The statistical significance of differences was performed by the use of nonparametric Mann -Whitney criteria, χ2 and Fisher criterium. The significance threshold of statistical value was considered p = 0.05. Results: In women with hyperandrogenism, there was a significant increase (p <0.05) in the level of DHEA-S, a decrease in the level of E2 and progesterone in the early follicular phase compared with the control group and an increase in body weight by 37.5%. At histological examination of the endometrium on the 5-7th day of the menstrual cycle there was a lag proliferative changes of the endometrium, and in one third of women hyperplastic process against the background of reduced proliferative activity. At GA there was a marked violation of expression of receptors as estrogens and progesterone stroma in all stages of the menstrual cycle. In women with hyperandrogenism, changes in the immunological profile of endometriosis with the prevalence of Th-1 orientation of immunity have been detected. Conclusions: In women with hyperandrogenism there is a close correlation between the biochemical form of the domination of androgens, ovulatory dysfunction, immunohistochemical and morphological structure of the endometrium. Revealed features of pro-inflammatory direction of cytokine immunity.",1,0,1,4
11,30763490,[Organization of nutrition of children and adolescents at the regional level].,"The article presents the results of 13-year monitoring epidemiological studies on the actual nutrition and eating habits among children and adolescents studying in educational institutions of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The study used standardized questionnaires, adapted by the Nutrition Center of the Health Institute M.K. Ammosov North-Eastern Federal University, in accordance with national traditions and food culture of the peoples of the North and the Arctic. Methods of frequency analysis of consumption of individual products and daily reproduction of food from memory have been used to study the main parameters of consumption of individual foods, including those from local animal and vegetable raw materials, and national dishes. Three monitoring epidemiological studies of 2001 (1st study), 2008 (2nd study), 2013 (3rd study) studied the energy value of diets and nutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals), the contribution of macronutrients in energy value. Schoolchildren's awareness of healthy nutrition was assessed. Dietary habits and addictions of children to particular foods and dishes have been identified. A comprehensive assessment of the actual nutrition and health status of 130 adolescents aged 15-18 years is given to study the effect of actual nutrition on the health of children, their anthropometric indices and body composition. Based on the results obtained, recommendations on how to optimize the nutrition of children of school age were scientifically substantiated, measures were taken to improve it, and conclusions were drawn on the need to improve the legal regulation of school feeding.",1,0,1,5
6,30740535,"Coronary artery disease, genetic risk and the metabolome in young individuals.","Background: Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in adults - the leading cause of death worldwide. It often occurs later in life, but variants may impact CAD-relevant phenotypes early and throughout the life-course. Cohorts with longitudinal and genetic data on thousands of individuals are letting us explore the antecedents of this adult disease. Methods: 148 metabolites, with a focus on the lipidome, measured using nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1H-NMR) spectroscopy, and genotype data were available from 5,907 individuals at ages 7, 15, and 17 years from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Linear regression was used to assess the association between the metabolites and an adult-derived genetic risk score (GRS) of CAD comprising 146 variants. Individual variant-metabolite associations were also examined. Results: The CAD-GRS associated with 118 of 148 metabolites (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05), the strongest associations being with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and atherogenic non-LDL subgroups. Nine of 146 variants in the GRS associated with one or more metabolites (FDR < 0.05). Seven of these are within lipid loci: rs11591147 PCSK9, rs12149545 HERPUD1-CETP, rs17091891 LPL, rs515135 APOB, rs602633 CELSR2-PSRC1, rs651821 APOA5, rs7412 APOE-APOC1. All associated with metabolites in the LDL or atherogenic non-LDL subgroups or both including aggregate cholesterol measures. The other two variants identified were rs112635299 SERPINA1 and rs2519093 ABO. Conclusions: Genetic variants that influence CAD risk in adults are associated with large perturbations in metabolite levels in individuals as young as seven. The variants identified are mostly within lipid-related loci and the metabolites they associated with are primarily linked to lipoproteins. Along with further research, this knowledge could allow for preventative measures, such as increased monitoring of at-risk individuals and perhaps treatment earlier in life, to be taken years before any symptoms of the disease arise.",1,0,1,6
5,30697184,Predictors of Evolution Into Multiple Sclerosis After a First Acute Demyelinating Syndrome in Children and Adolescents.,"Background/Objective: The aim of the study was to estimate the rate of evolution or for multiple sclerosis (MS), after a first acute demyelinating event (ADE) in pediatric patients, and to investigate the variables that predict this evolution. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and neuroradiological features of children who presented a first ADE between January 2005 and April 2017. All patients included underwent a baseline MRI, a cerebrospinal fluid and blood analysis, including virological examinations. The evolution into MS was determined by the 2013 International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group (IPMSSG) criteria. Clinical and radiological features predictive of MS were determined using multivariate analyses. Results: Ninety-one patients were selected (mean age at onset: 10.11 ± 4.6). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 ± 2.3 years, 35% of patients' conditions evolved to MS. In the logistic multivariate analysis of clinical and laboratory data, the best predictors of evolution into MS were: the presence of oligoclonal bands in CSF (p < 0.001), past infection with EBV (p < 0.001), periventricular lesions (p < 0.001), hypointense lesions on T1 (p < 0.001), and lesions of the corpus callosum (p < 0.001) including Dawson fingers (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a pattern of neuroimaging and laboratory findings may help to distinguish between, at clinical onset, children with a monophasic syndrome (clinically isolated syndrome or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) from those who will develop MS.",1,0,1,7
1,30675162,Relationship of Circulating Fetuin-A Levels with Body Size and Metabolic Phenotypes.,"Previous studies have suggested the existence of distinct body size subgroups according to metabolic health referred to as metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically abnormal but normal weight (MANW) patients. Although nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, the relationship between these phenotypes and fetuin-A, a representative hepatokine, has not been explored. We examined the association between circulating fetuin-A levels, metabolic health phenotypes, cardiometabolic risk parameters, and subclinical atherosclerosis in 290 subjects who were randomly selected from an ongoing cohort study. Fetuin-A concentrations were significantly associated with detrimental anthropometric and laboratory measurements, including increased waist circumference, blood pressure, alanine aminotransferase, fasting plasma glucose, and triglyceride levels. Furthermore, fetuin-A levels were significantly increased in the metabolically abnormal (MA) group compared to the metabolically healthy (MH) group in subjects without obesity (717.1 [632.1, 769.7] vs. 599.5 [502.0, 709.3], P = 0.001) and subjects with obesity (704.1 [595.5-880.9] vs. 612.2 [547.9-802.1], P = 0.016). In addition, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), which reflects arterial stiffness, was higher in MA individuals compared to MH individuals. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that both individuals without obesity (P for trend = 0.017) and with obesity (P for trend = 0.028) in the higher tertiles of fetuin-A had an increased risk of MA than those in the lowest tertile. This study demonstrates that fetuin-A levels are significantly associated with metabolic health phenotypes, such as MHO and MANW, in Korean adults.",1,0,1,8
10,30763025,Two case reports of synchronous unilateral pleomorphic adenoma and cystadenolymphoma of the parotid gland with literature review.,"Background: Synchronous unilateral tumors in the parotid glands account for less than 5-10% of all salivary gland neoplasms. Mostly these are cystadenolymphomas, but tumors of different histological types can be found as well. In these cases it is often pleomorphic adenoma in combination with cystadenolymphoma. Ultrasound is the first choice imaging modality. Case report: We present two patients with two simultaneous tumors in a unilateral parotid gland. In each case, B-mode ultrasound showed two hypoechoic masses, one of which was predominantly cystic. The subsequent use of Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification (VTIQ) showed tumors of elastic tissue. After a parotidectomy, both cases were diagnosed with pleomorphic adenoma combined with cystadenolymphoma. Conclusion: The combination of B-mode ultrasound and VTIQ is an important diagnostic modality and may improve diagnostic accuracy to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. Every clinician should be aware of the co-existence of different histological types of tumors in unilateral salivary glands.

13,30786686,Histological heterogeneity and distributional difference of gastric carcinosarcoma: report of 4 cases and literature review.,"Carcinosarcoma is a rare malignant neoplasm, consisting of both epithelial and mesenchymal component. Primary gastric carcinosarcoma is rare and poorly understood. We reported clinicopathologic features of 4 cases and analysis of 76 cases published in the literature. Clinical symptoms were nonspecific with epigastric pain, weight loss, and melena, as the most common complaints. The prognosis of patients was dismal with high mortality. The tumor commonly occurred in the upper stomach in Chinese patients, whereas, it was more prevalent at the lower stomach in Japanese and other populations. The two malignant components of this rare cancer showed considerable histological heterogeneity with a wide range of differentiation. We propose that carcinosarcomas be divided in two main subtypes: conventional carcinosarcoma and carcinosarcoma, not-otherwise-specified (NOS). Such distinction may provide useful information for targeted treatment of various sarcomatous components of this tumor. Immunohistochemistry should be routinely applied in the diagnosis of this rare tumor.",1,0,1,10
24,31516449,"Trend analysis of smoking-attributable hospitalizations in Thailand, 2007-2014.","Tobacco use is a major preventable risk factor for many noncommunicable diseases. Smoking-attributable mortality has been well described. However, the prevalence of smoking-attributable hospitalization (SAH) and associated costs have been less documented, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Our objective was to estimate the number of hospital admissions and expenditure attributable to tobacco use during 2007-2014 in Thailand. Hospitalization data between 2007 and 2014 were used for the analysis. SAHs were derived by applying smoking-attributable fractions, based on Thailand's estimates of smoking prevalence data and relative risks extracted from the published literature, to hospital admissions related to smoking according to the International Classification of Diseases version 10. Age-adjusted SAHs among adults age 35 and older were calculated. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to detect changes in trends among genders and geographical areas, based on annual per cent change (APC) and average annual per cent change (AAPC). Costs related to SAHs were also estimated. During 2007-2014, among adults age 35 years and older, smoking accounted for almost 3.6 million hospital admissions, with attributable hospital costs calculated at more than US$572 million annually, which represents 16.8% of the national hospital budget. While the age-adjusted rate of SAHs had been relatively stable (AAPC=1.12), the age-adjusted rate of SAHs due to cancers increased significantly for both sexes (AAPC=2.33). Cardiovascular diseases related to smoking increased significantly among men (AAPC=2.5), whereas, COPD, the most common smoking-related conditions decreased significantly during 2011-2014 (APC= -7.21). Furthermore, more provinces in the northeastern and the southern regions where smoking prevalence was higher than the national average have a significantly higher AAPC of SAH than other parts of the country. Smoking remains a significant health and economic burden in Thailand. Findings from this study pose compelling evidence for Thailand to advance tobacco control efforts to reduce the financial and social burden of diseases attributable to smoking.",1,0,0,11
23,31516438,Differences in visual fixation duration according to the position of graphic health warning labels: An eye-tracking approach.,"The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) recommends that graphic health warning labels (GHWLs) be positioned at the top of the principal area of cigarette packs, rather than at the bottom, to increase visibility. However, during the legislative process of introducing GHWLs in South Korea, the position of GHWLs has become a contested issue. The pro-tobacco industry group argued that the warnings should be placed at the bottom of cigarette packs because evidence for the effectiveness of the upper position was insufficient. Therefore, this study investigated whether the position of the GHWL affects eye movement. Participants (30 daily smokers and 24 non-smokers) were shown six cigarette packs in random order with different position combinations (top, middle, bottom) and image concepts (skin aging, toxic constituents). Participants' eye movements were recorded using eye-tracking equipment to measure visual fixation duration in milliseconds (ms). Participants visually fixated longer on the health warning area than on the tobacco branding area (p<0.05). Mean fixation duration on the health warning area was significantly longer at the top or middle positions compared to the bottom, by 28% (mean difference=340 ms, p=0.006) and by 30% (mean difference=368 ms, p=0.002), respectively. By contrast, mean fixation duration on the branding area was longer with the warning at the bottom compared to top or middle positions by 25% and 33%, with mean differences of 157 ms (p=0.100) and 212 ms (p=0.026), respectively. No significant difference in fixation time was observed between the top and middle positions (p>0.05). The duration of visual fixation on GHWLs was longer when they were displayed at the top and middle, rather than at the bottom. Therefore, GHWLs should be positioned from the top to the middle of the tobacco package.",1,0,0,12
18,30815192,Low Screening Rates for Diabetes Mellitus Among Family Members of Affected Relatives.,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and abnormal blood glucose is an important risk factor. Delayed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus can increase patients' morbidity. In an urban academic medical center with a large clinical data warehouse, we used a novel algorithm to identify 56,794 family members of diabetic patients that were eligible for disease screening. We found that 30.6% of patients did not receive diabetes screening as recommended by current guidelines. Further, our analysis showed that having more than one family member affected and being a female were important contributors to being screened for diabetes mellitus. This study demonstrates that informatics methods applied to electronic health record data can be used to identify patients at risk for disease development, and therefore support clinical care.",1,0,0,13
0,30569038,"A novel nano-iron supplement to safely combat iron deficiency and anaemia in young children: The IHAT-GUT double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial protocol.","Background: Iron deficiency and its associated anaemia (IDA) are the leading forms of micronutrient malnutrition worldwide. Here we describe the rationale and design of the first clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of an innovative nano iron supplement, iron hydroxide adipate tartrate (IHAT), for the treatment of IDA in young children (IHAT-GUT trial). Oral iron is often ineffective due to poor absorption and/or gastrointestinal adverse effects. IHAT is novel since it is effectively absorbed whilst remaining nanoparticulate in the gut, therefore should enable supplementation with fewer symptoms. Methods: IHAT-GUT is a three-arm, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial conducted in Gambian children 6-35 months of age. The intervention consists of a 12-week supplementation with either IHAT, ferrous sulphate (both at doses bioequivalent to 12.5 mg Fe/day) or placebo. The trial aims to include 705 children with IDA who will be randomly assigned (1:1:1) to each arm. The primary objectives are to test non-inferiority of IHAT in relation to ferrous sulphate at treating IDA, and to test superiority of IHAT in relation to ferrous sulphate and non-inferiority in relation to placebo in terms of diarrhoea incidence and prevalence. Secondary objectives are mechanistic assessments, to test whether IHAT reduces the burden of enteric pathogens, morbidity, and intestinal inflammation, and that it does not cause detrimental changes to the gut microbiome, particularly in relation to Lactobacillaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. Discussion: This trial will test the hypothesis that supplementation with IHAT eliminates iron deficiency and improves haemoglobin levels without inducing gastrointestinal adverse effects. If shown to be the case, this would open the possibility for further testing and use of IHAT as a novel iron source for micronutrient intervention strategies in resource-poor countries, with the ultimate aim to help reduce the IDA global burden.

21,31093568,OPTimal IMAging strategy in patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department: chest X-ray or ultra-low-dose CT (OPTIMACT)-a randomised controlled trial chest X-ray or ultra-low-dose CT at the ED: design and rationale.,"Chest X-ray has been the standard imaging method for patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department (ED) for years. Recently, ultra-low-dose chest computed tomography (ULD chest CT) has been introduced, which provides substantially more detailed information on pulmonary conditions that may cause pulmonary disease, with a dose in the order of chest X-ray (0.1 vs. 0.05 mSv). The OPTimal IMAging strategy in patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department: chest X-ray or CT (OPTIMACT) study is a randomized trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of replacing chest X-ray for ULD chest CT in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the ED. Two thousand four hundred patients presenting at the ED with pulmonary complaints and suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease will be enrolled in this multicenter, pragmatic, randomized trial. During randomly assigned periods of one calendar month, either conventional chest X-ray or ULD chest CT scan will be used as the imaging strategy. Randomization will rely on computer-generated blocks of 2 months to control for seasonal effects. Chest X-ray and ULD chest CT will be performed in a standardized way, after obtaining the clinical history and performing physical examination and initial laboratory tests. The primary outcome measure is functional health at 28 days. Secondary outcome measures are mental health, length of hospital stay, mortality within 28 days, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) during the first 28 days, correct diagnoses at ED discharge as compared to the final post hoc diagnosis, and number of patients in follow-up because of incidental findings on chest X-ray or ULD chest CT. In an economic evaluation, we will estimate total health care costs during the first 28 days. This pragmatic trial will clarify the effects of replacing chest X-ray by ULD chest CT in daily practice, in terms of patient-related health outcomes and costs, in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the ED. The OPTIMACT trial is registered in the Netherlands National Trial Register under number NTR6163. The date of registration is December 6, 2016.",0,1,0,15
3,30687208,The Games for Older Adults Active Life (GOAL) Project for People With Mild Cognitive Impairment and Vascular Cognitive Impairment: A Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Background: People living with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI) are persons who do not fulfill a diagnosis of dementia, but who have a high risk of progressing to a dementia disorder. The most recent guidelines to counteract cognitive decline in MCI/VCI subjects suggest a multidimensional and multi-domain interventions combining cognitive, physical, and social activities. The purpose of this study is to test an innovative service that provides a multi-dimensional tele-rehabilitation program through a user-friendly web application. The latter has been developed through a participatory design involving MCI specialists, patients, and their caregivers. Particularly, the proposed tele-rehabilitation program includes cognitive, physical, and caregiver-supported social activities. The goal is to promote and preserve an active life style and counteract cognitive decline in people living with MCI/VCI. Methods:The study is a randomized controlled trial. Sixty subjects will be randomly assigned to the experimental group, who will receive the tele-rehabilitation program, or the control group, who will not receive any treatment. The trial protocol comprises three steps of assessment for the experimental group: at the baseline (T_0), after tele-rehabilitation program (T_1) and at follow-up after 12-months (T_2). Differently, the control group will be assessed twice: at the baseline and at 12-months follow-up. Both the experimental and the control group will be assessed with a multidimensional evaluation battery, including cognitive functioning, behavioral, functional, and quality of life measures. The tele-rehabilitation program lasts 8 weeks and includes cognitive exercises 3 days a week, physical activities 2 days a week, and social activities once a week. In addition, group will be given an actigraph (GENEActiv, Activisinghts Ltd., Cambridgshire, UK) to track physical and sleep activity. Discussion:Results of this study will inform on the efficacy of the proposed tele-rehabilitation to prevent or delay further cognitive decline in MCI/VCI subjects. The expected outcome is to counteract cognitive decline and improve both physical functioning and quality of life. Ethics and Dissemination:The study is approved by the Local Ethics Committee and registered in https://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03383549). Dissemination will include submission to a peer-reviewed journal, patients, and healthcare magazines and congress presentations.

14,30788330,Iranian drug use survey in workplaces: A study protocol.,"Background: Addiction is a serious concern in workplaces, as it can lead to accidents, absenteeism, and loss of productivity, neglect, delay, arguing, unhappiness, production cuts, and irregular working pattern. This national survey was conducted to assess the prevalence and pattern of drug use among employees of industrial environments in Iran. Methods: In this cross sectional study, the sample size was determined to be 13489 using multistage cluster sampling method during November 2013 and November 2014. Data were collected by trained interviewers using a structured questionnaire developed by the research team. Urine drug test was done for participants using laboratory rapid kits. A total of 13 286 questionnaires were completed with remarkable responsiveness such that only 1.2% of them were excluded due to defects in urine drug tests, and the rest were analyzed after the review. Results: The response rate to the questionnaires was 98.4% and 13 128 individuals took the urinary drug test. Many participants who had positive urine test did not express drug use and positive tests were more than self-reported cases. Compared to information about the pattern of drug use, data on the estimated prevalence of drug use was more reliable. Conclusion: This study presents the protocol of a well-designed national survey, including sampling procedure, appropriate instrument and test, field work, and discussion on the strengths and limitations of the study, and thus its results can be used effectively by policymakers.",1,0,0,17
17,30809591,Intrathecal Immunoglobulin for treatment of adult patients with tetanus: A randomized controlled 2x2 factorial trial.,"Despite long-standing availability of an effective vaccine, tetanus remains a significant problem in many countries. Outcome depends on access to mechanical ventilation and intensive care facilities and in settings where these are limited, mortality remains high. Administration of tetanus antitoxin by the intramuscular route is recommended treatment for tetanus, but as the tetanus toxin acts within the central nervous system, it has been suggested that intrathecal administration of antitoxin may be beneficial. Previous studies have indicated benefit, but with the exception of one small trial no blinded studies have been performed. The objective of this study is to establish whether the addition of intrathecal tetanus antitoxin reduces the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with tetanus. Secondary objectives: to determine whether the addition of intrathecal tetanus antitoxin reduces autonomic nervous system dysfunction and length of hospital/ intensive care unit stay; whether the addition of intrathecal tetanus antitoxin in the treatment of tetanus is safe and cost-effective; to provide data to inform recommendation of human rather than equine antitoxin. This study will enroll adult patients (≥16 years old) with tetanus admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City. The study is a 2x2 factorial blinded randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 manner to the four treatment arms (intrathecal treatment and human intramuscular treatment, intrathecal treatment and equine intramuscular treatment, sham procedure and human intramuscular treatment, sham procedure and equine intramuscular treatment). Primary outcome measure will be requirement for mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcome measures: duration of hospital/ intensive care unit stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, in-hospital and 240-day mortality and disability, new antibiotic prescription, incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, total dose of benzodiazepines and pipecuronium, and incidence of adverse events.

22,31093569,Development and validation of clinical prediction models to risk stratify patients presenting with small pulmonary nodules: a research protocol.,"Lung cancer is a common cancer, with over 1.3 million cases worldwide each year. Early diagnosis using computed tomography (CT) screening has been shown to reduce mortality but also detect non-malignant nodules that require follow-up scanning or alternative methods of investigation. Practical and accurate tools that can predict the probability that a lung nodule is benign or malignant will help reduce costs and the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with lung cancer. Retrospectively collected data from 1500 patients with pulmonary nodule(s) of up to 15 mm detected on routinely performed CT chest scans aged 18 years old or older from three academic centres in the UK will be used to to develop risk stratification models. Radiological, clinical and patient characteristics will be combined in multivariable logistic regression models to predict nodule malignancy. Data from over 1000 participants recruited in a prospective phase of the study will be used to evaluate model performance. Discrimination, calibration and clinical utility measures will be presented.",1,0,0,19
16,30794012,"Influence of tobacco smoke on zinc, cadmium, iron, iron-binding proteins, and low-weight anti-oxidant status in pregnancy.","Pregnancy and tobacco smoking (TS) each can cause increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; this, in turn, can lead to disorders in iron management and disruption of the pro- and anti-oxidant balance. The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of TS and Cd on Fe, Zn, and anti-oxidant levels (i.e. glutathione [GSH], metallothionein [MT]) in the blood of pregnant women. The study reported here evaluated 110 blood samples from pregnant women in their 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester. Concentrations of ferritin and transferrin were measured in the serum; Zn, Fe and cotinine in the plasma, that of Cd in whole blood, that for glutathione in red blood cell lysates, and levels of metallothionein both in the plasma and in lysates prepared from isolated erythrocytes. The results indicated there was a decrease in Zn and increase in Cd and metallothionein levels in pregnant women smokers as compared to in nonsmoking counterparts. Differences in intracellular MT concentration were noted both in smoking and nonsmoking women during pregnancy while there were no changes in extracellular MT level. A decline in circulating ferritin and a rise in transferrin during pregnancy was observed in all groups. Based on the results, it was concluded that exposure to TS-associated xenobiotics like Cd could result in higher MT levels in erythrocytes and in pregnant smokers, the major anti-oxidant mechanism that is in place is one being mediated by MT and not by reduced GSH.",1,0,0,20
4,30687784,Time is money: quantifying savings in outpatient appendectomy.,"Laparoscopic appendectomy can be performed on a fast-track, short-stay, or outpatient basis with high success rates, low morbidity, low readmission rates, and shorter length of hospital stay. Cost savings from outpatient appendectomy have not been well described. We hypothesize that outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy is associated with cost savings. We performed an original retrospective cohort analysis of patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy between June 2013 and April 2017 at our academic medical center before and after implementation of an outpatient protocol which began on January 1, 2016. We assessed appendicitis grade, length of stay (LOS), cost, net revenue, and profit margin. After protocol implementation, the percentage of patients discharged from the the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) increased from 3.7% to 29.7% (χ2 p<0.001). The proportion of inpatient admissions and admissions to observation decreased by 5.7% and 20.3%, respectively. On average, PACU-to-home patients had a total hospital cost of $4734 compared with $5781 in patients admitted to observation, for an estimated savings of $1047 per patient (p<0.001). Comparing the time periods, the mean LOS decreased for all groups (p<0.001). Appendicitis grade was higher in those who required inpatient admission, but could not distinguish which patients required an observation bed. Outpatient appendectomy saves approximately $1000 per patient. Adoption of an outpatient appendectomy pathway is likely to be gradual, but will result in incremental improvement in resource utilization immediately. Grade does not predict which patients should be observed. Considering established safety, our data support widespread implementation of this protocol. III.",1,0,0,21
25,31516458,Study Protocol of European Regulatory Science on Tobacco (EUREST-PLUS): Policy implementation to reduce lung disease.,"Efforts to mitigate the devastation of tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality in the European Union (EU) are founded on its newly adopted Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) along with the first-ever health treaty, the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The aim of this Horizon 2020 Project entitled European Regulatory Science on Tobacco: Policy Implementation to Reduce Lung Disease (EURESTPLUS) is to monitor and evaluate the impact of the implementation of the TPD across the EU, within the context of WHO FCTC ratification. To address this aim, EUREST-PLUS consists of four objectives: 1) To create a cohort study of 6000 adult smokers in six EU MS (Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Spain) within a pre-TID vs post-TPD implementation study design; 2) To conduct secondary dataset analyses of the Special Eurobarometer on Tobacco Survey (SETS); 3) To document changes in e-cigarette product parameters (technical design, labelling/packaging and chemical composition) pre-TID vs post-TPD; and 4) To enhance innovative joint research collaborations on chronic non-communicable diseases. Through this methodological approach, EUREST-PLUS is designed to generate strong inferences about the effectiveness of tobacco control policies, as well as to elucidate the mechanisms and factors by which policy implementation translates to population impact. Findings from EUREST-PLUS have potential global implications for the implementation of innovative tobacco control policies and its impact on the prevention of lung diseases.",0,1,0,22
12,30776201,[Metabolic disorders in chronic non-communicable diseases and ways of their correction during the medical examination of the population.],"In the study, comparative analysis before and after the air cryotherapy for the following parameters: total cholesterol (using a set of reagents CHOL_2, automatic biochemical analyzer ADVIA 2400( Siemens), glucose (using a set of reagents Glucose Hexokinase II, automatic biochemical analyzer ADVIA 2400 (Siemens), cholesterol of low-density lipoproteins (using the set of reagents of L-HDL, automatic biochemical analyzer ADVIA 2400 (Siemens). The number of oxidized lipoproteins (LP) was determined by the method of the Muzya G. I., the amount of LP resistant to oxidation was determined by the Ragino Yu.I. The clinical group consisted of 30 people with a verified diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, the average age of which was 45.3±3.7 years. Patients of the clinical group received a course of cryotherapy by the method, including the presence in the pre -chamber at t0 -600C for 30 seconds, then in the main chamber at t 0-110-1200C for 180 seconds. Procedures were released again with an interval of 20 minutes, daily within 10 days. Statistical processing of the obtained data was carried out according to conventional methods with the determination of the arithmetic mean, the mean error using the program STADIA version 6.0. The significance of differences in the clinical group before and after the correction was judged by the Student's t-test value after checking the distribution for normality. Differences corresponding to the probability error p<0.05 were considered statistically significant. In patients of the clinical group with metabolic syndrome before treatment, elevated levels of total serum cholesterol by 24.3% and glucose by 12.8% relative to normal values were found. After the course of General air cryotherapy, the total number of low-density lipoproteins decreased by 15.47%, total serum cholesterol by 32.30%, while the serum glucose level decreased by 11.8% compared to the indicators registered in the clinical group before cryotherapy.",0,1,0,23
15,30792940,Understanding Health Risks for Adolescents in Protective Custody.,"Children in child welfare protective custody (e.g., foster care) are known to have increased health concerns compared to children not in protective custody. The poor health documented for children in protective custody persists well into adulthood; young adults who emancipate from protective custody report poorer health, lower quality of life, and increased health risk behaviors compared to young adults in the general population. This includes increased mental health concerns, substance use, sexually transmitted infections, unintended pregnancy, and HIV diagnosis. Identifying youth in protective custody with mental health concerns, chronic medical conditions, and increased health risk behaviors while they remain in custody would provide the opportunity to target prevention and intervention efforts to curtail poor health outcomes while youth are still connected to health and social services. This study leveraged linked electronic health records and child welfare administrative records for 351 youth ages 15 and older to identify young people in custody who were experiencing mental health conditions, chronic medical conditions, and health risk behaviors (e.g., substance use, sexual risk). Results indicate that 41.6% of youth have a mental health diagnosis, with depression and behavior disorders most common. Additionally, 41.3% of youth experience chronic medical conditions, primarily allergies, obesity, and vision and hearing concerns. Finally, 39.6% of youth use substances and 37.0% engage in risky sexual behaviors. Predictors of health risks were examined. Those findings indicate that women, those with longer lengths of stay and more times in custody, and those in independent living and congregate care settings are at greatest risk for mental health conditions, chronic medical conditions, and health risk behaviors. Results suggest a need to ensure that youth remain connected to health and mental health safety nets, with particular attention needed for adolescents in care for longer and/or those placed in non-family style settings. Understanding who is at risk is critical for developing interventions and policies to target youth who are most vulnerable for increased health concerns that can be implemented while they are in custody and are available to receive services.",1,0,0,24
8,30756093,Using machine learning to guide targeted and locally-tailored empiric antibiotic prescribing in a children's hospital in Cambodia.,"Background: Early and appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment of patients suspected of having sepsis is associated with reduced mortality. The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance reduces the efficacy of empiric therapy guidelines derived from population data. This problem is particularly severe for children in developing country settings. We hypothesized that by applying machine learning approaches to readily collect patient data, it would be possible to obtain individualized predictions for targeted empiric antibiotic choices. Methods and Findings: We analysed blood culture data collected from a 100-bed children's hospital in North-West Cambodia between February 2013 and January 2016. Clinical, demographic and living condition information was captured with 35 independent variables. Using these variables, we used a suite of machine learning algorithms to predict Gram stains and whether bacterial pathogens could be treated with common empiric antibiotic regimens: i) ampicillin and gentamicin; ii) ceftriaxone; iii) none of the above. 243 patients with bloodstream infections were available for analysis. We found that the random forest method had the best predictive performance overall as assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The random forest method gave an AUC of 0.80 (95%CI 0.66-0.94) for predicting susceptibility to ceftriaxone, 0.74 (0.59-0.89) for susceptibility to ampicillin and gentamicin, 0.85 (0.70-1.00) for susceptibility to neither, and 0.71 (0.57-0.86) for Gram stain result. Most important variables for predicting susceptibility were time from admission to blood culture, patient age, hospital versus community-acquired infection, and age-adjusted weight score. Conclusions: Applying machine learning algorithms to patient data that are readily available even in resource-limited hospital settings can provide highly informative predictions on antibiotic susceptibilities to guide appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy. When used as a decision support tool, such approaches have the potential to improve targeting of empiric therapy, patient outcomes and reduce the burden of antimicrobial resistance.",1,0,0,25
26,34671233,Smoking in public places in six European countries: Findings from the EUREST-PLUS ITC Europe Survey.,"Surveillance of tobacco consumption in public places is an important measure to evaluate the impact of tobacco control interventions over time. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of smoking as seen by smokers and their smoking behaviour in public places, in six European countries. We used baseline data of the International Tobacco Control Six European countries (ITC 6E) Survey, part of the EUREST-PLUS Project, conducted in 2016 in national representative samples of about 1000 adult smokers aged 18 years and older in Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Spain. For each setting (workplaces, restaurants, bars/pubs and discos) participants were asked whether they had seen someone smoking during their last visit there and whether they too had smoked there. We report the overall and by-country weighted prevalence of seeing someone smoking and the smokers' own smoking behaviour at each setting. We also assess the relationship between seeing someone smoking and smoking themselves at these settings. The prevalence of smoking as seen by smokers was 18.8% at workplaces, with high variability among countries (from 4.7% in Hungary to 40.8% in Greece). Among smokers visiting leisure facilities in the last year, during their last visit 22.7% had seen someone smoking inside restaurants and 12.2% had smoked themselves there, while for bars/pubs the corresponding prevalences were 33.9% and 20.4%, and inside discos 44.8% and 34.8%. Smoking is still prevalent at leisure facilities, particularly at discos in Europe, with high variability among countries. More extensive awareness campaigns and stricter enforcement are needed to increase the compliance of smoke-free regulations, especially in leisure facilities.",1,0,0,26
7,30741569,Comparison of the content of tobacco alkaloids and tobacco-specific nitrosamines in 'heat-not-burn' tobacco products before and after aerosol generation.,"Standardized methods for collecting smoke and for measuring smoke components in heat not burn tobacco product (HTP) are yet to be established, and there is a lack of consensus as to whether the content of HTP cigarettes can be assayed in the same manner as for conventional cigarettes. Since HTPcigarettes do not generate ash when smoked, we compared the levels of tobacco alkaloids (TAs) and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) of HTP cigarettes before and after aerosol generation. HTP cigarettes were smoked according to two international standardization methods. The TAs and TSNAs contents of the cigarettes were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF and UPLC-MSMS, respectively. Smoking was found to significantly decrease the content of nicotine, nornicotine, anatabine, and anabasine by 53 ∼ 100% in all samples, and the maximum inhalable amounts of these entities were determined to be 4.24 mg/cig, 103.52 μg/cig, 258.72 μg/cig, and 33.03 μg/cig, respectively. By contrast, smoking significantly increased the content of NNK and NAB. we suggested that the reduced nicotine content minus the nicotine content remaining in the filter is an amount that could potentially be inhaled during smoking. The increase of NNK and NAB in HTP cigarette after aerosol generation is expected to be caused by the precursor, but more specific behavioral studies should be performed.",0,1,0,27
