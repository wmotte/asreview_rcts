30671424	Scoping Review of Pediatric Early Warning Systems (PEWS) in Resource-Limited and Humanitarian Settings.	Pediatric Early Warning Systems (PEWS) aim to identify hospitalized children at increased risk of deterioration by assigning a score based on vital signs and clinical status and guiding interventions using a response algorithm to improve outcomes. When implemented with quality improvement methodology, these systems have been shown to be effective in high-resource settings and have the potential to improve the care of children in humanitarian and resource-limited settings (RLS). The purpose of this review is to summarize the current evidence for use of PEWS in RLS and identify areas for further research. A review of the current PEWS literature in RLS was performed using Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, Portal Regional da BVS, and TRIP Database. While there is limited research available on this topic, eight studies on the use of PEWS, or a PEWS score in a pediatric population in low- or middle-income countries were identified. Two studies assessed the clinical effect of implementation of PEWS; one reported a reduction in clinical deterioration events and the other a reduction in mortality. The remaining studies assessed the association of a PEWS score with signs of clinical deterioration or mortality without a response algorithm. Further research on the impact of PEWS implementation on inpatient care and outcomes in RLS is needed.	1	0
30672351	Quality of Life and Depression in Turkish Patients with β-Thalassemia Major: A Cross-Sectional Study.	Thalassemias are the most common monogenic disorders worldwide. Thalassemia patients experience difficulties in their schooling, finding jobs and/or marriage because of functional and physical limitations caused by this disease. It is expected that the quality of life (QoL) of patients with thalassemia will be lower than those without this disease. The aim of this study was to benefit worldwide thalassemia patients in terms of QoL and mental health. This cross-sectional study was performed in Turkey. The study population consisted of of 57 β-thalassemia major (β-TM) patients and the control group. The short form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire and Beck depression inventory (BDI) were used. The mean age of the patients was 21.6 ± 6.6 (age range 15-39) and the male-to-female ratio was 0.7. The mean SF-36 scores of the patient and the control groups were 59.2 ± 12.4 and 75.7 ± 11.8, and the mean BDI scores of the patients and controls were 13.5 ± 6.4 and 6.1 ± 3.7, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the total SF-36 and BDI scores of patients and controls. We aimed to investigate the effects of the decrease in morbidity and mortality of β-thalassemia (β-thal) due to regular transfusions and chelation therapy on the QoL and mental health of patients. The β-TM patients have a comparatively worse QoL score than the normal population. Improving QoL should be the target of clinicians who are monitoring adolescent or young adult β-TM patients.	0	1
30687040	Behind the Scenes of Developmental Language Disorder: Time to Call Neuropsychology Back on Stage.	Although the Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), also known as Specific Language Impairment in children has been the focus of unceasing scientific attention for decades, the nature and mechanisms of this disorder remain unclear. Most importantly, we still cannot reliably identify children requiring urgent intervention among other 'late talkers' at an early age and understand the high prevalence of comorbidity with psychiatric phenomena such as Autism Spectrum Disorder. One of the main reasons for this is the traditional 'diagnosis-by-exclusion,' resulting in heterogeneity of the DLD population. This paper proposes an alternative approach to the diagnosis, treatment and research of DLD, claiming that it is these children's multiple deficits in neuropsychological development, which impede the spontaneous acquisition of their first language. Specifically, this review of the state-of-the-art in DLD research demonstrates deep and systematic interconnections between the speech and other higher cognitive functions developing in early childhood, including perception, attention and executive functions. In the proposed framework, speech is, therefore, considered as one of neuropsychological abilities, and the delay in its development is explained by other neuropsychological deficits, resulting in highly individual clinical profiles. By considering DLD as a complex neuropsychological syndrome, whose successful treatment depends on a holistic approach to diagnosis and intervention, we may significantly increase the efficacy of speech therapy, and also better understand the flexibility of the developing brain, its compensatory mechanisms and hence the comorbidity of DLD with psychiatric symptoms. Implications for using this paradigm in future scientific research are discussed.	1	0
30687520	Are parenting practices associated with the same child outcomes in sub-Saharan African countries as in high-income countries? A review and synthesis.	There is increasing interest in the transferability of parenting interventions from high-income countries (HICs) to low-income countries (LICs) in order to improve child development and health outcomes. This is based on the premise that associations between parenting practices and child outcomes are similar in both settings. Many parenting interventions in HICs are evidence-based, but less evidence exists on associations of parenting practices with child outcomes in LICs, in particular, sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. This review synthesises evidence on the association of parenting practices with child outcomes in SSA in order to compare findings with those from HICs. We searched electronic databases-Web of Science, ASSIA, Embase, IBSS and PsycINFO-to identify studies from SSA that reported quantitative associations between parenting practices and child health or psychosocial outcomes (eg, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), mental health, conduct disorders). Due to inconsistent conceptual framing of parenting across studies, we used a modified version of the international WHO classification of parenting dimensions to guide synthesis of the results. Forty-four studies met our inclusion criteria. They were conducted in 13 SSA countries and included cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, and were predominantly descriptive studies rather than intervention research. Synthesis of results showed that associations between patterns of parenting ('positive'/'harsh') and child outcomes (including SRH, mental health and conduct disorders) in studies from SSA were broadly similar to those found in HICs. These findings suggest that the impacts of parenting practices on child outcomes are similar across contrasting global regions and, therefore, parenting interventions from HICs might be successfully transferred to SSA, subject to appropriate adaptation. However, this review also highlights the paucity of evidence in this area and the urgent need for higher quality studies to confirm these findings to help develop effective parenting interventions in SSA.	1	0
30687684	Understanding Family-Level Effects of Adult Chronic Disease Management Programs: Perceived Influences of Behavior Change on Adolescent Family Members' Health Behaviors Among Low-Income African Americans With Uncontrolled Hypertensions.	Background: Despite improvements in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and treatment, low-income African Americans experience disparities in CVD-related morbidity and mortality. Childhood obesity disparities and poor diet and physical activity behaviors contribute to CVD disparities throughout the life course. Given the potential for intergenerational transmission of CVD risk, it is important to determine whether adult disease management interventions could be modified to achieve family-level benefits and improve primary prevention among high-risk youth. Objective: To explore mechanisms by which African-American adults' (referred to as index patients) participation in a hypertension disease management trial influences adolescent family members' (referred to as adolescents) lifestyle behaviors. Design/Methods: The study recruited index patients from the Achieving blood pressure Control Together (ACT) study who reported living with an adolescent ages 12-17 years old. Index patients and adolescents were recruited for in-depth interviews and were asked about any family-level changes to diet and physical activity behaviors during or after participation in the ACT study. If family-level changes were described, index patients and adolescents were asked whether role modeling, changes in the home food environment, meal preparation, and family functioning contributed to these changes. These mechanisms were hypothesize to be important based on existing research suggesting that parental involvement in childhood obesity interventions influences child and adolescent weight status. Thematic content analysis of transcribed interviews identified both a priori and emergent themes. Results: Eleven index patients and their adolescents participated in in-depth interviews. Index patients and adolescents both described changes to the home food environment and meal preparation. Role modeling was salient to index patients, particularly regarding healthy eating behaviors. Changes in family functioning due to study participation were not endorsed by index patients or adolescents. Emergent themes included adolescent care-taking of index patients and varying perceptions by index patients of their influence on adolescents' health behaviors. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that disease management interventions directed at high-risk adult populations may influence adolescent family members' health behaviors. We find support for the hypotheses that role modeling and changes to the home food environment are mechanisms by which family-level health behavior change occurs. Adolescents' roles as caretakers for index patients emerged as another potential mechanism. Future research should explore these mechanisms and ways to leverage disease management to support both adult and adolescent health behavior change.	0	1
30693309	The relationship between childbearing motivations with fertility preferences and actual child number in reproductive-age women in Mashhad, Iran.	Motivation is directly involved in women's childbearing decision. Considering the lack of information about reproductive-age women's childbearing motivations with preferences and actual child number in Iran, this study was conducted to determine the relationship between childbearing motivations with the fertility preferences and actual child number of reproductive-age women. The participants in this descriptive-correlational study were 844 reproductive-age women (aged 15-49 years) who were married for the first time and came from a wide range of areas in Mashhad. Multistage and convenience samplings were applied and the data were collected using Miller's childbearing motivation and fertility preferences and actual child number questionnaire. The results of the study reveal that positive- and negative-childbearing motivation were correlated with preferences (P < 0.001) but were not correlated with actual child number. Furthermore, the interactional variable derived by a combination of positive and negative motivations showed a significant relationship with the ideal and actual child number (P < 0.05). Childbearing motivations affect the fertility preferences in reproductive-age women but do not appear to have any influence on the actual child number. Furthermore, the interactional variables affect the ideal and actual child number.	0	1
30713408	Partners in School: An Innovative Parent-Teacher Consultation Model for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.	Little research examines the best ways to improve communication between parents and teachers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and its effect on child outcomes. The present study tests an innovative parent-teacher consultation model, entitled Partners in School. The goal of Partners in School is to improve parent-teacher communication aboutevidence-based practices (EBPs), and subsequently, outcomes for children with ASD. Participants were 26 teachers and 49 parents of children with ASD from a large urban public school district. Parents and teachers completed measures of their communication and child outcomes prior to and after receiving consultation through Partners in School. Results indicated that parents and teachers perceived improvements in child outcomes after participation inPartners in School. Changes in parent-teacher communication also were associated with changes in some child outcomes. Discussionhighlights the important role of communication inconsultations targeting family-school partnerships for children with ASD.	0	1
30761275	Potential and Limitations of Atrial Natriuretic Peptide as Biomarker in Pediatric Heart Failure-A Comparative Review.	Although B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), N-terminal-proBNP (NT-proBNP), and mid-regional-proANP (MR-proANP) are included in current guidelines on heart failure in adults, no guideline considering these biomarkers in pediatric heart failure is available. A new drug class of neprilysin inhibitors as fixed-dose combination (Sacubitril/valsartan) has been introduced and is currently being investigated in children suffering from heart failure. Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) is discussed as a more useful alternative to BNP because it may grants better insights into the effects of this treatment. Thus, this review aimed to provide an overview of the current knowledge concerning ANP in pediatric heart failure and compares its suitability regarding diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure. A literature search using PubMed resulted in 147 publications of which 22 studies were classified as relevant. The review presents available ANP, NT-proANP, and MR-proANP level data in children (0-18 years). Summarizing, ANP shows only minor differences as marker for diagnosing and monitoring pediatric heart failure if compared to BNP. Due to its fast release, ANP offers the advantage of displaying rapid changes during therapy or operation. ANP is -like the other natriuretic peptides- influenced by age, presenting with the highest levels in very young infants. ANP also correlates with atrial pressure and volume overload in children. In addition, ANP determination in saliva appears to be a promising alternative to blood sampling. Similarly to NT-proBNP, NT-proANP, and MR-proANP offer better stability but only few data has been published in children and thus their potential is only presumable so far.	1	0
30768657	Improving pediatric emergency department physicians' adherence to clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis-a cross-sectional study.	Pharyngitis is one of the major and commonly seen presentations in pediatric emergency departments. While it could be caused by both bacterial and viral pathogens, antibiotics are improperly prescribed regardless of the pathogen. Inappropriate usage of antibiotics has risen the concern of microbial resistance and the need for stricter guidelines. Many guidelines have been validated for this reason, and the Centor score (Modified/McIsaac) is most commonly implemented. This study aims to assess the adherence and enumerate the reasons behind the suboptimal adherence to guidelines (Centor/McIsaac score) of pediatric emergency department physicians in the diagnosis and management of GABHS pharyngitis to lay the groundwork for future actions and to employ educational programs and implement local guidelines for the prevention of the development of multi-drug resistant microorganisms. We surveyed pediatric emergency department physicians of ten teaching hospitals of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We used convenient sampling and estimated a sample size of 170 physicians, and interns and medical centers without pediatric emergency department were excluded from the study. Elements of the Centor score (Modified/McIsaac) were used as a part of the assessment of physicians' knowledge of the guidelines. Adherence was assessed by requiring the participants to answer questions regarding their usage of diagnostic means when they suspect a bacterial cause of pharyngitis, as recommended by the guidelines. A total of 243 physicians answered the questionnaire, 43 consultants (17.6%) and 200 non-consultants (82.4%). On the knowledge score, 9.1% scored 0, and the majority of both groups, 46.5%, earned a score of 1. The remainder 44.4%, earned a score of 2. Adherence to guidelines was defined as when diagnostic tests (throat culture or rapid antigen detection test) were always requested prior to prescribing antibiotics when acute bacterial pharyngitis was suspected. Only 27.3% (n = 67) of our sample are adherent to guidelines, whereas the majority, 72.7% (n = 175), are non-adherent. Several factors were assessed as reasons for lack of adherence. Lack of knowledge and adherence to guidelines is prevalent in our setting, with awareness, knowledge, and behavior of physicians playing as major factors behind this low adherence. Studies should aim towards the assessment of adherence towards locally developed guidelines.	0	1
30774282	The Impact of Housing Instability on Child Maltreatment: A Causal Investigation.	More than a half million children are confirmed as victims of maltreatment by the child welfare system each year. Children from unstably housed families are over-represented in child mal-treatment reports, and a growing body of evidence links housing problems to maltreatment and Child Protective Services (CPS); investigation. The present study applies two propensity score analysis approaches-greedy matching and propensity score weighting-to data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study to move toward a causal explanation of child mal-treatment behaviors among mothers in low-income households. Utilizing two separate methods to correct for overt selection bias, the present study finds that housing instability leads to a small increase in maltreatment behaviors, yet this small positive net impact on child maltreatment does not fully explain the over-representation of unstably housed families in the child welfare system. Families experiencing housing problems likely have a range of needs that require earlier, targeted intervention to mitigate consequences of poverty, domestic violence, and maternal depression. Child welfare services should invest resources in housing assistance programs in-house as well as through partnerships with local public housing authorities to stabilize families, reduce housing-related strain on caregivers, and promote family preservation.	0	1
30815080	Characterizing the Utilization of the Problem List for Pediatric Trauma Care.	The EHR problem list has the potential to support care coordination among the multidisciplinary care team that cares for pediatric trauma patients. To realize this potential, the need exists to ensure appropriate utilization by formulating acceptable usage and management policy. In this regard, understanding the prevailing utilization pattern is pivotal. To this end, we analyzed EHR in tandem with trauma registry data at a Level I pediatric trauma center. Almost all (97.8%) of the actions executed on the problem list were addition of items. Among the 517 patient encounters in the cohort, 263 (48.9%) encounters involving sicker patients had at least one problem list item added, mostly within the first 4 hours of arrival, while in the emergency department, and by providers in the service of record. This represents a foundation to build upon. Subsequent research will explore completeness, accuracy, and the impact of the utilization on patient outcomes.	0	1
30815152	A Comparison of Existing Methods to Detect Weight Data Errors in a Pediatric Academic Medical Center.	Dosing errors due to erroneous body weight entry can be mitigated through algorithms designed to detect anomalies in weight patterns. To prepare for the development of a new algorithm for weight-entry error detection, we compared methods for detecting weight anomalies to human annotation, including a regression-based method employed in a real-time web service. Using a random sample of 4,000 growth charts, annotators identified clinically important anomalies with good inter-rater reliability. Performance of the three detection algorithms was variable, with the best performance from the algorithm that takes into account weights collected after the anomaly was recorded. All methods were highly specific, but positive predictive value ranged from < 5% to over 82%. There were 203 records of missed errors, but all of these were either due to no prior data points or errors too small to be clinically significant. This analysis illustrates the need for better weight-entry error detection algorithms.	1	0
30815414	Evaluating fear of hypoglycemia, pediatric parenting stress, and self-efficacy among parents of children with type 1 diabetes and their correlation with glycemic control.	Background: This study was designed to determine the level of fear of hypoglycemia (FoH), pediatric parenting stress and selfefficacy in parents of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 61 families of children with T1D who had been diagnosed for at least 6 months recruited from Gabric Diabetes Education Association in Tehran. Sixty mothers and 41 fathers of 61 children (26 girls, age: 6.0-12.7 years) were assessed using the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey-Parent (HFS-P), Pediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP) and Self-Efficacy for Diabetes Scale-Parent (SED-P) questionnaires. Pearson correlation analysis was used to compute the correlation between HFS-P, PIP and SEDP scores separately for mother and fathers. Results: Only 8.3% of children had controlled diabetes. Internal reliability of the Persian version of all questionnaires was good. FoH were higher for mothers. Mothers whose children had diabetes for less than two years had significantly lower mean HFS-Behavior subscale (HFS-B) scores than mothers whose children had diabetes for more than two years. There was a positive correlation between fathers' mean HFS-B score and children's total insulin dose per day. Parents' FoH score was positively correlated with increased pediatric parenting stress. Findings also showed considerable emotional distress in 51% of mothers and 29.7% of fathers. Frequency of selfmonitoring blood glucose tests (SMBG) correlated negatively with HbA1c. Conclusion: We concluded that parents with high levels of FoH and stress may benefit from diabetes education. Important implications for education are considering psychological adjustment, recognizing diabetes-related fear and stress in parents, encouraging fathers to become actively involved in the child's diabetes management and emphasizing the importance of SMBG.	0	1
30815424	Cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension, smoking and obesity: Emerging concerns among Pathan and Persian young adults?	Background: Hypertension was considered as a disease of the elderly but due to unhealthy dietary and lifestyle changes its incidence has increased in younger population. Smoking and obesity are emerging concerns the world is facing globally in younger age groups. This study is therefore aimed to identify these cardiovascular risk factors among Pathan and Persian young adults. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study carried out at multiple undergraduate, postgraduate educational institutes and hospitals using non-probability convenient sampling among young adults aged between 15 to 40 years for a period of six months from Apr 1st, 2017 to Sep 30th, 2017. Mean±SD was calculated for continuous variables and categorical variables were expressed as frequencies. Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 708 subjects were included. Mean±SD age was 26.12±3.7 years. Out of 708, 300(42.37%) were smokers with 209 (29.52%) active and 91 (12.85%) passive smokers. Among smokers, 216 (30.5%) were males while 84 (11.87%) were females. A total of 432 (61.02%) subjects were not doing any exercise, and 636 (89.83%) were consuming junk food. A total of 165 (23.3%) subjects were overweight, and 15 (2.1%) were obese. Stage-1 hypertension was present in 72 (10.2%), while 16 (2.25%) subjects had stage-2 hypertension. Conclusion: There is an increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors which includes hypertension, smoking, and obesity among Pathan and Persian young adults.	0	1
30886955	A phase II trial protocol of Tocilizumab in anti-TNF refractory patients with JIA-associated uveitis (the APTITUDE trial).	Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease in children. Children with JIA are at risk of intraocular inflammation (uveitis). In the initial stages of mild-moderate inflammation uveitis is asymptomatic. Most children with mild-moderate uveitis are managed on topical steroid drops with or without systemic methotrexate (MTX). When children with moderate-severe uveitis are refractory to MTX, monoclonal anti-tumour necrosis factor agents have been trialled, interim analysis data showed positive results. However, several children with severe recalcitrant disease or non-responsive to anti-tumour necrosis factor agents remain and are at greater risk of significant ocular complications and visual loss. Further evidence of alternative therapies is needed with evidence of a potential role of anti-interleukin-6 agents in the management of severe refractory uveitis. The trial will be conducted following a two-stage Simon design. The trial will register at least 22 patients aged 2 to 18 years with active JIA-associated uveitis, who have taken MTX for at least 12 weeks and have failed an anti-TNF agent. It will take place in 7 centres across the UK. All participants will be treated for 6 months, with follow up of 9 months from registration. Participants will receive a stable dose of MTX and those weighing ≥30 kg will be dosed with 162 mg of Tocilizumab every 2 weeks and participants weighing < 30 kg dosed with 162 mg of Tocilizumab every 3 weeks. Primary outcome is treatment response at 12 weeks. Adverse events will be collected up to 30 calendar days following treatment cessation. This is a novel adaptive design study of subcutaneous IL-6 inhibition in anti-TNF refractory JIA associated uveitis which will be able to determine if further research should be conducted. This is the first trial to look at ophthalmology outcomes in the efficacy of Tocilizumab in uveitis.This is the first paediatric clinical trial to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab with MTX in JIA associated uveitis. The Trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN95363507) on the 10/06/2015 and EU Clinical Trials Register on the 03/07/2015 (EudraCT Number: 2015-001323-23).	0	1
31007811	A cross-sectional study of traditional practices affecting maternal and newborn health in rural Nigeria.	Certain traditional practices which have negative effects on maternal and child health continue to be practiced in sub-Saharan African countries. A survey was carried out in a rural village in Nigeria to understand the scale and range of these practices. This was a cross-sectional study in which trained interviewers administered pre-tested questionnaires on child-bearing women using questionnaires embedded on android devices. The median age of marriage and pregnancy were 15 and 16 years respectively. Home births were high (90.4%) while non-skilled birth attendant was 87.4%. The community had a son preference index ratio of 1:4.1. Up to 81.5% of mothers responded that one form of unhygienic traditional procedure or the other was performed on their children. Time to initiation of breast feeding was in hours in the majority (76.3%) of mothers, with a high rate of use of prelacteal feeds (85.2%). Being an adolescent mother (AOR 0.403, 95%CI 0.203, 0,797) and utilizing a skilled provider at birth (AOR 0.245, 95%CI 0.088, 0.683) were associated with less likelihood of having an unhygienic procedure performed on children. The findings of our study suggest that traditional practices which could have negative effects on maternal and child health are still ongoing in the study community. Child protection laws and safeguarding principles could help to reduce these practices and would need to be developed and implemented in these settings where these practices are still prevalent.	0	1
31093056	[Maternal and child health care in Cuba: achievements and challengesCuidados de saúde materno-infantil em Cuba: conquistas e desafios].	In Cuba, maternal and child health care is based on the priority granted by the State, the implementation of the National Maternal and Child Health Program and the guarantee of equitable access to health services. This article describes the Cuban experience in this field, as well as its main achievements, challenges, and lessons learned. Among the most relevant results up to 2015 are the reduction of infant mortality rate and under-five mortality rate to 4.3 and 5.7 deaths per 1 000 live births, respectively; 5-year survival of 99.4%; more than 10 prenatal check-ups per delivery; 5.3% of low birth weight; 99.9% of institutional births; and being the first country to validate the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS and congenital syphilis. The main challenges are to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding; to reduce anemia due to iron deficiency in children and pregnant women; to reduce overweight in children; to prevent accidents; and to reduce maternal mortality, adolescent fertility rate, and voluntary abortion. Among the lessons learned are the priority given by the State to health, the programmatic management of maternal and child care, the guarantee of universal coverage, the systematic collection of information for decision-making, the integration of sectors and social participation in health. Sustaining and improving the results achieved will contribute to the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030. Em Cuba, os cuidados de saúde materno-infantil baseiam-se na prioridade concedida pelo Estado, na implementação do Programa Nacional de Saúde Materno-Infantil e na garantia de acesso equitativo aos serviços de saúde. Este artigo descreve a experiência cubana neste campo, bem como as principais conquistas, desafios e lições aprendidas. Entre os resultados mais relevantes até 2015 estão a redução da mortalidade infantil e mortalidade em menores de 5 anos para 4,3 e 5,7 mortes por 1 000 nascidos vivos, respectivamente; sobrevivência a 5 anos de 99,4%; mais de 10 exames pré-natal por nascimento; 5,3% do baixo peso ao nascer; 99,9% dos partos institucionais; e seja o primeiro país a validar a eliminação da transmissão materno-infantil de HIV/AIDS e sífilis congênita. Os principais desafios são aumentar a taxa de aleitamento materno exclusivo; reduzir a anemia devido a deficiência de ferro em crianças e mulheres grávidas e reduzir o excesso de peso infantil; prevenir acidentes; e reduzir a mortalidade materna, taxa de fertilidade adolescente e aborto voluntário. Entre as lições aprendidas estão a prioridade dada pelo Estado à saúde, a gestão programática dos cuidados materno e infantil, a garantia de cobertura universal, a coleta sistemática de informações para a tomada de decisões, a integração de setores e a participação social em saúde.

31236025	Turkish Neonatal Society guideline on parenteral nutrition in preterm infants.	Postnatal growth failure due to inappropriate and insufficient nutrition is a risk for preterm infants, especially for very-low-birth-weight or extremely-low-birth-weight infants. This extrauterine growth failure causes negative effects on long-term neurodevelopment. Early initiation of intensive parenteral nutrition with appropriate protein and energy supply is a nutritional emergency when enteral feeding cannot be achieved. This approach prevents protein catabolism and helps achievement of positive protein balance and postnatal growth. Protein, lipid, and glucose initiation with appropriate doses that reach timely goals constitute the major elements of parenteral nutrition. The transition to enteral nutrition with the mother's milk at the earliest convenience must be targeted in parenteral nutrition. Prematürelerin özellikle çok düşük doğum ağırlıklı ve aşırı düşük doğum ağırlıklı bebeklerin uygun ve yeterli beslenememelerine bağlı postnatal dönemde büyüme geriliği riskleri vardır. Bu ekstrauterin büyüme geriliğinin prematürede uzun dönem nörogelişimsel olumsuz etkileri gösterilmiştir. Enteral beslenmenin başarılamadığı durumlarda, erken ve yoğun parenteral beslenmenin uygun protein ve enerji sağlayarak başlanması, bu riskli prematüreler için yaşamsal bir acil durum kabul edilmektedir. Bu sayede protein katabolizması önlenmekte, pozitif protein dengesine erişmelerine ve büyümelerine olumlu katkı sağlanmaktadır. Parenteral beslenmede protein, lipid ve glukozun uygun dozda başlanarak belli hedeflere erişmesi prematüre bakımının ana elemanlarından biridir. Parenteral beslenen bebeklerin en kısa zamanda anne sütü ile enteral beslenmeye geçişleri de hedeflenmelidir.	1	0
31236031	Turkish Neonatal Society guideline for the follow-up of high-risk newborn infants.	Developments in perinatal and neonatal care have increased the survival rate of high-risk newborns but led to a rise in chronic diseases seen in these infants. A significant number of them attend primary and secondary health care centers after discharge; however, there are very few standard protocols for the long-term follow-up of these babies. Therefore, we aimed to establish a follow-up guideline that emphasizes on universal screening schemes and takes into consideration national data. The guide presented here provides brief recommendations for physicians in light of evidence-based data for the follow-up of high-risk newborn infants. The steps taken to monitor and solve the problems of all high-risk infants may vary. We hope the use of such a standard approach in evaluating each infant in daily routine will improve the life quality of these high-risk infants. Perinatal ve neonatal bakım alanındaki gelişmeler sonucunda riskli yenidoğanların yaşam oranı yükselmiş, ancak beraberinde bu bebeklerde görülen kronik hastalık oranı da artmıştır. Taburcu edildikten sonra birinci ve ikinci basamak sağlık merkezlerine başvuran hastaların önemli bir oranını oluşturmaya başlayan bu bebeklerin uzun süreli izleminin nasıl olması gerektiği ile ilgili ne yazık ki standart protokoller pek azdır. Bu nedenle evrensel izlem şemalarına ağırlık verdiğimiz ve ulusal verilerin de göz önüne alındığı bir izlem rehberi oluşturmayı amaçladık. Burada özetini sunduğumuz yüksek riskli bebek izlem rehberi uygulayıcıya kanıta dayalı veriler ışığında öneri niteliğinde bilgileri sunmaktadır. Tüm riskli bebekler için izlem ve sorunların çözümü için atılacak adımlar farklılıklar gösterebilir. Her bebeğin ayrı ayrı değerlendirildiği standart yaklaşımların güncel uygulamalarda kullanılmasının yüksek riskli bebeklerin yaşam kalitelerini artıracağını ummaktayız.	1	0
31304329	Sociomarkers and biomarkers: predictive modeling in identifying pediatric asthma patients at risk of hospital revisits.	The importance of social components of health has been emphasized both in epidemiology and public health. This paper highlights the significant impact of social components on health outcomes in a novel way. Introducing the concept of sociomarkers, which are measurable indicators of social conditions in which a patient is embedded, we employed a machine learning approach that uses both biomarkers and sociomarkers to identify asthma patients at risk of a hospital revisit after an initial visit with an accuracy of 66%. The analysis has been performed over an integrated dataset consisting of individual-level patient information such as gender, race, insurance type, and age, along with ZIP code-level sociomarkers such as poverty level, blight prevalence, and housing quality. Using this uniquely integrated database, we then compare the traditional biomarker-based risk model and the sociomarker-based risk model. A biomarker-based predictive model yields an accuracy of 65% and the sociomarker-based model predicts with an accuracy of 61%. Without knowing specific symptom-related features, the sociomarker-based model can correctly predict two out of three patients at risk. We systematically show that sociomarkers play an important role in predicting health outcomes at the individual level in pediatric asthma cases. Additionally, by merging multiple data sources with detailed neighborhood-level data, we directly measure the importance of residential conditions for predicting individual health outcomes.	1	0
31452828	[Knowledge, attitudes and practices of parents on vaccination against polio in Abeche-Tchad].	in Chad, transmission of poliovirus has been interrupted in 2000, but imports from Nigeria and weakness of vaccination coverage are a major risk of disease reactivation. This study aims to investigate knowledge, attitudes and practices of parents of children aged 0 to 5 years on vaccination against polio in Chad. this cross-sectional study was carried out in the six districts of Abéché. Only households who had children under 5 years of age were included. Data were collected through interviews with parents and guardians of eligible children using a tested and validated questionnaire. we interviewed 210 households. No family had a vaccination record notebook of their children. However, 97% reported vaccinated children who had participated in mass vaccination campaigns. About 97% were aware of poliomyelitis disease and 98% knew vaccination campaign. The most cited channels of information were radio (98%) and vaccinators (72%). Only 3% of parents reported refusing vaccination. There was an association between the negative influence of the relatives and the non-vaccination of children (p = 0.005). disease and vaccine knowledge is good in Chad despite the existence of rumours about, in particular, vaccine effects. The lack of immunization cards limited the analysis of survey results which were only declarative with a very high declared vaccination rate. Immunization cards are essential for eradication in association with prevention policy.	0	1
31516434	An evaluation of school-based e-cigarette control policies' impact on the use of vaping products.	Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use among youth is common, and so efforts to regulate its use and availability are continually being made. The school environment represents an important domain for advancing health policy among youth populations. This study examines the impact of school-based e-cigarette control policies on student e-cigarette use in the context of a natural experiment. Using three years of longitudinal student and school level data (2013/2014 to 2015/2016), from a sample of 69 secondary schools in Ontario, Canada, a generalized estimating equation approach examined the impact of school-based e-cigarette control policy changes on the prevalence of youth e-cigarette use. The main outcome of interest was current e-cigarette use, while covariates included age, gender, ethnicity, and amount of spending money in dollars per week the student has. Tests of proportion (t-tests) were used to examine whether there were any significant differences in the changes for each intervention school relative to the sample of schools that report no changes in school-level e-cigarette control policies. Estimates from the generalized estimating equation approach suggest that students had lower odds of using e-cigarettes in schools where an e-cigarette control policy was implemented. That is, the e-cigarette control policy decreased the adjusted odds of being an e-cigarette user (OR=0.68; 95% CI: 0.48-0.97). Examining school-specific impact, at four of six schools that had an e-cigarette control policy, the ban on the use of e-cigarettes may have lowered the prevalence of e-cigarette use. This is the first study to use longitudinal data to study school-level e-cigarette use and the impact of e-cigarette control policy. These results provide new evidence that school-level policies banning the use of e-cigarettes on school property may be effective in reducing e-cigarette use (or preventing it) in their current form, as seen in this natural experiment.	1	0
