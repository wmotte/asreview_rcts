30671473	LincRNA-p21 Inhibits Cell Viability and Promotes Cell Apoptosis in Parkinson's Disease through Activating α-Synuclein Expression.	Long intergenic noncoding RNA-p21 (lincRNA-p21) has been reported to be increased in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the function and underlying mechanisms of lincRNA-p21 remain not clear. In order to explore the role of lincRNA-p21 in PD, we used 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce in vivo PD model (C57BL/6 mice) and utilized N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) to create in vitro PD model (SH-SY5Y cells). Results showed that the expression level of lincRNA-p21 was increased significantly in PD models. High abundance of lincRNA-p21 inhibited viability and promoted apoptosis markedly in SH-SY5Y cells treated with MPP+. Mechanistically, further experiments demonstrated that upregulation of lincRNA-p21 could sponge miR-1277-5p and indirectly increase the expression of α-synuclein to suppress viability and activate apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. In short, our study illustrated that lincRNA-p21/miR-1277-5p axis regulated viability and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells treated with MPP+ via targeting α-synuclein. LincRNA-p21 might be a novel target for PD.	0	1
30686969	Tracking Neural Progenitor Cell Migration in the Rodent Brain Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging.	The study of neurogenesis and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is important across the biomedical spectrum, from learning about normal brain development and studying disease to engineering new strategies in regenerative medicine. In adult mammals, NPCs proliferate in two main areas of the brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular zone, and continue to migrate even after neurogenesis has ceased within the rest of the brain. In healthy animals, NPCs migrate along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) from the SVZ to the olfactory bulb, and in diseased animals, NPCs migrate toward lesions such as stroke and tumors. Here we review how MRI-based cell tracking using iron oxide particles can be used to monitor and quantify NPC migration in the intact rodent brain, in a serial and relatively non-invasive fashion. NPCs can either be labeled directly in situ by injecting particles into the lateral ventricle or RMS, where NPCs can take up particles, or cells can be harvested and labeled in vitro, then injected into the brain. For in situ labeling experiments, the particle type, injection site, and image analysis methods have been optimized and cell migration toward stroke and multiple sclerosis lesions has been investigated. Delivery of labeled exogenous NPCs has allowed imaging of cell migration toward more sites of neuropathology, which may enable new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for as-of-yet untreatable neurological diseases.	1	0
30687812	Oral Ibuprofen Interferes with Cellular Healing Responses in a Murine Model of Achilles Tendinopathy.	The attempted healing of tendon after acute injury (overloading, partial tear or complete rupture) proceeds via the normal wound healing cascade involving hemostasis, inflammation, matrix synthesis and matrix remodeling. Depending on the degree of trauma and the nature of the post-injury milieu, a variable degree of healing and recovery of function occurs. Post-injury analgesia is often achieved with NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen, however there is increasing evidence that NSAID usage may interfere with the healing process. This study aimed to investigate the cellular mechanism by which IBU therapy might lead to a worsening of tendon pathology. We have examined the effect of oral Ibuprofen, on Achilles tendon healing in a TGFb1-induced murine tendinopathy model. Dosing was started 3 days after initial injury (acute cellular response phase) and continued for 22 days or started at 9 days after injury (transition to matrix regeneration phase) and given for 16 days. Cellular changes in tendon and surrounding peritenon were assessed using Hematoxylin/Eosin, chondroid accumulation with Safranin O and anti-aggrecan immunohistochemistry, and neo-vessel formation with GSI Lectin histochemistry. Markers of inflammation included histochemical localization of hyaluronan, immunohistochemistry of heavy chain 1 and TNFα-stimulated glycoprotein-6 (TSG6). Cell responses were further examined by RT-qPCR of 84 NFκB target genes and 84 wound healing genes. Biomechanical properties of tendons were evaluated by tensile testing. At a clinically-relevant dosage, Ibuprofen prevented the process of remodeling/removal of the inflammatory matrix components, hyaluronan, HC1 and TSG6. Furthermore, the aberrant matrix remodeling was accompanied by activation at day 28 of genes (Col1a2, Col5a3, Plat, Ccl12, Itga4, Stat3, Vegfa, Mif, Col4a1, Rhoa, Relb, F8, Cxcl9, Lta, Ltb, Ccl12, Cdkn1a, Ccl22, Sele, Cd80), which were not activated at any time without the drug, and so appear most likely to be involved in the pathology. Of these, Vegfa, Col4a1, F8, Cxcl9 and Sele, have been shown to play a role in vascular remodeling, consistent with the appearance at 25 days of vasculogenic cell groups in the peritenon and fat pad stroma surrounding the Achilles of the drug-dosed mice. Tensile stiffness (p = 0.004) and elastic modulus (p = 0.012) were both decreased (relative to age-matched uninjured and non-dosed mice) in mice dosed with Ibuprofen from day 3 to day 25, whether injured or not. We conclude that the use of Ibuprofen for pain relief during inflammatory phases of tendinopathy, might interfere with the normal processes of extracellular matrix remodeling and cellular control of expression of inflammatory and wound healing genes. It is proposed that the known COX2-mediated anti-inflammatory effect of ibuprofen has detrimental effects on the turnover of a pro-inflammatory HA matrix produced in response to soft-tissue injury, thus preventing the switch to cellular responses associated with functional matrix remodeling and eventual healing.	1	0
30692914	Sirtuin 1 and Autophagy Attenuate Cisplatin-Induced Hair Cell Death in the Mouse Cochlea and Zebrafish Lateral Line.	Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is one of the major adverse effects in cisplatin chemotherapy, and hearing protective approaches are unavailable in clinical practice. Recent work unveiled a critical role of autophagy in cell survival in various types of hearing loss. Since the excessive activation of autophagy can contribute to apoptotic cell death, whether the activation of autophagy increases or decreases the rate of cell death in CDDP ototoxicity is still being debated. In this study, we showed that CDDP induced activation of autophagy in the auditory cell HEI-OC1 at the early stage. We then used rapamycin, an autophagy activator, to increase the autophagy activity, and found that the cell death significantly decreased after CDDP injury. In contrast, treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) significantly increased cell death. In accordance with in vitro results, rapamycin alleviated CDDP-induced death of hair cells in zebrafish lateral line and cochlear hair cells in mice. Notably, we found that CDDP-induced increase of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the HEI-OC1 cells modulated the autophagy function. The specific SIRT1 activator SRT1720 could successfully protect against CDDP-induced cell loss in HEI-OC1 cells, zebrafish lateral line, and mice cochlea. These findings suggest that SIRT1 and autophagy activation can be suggested as potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CDDP-induced ototoxicity.	0	1
30692927	Deficiency of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Protects Cardiac Function Impaired by LPS-Induced Acute Inflammation.	Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a bacterial wall endotoxin producing many pathophysiological conditions including myocardial inflammation leading to cardiotoxicity. Linoleic acid (18:2n6, LA) is an essential n-6 PUFA which is converted to arachidonic acid (20:4n6, AA) by desaturation and elongation via enzyme systems within the body. Biological transformation of PUFA through CYP-mediated hydroxylation, epoxidation, and allylic oxidation produces lipid mediators, which may be subsequently hydrolyzed to corresponding diol metabolites by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). In the current study, we investigate whether inhibition of sEH, which alters the PUFA metabolite profile, can influence LPS induced cardiotoxicity and mitochondrial function. Our data demonstrate that deletion of soluble epoxide hydrolase provides protective effects against LPS-induced cardiotoxicity by maintaining mitochondrial function. There was a marked alteration in the cardiac metabolite profile with notable increases in sEH-derived vicinal diols, 9,10- and 12,13-dihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (DiHOME) in WT hearts following LPS administration, which was absent in sEH null mice. We found that DiHOMEs triggered pronounced mitochondrial structural abnormalities, which also contributed to the development of extensive mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac cells. Accumulation of DiHOMEs may represent an intermediate mechanism through which LPS-induced acute inflammation triggers deleterious alterations in the myocardium in vivo and cardiac cells in vitro. This study reveals novel research exploring the contribution of DiHOMEs in the progression of adverse inflammatory responses toward cardiac function in vitro and in vivo.	0	1
30723481	Blockade of TNFα to Improve Human CD34+ Cell Repopulating Activity in Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation.	Early release of TNFα after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) correlates with development of acute graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). Here we tested the effect of TNFα and alloreactive T cells on early hematopoietic HSC genotype and function. Addition of TNFα (10 ng/ml) in liquid cultures with CD34+ cells for 6-72 h resulted in the downregulation of genes associated with stem cell activity, such as DNMT3A, DNMT3B, TET1, TET2, SOX2, NANOG, and OCT4, whereas no significant effect was observed on DNMT1 and GATA2 expression. These findings were reversed by using an anti-TNFα antibody. Similar gene downregulation was observed when CD34+ cells were co-cultured with alloreactive T cells CD34+ cells for 48-72 h, and this effect was partially prevented by rapamycin and an anti-TNFα antibody. CD34+ cells pre-incubated with TNFα for 48 h and transplanted in irradiated NOD-SCID ɤnull (NSG) mice showed a reduced myeloid engraftment compared to control mice. By using a xenograft model recently developed in our lab, we co-transplanted CD34+ cells and allogeneic T lymphocytes at 1:0.1 ratio in one group that also received etanercept (TNFα inhibitor) at 100 μg intra-peritoneum (i.p.) on days -1,+1,+3,+5 post-HSCT, and in the control group. At 6 weeks post-transplant, mice that received etanercept had a significantly higher number of marrow huCD45+CD34+CD38- early stem cells (p = 0.03) and a reduced number of huCD45+CD3+ splenic T cells (p = 0.04) compared to controls. The repopulating activity of marrow cells from mice treated with etanercept vs. controls was tested in secondary transplants. Although the overall engraftment was similar in the two groups, CD34+ cells isolated from recipients of marrow from the etanercept group showed a significantly greater expression of stem cell-associated genes and a higher number of CD45+CD34+CD38- cells than in controls (p = 0.03). Our findings suggest that early TNFα increase post-transplant can affect long-term stem cell engraftment, and that blockade of TNFα early after transplant may limit a cytokine-mediated suppressive effect on repopulating stem cell function.	0	1
30799984	Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant alkaline shock protein 23 from Staphylococcus aureus in a murine model.	The diversity and severity of infections caused and the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance necessitates the development of a vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus. None of the antigens tried as vaccine candidates so far has been translated into a clinically viable vaccine. Recent research data suggest that antigens with the potential to activate cell mediated immunity along with humoral immunity would be the key to the development of a vaccine. Alkaline shock protein 23, a membrane-anchored protein involved in the stress response, has been identified as a CD4+ T cell antigen from S. aureus. In the present study, we report the evaluation of immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant alkaline shock protein 23 from S. aureus in mouse models. The gene coding for the protein was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, purified using immobilized metal iron affinity chromatography, sequence-confirmed using mass spectrometry and intraperitoneally administered to BALB/c mice. Serum titers of IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a in response to the protein were measured on post-immunization days 21, 35 and 42 using indirect ELISA and compared to control mice injected with PBS. Our results showed that the protein induced significantly higher (p < 0.01) antibody responses in immunized mice compared to the control mice. The mean serum antibody titers of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a three weeks after the last immunization were found to be 25600, 25600 and 12800 respectively. Moreover, we found that immunization with Asp23 protected mice from a lethal dose of S. aureus strain USA300.	1	0
