30686251	Efficacy and Safety of Addition of Anti-PD1 to Chemotherapy in Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	Patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have limited treatment options. A novel treatment based on programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors has emerged as promising therapeutic options for advanced NSCLC. We assessed oncological outcomes of PD-L1 antibody versus docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to analyse the oncological outcomes of anti-PD1 to chemotherapy in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. Overall survival (OR=0.68,95%CI=0.61-0.75, P<0.00001) and progression-free survival (OR=0.84,95%CI=0.77-0.92, P=0.0002) were longer with anti-PD1 than with docetaxel in NSCLC. Anti-PD1 was associated with even greater objective response rate than docetaxel (OR=1.61,95%CI=1.16-2.24, P=0.004). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3-5 did favor anti-PD1 over docetaxel (OR=0.21,95%CI=0.10-0.42, P<0.00001). Among patients with advanced NSCLC, we found that there was a superior survival benefit and with a favorable safety profile with anti-PD1 than with docetaxel. More large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to identify relevant biomarkers that have an effect on predicting the population that would most likely benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 for pretreated advanced NSCLC patients.	1	0
30705616	Relationship Between Alzheimer's Disease and the Immune System: A Meta-Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative diseases (neuro-diseases) which is prevalent in the elderly and seriously affects the lives of individuals. Many studies have discussed the relationship between immune system and AD pathogenesis. Here, the meta-analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes based on microarray data was conducted to study the association between AD and immune system. 9519 target genes of hippocampus in 146 subjects (73 AD cases and 73 controls) from 4 microarray data sets were compiled and DE genes with p < 1.00E - 04 were selected to conduct the pathway-analysis. The results indicated that the DE genes were significantly enriched in the neuro-diseases as well as the immune system pathways.	0	1
