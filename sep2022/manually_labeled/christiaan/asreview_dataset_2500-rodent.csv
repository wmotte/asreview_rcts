90,35983393,Evaluation of the Antinociceptive Action of Simvastatin in Mice.,"Statins are well-established agents for dyslipidemia and have successfully been used for the prevention of coronary artery diseases for a long time; this is attributed not only to their lipid-lowering action but also to their pleiotropic actions. Recently many pleiotropic actions of statins have been explored, but very few studies were done to explore statins' antinociceptive action; therefore, the current study was planned to evaluate the antinociceptive activity of Simvastatin in different pain models in mice. Antinociceptive activity of Simvastatin was evaluated by using Eddy's hot plate method (central analgesic model), acetic acid-induced writhing method (peripheral analgesic model), and biphasic formalin-induced paw licking method. Twenty-four mice were divided into four groups (n = 6 in each): Vehicle control group, simvastatin 5mg/kg, simvastatin 20mg/kg, and positive control group. In the hot plate method, as compared to the vehicle control group, Simvastatin 20mg/kg group showed a significant rise in the reaction time to the corresponding time interval (p<0.001). While the simvastatin 5mg/kg group did not show any significant analgesic activity in the hot plate test. In the acetic acid writhing method, both test groups show a significant delay in the onset of writhing and a decrease in the number of writhes as compared to the vehicle control group (P<0.001). While in the formalin test, both groups show dose-dependent analgesic activity in both the early and late phases. Simvastatin exhibits analgesic activity in both central as well as peripheral models of analgesia, but central analgesia shows only at higher concentrations. Similarly, it inhibits inflammatory pain more predominantly than neurogenic, and hence simvastatin can be used in inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis particularly when there is coexisting dyslipidemia.",1,1
1832,35967808,Regular exercise combined with ferulic acid exhibits antiobesity effect and regulates metabolic profiles in high-fat diet-induced mice.,"Exercise (Ex) has been recognized as an effective way of obesity prevention, but it shows a dual effect on the body's antioxidant system. Ferulic acid (FA) is a kind of phenolic acid with well-known antioxidant capacity and numerous health benefits. Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare the antiobesity effect of Ex, FA, and Ex combined with FA (Ex-FA) in vivo and to illustrate the potential mechanisms. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without administration of Ex, FA, and Ex-FA for 13 weeks. The body weight, antioxidant ability, Ex performance, and lipid profiles in the serum, liver, and skeletal muscle were compared among the groups, and serum metabolomics analysis was conducted. The results showed that Ex, FA, and Ex-FA exhibited a similar effect on body weight management. Ex had a more beneficial function by alleviating HFD-induced dyslipidemia than FA, while FA exerted a more efficient effect in mitigating lipid deposition in the liver and skeletal muscle. Ex-FA showed comprehensive effects in the regulation of the lipid contents in serum, liver, and skeletal muscle, and provoked enhancement effects on antioxidant ability and Ex capacity. Mice administered with Ex, FA, and Ex-FA showed different metabolic profiles, which might be achieved through different metabolic pathways. The findings of this research implied that Ex coupled with FA could become an effective and safe remedy for the management of dietary-induced obesity.",1,2
1829,35967811,Importance of Dendrobium officinale in improving the adverse effects of high-fat diet on mice associated with intestinal contents microbiota.,"A growing body of evidence suggests that the disturbance of intestinal microbiota induced by high-fat diet is the main factor causing many diseases. Dendrobium officinale (DO), a medicinal and edible homologous Chinese herbal medicine, plays essential role in regulating intestinal microbiota. However, the extent of DO on the intestinal contents microbiota in mice fed with a high-fat diet still remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored the role of intestinal contents microbiota in the regulation of adverse effects caused by high-fat diet by DO from the perspective of intestinal microecology. Twenty-four mice were randomly distributed into the normal saline-treated basal diet (bcn), normal saline-treated high-fat diet (bmn), 2.37 g kg-1 days-1 DO traditional decoction-treated high-fat diet (bdn) and 1.19 g kg-1 days-1 lipid-lowering decoction-treated high-fat diet (bjn) groups for 40 days. Subsequently, we assessed the changes in body weight, serum total cholesterol (TC), total triacylglycerol (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and the characteristics of intestinal contents microbiota. Results demonstrated that DO exerted the modulating effect on the changes in body weight, TG, TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels. Besides, DO decreased the richness and diversity of intestinal contents microbiota, and altered the structure as a whole. Dominant bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, varied significantly and statistically. Moreover, DO influenced the carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolic functions. Furthermore, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira presented varying degrees of inhibition/promotion of TG, TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C. Consequently, we hypothesized that Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, as dominant bacteria, played key roles in the treatment of diseases associated with a high-fat diet DO.",1,3
1842,35967798,Effects of phytosterols' intake on systemic and tissue-specific lipid metabolism in C57BL/6J mice.,"This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of phytosterols (PS) intake on systemic and tissue-specific lipid metabolism in C57BL/6J mice. Healthy male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into control diet group (CS) and PS diet group (2% PS). After 28 weeks of continuous feeding, serums, livers, and lungs were collected for targeted free sterols quantification, biochemical tests, lipid profile detection, and RNA-seq analysis. Compared with the CS group, 2% PS supplementation significantly increased campesterol concentrations and its ratio to cholesterol in the serum, liver, and lung of mice, with cholestanol concentrations and its ratio to cholesterol decreased. Total cholesterol (TC) levels were reduced in the serum of the PS group (p < 0.05), with the triglyceride (TG) levels unchanged. In response to the decreased circulating cholesterol concentration, the expression of endogenous cholesterol synthesis genes was upregulated in the liver, but caused no obvious lipid accumulation and inflammatory cell infiltration. However, for peripheral tissues, long-term PS-fed mice exhibited diminished cholesterol synthesis, fatty acid transport, and oxidation in the lung. The results provided clear indication that 2% PS diet effectively reduced circulating TC levels in the healthy mice, with tissue-specific lipid metabolic regulation in the liver and the lung.",1,4
1821,35967819,The leaves of the seasoning plant Litsea cubeba inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome and ameliorate dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice.,"The intracellular sensor NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome controls caspase-1 activity and the maturation and release of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. The NLRP3 inflammasome has attracted the attention of the pharmaceutical industry because it promotes the pathogenesis of many diseases, making it a promising target for drug development. Litsea cubeba (Lour.) is a plant traditionally used as a seasoning in Taiwan and in other Asian countries. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory activity of the leaves of L. cubeba against the NLRP3 inflammasome. We found that the ethanol extract of L. cubeba leaves (MLE) inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages by reducing caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. MLE reduced pyroptosis in macrophages and inhibited the release of NLRP3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). In a mechanistic study, MLE reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and preserved mitochondrial integrity, which led to reduced mitochondrial DNA release into the cytosol. MLE did not reduce the expression levels of NLRP3, IL-1β precursor or TNF-α in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. These results indicated that MLE inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome by suppressing the activation signals of the NLRP3 inflammasome but not by reducing the priming signal induced by LPS. In addition, oral administration of MLE (20-80 mg/kg) ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a mouse model. Notably, mice that received MLE (1 and 2 g/kg) daily for 7 days did not exhibit visible side effects. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis found that α-Terpinyl acetate (27.2%) and 1,8-Cineole (17.7%) were the major compounds in MLE. These results indicated that L. cubeba leaves have the potential to be a nutraceutical for preventing and improving NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases.",1,5
1845,35967795,"Flavonoids from Lycium barbarum leaves attenuate obesity through modulating glycolipid levels, oxidative stress, and gut bacterial composition in high-fat diet-fed mice.","Traditional herbal therapy made from Lycium barbarum leaves has been said to be effective in treating metabolic diseases, while its exact processes are yet unknown. Natural flavonoids are considered as a secure and reliable method for treating obesity. We thus made an effort to investigate the processes by which flavonoids from L. barbarum leaves (LBLF) reduce obesity. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention following intragastric injection of various dosages of LBLF (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg⋅bw), obese model mice developed via a high-fat diet were utilized. Treatment for LBLF may decrease body weight gain, Lee's index, serum lipids levels, oxidative stress levels, and hepatic lipids levels. It may also enhance fecal lipids excretion and improve glucose tolerance. Additionally, LBLF therapy significantly restored gut dysfunction brought on by a high-fat diet by boosting gut bacterial diversities and altering the composition of the gut bacterial community by elevating probiotics and reducing harmful bacteria.",1,6
2100,35967418,Lactobacillus spp. act in synergy to attenuate splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice.,"Commensal bacteria and the immune system have a close and strong relationship that maintains a balance to control inflammation. Alterations of the microbiota, known as dysbiosis, can direct reactivity to self-antigens not only in the intestinal mucosa but also at the systemic level. Our laboratory previously reported gut dysbiosis, particularly lower abundance of bacteria in the family Lactobacillaceae, in lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, a model of systemic autoimmunity. Restoring the microbiota with a mix of 5 different Lactobacillus species (spp.), L. reuteri, L. oris, L. johnsonii, L. gasseri and L. rhamnosus, attenuated lupus-liked clinical signs, including splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. However, our understanding of the mechanism was limited. In this study, we first investigated the effects of individual species. Surprisingly, none of the species individually recapitulated the benefits of the mix. Instead, Lactobacillus spp. acted synergistically to attenuate splenomegaly and renal lymphadenopathy through secreted factors and a CX3CR1-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, oral administration of MRS broth exerted the same benefits likely through increasing the relative abundance of endogenous Lactobacillus spp. Mechanistically, we found increased percentages of FOXP3-negative type 1 regulatory T cells with administration of the mix in both spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. In addition, oral gavage of Lactobacillus spp. decreased the percentage of central memory T cells while increasing that of effector memory T cells in the lymphoid organs. Furthermore, a decreased percentage of double negative T cells was observed in the spleen with the mix. These results suggest that Lactobacillus spp. might act on T cells to attenuate splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Together, this study advances our understanding of how Lactobacillus spp. attenuate lupus in MRL/lpr mice. The synergistic action of these bacteria suggests that multiple probiotic bacteria in combination may dampen systemic autoimmunity and benefit lupus patients.",1,7
1388,35969050,Characterizing Salmonella Typhimurium-induced Septic Peritonitis in Mice.,"Sepsis is a dysregulated host immune response to microbial invasion or tissue damage, leading to organ injury at a site distant from that of the infection or damage. Currently, the widely used mice models of sepsis include lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and monobacterial infection model systems. This protocol describes a method to study the host responses during Salmonella Typhimurium infection-induced septic peritonitis in mice. S. Typhimurium, a Gram-negative intracellular pathogen, causes typhoid-like disease in mice. This protocol elaborates the culture preparation, induction of septic peritonitis in mice through intraperitoneal injection, and methods to study systemic host responses. Furthermore, the assessment of bacterial burden in different organs and the flow cytometric analysis of increased neutrophil numbers in the peritoneal lavage is presented. Salmonella Typhimurium-induced sepsis in mice leads to an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and rapid infiltration of neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity, leading to lower survival. Every step in this protocol has been optimized, resulting in high reproducibility of the pathogenesis of septic peritonitis. This model is useful for studying immunological responses during bacterial sepsis, the roles of different genes in disease progression, and the effects of drugs to attenuate sepsis.",1,8
1383,35969057,A Protocol for the Induction of Posttraumatic Stress-Disorder (PTSD)-like Behavior in Mice.,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric condition that precipitates in ~10% of individuals exposed to a traumatic event (TE). Symptoms include recurrent and intrusive thoughts, sleep disturbance, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, and reckless or destructive behavior. Given the complex and heterogeneous nature of the disease, animal models for PTSD-like symptomatology are of increasing interest to the field of PTSD research. Because resilience to PTSD-like symptomatology is an important epidemiologic aspect of PTSD, animal models that resolve vulnerable and resilient animals are of particular value. Due to the complex nature of the PTSD phenotype and the potential overlaps between PTSD-like behavior and behaviors associated with other stress-induced psychopathologies such as anxiety or depression, animal models that utilize multiple readouts for PTSD-like behavior are also of increasing value. We utilize a paradigm developed by Lebow et al. 2012 for the induction and identification of PTSD-like symptomatology in mice. This paradigm utilizes inescapable electric foot shock, administered in two decontextualized sessions over two consecutive days. Stressed mice perform four behavioral tests - dark/light transfer, marble burying, acoustic startle, and home cage activity - to generate five behavioral readouts of PTSD-like behavior: % risk assessment (%RA), % marbles buried (%MB), % prepulse inhibition (%PPI), latency to peak startle amplitude (LPSA), and % light phase activity (%LPA). PTSD-like symptomatology is characterized by decreased %RA, increased %MB, decreased %PPI, decreased LPSA, and increased %LPA. The 20% of animals displaying the most PTSD-like behavior in each test are awarded a certain number of points depending on the test, and animals scoring sufficient points are designated as PTSD-like, while animals scoring no points are designated PTSD-resilient. This paradigm identifies PTSD-like behavior in ~15% of animals, a rate comparable to that observed in humans. This protocol represents a robust and reproducible paradigm for the induction of PTSD-like behavior in mice.",1,9
2460,35966798,Attenuation of HECT-E3 ligase expression rescued memory deficits in 3xTg-AD mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorders that cause deterioration of cognitive functions. Recent studies suggested that the accumulation of inflammatory molecules and impaired protein degradation mechanisms might both play a critical role in the progression of AD. Autophagy is a major protein degradation pathway that can be controlled by several HECT-E3 ligases, which then regulates the expression of inflammatory molecules. E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to be upregulated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we studied the expressional change of HECT-E3 ligase using M01 on autophagy and inflammasome pathways in the context of AD pathogenesis. Our results demonstrated that the M01 treatment reversed the working memory deficits in 3xTg-AD mice when examined with the T-maze and reversal learning with the Morris water maze. Additionally, the electrophysiology recordings indicated that M01 treatment enhanced the long-term potentiation in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. Together with the improved memory performance, the expression levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome protein were decreased. On the other hand, autophagy-related molecules were increased in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. Furthermore, the protein docking analysis indicated that the binding affinity of M01 to the WWP1 and NEDD4 E3 ligases was the highest among the HECT family members. The western blot analysis also confirmed the decreased expression level of NEDD4 protein in the M01-treated 3xTg-AD mice. Overall, our results demonstrate that the modulation of HECT-E3 ligase expression level can be used as a strategy to treat early memory deficits in AD by decreasing NLRP3 inflammasome molecules and increasing the autophagy pathway.",1,10
558,35978576,"Immunohistochemistry of Immune Cells and Cells Bound to in vivo Administered Antibodies in Liver, Lung, Pancreas, and Colon of B6/lpr Mice.","Employing a novel mouse model of immune related adverse events (irAEs) induced by combination of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, we visualized immune infiltration into the liver, lung, pancreas, and colon. Here, we describe the avidin-biotin conjugate (ABC) method used to stain T cells (CD4 and CD8), B cells (CD19), macrophages (F4/80), and cells bound by the in vivo administered rat anti-mouse antibodies for chromogenic immunohistochemistry (IHC). Using a biotinylated goat anti-rat antibody, we detected the localization of cells bound to the in vivo antibodies for PD-1 and CTLA-4. IHC has advantages over other techniques, namely antibody availability, resistance to photobleaching, and greater sensitivity. Additionally, detection and localization of in vivo antibodies can be used in mice models to infer their therapeutic efficacy, stability, and function. Graphical abstract.",1,11
198,35982824,The Influence of Different γ-Irradiation Patterns on Factors that May Affect Cell Cycle Progression in Male Rats.,"Most studies of the biological effects of ionizing radiation have been done on a single acute dose, while clinically and environmentally exposures occur under chronic/repetitive conditions. It is important to study effects of different patterns of ionizing radiation. In this study, a rat model was used to compare the effects of repetitive and acute exposure. Groups: (I) control, (II, III) were exposed to fractionated doses (1.5 GyX4) and (2 GyX4), respectively/24h interval, and (IV, V) were exposed to 6 Gy and 8 Gy of whole-body gamma irradiation, respectively. The gene expression of MAPT and tau phosphorylation increased in all irradiated groups but the gene expression of PKN not affected. TGFβ% increased at dose of 2 GyX4 only. In addition, the cell cycle was arrested in S phase. Micronucleus (MN) increased and cell proliferation decreased. In conclusion, the dose and pattern of ionizing radiation do not affect the MAPT and PKN gene expression, but TGF-β, p-tau, MN assay and cell proliferation are significantly affected. The dose of 2 GyX4 showed distinctive effect. Repetitive exposure may increase TGF-β%, which causes radio-resistance and, G2/M delay. Thus, the cell cycle could be regulated in a different manner according to the dose and pattern of irradiation.",1,12
2425,35966871,Human Recombinant Alkaline Phosphatase (Ilofotase Alfa) Protects Against Kidney Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Mice and Rats Through Adenosine Receptors.,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released from injured or dying cells is a potent pro-inflammatory danger signal. Alkaline phosphatase (AP), an endogenous enzyme that de-phosphorylates extracellular ATP, likely plays an anti-inflammatory role in immune responses. We hypothesized that ilofotase alfa, a human recombinant AP, protects kidneys from ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), a model of acute kidney injury (AKI), by metabolizing extracellular ATP to adenosine, which is known to activate adenosine receptors. Ilofotase alfa (iv) with or without ZM241,385 (sc), a selective adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonist, was administered 1 h before bilateral IRI in WT, A2AR KO (Adora2a-/- ) or CD73-/- mice. In additional studies recombinant alkaline phosphatase was given after IRI. In an AKI-on-chronic kidney disease (CKD) ischemic rat model, ilofotase alfa was given after the three instances of IRI and rats were followed for 56 days. Ilofotase alfa in a dose dependent manner decreased IRI in WT mice, an effect prevented by ZM241,385 and partially prevented in Adora2a-/- mice. Enzymatically inactive ilofotase alfa was not protective. Ilofotase alfa rescued CD73-/- mice, which lack a 5'-ectonucleotidase that dephosphorylates AMP to adenosine; ZM241,385 inhibited that protection. In both rats and mice ilofotase alfa ameliorated IRI when administered after injury, thus providing relevance for therapeutic dosing of ilofotase alfa following established AKI. In an AKI-on-CKD ischemic rat model, ilofotase alfa given after the third instance of IRI reduced injury. These results suggest that ilofotase alfa promotes production of adenosine from liberated ATP in injured kidney tissue, thereby amplifying endogenous mechanisms that can reverse tissue injury, in part through A2AR-and non-A2AR-dependent signaling pathways.",1,13
174,35982981,Amide Proton Transfer-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Detecting Severity and Predicting Outcome after Traumatic Brain Injury in Rats.,"After traumatic brain injury (TBI), early assessment of secondary injury severity is critically important for estimating prognosis and treatment stratification. Currently, secondary injury severity is difficult to estimate. The objective of this study was to investigate the capacity of non-invasive amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to assess TBI injury in different brain regions and predict long-term neurobehavior outcomes. Fifty-five male and female rats were subjected to a controlled cortical impact with one of three different impactor depths to produce different degrees of TBI. Multi-parameter MRI data were acquired on a 4.7-Tesla scanner at 1 h, 1 day, and 3 days. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect activated microglia at 3 days, and neurobehavioral tests were performed to assess long-term outcomes after 28 days. The APTw signal in the injury core at 1 day correlated with deficits in sensorimotor function, the sucrose preference test (a test for anhedonia), and spatial memory function on the Barnes maze. The APTw signal in the perilesion ipsilateral cortex gradually increased after TBI, and the value at 3 days correlated with microglia density at 3 days and with spatial memory decline and anhedonia at 28 days. The correlation between APTw and activated microglia was also observed in the ipsilateral thalamus, and its correlation to memory deficit and depression was evident in other ipsilateral sites. These results suggest that APTw imaging can be used for detecting secondary injury and as a potential predictor of long-term outcomes from TBI.",1,14
1369,35969093,Measuring Skeletal Muscle Thermogenesis in Mice and Rats.,"Skeletal muscle thermogenesis provides a potential avenue for better understanding metabolic homeostasis and the mechanisms underlying energy expenditure. Surprisingly little evidence is available to link the neural, myocellular, and molecular mechanisms of thermogenesis directly to measurable changes in muscle temperature. This paper describes a method in which temperature transponders are utilized to retrieve direct measurements of mouse and rat skeletal muscle temperature. Remote transponders are surgically implanted within the muscle of mice and rats, and the animals are given time to recover. Mice and rats must then be repeatedly habituated to the testing environment and procedure. Changes in muscle temperature are measured in response to pharmacological or contextual stimuli in the home cage. Muscle temperature can also be measured during prescribed physical activity (i.e., treadmill walking at a constant speed) to factor out changes in activity as contributors to the changes in muscle temperature induced by these stimuli. This method has been successfully used to elucidate mechanisms underlying muscle thermogenic control at the level of the brain, sympathetic nervous system, and skeletal muscle. Provided are demonstrations of this success using predator odor (PO; ferret odor) as a contextual stimulus and injections of oxytocin (Oxt) as a pharmacological stimulus, where predator odor induces muscle thermogenesis, and Oxt suppresses muscle temperature. Thus, these datasets display the efficacy of this method in detecting rapid changes in muscle temperature.",1,15
1788,35967867,Changes of gut microbiota structure in rats infected with Toxoplasma gondii.,"Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection can cause intestinal inflammation in rodents and significantly alters the structure of gut microbiota. However, the effects of different T. gondii genotypes on the gut microbiota of rats remain unclear. In this study, acute and chronic T. gondii infection in Fischer 344 rats was induced artificially by intraperitoneal injection of tachyzoites PYS (Chinese 1 ToxoDB#9) and PRU (Type II). Fecal 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was employed to analyze the gut microbiota structure at different stages of infection, and to compare the effects of infection by two T. gondii genotypes. Our results suggested that the infection led to structural changes of gut microbiota in rats. At the acute infection stage, the microbiota diversity increased, while both diversity and abundance of beneficial bacteria decreased at the chronic infection stage. The differences of microbiota structure were caused by strains of different genotypes. However, the diversity changes were consistent. This study demonstrates that the gut microbiota plays an important role in T. gondii infection in rats. The data will improve our understanding of the association between T. gondii infection and gut microbiota in rodents.",1,16
2463,35966795,Dietary Supplementation With Tinospora cordifolia Improves Anxiety-Type Behavior and Cognitive Impairments in Middle-Aged Acyclic Female Rats.,"The midlife transition period in women marks the progressive flattening of neurological health along with increased adiposity, dyslipidemia, frailty, and inflammatory responses mainly attributed to the gradual decline in estrogen levels. Conflicting reports of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) necessitate the exploration of novel therapeutic interventions using bioactive natural products having the least toxicity and a holistic mode of action for the preservation of metabolic homeodynamics with aging in women. The present study was planned to investigate the effects of aging and/or a high-fat diet (HFD) on cognitive impairments and anxiety and further their management by dietary supplement with the Tinospora cordifolia stem powder (TCP). Acyclic female rats were included in this study as the model system of the perimenopause phase of women along with young 3-4 months old rats as controls. Rats were fed on with and without TCP supplemented normal chow or HFD for 12 weeks. Animals fed on a TCP supplemented normal chow showed consistent management of body weight over a 12-week regimen although their calorie intake was much higher in comparison to their age-matched controls. Post-regimen, neurobehavioral tests, such as novel object recognition and elevated plus maze, performed on these animals showed improvement in their learning and memory abilities as well as the anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, due to the presence of multiple components, TCP was observed to modulate the expression of key marker proteins to ameliorate neuroinflammation and apoptosis and promote cell survival and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions of the brain. These findings suggest that TCP supplementation in diet during the midlife transition period in women may be a potential interventional strategy for the management of menopause-associated anxiety and cognitive impairments and healthy aging.",1,17
1375,35969082,Assessment of Nerve Injury-induced Mechanical Hypersensitivity in Rats using an Orofacial Operant Pain Assay.,"Pain has sensory and affective components. Unlike traditional, reflex-based pain assays, operant pain assays can produce more clinically relevant results by addressing the cognitive and motivational aspects of pain in rodents. This paper presents a protocol for assessing mechanical hypersensitivity following chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerves (CCI-ION) in rats using an orofacial operant pain system. Before CCI-ION surgery, rats were trained in an orofacial pain assessment device (OPAD) to drink sweetened condensed milk while making facial contact with the metal spiked bars and lick-tube. In this assay, rats can choose between receiving milk as a positive reinforcer or escaping an aversive mechanical stimulus that is produced by a vertical row of small pyramid-shaped spikes on each side of the reward access hole. Following 2 weeks of training in the OPAD and before the CCI-ION surgery, baseline mechanical sensitivity data were recorded for 5 days for each rat during a 10 min testing session. During a session, the operant system automatically records the number of reward bottle activations (licks) and facial contacts, contact duration, and latency to the first lick, among other measures. Following baseline measurements, rats underwent either CCI-ION or sham surgery. In this protocol, mechanical hypersensitivity was quantified by measuring the number of licks, latency to the first lick, the number of contacts, and the ratio of licks to facial contacts (L/F). The data showed that CCI-ION resulted in a significant decrease in the number of licks and the L/F ratio and an increase in the latency to the first lick, indicating mechanical hypersensitivity. These data support the use of operant-based pain assays to assess mechanical pain sensitivity in preclinical pain research.",1,18
1522,35968364,Histopathological modeling of status epilepticus-induced brain damage based on in vivo diffusion tensor imaging in rats.,"Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have proved useful in the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the interpretation of imaging outcomes in terms of tissue pathology is still challenging. This study goes beyond the current interpretation of in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) by constructing multivariate models of quantitative tissue microstructure in status epilepticus (SE)-induced brain damage. We performed in vivo DTI and histology in rats at 79 days after SE and control animals. The analyses focused on the corpus callosum, hippocampal subfield CA3b, and layers V and VI of the parietal cortex. Comparison between control and SE rats indicated that a combination of microstructural tissue changes occurring after SE, such as cellularity, organization of myelinated axons, and/or morphology of astrocytes, affect DTI parameters. Subsequently, we constructed a multivariate regression model for explaining and predicting histological parameters based on DTI. The model revealed that DTI predicted well the organization of myelinated axons (cross-validated R = 0.876) and astrocyte processes (cross-validated R = 0.909) and possessed a predictive value for cell density (CD) (cross-validated R = 0.489). However, the morphology of astrocytes (cross-validated R > 0.05) was not well predicted. The inclusion of parameters from CA3b was necessary for modeling histopathology. Moreover, the multivariate DTI model explained better histological parameters than any univariate model. In conclusion, we demonstrate that combining several analytical and statistical tools can help interpret imaging outcomes to microstructural tissue changes, opening new avenues to improve the non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of brain tissue damage.",1,19
2102,35967416,Aspirin eugenol ester alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in rats while stabilizing serum metabolites levels.,"Aspirin eugenol ester (AEE) was a novel drug compound with aspirin and eugenol esterified. AEE had various pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic, anti-oxidative stress and so on. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effect of AEE on the acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. In vitro experiments evaluated the protective effect of AEE on the LPS-induced A549 cells. The tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured in the cell supernatant. The Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 8): control group, model group (LPS group), LPS + AEE group (AEE, 54 mg·kg-1), LPS + AEE group (AEE, 108 mg·kg-1), LPS + AEE group (AEE, 216 mg·kg-1). The lung wet-to-dry weight (W/D) ratio and immune organ index were calculated. WBCs were counted in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and total protein concentration was measured. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining of lung tissue was performed. Glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), macrophage mobility inhibitory factor (MIF), TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β activity were measured. The metabolomic analysis of rat serum was performed by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. From the results, compared with LPS group, AEE improved histopathological changes, reduced MDA, CRP, MPO, MDA, and MIF production, decreased WBC count and total protein content in BALF, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, immune organ index and lung wet-dry weight (W/D), increased antioxidant enzyme activity, in a dose-dependent manner. The results of serum metabolomic analysis showed that the LPS-induced ALI caused metabolic disorders and oxidative stress in rats, while AEE could ameliorate it to some extent. Therefore, AEE could alleviate LPS-induced ALI in rats by regulating abnormal inflammatory responses, slowing down oxidative stress, and modulating energy metabolism.",1,20
424,35979175,New use for old drug: Local delivery of puerarin facilitates critical-size defect repair in rats by promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis.,"Large bone defect repair is a challenging clinical problem due to limited self-repair ability. A well-designed bone filling product should possess the ability to induce tissue in-growth and facilitate neovascularization and new bone formation. Puerarin has been used in clinics for a long time, and recently it was found to be able to promote osteogenesis. This study aimed to investigate a puerarin-based drug/delivery combination implant for promoting large bone defect repair. Puerarin was incorporated into the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)/β-calcium phosphate (PLGA/TCP, PT) to form a porous PLGA/TCP/Puerarin (PTP) composite scaffold by low-temperature rapid prototyping technology. Its structural and degradation were analyzed in vitro. Then we employed a rat calvarial critical size defect model to assess the potency of the PTP scaffold. MC3T3-E1 cells and EA. hy 926 ​cells were used to investigate the underlying mechanism. PTP scaffold inherited all advantages of PT scaffold in structural, mechanical, and biodegradation, meanwhile puerarin stably and continuously released from PTP scaffold and lasted for 5 months in vitro. At 8 weeks after implantation, the PTP scaffold triggered new bone formation in the macro-pores of the scaffold and inside the scaffold accompanied by the degrading materials. The underlying mechanism revealed that the PTP scaffold induced vascular infiltration and recruit repair cells through stimulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) expressions to promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Puerarin-enriched porous PTP scaffold was a promising local delivery system with sustained release of puerarin for facilitating defect repair through getting synergistic angiogenic and osteogenic effects. The PTP scaffold presents a potential drug/device combination medical implant for large bone defect repair, which also provides a new and innovative application for the old drug puerarin.",1,21
1863,35967777,Polyphenol-rich oolong tea alleviates obesity and modulates gut microbiota in high-fat diet-fed mice.,"Obesity is a major public health issue worldwide. Oolong tea (OT), which is partially fermented from Camellia sinensis leaves, has proven health benefits and potential preventive applications in multiple studies. However, research on the role of OT in obesity prevention and potential mechanisms is still limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the modulatory effects of OT intervention on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and gut microbiota dysbiosis using an obese mouse model. Our results showed that 8-week OT supplementation with 93.94% polyphenols significantly decreased body weight gain, adipose tissue mass, and serum levels of triglyceride (2.60 mmol/L), cholesterol (5.49 mmol/L), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.61 mmol/L) in HFD-fed mice. Meanwhile, OT intervention was observed to improve fat accumulation, hepatic damage, glucose intolerance, and endotoxemia and alleviate inflammation by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory factors. OT also upregulated the expression of genes including Srebf1, Ppara, Lxra, Pgc1a, and Hsl and downregulated the expression of genes including Leptin, Il-6, and Il-1b. In addition, the gut dysbiosis characterized by decreased flora diversity and increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in obese mice was recovered by OT intervention. Certain differentially abundant microbes caused by HFD feeding, including Enterococcus, Intestinimonas, Blautia, and Bilophila, were also improved by OT treatment. This study demonstrated that OT, as a novel resource of dietary polyphenols, exhibited a protective effect on HFD-induced obesity and gut microbiota disorder.",1,22
2490,35966768,Transplantation of fecal microbiota from APP/PS1 mice and Alzheimer's disease patients enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress in the cerebral cortex of wild-type mice.,"The gut-brain axis is bidirectional and the imbalance of the gut microbiota usually coexists with brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulating evidence indicates that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a core lesion in AD and persistent ER stress promotes AD pathology and impairs cognition. However, whether the imbalance of the gut microbiota is involved in triggering the ER stress in the brain remains unknown. In the present study, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed with gut microbiota from AD patients and APP/PS1 mice, respectively, resulting in two mouse models with dysregulated gut microbiota. The ER stress marker protein levels in the cerebral cortex were assessed using western blotting. The composition of the gut microbiota was assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Excessive ER stress was induced in the cerebral cortex of mice after FMT. Elevated ER stress marker proteins (p-perk/perk, p-eIF2α/eIF2α) were observed, which were rescued by 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB). Notably, DMB is a compound that significantly attenuates serum trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite of the gut microbiota widely reported to affect cognition. The findings indicate that imbalance of the gut microbiota induces ER stress in the cerebral cortex, which may be mediated by TMAO.",1,23
2202,35967316,The anti-obesity effects of a water-soluble glucan from Grifola frondosa via the modulation of chronic inflammation.,"Polysaccharides from Grifola frondosa (G. frondosa) have anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, the major type, molecular weight, homogeneity and structure of a polysaccharide purified from G. frondosa (denoted GFPA) were determined. In high-fat diet (HFD)-treated mice, 8 weeks of GFPA administration efficiently decreased body weight and blood glucose concentration and counteracted hyperlipidemia. GFPA efficiently decreased adipocyte size and ameliorated inflammatory infiltration in the three types of white adipose tissue and alleviated steatosis, fat accumulation and inflammatory infiltration in the livers of HFD-fed mice. GFPA also decreased the concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and pro-inflammatory factors in the sera and livers of HFD-treated mice. Furthermore, GFPA was found to regulate lipid metabolism via the inhibition of ceramide levels in HFD-treated mice. GFPA exhibited strong anti-obesity effects via the modulation of chronic inflammation through Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa-B signaling, which supports the use of GFPA for the treatment of obesity.",1,24
1501,35968386,Modulation of entorhinal cortex-hippocampus connectivity and recognition memory following electroacupuncture on 3×Tg-AD model: Evidence from multimodal MRI and electrophysiological recordings.,"Memory loss and aberrant neuronal network activity are part of the earliest hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Electroacupuncture (EA) has been recognized as a cognitive stimulation for its effects on memory disorder, but whether different brain regions or neural circuits contribute to memory recovery in AD remains unknown. Here, we found that memory deficit was ameliorated in 3×Tg-AD mice with EA-treatment, as shown by the increased number of exploring and time spent in the novel object. In addition, reduced locomotor activity was observed in 3×Tg-AD mice, but no significant alteration was seen in the EA-treated mice. Based on the functional magnetic resonance imaging, the regional spontaneous activity alterations of 3×Tg-AD were mainly concentrated in the accumbens nucleus, auditory cortex, caudate putamen, entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus, insular cortex, subiculum, temporal cortex, visual cortex, and so on. While EA-treatment prevented the chaos of brain activity in parts of the above regions, such as the auditory cortex, EC, hippocampus, subiculum, and temporal cortex. And then we used the whole-cell voltage-clamp recording to reveal the neurotransmission in the hippocampus, and found that EA-treatment reversed the synaptic spontaneous release. Since the hippocampus receives most of the projections of the EC, the hippocampus-EC circuit is one of the neural circuits related to memory impairment. We further applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tracking and functional connectivity, and found that hypo-connected between the hippocampus and EC with EA-treatment. These data indicate that the hippocampus-EC connectivity is responsible for the recognition memory deficit in the AD mice with EA-treatment, and provide novel insight into potential therapies for memory loss in AD.",1,25
646,35976729,"Pronociceptive autoantibodies in the spinal cord mediate nociceptive sensitization, loss of function, and spontaneous pain in the lumbar disk puncture model of chronic back pain.","Previously, we observed that B cells and autoantibodies mediated chronic nociceptive sensitization in the mouse tibia fracture model of complex regional pain syndrome and that complex regional pain syndrome patient antibodies were pronociceptive in fracture mice lacking mature B cells and antibodies (muMT). The current study used a lumbar spinal disk puncture (DP) model of low back pain in wild-type (WT) and muMT mice to evaluate pronociceptive adaptive immune responses. Spinal disks and cords were collected 3 weeks after DP for polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analyses. Wild-type DP mice developed 24 weeks of hindpaw mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia, grip weakness, and a conditioned place preference response indicative of spontaneous pain, but pain responses were attenuated or absent in muMT DP mice. Spinal cord expression of inflammatory cytokines, immune cell markers, and complement components were increased in WT DP mice and in muMT DP mice. Dorsal horn immunostaining in WT DP mice demonstrated glial activation and increased complement 5a receptor expressionin spinal neurons. Serum collected from WT DP mice and injected into muMT DP mice caused nociceptive sensitization, as did intrathecal injection of IgM collected from WT DP mice, and IgM immune complexes were observed in lumbar spinal disks and cord of WT DP mice. Serum from WT tibia fracture mice was not pronociceptive in muMT DP mice and vice versa, evidence that each type of tissue trauma chronically generates its own unique antibodies and targeted antigens. These data further support the pronociceptive autoimmunity hypothesis for the transition from tissue injury to chronic musculoskeletal pain state.",1,26
1809,35967846,Therapeutic effect of fecal microbiota transplantation on chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depression.,"Depression is a complex neuropsychiatric disease with extensive morbidity. Its pathogenesis remains unclear, and it is associated with extremely low rates of cure and complete remission. It is vital to study the pathogenesis of depression to develop effective treatments. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of depression in rats. Thirty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to model depression, and CUMS+FMT. For the CUMS and CUMS+FMT groups, after CUMS intervention (four weeks), the rats were given normal saline or FMT (once/week for three weeks), respectively. Behavior, colonic motility, 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, and untargeted metabolomics on fecal samples were compared between the three rat groups. The following markers were analyzed: 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus; glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the serum; and GLP-1, GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) levels in colonic tissues. FMT improved symptoms of depression and colonic motility in rats exposed to CUMS. The expression levels of 5-HT, GABA, BDNF, and other biochemical indices, significantly differed among the three groups. Meanwhile, the intestinal microbiota in the CUMS+FMT group was more similar to that of the control group with a total of 13 different fecal metabolites. FMT exerted antidepressant effects on CUMS-induced depression in rats, and the mechanism involved various neurotransmitters, inflammatory factors, neurotrophic factors, and glucagon-like peptides.",1,27
1523,35968363,Microglial re-modeling contributes to recovery from ischemic injury of rat brain: A study using a cytokine mixture containing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3.,"Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality and permanent disability. Chronic stroke lesions increase gradually due to the secondary neuroinflammation that occurs following acute ischemic neuronal degeneration. In this study, the ameliorating effect of a cytokine mixture consisting of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-3 was evaluated on ischemic brain injury using a rat stroke model prepared by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). The mixture reduced infarct volume and ameliorated ischemia-induced motor and cognitive dysfunctions. Sorted microglia cells from the ischemic hemisphere of rats administered the mixture showed reduced mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β at 3 days post-reperfusion. On flow cytometric analysis, the expression of CD86, a marker of pro-inflammatory type microglia, was suppressed, and the expression of CD163, a marker of tissue-repairing type microglia, was increased by the cytokine treatment. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry data showed that the cytokines increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in neurons in the ischemic lesion. Thus, the present study demonstrated that cytokine treatment markedly suppressed neurodegeneration during the chronic phase in the rat stroke model. The neuroprotective effects may be mediated by phenotypic changes of microglia that presumably lead to increased expression of Bcl-xL in ischemic lesions, while enhancing neuronal survival.",1,28
2217,35967301,A Study on the Radiosensitivity of Radiation-Induced Lung Injury at the Acute Phase Based on Single-Cell Transcriptomics.,"Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is the most common complication associated with chest tumors, such as lung and breast cancers, after radiotherapy; however, the pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing has laid the foundation for studying RILI at the cellular microenvironmental level. This study focused on changes during the acute pneumonitis stage of RILI at the cellular microenvironmental level and investigated the interactions between different cell types. An acute RILI model in mice and a single-cell transcriptional library were established. Intercellular communication networks were constructed to study the heterogeneity and intercellular interactions among different cell types. A single-cell transcriptome map was established in a mouse model of acute lung injury. In total, 18,500 single-cell transcripts were generated, and 10 major cell types were identified. The heterogeneity and radiosensitivity of each cell type or subtype in the lung tissues during the acute stage were revealed. It was found that immune cells had higher radiosensitivity than stromal cells. Immune cells were highly heterogeneous in terms of radiosensitivity, while some immune cells had the characteristics of radiation resistance. Two groups of radiation-induced Cd8+Mki67+ T cells and Cd4+Cxcr6+ helper T cells were identified. The presence of these cells was verified using immunofluorescence. The ligand-receptor interactions were analyzed by constructing intercellular communication networks. These explained the origins of the cells and revealed that they had been recruited from endothelial cells to the inflammatory site. This study revealed the heterogeneity of in vivo radiosensitivity of different cell types in the lung at the initial stage post irradiation.",1,29
1869,35967771,Lactobacillus plantarum-derived postbiotics prevent Salmonella-induced neurological dysfunctions by modulating gut-brain axis in mice.,"Postbiotics are the inactive bacteria and/or metabolites of beneficial microbes which have been recently found to be as effective as their live probiotic. This study aimed to evaluate the benefits of Lactobacillus plantarum (LP)-derived postbiotics on ameliorating Salmonella-induced neurological dysfunctions. Mice were pretreated with LP postbiotics (heat-killed bacteria or the metabolites) or active bacteria, and then challenged with Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (ST). Results showed that LP postbiotics, particularly the metabolites, effectively prevented ST infection in mice, as evidenced by the inhibited weight loss, bacterial translocation, and tissue damages. The LP postbiotics markedly suppressed brain injuries and neuroinflammation (the decreased interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, and the increased IL-4 and IL-10). Behavior tests indicated that LP postbiotics, especially the metabolites, protected mice from ST-induced anxiety and depressive-like behaviors and cognitive impairment. A significant modulation of neuroactive molecules (5-hydroxytryptamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dopamine, acetylcholine, and neuropeptide Y) was also found by LP postbiotic pretreatment. Microbiome analysis revealed that LP postbiotics optimized the cecal microbial composition by increasing Helicobacter, Lactobacillus and Dubosiella, and decreasing Mucispirillum, norank_f_Oscillospiraceae, and Eubacterium_siraeum_group. Moreover, LP postbiotics inhibited the reduction of short-chain fatty acids caused by ST infection. Pearson's correlation assays further confirmed the strong relationship of LP postbiotics-mediated benefits and gut microbiota. This study highlights the effectiveness of postbiotics and provide a promising strategy for preventing infection-induced brain disorders by targeting gut-brain axis.",1,30
821,35974950,"Effect of Cassia fistula L. aqueous extract in maternal reproductive outcome, some serum indices and fetal anomaly frequency in rat.","Cassia fistula was used traditionally as laxative in pregnant women. Nevertheless, its fetal and maternal effects in pregnancy have not been studied yet. Oral (Lethal Dose, 50%) LD50 was determined in mice. In addition, a control group, pregnant rats in other 5 experimental groups (n=12) received orally C. fistula aqueous extract (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg), tween80 (10%) and distilled water during pregnancy up to the delivery (21-23 days). Some serum indices were evaluated in maternal blood samples after delivery. Histopathologic and histomorphometric evaluations were performed on the selected slices of newborn rats. Anthraquinone‎ content of the aqueous extract was 0.34% w/w. Oral LD50 was obtained more than 5000mg/kg. No abortions and newborn anomalies were observed in groups. The height and weight of the offspring were significantly reduced by the administration of 500, and 2000 mg/kg of extract compared to control. There was no significant change in maternal blood urea and creatinine. Higher concentration (2000mg/kg) led to ALT elevation. ALS levels decreased dose-dependency in treatment groups comparing to control. Histopathological findings showed significant lung vascular congestion, and hypertrophy of heart in group tween80, and significant hepatic parenchymal inflammation in tween80 and 2000mg/kg and 1000mg/kg groups. In all tissues of all groups, malpighian body area and bowman's capsule space significantly increased compared to the control group. It seems C. fistula extract is safe in pregnancy. Because of confounding role of tween80 in histopathological finding, more research is necessary.",1,31
34,35984760,ACUTE AND SUSTAINED ALTERATIONS TO THE BONE MARROW IMMUNE MICROENVIRONMENT FOLLOWING POLYMICROBIAL INFECTION.,"Sepsis is a highly prevalent cause of death in intensive care units. Characterized by severe immune cell derangements, sepsis is often associated with multiorgan dysfunction. For many sepsis survivors, these deficits can persist long after clinical resolution of the underlying infection. Although many studies report on the impact of sepsis on individual immune cell subtypes, a comprehensive analysis of sepsis-induced alterations within and across the immune cell landscape is lacking. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to assess sepsis-associated transcriptional changes in immune cells isolated from bone marrow at single-cell resolution. We used a high-survival fecal-induced peritonitis sepsis model using Friend leukemia virus B mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing classified 3402 single cells from control subjects into 14 clusters representing long-term hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), short-term HSC, basophil, dendritic cell, eosinophil, erythroblast, erythrocyte, macrophage, neutrophil, natural killer cell, plasma cell, plasmacytoid dendritic cell, pre-B cell, and T memory cell lineages. One day following experimentally induced sepsis, cell type compositions shifted significantly and included notable decreases in HSC and myeloid cell abundance. In addition to proportional cell composition changes, acute sepsis induced significant transcriptional alterations in most immune cell types analyzed-changes that failed to completely resolve 1 month after sepsis. Taken together, we report widespread and persistent transcriptional changes in diverse immune cells in response to polymicrobial infection. This study will serve as a valuable resource for future work investigating acute and/or long-term sepsis-associated immune cell derangements.",1,32
637,35977054,Hylocereus undatus flower extract suppresses OVA-induced allergic asthma in BALb/c mice by reducing airway inflammation and modulating gut microbiota.,"Asthma is a chronic allergic respiratory disease with limited treatment options. Emerging findings indicate an important interaction between the gut microbiota and the lungs, and that the development of asthma causes changes in the gut environment. Hylocereus undatus flower (HUF) is a traditional Chinese medicine used in the treatment of pulmonary and intestinal diseases. Our previous studies have demonstrated significant anti-asthmatic and anti-inflammatory activity, but the exact mechanism has not been elucidated. In the current study, we validated the potential therapeutic asthma properties of HUF in vivo using an ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma mouse model. We found that HUF treatment significantly reduced the key features of allergic asthma, including an elevated respiratory rate, inflammatory cell accumulation, airway inflammation, and the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules. Histological analysis of mouse lungs showed that HUF attenuated lung inflammatory cell infiltration. Periodic acid-Schiff staining confirmed the reduced mucus secretion in lung mucosa, and Masson's staining confirmed the reduced collagen deposition in the lungs after HUF treatment. Western blot and immunohistochemistry confirmed that HUF increased lung SIRT1 and reduced p38MAPK, NF-κBp65, and caspase-1 proteins. 16 S rDNA sequencing showed that HUF improved the endostasis of the disrupted gut microbiota composition in asthmatic mice. Surprisingly, an inflammatory response was found in the gut of asthmatic mice, along with alterations in inflammation-associated SIRT1 and caspase-1 proteins, and HUF was able to ameliorate these lesions. In conclusion, these findings suggest that HUF may be a new drug candidate for the treatment of allergic asthma.",1,33
35,35984759,TRAUMA-DERIVED EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES ARE SUFFICIENT TO INDUCE ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION AND COAGULOPATHY.,"Although a number of studies have demonstrated increased release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and changes in their origin differentials after trauma, the biologic significance of EVs is not well understood. We hypothesized that EVs released after trauma/hemorrhagic shock (HS) contribute to endotheliopathy and coagulopathy. To test this hypothesis, adoptive transfer experiments were performed to determine whether EVs derived from severely injured patients in shock were sufficient to induce endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathy. Methods: Total EVs were enriched from plasma of severely injured trauma/HS patients or minimally injured patients by ultracentrifugation and characterized for size and numbers. Under isoflurane anesthesia, noninjured naive C57BL/6J mice were administered EVs at varying concentrations and compared with mice receiving equal volume vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) or to mice receiving EVs from minimally injured patients. Thirty minutes after injection, mice were sacrificed, and blood was collected for thrombin generation (thrombin-antithrombin, thrombin-antithrombin complex [TAT] assay) and syndecan-1 by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Lungs were harvested for examination of histopathologic injury and costained with von Willebrand factor and fibrin to identify intravascular coagulation. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid was aspirated from lungs for protein measurement as an indicator of the endothelial permeability. Data are presented as mean ± SD, P < 0.05 was considered significant, and t test was used. Results: An initial proof-of-concept experiment was performed in naive mice receiving EVs purified from severely injured trauma/HS patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS], 34 ± 7) at different concentrations (5 × 106 to 3.1 × 109/100 μL/mouse) and compared with PBS (control) mice. Neither TAT nor syndecan-1 levels were significantly different between groups at 30 minutes after EV infusion. However, lung vascular permeability and histopathologic injury were significantly higher in the EV group, and lung tissues demonstrated intravascular fibrin deposition. Based on these data, EVs from severely injured trauma/HS patients (ISS, 32 ± 6) or EVs from minimally injured patients (ISS, 8 ± 3) were administered to naive mice at higher concentrations (1 × 109 to 1 × 1010 EV/100 μL/mouse). Compared with mice receiving EVs from minimally injured patients, plasma TAT and syndecan-1 levels were significantly higher in the trauma/HS EV group. Similarly, bronchial alveolar lavage protein and lung histopathologic injury were higher in the trauma/HS EV group, and lung tissues demonstrated enhanced intravascular fibrin deposition. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that trauma/HS results in the systemic release of EVs, which are capable of inducing endotheliopathy as demonstrated by elevated syndecan-1 and increased permeability and coagulopathy as demonstrated by increased TAT and intravascular fibrin deposition. Targeting trauma-induced EVs may represent a novel therapeutic strategy.",1,34
2219,35967299,Single-cell RNA-Seq reveals changes in immune landscape in post-traumatic osteoarthritis.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease, affecting over 300 million people world-wide. Accumulating evidence attests to the important roles of the immune system in OA pathogenesis. Understanding the role of various immune cells in joint degeneration or joint repair after injury is vital for improving therapeutic strategies for treating OA. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) develops in ~50% of individuals who have experienced an articular trauma like an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Here, using the high resolution of single-cell RNA sequencing, we delineated the temporal dynamics of immune cell accumulation in the mouse knee joint after ACL rupture. Our study identified multiple immune cell types in the joint including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, B cells, T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells. Monocytes and macrophage populations showed the most dramatic changes after injury. Further characterization of monocytes and macrophages reveled 9 major subtypes with unique transcriptomics signatures, including a tissue resident Lyve1hiFolr2hi macrophage population and Trem2hiFcrls+ recruited macrophages, both showing enrichment for phagocytic genes and growth factors such as Igf1, Pdgfa and Pdgfc. We also identified several genes induced or repressed after ACL injury in a cell type-specific manner. This study provides new insight into PTOA-associated changes in the immune microenvironment and highlights macrophage subtypes that may play a role in joint repair after injury.",1,35
2061,35967466,Intestine epithelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles alleviate inflammation induced by Clostridioides difficile TcdB through the activity of TGF-β1.,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been primarily associated with the toxin B (TcdB), one of the three known protein toxins secreted by C. difficile, which can activate the intestinal immune system and lead to pathological damage. Even though the biological functions of intestine epithelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles (I-Evs) have been well documented, the role of I-Evs in the process of CDI is still unknown. The protective effect of I-Evs against C. difficile TcdB was investigated both in cultured murine colon carcinoma MC38 cells and a mouse model used in this study. Mouse I-Evs with mean diameter ranging from 100 to 200 nm and a density of 1.09-1.17 g/mL were obtained and confirmed containing the Ev-associated specific surface markers CD63 and TSG101 as well as high level of TGF-β1. In MC38 cells, I-Evs were able to decrease the gene expression of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-22 induced by C. difficile TcdB, but to increase both the gene expression and protein levels of TGF-β1. I-Evs treatment via intraperitoneal administration alleviates C. difficile TcdB-induced local colon inflammation in mice and increased their survival rate from 50% up to 80%. Furthermore, I-Evs induced an increase in the proportion of CD4+Foxp3+Tregs in vitro and in vivo through a TGF-β1-dependent mechanism by activating the TGF-β1 pathway and prompting phosphorylation of the downstream proteins Smad 2/3. For the first time, our study demonstrated that I-Evs originated from intestine epithelial cells can alleviate inflammation induced by C. difficile TcdB both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, I-Evs might be potentially a novel endogenous candidate for effective treatment of CDI.",1,36
2146,35967372,Glycyrrhetinic acid regulates impaired macrophage autophagic flux in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.,"Macrophages are involved in hepatocyte steatosis and necroinflammation and play an important role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Impaired autophagy function (decreased autophagy or blocked autophagic flow) leads to cell damage and death and promotes NAFLD progression. The experimental and clinical research of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) in the treatment of NAFLD has gradually attracted attention with clear pharmacological activities such as immune regulation, antiviral, antitumor, antioxidant, liver protection, and anti-inflammatory. However, the effects of GA on the STAT3-HIF-1α pathway and autophagy in macrophages are still unclear, and its mechanism of action in the treatment of NAFLD remains to be further elucidated. We constructed a NAFLD mouse model through a high-fat and high-sugar diet to investigate the therapeutic effects of GA. The results showed that GA reduced weight, improved the pathological changes and hepatic lipid deposition of liver, and abnormally elevated the levels of serum biochemical (AST, ALT, TG, T-CHO, LDL-C, and HDL-C) and inflammatory indexes (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-α) in NAFLD mice. Further examination revealed that GA ameliorates excessive hepatic macrophage infiltration and hepatocyte apoptosis. The results of the cell experiments further elaborated that GA modulated the PA-induced macrophage STAT3-HIF-1α pathway and ameliorated impaired autophagic flux (blockade of autophagosome-lysosome fusion) and overactivation of inflammation. Excessive hepatocyte apoptosis caused by the uncontrolled release of inflammatory cytokines was also suppressed by GA. This study demonstrated that GA could regulate the STAT3-HIF-1α pathway of macrophages, ameliorate the impaired autophagy flux, and reduce the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines to improve the excessive apoptosis of liver cells, thus playing a therapeutic role on NAFLD.",1,37
1379,35969074,Investigating the Alleviating Effects of Bacillus cereus Administration on Colitis through Gut Microbiota Modulation.,"Gut microbiota dysbiosis is thought to exert a role in the progression of colitis. However, the precise standards for probiotic administration in alleviating colitis remain undefined. Most analysis methods rely on limited diversity and abundance of gut microorganisms. Therefore, observational studies cannot establish causation. In this study, we applied antibiotic-induced pseudo-germ-free mice to investigate the role of gut microbiota in regulating the probiotic effects of Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. This process allows for evaluating the bidirectional regulating effect of B. cereus supplementation on health and provides stable and reproducible results. Here, the detailed protocols for B. cereus cultivation, gavage operation, stool collection, and antibiotic clearance treatment on colitis mice are provided. The optimization methods are also applicable for other chronic inflammatory-associated disorders. The results showed that B. cereus administration decreased body weight loss, colon length shortening, disease activity index, and histopathological scores. However, treatment with antibiotics suppressed the positive effect of B. cereus on colitis. These results indicate that gut microbiota are needed for the alleviating effects of B. cereus on colitis. Therefore, exploring the beneficial effects of probiotics in this research is a promising approach for developing novel treatment strategies for alleviating the symptoms of chronic inflammatory-associated disorders.",1,38
453,35978937,FOSL1 knockdown ameliorates DSS-induced inflammation and barrier damage in ulcerative colitis via MMP13 downregulation.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon. Fos-related antigen 1 is highly expressed in mild UC and affects the maintenance and delayed recurrence of inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore the present study aimed to investigate the role of Fos-like antigen-1 (FOSL1) in UC. Use of the JASPAR database predicted the possible interaction of FOSL1 and the MMP13 promoter. FOSL1 and MMP13 mRNA and protein expression levels in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced HT29 cells and colon tissues of a UC mice model were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. MMP13 promoter activity was determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay, the relationship between FOSL1 and MMP13 promoter was determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation, inflammatory factor levels were quantified using ELISA, cell monolayer permeability analysis was performed using transepithelial electrical resistance measurements and tight junction protein expression levels were determined by western blotting. After constructing a UC mice model, mice colonic injury was determined with the quantification of colon length, H&E staining and disease activity index. The results demonstrated that FOSL1 and MMP13 were upregulated in DSS-induced HT29 cells and tissues. FOSL1 was also determined to be bound to the MMP13 promoter region and was demonstrated to upregulate MMP13 expression levels. Furthermore, FOSL1 knockdown inhibited DSS-induced inflammation and barrier damage in HT29 cells via MMP13 downregulation. FOSL1 knockdown also ameliorated colonic injury, inflammation and barrier damage in the tissues of the UC mice model via MMP13 downregulation. Overall, FOSL1 knockdown was demonstrated to potentially ameliorate DSS-induced inflammatory injury and protect the intestinal barrier integrity in the UC mice model via MMP13 downregulation.",1,39
571,35978516,Targeting EZH2 prevents the occurrence and mitigates the development of Sjögren's syndrome in mice.,"We analyzed RNA-SEQ data and found that EZH2 gene expression in salivary glands (SGs) of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) patients was up-regulated and correlated with pathological injury. In this study, we sought to determine if inhibiting EZH2 would ameliorate SS-like disease in NOD/Ltj (NOD) mice. We analyzed RNA-SEQ data of SGs of patients with SS from data obtained from the GEO database to explore the correlation between EZH2 gene expression and the progression of SS. Inhibition of EZH2 in the NOD mice was achieved by intraperitoneal administration of GSK343 using both a preventative and a therapeutic model. The effects of GSK343 on SGs secretion and pathological damage, as well as the levels and functions of T cells, B cells, Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and other immune cells were evaluated. The expression levels of the gene encoding EZH2 in the SGs of SS patients were significantly higher than the non-SS sicca patients, and the expression levels were positively correlated with the severity of the SGs pathological damage. GSK343 treatment significantly increased the salivary flow rate and pathological damage of the SGs in the NOD mice compared to the control mice. In addition, GSK343 significantly inhibited the number and pro-inflammatory-factor secretion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and inhibited the increase in the Th1/Th2 cell ratio caused by SS. RNA-SEQ data also showed that EZH2 inhibited several inflammatory pathways during the pathogenesis of SS. EZH2 expression was up-regulated in the submandibular gland tissue of SS patients.Inhibition of EZH2 alleviated SS-like disease in NOD mice, suggesting that EZH2 might be a potential target for the clinical treatment of SS.",1,40
2161,35967357,Promoting intestinal IgA production in mice by oral administration with anthocyanins.,"While recent years have witnessed ever-growing evidence on the prebiotic attributes of anthocyanins for treatment of microbiota-associated diseases, the complex interplay between anthocyanin uptake, the gut microbiota, and the intestinal mucosal immune system remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effects of bilberry anthocyanins on the gut microbiota composition and metabolism, and the intestinal mucosal immune system of mice. We observed an increased proportion of IgA-producing plasma cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and an enhanced secretion of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and antimicrobial peptides in the small intestine. Small intestine transcriptome analysis further suggested that anthocyanins influenced IgA production. We found that oral administration of anthocyanins altered the gut microbiota through maintaining the anaerobic intestinal environment, promoting the secretion of sIgA and antimicrobial peptides, and downregulating cell motility and mobile genetic elements of commensal bacteria. These observations suggest that the oral administration of anthocyanins helps in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and thus it may find applications in immunotherapy and related fields.",1,41
2165,35967353,Susceptibility to Infections During Acute Liver Injury Depends on Transient Disruption of Liver Macrophage Niche.,"Kupffer cells are the primary liver resident immune cell responsible for the liver firewall function, including clearance of bacterial infection from the circulation, as they are strategically positioned inside the liver sinusoid with intimate contact with the blood. Disruption in the tissue-resident macrophage niche, such as in Kupffer cells, can lead to a window of susceptibility to systemic infections, which represents a significant cause of mortality in patients with acetaminophen (APAP) overdose-induced acute liver injury (ALI). However, how Kupffer cell niche disruption increases susceptibility to systemic infections in ALI is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of ALI induced by APAP overdose, we found that Kupffer cells upregulated the apoptotic cell death program and were markedly reduced in the necrotic areas during the early stages of ALI, opening the niche for the infiltration of neutrophils and monocyte subsets. In addition, during the resolution phase of ALI, the remaining tissue macrophages with a Kupffer cell morphology were observed forming replicating cell clusters closer to necrotic areas devoid of Kupffer cells. Interestingly, mice with APAP-induced liver injury were still susceptible to infections despite the dual cellular input of circulating monocytes and proliferation of remaining Kupffer cells in the damaged liver. Therapy with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) was shown to be effective in occupying the niche devoid of Kupffer cells following APAP-induced ALI. The rapid BMDM migration to the liver and their positioning within necrotic areas enhanced the healing of the tissue and restored the liver firewall function after BMDM therapy. Therefore, we showed that disruption in the Kupffer cell niche and its impaired function during acute liver injury are key factors for the susceptibility to systemic bacterial infections. In addition, modulation of the liver macrophage niche was shown to be a promising therapeutic strategy for liver injuries that reduce the Kupffer cell number and compromise the organ function.",1,42
2173,35967345,microRNA-144/451 decreases dendritic cell bioactivity via targeting interferon-regulatory factor 5 to limit DSS-induced colitis.,"The microRNAs miR-144/451 are highly conserved miRNA that is strongly induced during erythropoiesis. Despite the biological functions of miR-144/451 have been extensively studied in erythropoiesis and tumorigenesis, few studies have been conducted in immune responses. In this study, we showed that miR-144/451-/- DCs exhibit increased activation. Mechanistically, the miR-144 directly targets the 3`-UTR of IRF5 and represses the expression of IRF5 in DCs. Ectopic expression of miR-144/451 by lentiviruses downregulates the levels of IRF5 and suppresses DCs function. In addition, knockdown of IRF5 by shRNA significantly inhibits activities of the miR-144/451-/- DCs. Expression of miR144/451 was decreased in DCs from both patients with IBD and mice with DSS-colitis compared with controls. Human PBMC derived DCs were downregulated expression of miR144/451 after LPS stimulation. In the DSS-induced colitis mice model, we showed that ablation of the miR-144/451 gene causes severe colitis, and their DCs from both periphery and MLN expressed higher co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines than wild-type mice. In addition, DCs isolated from miR-144/451-/- mice transfusion exacerbates mice colitis. In the bone marrow transplanted chimeric mice model, we show that miR-144/451-/- bone marrow transplantation deteriorated DSS-induced colitis. At last, we treat the mice with miR-144/451 delivered by chitosan nanoparticles revealing protective effects in DSS-induced colitis mice. Thus, our results reveal a novel miR144/451-IRF5 pathway in DCs that protects experimental colitis. The manipulation of miR-144/451 expression and DCs activation in IBD patients may be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",1,43
234,35982786,Acoustic camera system for measuring ultrasound communication in mice.,"To investigate biological mechanisms underlying social behaviors and their deficits, social communication via ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in mice has received considerable attention as a powerful experimental model. The advances in sound localization technology have facilitated the analysis of vocal interactions between multiple mice. However, existing sound localization systems are built around distributed-microphone arrays, which require a special recording arena and long processing time. Here, we report a novel acoustic camera system, USVCAM, which enables simpler and faster USV localization and assignment. The system comprises recently developed USV segmentation algorithms with a modification for overlapping vocalizations that results in high accuracy. Using USVCAM, we analyzed USV communications in a conventional home cage, and demonstrated novel vocal interactions in female ICR mice under a resident-intruder paradigm. The extended applicability and usability of USVCAM may facilitate future studies investigating typical and atypical vocal communication and social behaviors, as well as the underlying mechanisms.",1,44
582,35978505,Histamine H3R antagonist counteracts the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in Lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation.,"Adult neurogenesis in hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) is associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases such as aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Overactivation of microglia induced neuroinflammation is well acknowledged to contribute to the impaired neurogenesis in pathologies of these diseases and then leading to cognitive dysfunction. Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) is a presynaptic autoreceptor regulating histamine release via negative feedback way. Recently, studies show that H3R are highly expressed not only in neurons but also in microglia to modulate inflammatory response. However, whether inhibition of H3R is responsible for the neurogenesis and cognition in chronic neuroinflammation induced injury and the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we found that inhibition of H3R by thioperamide reduced the microglia activity and promoted a phenotypical switch from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 in microglia, and ultimately attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation in mice. Additionally, thioperamide rescued the neuroinflammation induced impairments of neurogenesis and cognitive function. Mechanically, the neuroprotection of thioperamide was involved in histamine dependent H2 receptor (H2R) activation, because cimetidine, an H2R antagonist but not pyrilamine, an H1R antagonist reversed the above effects of thioperamide. Moreover, thioperamide activated the H2R downstream phosphorylated protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway but inhibited nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling. Activation of CREB by thioperamide promoted interaction of CREB-CREB Binding Protein (CBP) to increase anti-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release but inhibited NF-κB-CBP interaction to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-1β, Interleukin-6 and Tumor necrosis factor α) release. H89, an inhibitor of PKA/CREB signaling, abolished effects of thioperamide on neuroinflammation and neurogenesis. Taken together, these results suggested under LPS induced neuroinflammation, the H3R antagonist thioperamide inhibited microglia activity and inflammatory response, and ameliorated impairment of neurogenesis and cognitive dysfunction via enhancing histamine release. Histamine activated H2R and reinforced CREB-CBP interaction but weakened NF-κB-CBP interaction to exert anti-inflammatory effects. This study uncovered a novel histamine dependent mechanism behind the therapeutic effect of thioperamide on neuroinflammation.",1,45
2334,35967043,Beneficial Effects of lncRNA-UC.360+ shRNA on Diabetic Cardiac Sympathetic Damage via NLRP3 Inflammasome-Induced Pyroptosis in Stellate Ganglion.,"Hyperglycemia is one of the common symptoms of diabetes, and it produces excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study investigated whether the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) UC.360+ is involved in diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy (DCAN) mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome-induced pyroptosis in the stellate ganglion (SG). Using a rat type 2 diabetes model, we found that lncRNA UC.360+ short hairpin RNA (shRNA) ameliorated the dyslipidaemia of type 2 diabetic rats and reduced serum adrenaline and ROS production in SG under hyperglycemia. In addition, UC.360+ shRNA also reduced the expression of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-18 in the SG of diabetic rats and inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Therefore, lncRNA-UC.360+ shRNA may modulate the NLRP3 inflammasome/inflammatory pathway in the SG, which in turn alleviates diabetic heart sympathetic nerve damage.",1,46
579,35978508,Sirt6 inhibits vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis by regulation of the Lin28b/let-7 pathway in atherosclerosis.,"Our previous study showed that Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) plays an important role in the regulation of vascular endothelial cell inflammation. Recently, studies have reported that the RNA binding protein Lin28b directly regulates the let-7 microRNA (miRNA), which participates in the process of atherosclerosis (AS) by regulating inflammation. Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is accompanied by inflammation and is critical for AS. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the role of Sirt6 and Lin28b in vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis and the related mechanism. The present study showed that Lin28b expression was upregulated in the aortic intima and aorta of apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 or 12 weeks. Then, in vitro study found Lin28b was involved in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis, as indicated by the increased number of PI-positive cells and gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, as well as the increased release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and interleukin (IL)-1β. Further studies demonstrated that TNF-α significantly decreased the expression of let-7, while Lin28b knockdown significantly increased the expression of let-7a, let-7d and let-7g. In addition, Sirt6 overexpression decreased Lin28b expression. Moreover, Sirt6 overexpression suppressed pyroptosis by decreasing the number of PI-positive cells and GSDMD cleavage, as well as by decreasing the release of LDH and IL-1β in TNF-α-induced vascular endothelial cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that Sirt6 directly interacted with and deacetylated Lin28b. Taken together, these findings indicate that Sirt6 inhibits vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis by negatively regulating the Lin28b/let-7 pathway in AS.",1,47
224,35982796,Histone deacetylase-2 controls IL-1β production through the regulation of NLRP3 expression and activation in tuberculosis infection.,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are critical immune regulators. However, their roles in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production remain unclear. By screening 11 zinc-dependent HDACs with chemical inhibitors, we found that HDAC1 inhibitor, 4-(dimethylamino)-N-[6-(hydroxyamino)-6-oxohexyl]-benzamide (DHOB), enhanced IL-1β production by macrophage and dendritic cells upon TLR4 stimulation or Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection through IL-1β maturation via elevated NLRP3 expression, increased cleaved caspase-1, and enhanced ASC oligomerization. DHOB rescued defective IL-1β production by dendritic cells infected with M. tuberculosis with ESAT-6 deletion, a virulence factor shown to activate NLRP3 inflammasome. DHOB increased IL-1β production and NLRP3 expression in a tuberculosis mouse model. Although DHOB inhibited HDAC activities of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 by direct binding, knockdown of HDAC2, but not HDAC1, increased IL-1β production and NLRP3 expression in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages. These data suggest that HDAC2, but not HDAC1, controls IL-1β production through NLRP3 inflammasome activation, a mechanism with a significance in chronic inflammatory diseases including tuberculosis.",1,48
588,35978498,High glucose promotes IL-17A-induced gene expression through histone acetylation in retinal pigment epithelium cells.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) that can cause visual impairment and blindness. Inflammation plays a critical role in its development and progression. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells secrete inflammatory factors that modulate ocular immune response. However, it is unclear how diabetes regulates the expression of inflammatory factors in RPE cells. In this study, streptozocin (STZ) was applied to induce diabetic alterations in the retinas of mice, and RPE cells were further purified to profile gene expressions. The IL-17 signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched and the only enriched inflammation pathway in the profile via KEGG analysis. IL-17A induced the expression of targeted genes, which was enhanced by high glucose levels, suggesting a synergistic effect of IL-17A and high glucose. High glucose did not affect the mRNA stability of IL-17A-targeted genes or the activity of IL-17A signaling transduction, but it boosted the histone acetylation on IL-17A-targeted genes. Curcumin, an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase, abolished high glucose-enhanced histone acetylation of IL-17A-targeted genes and blocked the promotion of high glucose levels on gene expression induced by IL-17A. In conclusion, high glucose levels promote IL-17A-induced gene expression via histone acetylation in RPE cells.",1,49
2186,35967332,MDA5 signaling induces type 1 IFN- and IL-1-dependent lung vascular permeability which protects mice from opportunistic fungal infection.,"Lungs balance threat from primary viral infection, secondary infection, and inflammatory damage. Severe pulmonary inflammation induces vascular permeability, edema, and organ dysfunction. We previously demonstrated that poly(I:C) (pICLC) induced type 1 interferon (t1IFN) protected mice from Cryptococcus gattii (Cg) via local iron restriction. Here we show pICLC increased serum protein and intravenously injected FITC-dextran in the lung airspace suggesting pICLC induces vascular permeability. Interestingly, pICLC induced a pro-inflammatory signature with significant expression of IL-1 and IL-6 which depended on MDA5 and t1IFN. Vascular permeability depended on MDA5, t1IFN, IL-1, and IL-6. T1IFN also induced MDA5 and other MDA5 signaling components suggesting that positive feedback contributes to t1IFN dependent expression of the pro-inflammatory signature. Vascular permeability, induced by pICLC or another compound, inhibited Cg by limiting iron. These data suggest that pICLC induces t1IFN which potentiates pICLC-MDA5 signaling increasing IL-1 and IL-6 resulting in leakage of antimicrobial serum factors into lung airspace. Thus, induced vascular permeability may act as an innate defense mechanism against opportunistic fungal infection, such as cryptococcosis, and may be exploited as a host-directed therapeutic target.",1,50
1803,35967852,Antibiotic-Induced Primary Biles Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Endoribonuclease Nsp15 Activity in Mouse Gut.,"The gut microbiome profile of COVID-19 patients was found to correlate with a viral load of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 severity, and dysfunctional immune responses, suggesting that gut microbiota may be involved in anti-infection. In order to investigate the role of gut microbiota in anti-infection against SARS-CoV-2, we established a high-throughput in vitro screening system for COVID-19 therapeutics by targeting the endoribonuclease (Nsp15). We also evaluated the activity inhibition of the target by substances of intestinal origin, using a mouse model in an attempt to explore the interactions between gut microbiota and SARS-CoV-2. The results unexpectedly revealed that antibiotic treatment induced the appearance of substances with Nsp15 activity inhibition in the intestine of mice. Comprehensive analysis based on functional profiling of the fecal metagenomes and endoribonuclease assay of antibiotic-enriched bacteria and metabolites demonstrated that the Nsp15 inhibitors were the primary bile acids that accumulated in the gut as a result of antibiotic-induced deficiency of bile acid metabolizing microbes. This study provides a new perspective on the development of COVID-19 therapeutics using primary bile acids.",1,51
2481,35966777,Distribution and inter-regional relationship of amyloid-beta plaque deposition in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Although previous studies have selectively investigated the localization of amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition in certain brain regions, a comprehensive characterization of the rostro-caudal distribution of Aβ plaques in the brain and their inter-regional correlation remain unexplored. Our results demonstrated remarkable working and spatial memory deficits in 9-month-old 5xFAD mice compared to wildtype mice. High Aβ plaque load was detected in the somatosensory cortex, piriform cortex, thalamus, and dorsal/ventral hippocampus; moderate levels of Aβ plaques were observed in the motor cortex, orbital cortex, visual cortex, and retrosplenial dysgranular cortex; and low levels of Aβ plaques were located in the amygdala, and the cerebellum; but no Aβ plaques were found in the hypothalamus, raphe nuclei, vestibular nucleus, and cuneate nucleus. Interestingly, the deposition of Aβ plaques was positively associated with brain inter-regions including the prefrontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, medial amygdala, thalamus, and the hippocampus. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive morphological profile of Aβ deposition in the brain and its inter-regional correlation. This suggests an association between Aβ plaque deposition and specific brain regions in AD pathogenesis.",1,52
586,35978500,Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside alters neurogenesis and neuroinflammation to ameliorate radiation-associated cognitive disability via AMPK/Tet2.,"Along with the extensive application of radiation in medical, military and other fields, human beings carry a greater risk of exposure to radiation environment that causes a range of physical injure, particularly to the brain in cognition. However, the radiation-associated cognitive disability is poorly understood and there is no effective prevention or long-term treatment. Here, we demonstrate that neurogenesis and neuroinflammation disorder are primarily involved in the pathophysiological basis of irradiation-induced cognitive decline. Furthermore, we discovered that tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside (TSG), a natural active ingredient from Heshouwu that has been well known for its unique anti-aging effect as the Chinese herb, can be a promising mitigator to improve learning-memory ability by facilitating the neurogenesis in the proliferation and differentiation of the surviving neural progenitor cells via AMPK/Tet2, and attenuating the neuroinflammation in the microglial NLRP3 inflammasomes activation via AMPK in vivo. Additionally, TSG was also revealed to activate AMPK by molecular docking and kinase enzyme system assay in vitro. Taken together, our findings identify TSG, as the AMPK activator, prevents radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction by regulating neurogenesis and neuroinflammation via AMPK/Tet2 in rodents, and represents a very promising candidate for developing drugs that can be used for radiation-associated brain injury.",1,53
2302,35967127,Enhancement of Mitochondrial Function by the Neurogenic Molecule NSI-189 Accompanies Reversal of Peripheral Neuropathy and Memory Impairment in a Rat Model of Type 2 Diabetes.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to many forms of peripheral and central nervous system degeneration. Therapies that protect mitochondrial number and function have the potential to impact the progression of conditions such as diabetic neuropathy. We therefore assessed indices of mitochondrial function in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and brain cortex of the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat model of type 2 diabetes and tested the therapeutic impact of a neurogenic compound, NSI-189, on both mitochondrial function and indices of peripheral and central neurological dysfunction. ZDF rats were maintained for 16 weeks of untreated diabetes before the start of oral treatment with NSI-189 for an additional 16 weeks. Nerve conduction velocity, sensitivity to tactile and thermal stimuli, and behavioral assays of cognitive function were assessed monthly. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, mitochondrial protein levels, and respiratory complex activities were assessed in the DRG and brain cortex after 16 weeks of treatment with NSI-189. Treatment with NSI-189 selectively elevated the expression of protein subunits of complexes III and V and activities of respiratory complexes I and IV in the brain cortex, and this was accompanied by amelioration of impaired memory function and plasticity. In the sensory ganglia of ZDF rats, loss of AMPK activity was ameliorated by NSI-189, and this was accompanied by reversal of multiple indices of peripheral neuropathy. Efficacy of NSI-189 against dysfunction of the CNS and PNS function in type 2 diabetic rats was accompanied by improvement of mitochondrial function. NSI-189 exhibited actions at different levels of mitochondrial regulation in central and peripheral tissues.",1,54
2140,35967378,Distribution and efficacy of ofatumumab and ocrelizumab in humanized CD20 mice following subcutaneous or intravenous administration.,"Approval of B-cell-depleting therapies signifies an important advance in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, it is unclear whether the administration route of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) alters tissue distribution patterns and subsequent downstream effects. This study aimed to investigate the distribution and efficacy of radiolabeled ofatumumab and ocrelizumab in humanized-CD20 (huCD20) transgenic mice following subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) administration. For distribution analysis, huCD20 and wildtype mice (n = 5 per group) were imaged by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT 72 h after SC/IV administration of ofatumumab or SC/IV administration of ocrelizumab, radiolabeled with Indium-111 (111In-ofatumumab or 111In-ocrelizumab; 5 µg, 5 MBq). For efficacy analysis, huCD20 mice with focal delayed-type hypersensitivity lesions and associated tertiary lymphoid structures (DTH-TLS) were administered SC/IV ofatumumab or SC/IV ocrelizumab (7.5 mg/kg, n = 10 per group) on Days 63, 70 and 75 post lesion induction. Treatment impact on the number of CD19+ cells in select tissues and the evolution of DTH-TLS lesions in the brain were assessed. Uptake of an 111In-labelled anti-CD19 antibody in cervical and axillary lymph nodes was also assessed before and 18 days after treatment initiation as a measure of B-cell depletion. SPECT/CT image quantification revealed similar tissue distribution, albeit with large differences in blood signal, of 111In-ofatumumab and 111In-ocrelizumab following SC and IV administration; however, an increase in both mAbs was observed in the axillary and inguinal lymph nodes following SC versus IV administration. In the DTH-TLS model of MS, both treatments significantly reduced the 111In-anti-CD19 signal and number of CD19+ cells in select tissues, where no differences between the route of administration or mAb were observed. Both treatments significantly decreased the extent of glial activation, as well as the number of B- and T-cells in the lesion following SC and IV administration, although this was mostly achieved to a greater extent with ofatumumab versus ocrelizumab. These findings suggest that there may be more direct access to the lymph nodes through the lymphatic system with SC versus IV administration. Furthermore, preliminary findings suggest that ofatumumab may be more effective than ocrelizumab at controlling MS-like pathology in the brain.",1,55
2470,35966788,Enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis mediated by PGC-1α-activated OXPHOS after neonatal low-dose Propofol exposure.,"Developing brain is highly plastic and can be easily affected. Growing pediatric usage of anesthetics during painless procedures has raised concerns about the effect of low-dose anesthetics on neurodevelopment. It is urgent to ascertain the neuronal effect of low-dose Propofol, a widely used anesthetic in pediatrics, on developing brains. The behavioral tests after neonatal exposure to low-dose/high-dose Propofol in mice were conducted to clarify the cognitive effect. The nascent cells undergoing proliferation and differentiation stage in the hippocampus and cultured neural stem cells (NSCs) were further identified. In addition, single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), NSCs bulk RNA-seq, and metabolism trials were performed for pathway investigation. Furthermore, small interfering RNA and stereotactic adenovirus injection were, respectively, used in NSCs and hippocampal to confirm the underlying mechanism. Behavioral tests in mice showed enhanced spatial cognitive ability after being exposed to low-dose Propofol. Activated neurogenesis was observed both in hippocampal and cultured NSCs. Moreover, transcriptome analysis of snRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and metabolism trials revealed a significantly enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) level in NSCs. Furthermore, PGC-1α, a master regulator in mitochondria metabolism, was found upregulated after Propofol exposure both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, downregulation of PGC-1α remarkably prevented the effects of low-dose Propofol in activating OXPHOS and neurogenesis. Taken together, this study demonstrates a novel alteration of mitochondrial function in hippocampal neurogenesis after low-dose Propofol exposure, suggesting the safety, even potentially beneficial effect, of low-dose Propofol in pediatric use.",1,56
2406,35966944,Dataset of ileum bacterial diversity in mice after heart failure due to pressure overload.,"We recently reported the correlation of gut bacterial diversity with heart failure using a mouse model of heart failure due to pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). We found that gut the bacterial diversity is significantly altered and is directly correlated to the severity of heart failure (Heart Failure Severity Closely Correlates with Intestinal Dysbiosis and Subsequent Metabolomic Alterations (Spehlmann, 2022). In addition, stool samples that were collected for the gut microbial diversity analysis, we dissected ileum from the mice after 42 days of TAC. The total DNA was extracted to identify the bacterial diversity resided in ileum using 16S rRNA gene amplicon shotgun sequencing and downstream bioinformatics analysis to determine if it is correlated to the heart failure.",1,57
480,35978875,Upregulated adenosine 2A receptor accelerates post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome by promoting CD4+ T cells' T helper 17 polarization.,"Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is generally regarded as a functional disease. Several recent studies have reported the involvement of low-grade inflammation and immunological dysfunction in PI-IBS. T helper 17 (Th17) polarization occurs in IBS. Adenosine and its receptors participate in intestinal inflammation and immune regulation. To investigate the role of Th17 polarization of CD4+ T cells regulated by adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) in PI-IBS. A PI-IBS model was established by infecting mice with Trichinella spiralis. The intestinal A2AR and CD4+ T lymphocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry, and the inflammatory cytokines were detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay. CD4+ T lymphocytes present in the animal's spleen were separated and cultured with or without A2AR agonist and antagonist. Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed to determine the effect of A2AR on the cells and intestinal tissue. Cytokine production was determined. The protein and mRNA levels of A2AR associated signaling pathway molecules were also evaluated. Furthermore, A2AR agonist and antagonist were injected into the mouse model and the clinical features were observed. The PI-IBS mouse model showed increased expression of ATP and A2AR (P < 0.05), and inhibition of A2AR improved the clinical features in PI-IBS, including the abdominal withdrawal reflex and colon transportation test (P < 0.05). The number of intestinal CD4+ T cells and interleukin-17 (IL-17) protein levels increased during PI-IBS, which was reversed by administration of the A2AR antagonist (P < 0.05). CD4+ T cells expressed A2AR and produced IL-17 in vitro, which was regulated by the A2AR agonist and antagonist. The A2AR antagonist increased the production of IL-17 by CD4+ T cells via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription-receptor-related orphan receptor γ signaling pathway. The results of the present study suggested that the upregulation of A2AR increases PI-IBS by promoting the Th17 polarization of CD4+ T cells.",1,58
575,35978512,Exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells regulate lymphangiogenesis via the miR-302d-3p/VEGFR3/AKT axis to ameliorate inflammatory bowel disease.,"Exosomes released from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (hucMSC-Ex) have been revealed to hold great potential for the development of new treatment approaches for various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Lymphatic vessels are vital for IBD development and progression to colorectal cancer (CRC), as an occluded conduit for lymphatic fluid to return to the blood. The mechanism involved remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the therapeutic effect of hucMSC-Ex in a mouse model of IBD during the modulation of lymphangiogenesis. We established a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD model in BALB/c mice and observed the influence of hucMSC-Ex on tissue repair, intestinal lymphatic function, changes in lymphangiogenesis, and infiltration of macrophages. We also evaluated the functional changes of human lymphatic endothelial cells (hLECs) in vitro to determine the mechanism by which hucMSC-Ex regulate lymphangiogenesis. Finally, we identified key molecules in hucMSC-Ex by sequencing, database comparison, and cell validation. Results showed that hucMSC-Ex alleviates IBD in mice by improving intestinal lymphatic drainage, inhibiting lymphangiogenesis, and infiltration of macrophages. Mechanistically, the miRNA sequencing results showed that miR-302d-3p was highly expressed in hucMSC-Ex and played an important role in inhibiting lymphangiogenesis by targeting Fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4). At the same time, the phosphorylation of AKT was inhibited and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) was reduced. Collectively, our study suggests that hucMSC-Ex can regulate lymphangiogenesis via the miR-302d-3p/VEGFR3/AKT axis to ameliorate IBD. Our findings identify VEGFR3 as a potential therapeutic target in IBD, where tightly regulated lymphangiogenesis is crucial in its pathogenesis and progression.",1,59
536,35978694,Antitubercular Activity of Novel 2-(Quinoline-4-yloxy)acetamides with Improved Drug-Like Properties.,"Using cycloalkyl and electron-donating groups to decrease the carbonyl electrophilicity, a novel series of 2-(quinoline-4-yloxy)acetamides was synthesized and evaluated as in vitro inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth. Structure-activity relationship studies led to selective and potent antitubercular agents with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the submicromolar range against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mtb strains. An evaluation of the activity of the lead compounds against a spontaneous qcrB mutant strain indicated that the structures targeted the cytochrome bc 1 complex. In addition, selected molecules inhibited Mtb growth in a macrophage model of tuberculosis infection. Furthermore, the leading compound was chemically stable depending on the context and showed good kinetic solubility, high permeability, and a low rate of in vitro metabolism. Finally, the pharmacokinetic profile of the compound was assessed after oral administration to mice. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, a 2-(quinoline-4-yloxy)acetamide was obtained with a sufficient exposure, which may enable in vivo effectiveness and its further development as an antituberculosis drug candidate.",1,60
587,35978499,"Mesenchymal stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles-shuttled microRNA-223-3p suppress lipopolysaccharide-induced cardiac inflammation, pyroptosis, and dysfunction.","Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) possess therapeutical potentials in cardiac disorders. We probed into the mechanisms of MSC-EV-enclosed miR-223-3p in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiac inflammation, pyroptosis, and dysfunction. The cardiomyocyte model of cardiac dysfunction was induced by LPS, followed by determination of miR-223-3p expression. Next, we discerned the relation among miR-223-3p, FOXO3, and NLRP3. LPS-exposed cardiomyocytes were co-incubated with EVs from mouse MSCs to detect inflammation and pyroptosis using the gain- or loss-of-function experimentations. LPS-induced myocarditis mouse models were also prepared for further validating the effects of miR-223-3p from MSCs-derived EVs. Reduced miR-223-3p was witnessed in LPS-induced cardiomyocytes. Specifically, miR-223-3p could target and inhibit FOXO3 to reduce NLRP3 expression. MSC-EVs could transfer miR-223-3p into cardiomyocytes to repress LPS-induced cardiomyocyte inflammation and pyroptosis. Additionally, in LPS-induced mice, pyroptosis, immune cell infiltration, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and cardiac dysfunction were alleviated by MSC-EV-loading miR-223-3p. Conclusively, miR-223-3p shuttled by MSC-EVs restricted cardiac inflammation, pyroptosis, and dysfunction by disrupting FOXO3/NLRP3 axis.",1,61
33,35984761,MECHANISM OF MIR-25-3P CARRIED BY EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES DERIVED FROM PLATELET-RICH PLASMA IN IL-1β-INDUCED NUCLEUS PULPOSUS CELL DEGENERATION VIA THE SOX4/CXCR7 AXIS.,"Objectives: Nucleus pulposus (NP) cell degeneration promotes the progression of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. MicroRNAs (miRs) are associated with IVD degeneration. This study expounded the mechanism of microRNA (miR)-25-3p carried by extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in interleukin (IL)-1β-induced NP cell degeneration. Methods: Platelet-rich plasma from mouse blood was obtained, and EVs were isolated from PRP (EVs derived from PRP [PRP-EVs]) and identified. Nucleus pulposus cells were isolated from the mouse lumbar IVD and treated with IL-1β to induce NP cell degeneration. Extracellular vesicles derived from PRP were added into NP cell culture medium. Afterward, intracellular miR-25-3p, sex determining region Y-related high-mobility-group box 4 (SOX4), and CXC chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) levels were examined. Nucleus pulposus cell viability, apoptosis, and inflammation were detected. Extracellular vesicles derived from PRP were labeled by PKH67 to obverse the uptake of EVs by NP cells. The binding relations between SOX4 and miR-25-3p and CXCR7 were predicted and examined. Functional rescue experiments were performed to investigate the roles of miR-25-3p, SOX4, and CXCR7 in NP cell degeneration. Results: miR-25-3p was downregulated, whereas SOX4 and CXCR7 were upregulated in IL-1β-induced NP cells. Extracellular vesicles derived from PRP increased the cell viability, and decreased apoptosis and inflammation. miR-25-3p carried by PRP-EVs into NP cells alleviated NP cell degeneration. miR-25-3p inhibited SOX4 expression and limited CXCR7 transcription. Silencing miR-25-3p or overexpressing SOX4 or CXCR7 reversed the alleviating role of PRP-EVs in NP cell degeneration. Conclusion: miR-25-3p carried by PRP-EVs into NP cells elevated intracellular miR-25-3p expression, which suppressed SOX4 expression and further limited CXCR7 transcription, thus alleviating IL-1β-induced NP cell degeneration. Extracellular vesicles derived from PRP containing miR-25-3p may be a new method for IVD treatment.",1,62
2223,35967295,A hierarchy of selection pressures determines the organization of the T cell receptor repertoire.,"We systematically examine the receptor repertoire in T cell subsets in young, adult, and LCMV-infected mice. Somatic recombination generates diversity, resulting in the limited overlap between nucleotide sequences of different repertoires even within the same individual. However, statistical features of the repertoire, quantified by the V gene and CDR3 k-mer frequency distributions, are highly conserved. A hierarchy of immunological processes drives the evolution of this structure. Intra-thymic divergence of CD4+ and CD8+ lineages imposes subtle but dominant differences observed across repertoires of all subpopulations in both young and adult mice. Differentiation from naive through memory to effector phenotype imposes an additional gradient of repertoire diversification, which is further influenced by age in a complex and lineage-dependent manner. The distinct repertoire of CD4+ regulatory T cells is more similar to naive cells in young mice and to effectors in adults. Finally, we describe divergent (naive and memory) and convergent (CD8+ effector) evolution of the repertoire following acute infection with LCMV. This study presents a quantitative framework that captures the structure of the repertoire in terms of its fundamental statistical properties and describes how this structure evolves as individual T cells differentiate, migrate and mature in response to antigen exposure.",1,63
1309,35970099,Probing Caffeine Administration as a Medical Management for Hydrocephalus: An Experimental Study.,"Hydrocephalus is currently managed by cerebrospinal fluid diversion from the cerebral ventricles to other body sites, but this is complicated by obstruction and infection in young infants, thus adding to morbidity and mortality. Studies have reported caffeine to be a pleiotropic neuroprotective drug in the developing brain due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties, with improved white matter microstructural development. In this study, we investigate the use of caffeine administration as a possible means of pharmacological management for hydrocephalus. A total of 76 three-day-old mice pups from 10 dams were divided into four groups: hydrocephalus was induced in the pups in two groups by intracisternal injection of kaolin suspension, and their dams were given either caffeine (50 mg/kg by gavage) or water daily for 21 days; the dams in the other 2 (non-hydrocephalic) groups similarly had either caffeine or water; the pups received caffeine administered via lactation. Developmental neurobehavioral tests were performed until day 21, when the pups were sacrificed. Their brains were removed and processed for Cresyl and Golgi staining; both quantitative and qualitative analyses were then carried out. Improved developmental motor activities and reflexes were observed in the hydrocephalus + caffeine-treated pups. Caffeine administration was associated with reduced cell death and increased dendritic arborization of the neurons in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum of hydrocephalic mice pups. Caffeine administration appears to have promise as an adjunct in hydrocephalus management, and its use needs to be further explored.",1,64
2111,35967407,ILC2s expanded by exogenous IL-33 regulate CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophage polarization to alleviate hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an adverse consequence of hepatectomy or liver transplantation. Recently, immune mechanisms involved in hepatic IRI have attracted increased attention of investigators working in this area. In specific, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), have been strongly implicated in mediating type 2 inflammation. However, their immune mechanisms as involved with hepatic IRI remain unclear. Here, we reported that the population of ILC2s is increased with the development of hepatic IRI as shown in a mouse model in initial stage. Moreover, M2 type CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophages increased and reached maximal levels at 24 h followed by a significant elevation in IL-4 levels. We injected exogenous IL-33 into the tail vein of mice as a mean to stimulate ILC2s production. This stimulation of ILC2s resulted in a protective effect upon hepatic IRI along with an increase in M2 type CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophages. In contrast, depletion of ILC2s as achieved with use of an anti-CD90.2 antibody substantially abolished this protective effect of exogenous IL-33 and M2 type CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophage polarization in hepatic IRI. Therefore, this exogenous IL-33 induced potentiation of ILC2s appears to regulate the polarization of CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophages to alleviate IRI. Such findings provide the foundation for the development of new targets and strategies in the treatment of hepatic IRI.",1,65
2095,35967423,Potential correlation of allograft infiltrating group 2 innate lymphoid cells with acute rejection after liver transplantation.,"Accumulating evidence indicates the critical roles of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in immunoregulation. However, the role of ILC2s in acute rejection after liver transplantation (LT) remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed the frequency, counts, and signature cytokines of ILC2s in liver transplant recipients by flow cytometric analysis and multiplex immunofluorescence assay. We also assessed the spatial distribution and correlation between hepatic ILC2s and Treg cells. The changes of ILC2s were dynamically monitored in the mouse LT model. We found that the frequencies of circulating ILC2s were comparable in liver transplant recipients with either rejection or non-rejection compared with the control group. The hepatic ILC2s counts were significantly increased in the rejection group than in the non-rejection and control groups, and a similar trend was observed for Treg cells. In the mouse LT model, allograft infiltrating ILC2s dramatically increased within 14 days post-transplant. The frequency of ILC2s in bone marrow significantly increased at 7 days post-transplant and rapidly decreased at 14 days after LT. Similarly, there was a significant increase in the frequency of splenic ILC2s within two weeks post-transplant. Multiplex immunofluorescence assay showed a close correlation between hepatic ILC2s and Treg cells by analyzing their spatial distribution and distance. In conclusion, the number of allograft infiltrating ILC2s was closely related to rejection after LT. Allograft infiltrating ILC2s may play inhibitory roles in posttransplant immune homeostasis, favoring resolution of liver allograft rejection by interacting with Treg cells or promoting the migration of Tregs cells into the liver allograft.",1,66
483,35978872,Mechanism and therapeutic strategy of hepatic TM6SF2-deficient non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases via in vivo and in vitro experiments.,"The lack of effective pharmacotherapies for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is mainly attributed to insufficient research on its pathogenesis. The pathogenesis of TM6SF2-efficient NAFLD remains unclear, resulting in a lack of therapeutic strategies for TM6SF2-deficient patients. To investigate the role of TM6SF2 in fatty acid metabolism in the context of fatty liver and propose possible therapeutic strategies for NAFLD caused by TM6SF2 deficiency. Liver samples collected from both NAFLD mouse models and human participants (80 cases) were used to evaluate the expression of TM6SF2 by using western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RNA-seq data retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were used to confirm the over-expression of TM6SF2. Knockdown and overexpression of TM6SF2 were performed to clarify the mechanistic basis of hepatic lipid accumulation in NAFLD. MK-4074 administration was used as a therapeutic intervention to evaluate its effect on NAFLD caused by TM6SF2 deficiency. Hepatic TM6SF2 levels were elevated in patients with NAFLD and NAFLD mouse models. TM6SF2 overexpression can reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, suggesting a protective role for TM6SF2 in a high-fat diet (HFD). Downregulation of TM6SF2, simulating the TM6SF2 E167K mutation condition, increases intracellular lipid deposition due to dysregulated fatty acid metabolism and is characterized by enhanced fatty acid uptake and synthesis, accompanied by impaired fatty acid oxidation. Owing to the potential effect of TM6SF2 deficiency on lipid metabolism, the application of an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor (MK-4074) could reverse the NAFLD phenotypes caused by TM6SF2 deficiency. TM6SF2 plays a protective role in the HFD condition; its deficiency enhanced hepatic lipid accumulation through dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, and MK-4074 treatment could alleviate the NAFLD phenotypes caused by TM6SF2 deficiency.",1,67
568,35978519,Zoledronic acid enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Only a minority of patients benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy, although they have become the standard of care for patients of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without driver mutations. Zoledronic acid (ZA) enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of endocrine therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. However, little is known about the effect of ZA on the clinical outcomes of ICIs, or its possible mechanisms. Patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICIs alone or in combination with ZA were recruited. The clinical efficacy was compared between the two cohorts. We used an LL2 mouse model to confirm the combined effects of ZA with ICIs. Immune cell populations and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment and circulation were assayed and analyzed. The median PFS for the patients treated with and without ZA was 5.4 months and 2.8 months, respectively. The combination group showed a higher rate of disease control. In the mouse LL2 lung cancer model, tumor growth was significantly inhibited in mice treated with the combination treatment. More CD8 + IFN-γ + T cells and γδ T cells, and fewer CD11b cells were found in the circulation and TILs in the combination group. Anti-tumor cytokines INF-γ and IL-18 were elevated in the sera after combination therapy. Our study provides preclinical and clinical evidence to show that ZA could improve the therapeutic effects of ICIs. This effect was likely related to the activation of immune cells and elevated cytokines, which provided a new way to improve the effect of ICIs therapy, and is worth exploring further.",1,68
2126,35967392,"A recombinant murine-like rotavirus with Nano-Luciferase expression reveals tissue tropism, replication dynamics, and virus transmission.","Rotaviruses (RVs) are one of the main causes of severe gastroenteritis, diarrhea, and death in children and young animals. While suckling mice prove to be highly useful small animal models of RV infection and pathogenesis, direct visualization tools are lacking to track the temporal dynamics of RV replication and transmissibility in vivo. Here, we report the generation of the first recombinant murine-like RV that encodes a Nano-Luciferase reporter (NLuc) using a newly optimized RV reverse genetics system. The NLuc-expressing RV was replication-competent in cell culture and both infectious and virulent in neonatal mice in vivo. Strong luciferase signals were detected in the proximal and distal small intestines, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes. We showed, via a noninvasive in vivo imaging system, that RV intestinal replication peaked at days 2 to 5 post infection. Moreover, we successfully tracked RV transmission to uninoculated littermates as early as 3 days post infection, 1 day prior to clinically apparent diarrhea and 3 days prior to detectable fecal RV shedding in the uninoculated littermates. We also observed significantly increased viral replication in Stat1 knockout mice that lack the host interferon signaling. Our results suggest that the NLuc murine-like RV represents a non-lethal powerful tool for the studies of tissue tropism and host and viral factors that regulate RV replication and spread, as well as provides a new tool to facilitate the testing of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in the future.",1,69
1392,35969043,The Tibial Fracture-Pin Model: A Clinically Relevant Mouse Model of Orthopedic Injury.,"The tibial fracture-pin model is a mouse model of orthopedic trauma and surgery that recapitulates the complex muscle, bone, nerve, and connective tissue damage that manifests with this type of injury in humans. This model was developed because previous models of orthopedic trauma did not include simultaneous injury to multiple tissue types (bone, muscle, nerves) and were not truly representative of human complex orthopedic trauma. The authors therefore modified previous models of orthopedic trauma and developed the tibial fracture-pin model. This modified fracture model consists of a unilateral open tibial fracture with intramedullary nail (IMN) internal fixation and simultaneous tibialis anterior (TA) muscle injury, resulting in mechanical allodynia that lasts up to 5 weeks post injury. This series of protocols outlines the detailed steps to perform the clinically relevant orthopedic trauma tibial fracture-pin model, followed by a modified hot plate assay to examine nociceptive changes after orthopedic injury. Taken together, these detailed, reproducible protocols will allow pain researchers to expand their toolkit for studying orthopedic trauma-induced pain.",1,70
133,35983273,Carboxymethyl Chitosan Oligosaccharide Holds Promise for Treatment of Stenosis Crohn's Disease.,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic intestinal disturbance mediated by mucosal immune hyperactivity that is often associated with the formation of stenosis. No reliable solution to stenosis CD exists so far. Therefore, we generated carboxymethyl chitosan oligosaccharide (CMCOS) as a new promising therapy and investigate its efficacy in an improved rat CD model. CMCOS was synthesized by enzymatic hydrolysis, and its biosafety was evaluated in vivo. The rat model of stenosis CD was optimized by an orthogonal experiment of 75 or 100 mg/kg trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) in a 50 or 75% ethanol enema. The therapeutic efficacy of CMCOS on the rat model of stenosis CD was investigated and compared with the commercial drug 5-aminosalicylic acid over a 28 day period of disease progression. The rat model of stenosis CD was well established by intracolonic administration of 75 mg/kg TNBS in 75% ethanol. CMCOS significantly alleviated CD symptoms morphologically, hematologically, and pathologically, promoting functional recovery of intestinal epithelium in a dose-dependent manner. CMCOS reduced infiltrations of inflammatory cells by regulating the IL-17A/PPAR-γ pathway and reduced fibro-proliferation and fibro-degeneration of the colon tissue by downregulating the TGF-β1/WT1 pathway. 75 mg/kg TNBS in a 75% ethanol enema induces a rat model of stenosis CD suitable for preclinical pathology and pharmacological studies. The safety, antifibrosis, and functional repair performance of CMCOS make it a promising candidate for the treatment of stenosis CD.",1,71
2123,35967395,Lentinan -triggered butyrate-producing bacteria drive the expulsion of the intestinal helminth Trichinella spiralis in mice.,"Trichinellosis caused by Trichinella spiralis is a serious zoonosis with a worldwide distribution. Lentinan (LNT) is known to modulate the intestinal environment with noted health benefits, yet the effect of LNT against intestinal helminth is unknown. In our study, we first observed that LNT could trigger worm expulsion by promoting mucus layer functions through alteration of gut microbiota. LNT restored the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria altered by T. spiralis infection to the control group level. Interestingly, LNT triggered the production of butyrate. Then, we determined the deworming capacity of probiotics (butyrate-producing bacteria) in mice. Collectively, these findings indicated that LNT could modulate intestinal dysbiosis by T. spiralis, drive the expulsion of intestinal helminth and provided an easily implementable strategy to improve the host defence against T. spiralis infection.",1,72
1875,35967756,"[18F]-(2S,4R)4-Fluoroglutamine PET Imaging of Glutamine Metabolism in Murine Models of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).","Quantitative in vivo [18F]-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine ([18F]4-FGln or more simply [18F]FGln) metabolic kinetic parameters are compared with activity levels of glutamine metabolism in different types of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For this study, we used two transgenic mouse models of HCC induced by protooncogenes, MYC, and MET. Biochemical data have shown that tumors induced by MYC have increased levels of glutamine metabolism compared to those induced by MET. One-hour dynamic [18F]FGln PET data were acquired and reconstructed for fasted MYC mice (n = 11 tumors from 7 animals), fasted MET mice (n = 8 tumors from 6 animals), fasted FVBN controls (n = 8 normal liver regions from 6 animals), nonfasted MYC mice (n = 16 tumors from 6 animals), and nonfasted FVBN controls (n = 8 normal liver regions from 3 animals). The influx rate constants (K 1) using the one-tissue compartment model were derived for each tumor with the left ventricular blood pool input function. Influx rate constants were significantly higher for MYC tumors (K 1 = 0.374 ± 0.133) than for MET tumors (K 1 = 0.141 ± 0.058) under fasting conditions (P = 0.0002). Rate constants were also significantly lower for MET tumors (K 1 = 0.141 ± 0.135) than normal livers (K 1 = 0.332 ± 0.179) under fasting conditions (P = 0.0123). Fasting conditions tested for MYC tumors and normal livers did not result in any significant difference with P values > 0.005. Higher influx rate constants corresponded to elevated levels of glutamine metabolism as determined by biochemical assays. The data showed that there is a distinctive difference in glutamine metabolism between MYC and MET tumors. Our study has demonstrated the potential of [18F]FGln PET imaging as a tool to assess glutamine metabolism in HCC tumors in vivo with a caution that it may not be able to clearly distinguish HCC tumors from normal liver tissue.",1,73
695,35975361,Hyperinsulinemia alters insulin receptor presentation and internalization in brain microvascular endothelial cells.,"Insulin receptors are internalized by endothelial cells to facilitate their physiological processes; however, the impact of hyperinsulinemia in brain endothelial cells is not known. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the impact hyperinsulinemia plays on insulin receptor internalization through changes in phosphorylation, as well as the potential impact of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Hippocampal microvessels were isolated from high-fat diet fed mice and assessed for insulin signaling activation, a process known to be involved with receptor internalization. Surface insulin receptors in brain microvascular endothelial cells were labelled to assess the role hyperinsulinemia plays on receptor internalization in response to stimulation, with and without the PTP1B antagonist, Claramine. Our results indicated that insulin receptor levels increased in tandem with decreased receptor signaling in the high-fat diet mouse microvessels. Insulin receptors of cells subjected to hyperinsulinemic treatment demonstrate splice variation towards decreased IR-A mRNA expression and demonstrate a higher membrane-localized proportion. This corresponded with decreased autophosphorylation at sites critical for receptor internalization and signaling. Claramine restored signaling and receptor internalization in cells treated with hyperinsulinemia. In conclusion, hyperinsulinemia impacts brain microvascular endothelial cell insulin receptor signaling and internalization, likely via alternative splicing and increased negative feedback from PTP1B.",1,74
2200,35967318,Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator correction attenuates heart failure-induced lung inflammation.,"Heart failure (HF) affects 64 million people worldwide. Despite advancements in prevention and therapy, quality of life remains poor for many HF patients due to associated target organ damage. Pulmonary manifestations of HF are well-established. However, difficulties in the treatment of HF patients with chronic lung phenotypes remain as the underlying patho-mechanistic links are still incompletely understood. Here, we aim to investigate the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) involvement in lung inflammation during HF, a concept that may provide new mechanism-based therapies for HF patients with pulmonary complications. In a mouse model of HF, pharmacological CFTR corrector therapy (Lumacaftor (Lum)) was applied systemically or lung-specifically for 2 weeks, and the lungs were analyzed using histology, flow cytometry, western blotting, and qPCR. Experimental HF associated with an apparent lung phenotype characterized by vascular inflammation and remodeling, pronounced tissue inflammation as evidenced by infiltration of pro-inflammatory monocytes, and a reduction of pulmonary CFTR+ cells. Moreover, the elevation of a classically-activated phenotype of non-alveolar macrophages coincided with a cell-specific reduction of CFTR expression. Pharmacological correction of CFTR with Lum mitigated the HF-induced downregulation of pulmonary CFTR expression and increased the proportion of CFTR+ cells in the lung. Lum treatment diminished the HF-associated elevation of classically-activated non-alveolar macrophages, while promoting an alternatively-activated macrophage phenotype within the lungs. Collectively, our data suggest that downregulation of CFTR in the HF lung extends to non-alveolar macrophages with consequences for tissue inflammation and vascular structure. Pharmacological CFTR correction possesses the capacity to alleviate HF-associated lung inflammation.",1,75
1136,35973885,Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation promotes alveolar epithelial recovery by activating Hippo/YAP signaling after lung injury.,"The preferred configuration for bridging patients with respiratory failure while awaiting lung transplantation is venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO). However, the protective effect of VV ECMO on the lung, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are still unknown. We investigated the role of VV ECMO in preventing lung injury in vivo using a rat model. Additionally, the effects of Hippo/YAP signaling on alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2)-mediated alveolar epithelial recovery in VV ECMO rats were also investigated. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, RNA sequencing, lung injury, edema, and cytokine expression were evaluated. VV ECMO significantly improved severe hypoxemia, reduced lung edema, and inflammatory response, and altered alveolar epithelial function, as indicated by reduced protein concentrations in BALF. This was associated with Hippo/YAP signaling activation, according to RNA sequencing analysis. Furthermore, we discovered that after VV ECMO, AT2 cells proliferated and differentiated, and this increase in AT2 cell activity was correlated to the increased nuclear expression of YAP, which is critical for alveolar epithelial recovery from lung injury. During VV ECMO, verteporfin-induced YAP inhibition and the loss of the oxygenator delayed lung alveolar epithelial recovery and led to a prolonged inflammatory response. These findings suggest that VV ECMO protects against lung injury by activating the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. Strategies aimed at increasing YAP activity in AT2 cells could thus aid alveolar epithelial recovery, making VV ECMO easier for lung transplantation.",1,76
212,35982808,Target Specific Uptake of a Newly Synthesized Radiolabeled 5α-Reductase Inhibitor Tc-99m-17-Oxo-17a-Aza-D-Homo-5-Androsten-3β-yl Phenoxyacetate (Tc-99m-17a-Aza Steroid) in Rat Prostatic Neoplastic Lesions.,"Considering the 5α-reductase (5AR) inhibitory activity of the oximes and the importance of the ester group in increasing the anti-androgenic property, we reasoned to synthesize a compound having a lactam group in ring D and an ester group at the 3 β position of the androsterone nucleus. The study aims to radiolabel 17-oxo-17a-aza-D-homo-5-androsten-3β-yl phenoxyacetate (17a-aza steroid) with Tc-99m to evaluate its targeted uptake in experimentally induced prostate carcinogenesis in rats. The prediction of the optimal interaction and binding affinity of Tc-99m-17-oxo-17a-aza-D-homo-5-androsten-3 β-ylphenoxyacetate (Tc-99m-17a-aza steroid) toward 5AR inhibitor was done using Biopredicta Vlife MDS tool. Tc-99m-17a-aza steroid was developed by direct radiolabeling protocol. The radio-pharmacological characteristics (serum stability, plasma protein-binding ability, and lipophilicity) of the complex were evaluated. Further, the bio-distribution studies of the complex were performed in rats with experimentally induced prostate carcinogenesis. The in-silico analysis exhibits favorable binding of Tc-99m-17a-aza toward 5AR with D score-130.97. The radiochemical purity of Tc-99m-17a-aza was 96.79%. The radio-complex maintained stability in the rat serum for a period of 6 h (hours). Plasma protein binding and Log Po/w value were observed to be 86.23 ± 7.08% and 0.118 ± 0.045, respectively. A significantly enhanced percent-specific uptake was observed in the prostate of rats with induced prostate carcinogenesis. The study concludes that Tc-99m-17a-aza exhibits prostate specificity and can be explored further for its potential as a radionuclide imaging probe.",1,77
2473,35966785,Enriched environment ameliorates propagation of tau pathology and improves cognition in rat model of tauopathy.,"The typical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are cognitive impairment, disrupted spatial orientation, behavioral and psychiatric abnormalities, and later motor deficits. Neuropathologically, AD is characterized by deposits of pathological forms of endogenous proteins - amyloid-β, and neurofibrillary tau protein pathology. The latter closely correlates with brain atrophy and clinical impairment. Pharmacological therapies for these pathologies are largely absent, raising the question whether non-pharmacological interventions could be efficacious. Environmental factors can play a role in the manifestation of AD. It is unknown whether enriched environment (EE) can ameliorate the propagation of protein aggregates or their toxic components. We injected insoluble tau extracts from human brains with AD (600 or 900 ng per animal) into hippocampi of SHR72 transgenic rats that express non-mutated truncated human tau 151-391/4R, but usually do not develop hippocampal tangles. The rats had either standard housing, or could access an EE 5×/week for 3 months. Behavioral analysis included the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Histological analysis was used to assess the propagation of tau pathology. Animals exposed to EE performed better in the MWM (spatial acquisition duration and total distance, probe test); unexposed animals improved over the course of acquisition trials, but their mean performance remained below that of the EE group. Enriched environment abrogated tau propagation and hippocampal tangle formation in the 600 ng group; in the 900 ng group, tangle formation was ∼10-fold of the 600 ng group, and unaffected by EE. Even a small difference in the amount of injected human AD tau can cause a pronounced difference in the number of resulting tangles. EE leads to a noticeably better spatial navigation performance of tau-injected animals. Furthermore, EE seems to be able to slow down tau pathology progression, indicating the possible utility of similar interventions in early stages of AD where tangle loads are still low.",1,78
2071,35967447,BSL2-compliant lethal mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern to evaluate therapeutics targeting the Spike protein.,"Since first reported in 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly acquiring mutations, particularly in the spike protein, that can modulate pathogenicity, transmission and antibody evasion leading to successive waves of COVID19 infections despite an unprecedented mass vaccination necessitating continuous adaptation of therapeutics. Small animal models can facilitate understanding host-pathogen interactions, target selection for therapeutic drugs, and vaccine development, but availability and cost of studies in BSL3 facilities hinder progress. To generate a BSL2-compatible in vivo system that specifically recapitulates spike protein mediated disease we used replication competent, GFP tagged, recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus where the VSV glycoprotein was replaced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (rVSV-SARS2-S). We show that infection requires hACE2 and challenge of neonatal but not adult, K18-hACE2 transgenic mice (hACE2tg) leads to productive infection of the lungs and brains. Although disease progression was faster in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, infection with both viruses resulted in neuronal infection and encephalitis with increased expression of Interferon-stimulated Irf7, Bst2, Ifi294, as well as CxCL10, CCL5, CLC2, and LILRB4, and both models were uniformly lethal. Further, prophylactic treatment targeting the Spike protein (Receptor Binding Domain) with antibodies resulted in similar levels of protection from lethal infection against rVSV-SARS2-S and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Strikingly, challenge of neonatal hACE2tg mice with SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (SARS-CoV-2-α, -β, ϒ, or Δ) or the corresponding rVSV-SARS2-S viruses (rVSV-SARS2-Spike-α, rVSV-SARS2-Spike-β, rVSV-SARS2-Spike-ϒ or rVSV-SARS2-Spike-Δ) resulted in increased lethality, suggesting that the Spike protein plays a key role in determining the virulence of each variant. Thus, we propose that rVSV-SARS2-S virus can be used to understand the effect of changes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on infection and to evaluate existing or experimental therapeutics targeting spike protein of current or future VOC of SARS-CoV-2 under BSL-2 conditions.",1,79
1495,35968392,Stress Affects Central Compensation of Neural Responses to Cochlear Synaptopathy in a cGMP-Dependent Way.,"In light of the increasing evidence supporting a link between hearing loss and dementia, it is critical to gain a better understanding of the nature of this relationship. We have previously observed that following cochlear synaptopathy, the temporal auditory processing (e.g., auditory steady state responses, ASSRs), is sustained when reduced auditory input is centrally compensated. This central compensation process was linked to elevated hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). We further observed that, independently of age, central responsiveness to cochlear synaptopathy can differ, resulting in either a low or high capacity to compensate for the reduced auditory input. Lower central compensation resulted in poorer temporal auditory processing, reduced hippocampal LTP, and decreased recruitment of activity-dependent brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in hippocampal regions (low compensators). Higher central compensation capacity resulted in better temporal auditory processing, higher LTP responses, and increased activity-dependent BDNF expression in hippocampal regions. Here, we aimed to identify modifying factors that are potentially responsible for these different central responses. Strikingly, a poorer central compensation capacity was linked to lower corticosterone levels in comparison to those of high compensators. High compensators responded to repeated placebo injections with elevated blood corticosterone levels, reduced auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave I amplitude, reduced inner hair cell (IHC) ribbon number, diminished temporal processing, reduced LTP responses, and decreased activity-dependent hippocampal BDNF expression. In contrast, the same stress exposure through injection did not elevate blood corticosterone levels in low compensators, nor did it reduce IHC ribbons, ABR wave I amplitude, ASSR, LTP, or BDNF expression as seen in high compensators. Interestingly, in high compensators, the stress-induced responses, such as a decline in ABR wave I amplitude, ASSR, LTP, and BDNF could be restored through the memory-enhancing drug phosphodiesterase 9A inhibitor (PDE9i). In contrast, the same treatment did not improve these aspects in low compensators. Thus, central compensation of age-dependent cochlear synaptopathy is a glucocorticoid and cyclic guanosine-monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent neuronal mechanism that fails upon a blunted stress response.",1,80
569,35978518,Revolutionalizing the age old conventional treatment of psoriasis: An animal based comparative study between methylprednisolone and different doses of a novel anti-oxidant humanin analogue (HNG).,"Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease with 2-4% of prevalence worldwide conferring a major burden on health systems. It is assumed that the prevalence might increase due to climatic change and deterioration of protective ozone barrier. With the chances of increasing prevalence, newer and specific treatment options need to be explored. Skin is a constant target of oxidative stress owing to continuous exposure to ultraviolet radiations. Oxidative stress is considered to have a central role in dermatological diseases, including psoriasis. This study was designed to explore the role of Humanin analogue (S14-G HNG) as an important anti oxidant for psoriasis like condition in BALB/c mice as till date the commomly used drugs for this disease are corticosteroids which have a dissatisfactory adverse effect profile in terms of chronic use. Imiquimod 5% was used to induce Psoriasis like condition in mice, and the role of HNG was assessed through the histological examination, protein expressions and markers of oxidative stress. Two doses (low and high) of HNG were used and results were compared with an established drug methylprednisolone. Significant improvement was seen on histology, PASI scoring, protein expression and oxidative stress by the use of intraperitoneal injections of S14-G HNG and the results were comparable to those obtained through peritoneal injections of methylprednisolone. S14G-HNG can be considered as a suitable option for treatment of Psoriasis after clinical trials and it might prove to have lesser side effects as compared to other drugs employed for the treatment of psoriasis being an innate anti oxidant and anti apoptotic compound.",1,81
1853,35967787,Early Life to Adult Brain Lipidome Dynamic: A Temporospatial Study Investigating Dietary Polar Lipid Supplementation Efficacy.,"The lipid composition of the brain is well regulated during development, and the specific temporospatial distribution of various lipid species is essential for the development of optimal neural functions. Dietary lipids are the main source of brain lipids and thus contribute to the brain lipidome. Human milk is the only source of a dietary lipids for exclusively breastfed infant. Notably, it contains milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) enriched in polar lipids (PL). While early life is a key for early brain development, the interplay between dietary intake of polar lipids and spatial dynamics of lipid distribution during brain development is poorly understood. Here, we carried out an exploratory study to assess the early postnatal temporal profiling of brain lipidome between postnatal day (PND) 7 and PND 50 using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization as a mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) in an in vivo preclinical model. We also assessed the effect of chronic supplementation with PL extracted from alpha-lactalbumin-enriched whey protein concentrate (WPC) containing 10% lipids, including major lipid classes found in the brain (37% phospholipids and 15% sphingomyelin). MALDI-MSI of the spatial and temporal accretion of lipid species during brain development showed that the brain lipidome is changing heterogeneously along time during brain development. In addition, increases in 400+ PL supplement-dependent lipids were observed. PL supplementation had significant spatial and temporal effect on specific fatty esters, glycerophosphocholines, glycerophosphoethanolamines, and phosphosphingolipids. Interestingly, the average levels of these lipids per brain area tended to be constant in various brain structures across the age groups, paralleling the general brain growth. In contrast, other lipids, such as cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol, diacylglycerophosphates, phosphocholines, specific ether-phosphoethanolamines, phosphosphingolipids, glycerophosphoinositols, and glycerophosphoserines showed clear age-dependent changes uncoupled from the general brain growth. These results suggest that the dietary PL supplementation may preferentially provide the building blocks for the general brain growth during development. Our findings add to the understanding of brain-nutrient relations, their temporospatial dynamics, and potential impact on neurodevelopment.",1,82
1391,35969046,Analyzing the Parkinson's Disease Mouse Model Induced by Adeno-associated Viral Vectors Encoding Human α-Synuclein.,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that involves the death of the dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway and, consequently, the progressive loss of control of voluntary movements. This neurodegenerative process is triggered by the deposition of protein aggregates in the brain, which are mainly constituted of α-synuclein. Several studies have indicated that neuroinflammation is required to develop the neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease. Notably, the neuroinflammatory process involves microglial activation as well as the infiltration of peripheral T cells into the substantia nigra (SN). This work analyzes a mouse model of Parkinson's disease that recapitulates microglial activation, T-cell infiltration into the SN, the neurodegeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, and motor impairment. This mouse model of Parkinson's disease is induced by the stereotaxic delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors encoding the human wild-type α-synuclein (AAV-hαSyn) into the SN. The correct delivery of viral vectors into the SN was confirmed using control vectors encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). Afterward, how the dose of AAV-hαSyn administered in the SN affected the extent of hαSyn expression, the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons, and motor impairment were evaluated. Moreover, the dynamics of hαSyn expression, microglial activation, and T-cell infiltration were determined throughout the time course of disease development. Thus, this study provides critical time points that may be useful for targeting synuclein pathology and neuroinflammation in this preclinical model of Parkinson's disease.",1,83
2465,35966793,A novel curcumin oil solution can better alleviate the motor activity defects and neuropathological damage of a Parkinson's disease mouse model.,"Curcumin has been reported to improve or prevent movement disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, its low bioavailability is the biggest obstacle to its application. To optimize the limited efficacy of curcumin and to improve its protective effects against PD, we prepared and tested a novel curcumin oil solution. In vivo imaging was used to confirm that the curcumin oil solution has higher bioavailability than curcumin alone. To test its motor effects on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced movement disorders, behavioral tests, including the open-field test, pole test, rotarod test, and automated gait analysis were used. Finally, pathological evaluation using immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis was done. Encouragingly, the behavioral test findings exhibited a better protective effect against MPTP-induced movement disorders. In addition, it had a greater protective effect on dopaminergic neurons in the compact part of the substantia nigra along with the PD process according to pathological evaluation. This novel curcumin oil solution may provide a new choice for PD prevention as a dietary supplement or clinically assisted treatment based on its better bioavailability and efficiency.",1,84
1779,35967878,"The repositioned drugs disulfiram/diethyldithiocarbamate combined to benznidazole: Searching for Chagas disease selective therapy, preventing toxicity and drug resistance.","Chagas disease (CD) affects at least 6 million people in 21 South American countries besides several thousand in other nations all over the world. It is estimated that at least 14,000 people die every year of CD. Since vaccines are not available, chemotherapy remains of pivotal relevance. About 30% of the treated patients cannot complete the therapy because of severe adverse reactions. Thus, the search for novel drugs is required. Here we tested the benznidazole (BZ) combination with the repositioned drug disulfiram (DSF) and its derivative diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) upon Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro and in vivo. DETC-BZ combination was synergistic diminishing epimastigote proliferation and enhancing selective indexes up to over 10-fold. DETC was effective upon amastigotes of the BZ- partially resistant Y and the BZ-resistant Colombiana strains. The combination reduced proliferation even using low concentrations (e.g., 2.5 µM). Scanning electron microscopy revealed membrane discontinuities and cell body volume reduction. Transmission electron microscopy revealed remarkable enlargement of endoplasmic reticulum cisternae besides, dilated mitochondria with decreased electron density and disorganized kinetoplast DNA. At advanced stages, the cytoplasm vacuolation apparently impaired compartmentation. The fluorescent probe H2-DCFDA indicates the increased production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced lipid peroxidation in parasites incubated with DETC. The biochemical measurement indicates the downmodulation of thiol expression. DETC inhibited superoxide dismutase activity on parasites was more pronounced than in infected mice. In order to approach the DETC effects on intracellular infection, peritoneal macrophages were infected with Colombiana trypomastigotes. DETC addition diminished parasite numbers and the DETC-BZ combination was effective, despite the low concentrations used. In the murine infection, the combination significantly enhanced animal survival, decreasing parasitemia over BZ. Histopathology revealed that low doses of BZ-treated animals presented myocardial amastigote, not observed in combination-treated animals. The picrosirius collagen staining showed reduced myocardial fibrosis. Aminotransferase de aspartate, Aminotransferase de alanine, Creatine kinase, and urea plasma levels demonstrated that the combination was non-toxic. As DSF and DETC can reduce the toxicity of other drugs and resistance phenotypes, such a combination may be safe and effective.",1,85
1313,35970078,17β-estradiol reduces NF-κB expression induced by increased crosstalk between KLF5 and ERα in murine vascular smooth muscle cells.,"Pathological vascular remodeling and cell proliferation play vital roles in many proliferative vascular diseases. Estrogen can protect the cardiovascular system, but its exact molecular mechanism is unknown. Here we report that 17β-estradiol (E2) suppressed vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation and inflammation. qRT-PCR and Western blot demonstrated that E2 decreased NF-κB p50 expression and reduced VSMCs proliferation and inflammation. Mechanistically, a dual luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested that KLF5 promoted NF-κB p50 expression by binding to the NF-κB p50 promoter, whereas E2 reduced the effect of KLF5 binding to the NF-κB p50 promoter and inhibited NF-κB p50 expression. Furthermore, a coimmunoprecipitation assay and immunofluorescence staining showed that the interaction between KLF5 and ERα increased in VSMCs treated with E2, which in turn decreased NF-κB p50 expression levels. Altogether, we reveal that E2 inhibits VSMCs proliferation and inflammation by reducing NF-κB expression induced by an increased interaction between KLF5 and ERα. These data provide further insights into how E2 inhibits vascular proliferation and inflammation.",1,86
2201,35967317,B cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors impacting memory recall responses to SRBC challenge.,"MBCs (MBCs) generated in T-dependent immune responses can persist for a lifetime and rapidly react upon secondary antigen exposure to differentiate into plasma cells (PCs) and/or to improve the affinity of their BCR through new rounds of hypermutation in germinal centers (GCs). The fate of a MBC in secondary immune reactions appears to depend upon multiple parameters, whose understanding is mandatory for the design of efficient vaccine strategies. We followed the behavior of MBCs in recall responses to SRBCs using an inducible AID fate mapping mouse model in which B cells engaged in a germinal center (GC) response are irreversibly labeled upon simultaneous tamoxifen ingestion and immunization. We used different schemes of mouse immunization and tamoxifen feeding in adoptive-transfer experiments of total splenic B cells into congenic mice that have been pre-immunized or not, to assess the contribution of the different effector subsets in a physiological competitive context. We were able to show that naive B cells can differentiate into GC B cells with kinetics similar to MBCs in the presence of previously activated T follicular helper (TFH) cells and a primed microenvironment. We also showed that MBCs are recruited into secondary GCs, together with naive B cells. In contrast, PC differentiation, which dominated secondary MBC responses, was not dependent upon a previous TFH activation. We observed that the presence of persisting germinal centers and circulating antibody levels are key factors determining the germinal center versus plasma cell fate in a recall response. Notably, disruption of persistent germinal center structures by a lymphotoxin beta-receptor fusion protein or a longer timing between the prime and the boost, which correlated with reduced antigen-specific immunoglobulin levels in serum, were two conditions with an opposite impact, respectively inhibiting or promoting a GC fate for MBCs. Altogether, these studies highlight the complexity of recall responses, whose outcome varies according to immunization contexts.",1,87
2078,35967440,Integrative lipidomic features identify plasma lipid signatures in chronic urticaria.,"Chronic urticaria (CU) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease mainly mediated by mast cells. Lipids exert essential functions in biological processes; however, the role of lipids in CU remains unclear. Nontargeted lipidomics was performed to investigate the differential lipid profiles between CU patients and healthy control (HC) subjects. Functional validation studies were performed in vitro and in vivo including β-hexosaminidase release examination from mast cells and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) mouse model. We detected dramatically altered glycerophospholipids in CU patients compared with HCs. Phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) were increased, while phosphatidylcholine (PC) was reduced in CU patients. The reduction in PC was related to a high weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7), while PS was positively associated with the dermatology life quality index (DLQI). We also identified the differential lipid profiles between chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), symptomatic dermographism (SD), and CSU coexist with SD. CU patients were classified into two subtypes (subtype 1 and subtype 2) based on consensus clustering of lipid profiling. Compared with patients in subtype 2, patients in subtype 1 had elevated levels of PC (18:0e/18:2) and PE (38:2), and lower urticaria control test (UCT) scores indicated worse clinical efficiency of secondary generation H1 antihistamines treatment. Importantly, we found that supplementation with PC could attenuate IgE-induced immune responses in mast cells. In general, We described the landscape of plasma lipid alterations in CU patients and provided novel insights into the role of PC in mast cells.",1,88
705,35975241,Neuronal density in the brain cortex and hippocampus in Clsnt2-KO mouse strain modeling autistic spectrum disorder.,"Autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) represent conditions starting in childhood, which are characterized by diff iculties with social interaction and communication, as well as non-typical and stereotyping models of behavior. The mechanisms and the origin of these disorders are not yet understood and thus far there is a lack of prophylactic measures for these disorders. The current study aims to estimate neuronal density in the prefrontal cortex and four hippocampal subf ields, i. e. СA1, СA2, СA3, and DG in Clstn2-KO mice as a genetic model of ASD. In addition, the level of neurogenesis was measured in the DG area of the hippocampus. This mouse strain was obtained by a knockout of the calsinthenin-2 gene (Clsnt2) in C57BL/6J mice; the latter (wild type) was used as controls. To estimate neuronal density, serial sections were prepared on a cryotome for the above-mentioned brain structures with the subsequent immunohistochemical labeling and confocal microscopy; the neuronal marker (anti-NeuN) was used as the primary antibody. In addition, neurogenesis was estimated in the DG region of the hippocampus; for this purpose, a primary antibody against doublecortin (anti-DCX) was used. In all cases Goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody. The density of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was lower in Clstn2-KO mice of both sexes as compared with controls. Moreover, in males of both strains, neuronal density in this region was lower as compared to females. Besides, the differences between males and females were revealed in two other hippocampal regions. In the CA2 region, a lower density of neurons was observed in males of both strains, and in the CA3 region, a lower density of neurons was also observed in males as compared to females but only in C57BL/6J mice. No difference between the studied groups was revealed in neurogenesis, nor was it in neuronal density in the prefrontal cortex or DG hippocampal region. Our new f indings indicate that calsyntenin-2 regulates neuronal hippocampal density in subf ield-specif ic manner, suggesting that the CA1 neuronal subpopulation may represent a cellular target for early-life preventive therapy of ASD. Расстройства аутистического спектра (РАС) – это группа состояний, возникающих в детском возрасте, для которых характерны трудности с социальным взаимодействием и общением, a также нетипичные модели поведения и склонность к стереотипии. Механизмы возникновения этой группы расстройств до сих пор не вполне понятны, и, следовательно, отсутствуют соответствующие методы профилактики. Целью исследования была оценка плотности нейронов в медиальной префронтальной коре и четырех областях гиппокампа, а именно СA1, СA2, СA3 и зубчатой извилины (DG) у мышей линии Clstn2-KO, которая может выступать в качестве генетической модели РАС. Кроме того, охарактеризовали уровень нейрогенеза в области DG гиппокампа. Данная линия получена путем нокаута гена кальсинтенина-2 (Clstn2) на основе мышей линии С57BL/6J; последняя была использована в настоящем исследовании в качестве контроля. Для определения плотности нейронов изготавливали серийные срезы соответствующих областей мозга на криотоме с последующим иммуногистохимическим окрашиванием и конфокальной микроскопией, для чего использовали нейрональный маркер (anti-NeuN) в качестве первичного антитела. Наряду с этим в области DG гиппокампа оценивали нейрогенез, для чего проводили иммуногистохимическое окрашивание с применением антитела против даблкортина (anti-DCX). В обоих случаях в качестве вторичного антитела был Goat anti-rabbit IgG. Плотность нейронов в области гиппокампа СА1 была снижена как у самцов, так и самок мышей Clstn2-KO по сравнению с контролем; у самцов обеих линий плотность нейронов была ниже в этой области по сравнению с самками. Помимо этого, были обнаружены различия между самцами и самками в двух других областях гиппокампа: в области CA2 – у мышей обеих исследованных линий, а в области CA3 лишь у мышей C57BL/6J плотность нейронов была меньше у самцов по сравнению с самками. Различий между исследованными группами в уровне нейрогенеза, а также в плотности нейронов в префронтальной коре и области DG гиппокампа не обнаружено. Полученные результаты показывают, что нокаут по гену Clstn2 приводит к избирательному снижению плотности нейронов в CA1-области гиппокампа, что может представлять собой клеточную мишень для ранней профилактики и возможной терапии РАС.",1,89
1851,35967789,CircRNA-mediated regulation of brown adipose tissue adipogenesis.,"Adipose tissue represents a candidate target for the treatment of metabolic illnesses, such as obesity. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), an important heat source within the body, promotes metabolic health through fat consumption. Therefore, the induction of white fat browning may improve lipid metabolism. Currently, the specific roles of circRNA in BAT and white adipose tissue (WAT) remain elusive. Herein, we conducted circRNA expression profiling of mouse BAT and WAT using RNA-seq. We identified a total of 12,183 circRNAs, including 165 upregulated and 79 downregulated circRNAs between BAT and WAT. Differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs were associated with the mitochondrion, mitochondrial part, mitochondrial inner membrane, mitochondrial envelope, therefore, these circRNAs may affect the thermogenesis and lipid metabolism of BAT. Moreover, DE circRNAs were enriched in browning- and thermogenesis-related pathways, including AMPK and HIF-1 signaling. In addition, a novel circRNA, circOgdh, was found to be highly expressed in BAT, formed by back-splicing of the third and fourth exons of the Ogdh gene, and exhibited higher stability than linear Ogdh. circOgdh was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm and could sponge miR-34a-5p, upregulating the expression of Atgl, a key lipolysis gene, which enhanced brown adipocyte lipolysis and suppressed lipid droplet accumulation. Our findings offer in-depth knowledge of the modulatory functions of circRNAs in BAT adipogenesis.",1,90
1562,35968324,"AdAPT-001, an oncolytic adenovirus armed with a TGF-β trap, overcomes in vivo resistance to PD-L1-immunotherapy.","Monoclonal antibodies targeting the programmed cell death protein-1/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) axes have permanently changed the therapeutic landscape for multiple tumor types previously associated with a dismal prognosis such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, MSI-high colorectal carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. However, only a subset of patients initially benefits from these inhibitors, and increasing clinical experience indicates that in a substantial proportion of initial responders, lethal secondary resistance ultimately develops months or years later. In this paper we evaluated combination therapy with a Phase 1 oncolytic adenovirus called AdAPT-001, armed with a TGF-β trap that binds to and neutralizes the immunosuppressive cytokine, TGF-β, and a checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD-L1, in PD-L1 resistant tumors. The study, which was performed in an immunocompetent syngeneic ADS-12 mouse model, demonstrated that the combination of AdAPT-001 with PD-L1 blockade reversed PD-L1 resistance, potentially representing a future paradigm shift for patients that are primarily or secondarily resistant to checkpoint inhibitors.",1,91
187,35982896,MiR-138-5p Targets MACF1 to Aggravate Aging-related Bone Loss.,"Senile osteoporosis is one of the major health problems in an aging society. Decreased bone formation due to osteoblast dysfunction may be one of the causes of aging-related bone loss. With increasing evidence suggesting that multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in osteoblast function, the relationship between miRNAs and senile osteoporosis has become a popular research topic. Previously, we confirmed that mechanoresponsive miR-138-5p negatively regulated bone anabolic action. In this study, the miR-138-5p level was found to be negatively correlated with BMD and osteogenic markers in bone specimens of senile osteoporotic patients by bioinformatic analysis and experimental verification. Furthermore, high miR-138-5p levels aggravated the decrease of aged osteoblast differentiation in vitro and led to worse bone loss in aged osteoblastic miR-138-5p transgenic mice in vivo. We also previously identified that the target of miR-138-5p, microtubule actin cross-linking factor 1 (MACF1), could attenuate senile osteoporosis. Here, miR-138-5p was demonstrated to regulate aged osteoblast differentiation by targeting MACF1. Finally, the therapeutic inhibition of miR-138-5p counteracted the decrease in bone formation and aging-related bone loss in aged mice. Overall, our results highlight the crucial roles and the molecular mechanism of miR-138-5p in aging-related bone loss and may provide a powerful therapeutic target for ameliorating senile osteoporosis.",1,92

The role of TPTEP1 in gastric cancer has not been reported. Wound healing assay and transwell assay analysis TPTEP1/miR-548d-3p/KLF9/PER1 effect on migration and invasiveness of gastric cells. Western blot and RT-qPCR certificate TPTEP1/miR-548d-3p/KLF9/PER1transcription and expression of migration and invasion related genes. Luciferase assay was used to determine the adsorption of miR-548d-3p by TPTEP1 sponge, the targeting of miR-548d-3p to KLF9, and the binding of KLF9 to the promoter of PER1. immunohistochemical assay and H&E staining prove the function of TPTEP1 and miR-548d-3p in nude mice model of gastric cancer. TPTEP1 inhibited its expression by sponge adsorption of miR-548d-3p. miR-548d-3p targets KLF9 3'UTR to inhibit its expression, and KLF9 binds to the PER1 promoter to promote its expression.TPTEP1/KLF9/PER1 inhibits gastric cancer cell migration and invasion, and miR-548d-3p does the opposite. Our data suggest that TPTEP1 affects gastric cancer progression by regulating the miR-548d-3p/KLF9/PER1 axis. Targeting this pathway may provide new therapeutic opportunities for gastric cancer.",1,93
1387,35969051,A New Optokinetic Testing Method to Measure Rat Vision.,"Optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) is a reflexive eye movement initiated by the motion of visual stimuli in the field of vision. The head-tracking movement associated with OKN is commonly used as a measure of visual function in rodents. To record OKN responses in normal and experimental rats, a simple and inexpensive apparatus has been developed. This setup uses two tablet screens to display the OKN visual stimulus consisting of high contrast black and white stripes generated using the OKN Stripes Visualization Web Application, a freely available software. The rat is placed inside a clear Plexiglass holder that limits movement so that the rat's head continuously faces the OKN display screen. The position of the rat holder can be changed to adjust the distance between the rat and the display screen. A micro-camera positioned above the rat holder is used to record the rat's visual activities. These recordings can be used for quantitative assessments. Based on the presence or absence of clear head-tracking, the OKN responses at different spatial frequencies can be determined. The collected data demonstrates a novel technique for reliable measurement of visual acuity in normal and retinal degenerate rats.",1,94
54,35983499,Mesenchymal stem cells pretreated with proinflammatory cytokines accelerate skin wound healing by promoting macrophages migration and M2 polarization.,"Numerous studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote cutaneous wound healing via paracrine signaling. Our previous study found that the secretome of MSCs was significantly amplified by treatment with IFN-γ and TNF-α (IT). It has been known that macrophages are involved in the initiation and termination of inflammation, secretion of growth factors, phagocytosis, cell proliferation and collagen deposition in wound, which is the key factor during wound healing. In the present study, we used a unique supernatant of MSCs from human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) pretreated with IT, designated S-IT MSCs, to explore whether S-IT MSCs have a better effect on improving wound healing by improving the biological function of macrophages than the control supernatant of MSCs (S-MSCs). In the present study, we used a unique supernatant of MSCs pretreated with IT subcutaneously injected into a mice total skin excision. We evaluated the effect of S-IT MSCs on wound healing and the quality of wound repair via promoting macrophages migration and M2 polarization in vivo. In addition, the effect of S-IT MSCs on macrophages migration, converting toward M2 phenotype and phagocytosis were also investigated in vitro. Indeed, S-IT MSCs were found to be more potent in promoting macrophage migration, M2 polarization, phagocytosis, and promoting wound closure than S-MSCs during the wound repair. High levels of CCL2 and IL-6 were found in S-IT MSCs, which indicated that the optimization of macrophage function by S-IT MSCs may be achieved through their high expression of CCL2 and IL-6. Our results suggest that the beneficial paracrine effect of MSCs on wound healing can be amplified by pretreatment with IT, which may represent a new strategy for optimizing the therapeutic effect of MSCs on wound healing.",1,95
1400,35968617,The effect of adding carboxymethylcellulose and alginate to hyaluronic acid on reducing epidural fibrosis in a lumbar laminectomized rat model.,"This study aimed to compare the anti-epidural fibrosis and anti-inflammation effects of hyaluronic acid (HA)-carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)-alginate hydrogel, pure HA, and normal saline using a lumbar laminectomized rat model. Thirty lumbar laminectomized adult rats were randomly assigned to three groups. The control group received normal saline, the HCA group received HA-CMC-alginate gel, and the HA group received pure HA gel soaked over the dura of the laminectomized area before closing the surgical wound. All rats were housed for eight weeks, then epidural fibrosis (EF) was histologically graded. In addition, the fibroblast and inflammatory cell density were computerized for evaluation. The mean fibroblast densities were 32.03 × 102 ± 488, 13.22 × 102 ± 200, and 14.52 × 102 ± 368 cell/mm2 in the control, HCA, and HA groups, respectively. The mean inflammatory cell density was 30.74 × 102 ± 459, 5.90 × 102 ± 129, and 11.08 × 102 ± 282 cell/mm2 in the control, HCA, and HA groups, respectively. The mean fibroblast and inflammatory cell densities in the HCA and HA groups were significantly lower than in the control group (P < 0.05). The HCA group had a significantly lower inflammatory cell density than the HA group (P < 0.05). The fibrous adherence grading of HCA and HA was significantly lower than the control (P < 0.05). HA-CMC-alginate gel and HA hydrogels seem to have a better preventative effect on EF than no treatment (control). HA-CMCalginate can exhibit a better anti-inflammatory effect than HA. HA-CMC-alginate can be effective in reducing EF and inflammation after lumbar laminectomy.",1,96
2131,35967387,The TAM receptor tyrosine kinases Axl and Mer drive the maintenance of highly phagocytic macrophages.,"Many apoptotic thymocytes are generated during the course of T cell selection in the thymus, yet the machinery through which these dead cells are recognized and phagocytically cleared is incompletely understood. We found that the TAM receptor tyrosine kinases Axl and Mer, which are co-expressed by a specialized set of phagocytic thymic macrophages, are essential components of this machinery. Mutant mice lacking Axl and Mer exhibited a marked accumulation of apoptotic cells during the time that autoreactive and nonreactive thymocytes normally die. Unexpectedly, these double mutants also displayed a profound deficit in the total number of highly phagocytic macrophages in the thymus, and concomitantly exhibited diminished expression of TIM-4, CD163, and other non-TAM phagocytic engulfment systems in the macrophages that remained. Importantly, these previously unrecognized deficits were not confined to the thymus, as they were also evident in the spleen and bone marrow. They had pleiotropic consequences for the double mutants, also previously unrecognized, which included dysregulation of hemoglobin turnover and iron metabolism leading to anemia.",1,97
225,35982795,Tripartite motif 38 attenuates cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction by suppressing TAK1 activation via TAB2/3 degradation.,"The role of tripartite motif (TRIM) 38, a ubiquitin E3 ligase regulating various pathophysiological processes, in cardiac fibrosis remains unclear. Here, a model of angiotensin II and myocardial infarction (MI)-induced fibrosis was established to explore its role in cardiac fibrosis and its underlying mechanisms. Cardiac fibrosis in the mouse MI model was mitigated by TRIM38 overexpression, but aggravated by its depletion. Consistently, in vitro overexpression or knockdown of TRIM38 ameliorated or aggravated the proliferation and secretion of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) exposed to fibrotic stimulation, respectively. Mechanistically, TRIM38 suppressed cardiac fibrosis progression by attenuating TAK1/MAPK signaling. Inhibiting TAK1/MAPK signaling with a pharmacological inhibitor greatly reversed the effects of TRIM38 knockdown on CF secretion. Specifically, TRIM38 interacted with and targeted TAB2 and TAB3 for degradation, subsequently inhibiting TAK1 phosphorylation and negatively regulating MAPK signaling. These findings can help develop therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent cardiac fibrosis.",1,98
1377,35969077,En Face Endocardial Cushion Preparation for Planar Morphogenesis Analysis in Mouse Embryos.,"The study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of the mammalian heart is essential to address human congenital heart disease. The development of the primitive cardiac valves involves the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of endocardial cells from the atrioventricular canal (AVC) and outflow tract (OFT) regions of the heart in response to local inductive myocardial and endocardial signals. Once the cells delaminate and invade the extracellular matrix (cardiac jelly) located between the endocardium and the myocardium, the primitive endocardial cushions (EC) are formed. This process implies that the endocardium has to fill the gaps left by the delaminated cells and has to reorganize itself to converge (narrow) or extend (lengthen) along an axis. Current research has implicated the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway in regulating the subcellular localization of the factors involved in this process. Classically, the initial phases of cardiac valve development have been studied in cross-sections of embryonic hearts or in ex vivo AVC or OFT explants cultured on collagen gels. These approaches allow the analysis of apico-basal polarity but do not allow the analysis of cell behavior within the plane of the epithelium or of the morphological changes of migrating cells. Here, we show an experimental approach that allows the visualization of the endocardium at valvulogenic regions as a planar field of cells. This experimental approach provides the opportunity to study PCP, planar topology, and intercellular communication within the endocardium of the OFT and AVC during valve development. Deciphering new cellular mechanisms involved in cardiac valve morphogenesis may contribute to understanding congenital heart disease associated with endocardial cushion defects.",,99
2309,35967071,Finite Element Model to Simulate Two-Phase Fluid Flow in Naturally Fractured Oil Reservoirs: Part I.,"Naturally fractured reservoirs host more than 20% of the world's total oil and gas reserves. To produce from such reservoirs efficiently, a good understanding of the reservoir behavior at various conditions is essential. This allows us to predict the reservoir performance in advance and assess its economic feasibility. However, the production from such reservoirs is challenging due to (a) uncertainty associated with the fracture map, (b) complex physics phenomena of fluid and rock interaction, and (c) lack of comprehensive knowledge of the extent, orientation, and permeability sensitivity of the fracture network. This paper addresses the abovementioned challenges by presenting a three-dimenisonal (3-D) two-phase fluid flow model in a poroelastic environment. The model is based on a hybrid methodology by combining single continuum and discrete fracture network approaches. Also, the capillary pressure effect, saturation, and relative permeability variations are considered. A mathematical formulation for three-dimensional, two immiscible fluid flows including rock deformation for the fracture network and the rock matrix is presented. A standard Galerkin-based finite element method is applied to discretize the poroelastic governing equations in space and time. The characteristic Galerkin discretization method is used to stabilize the solution of the convection equation in a finite element approach. The 3-D model is validated against IMEX commercial software and finite element package to test its robustness. The results show that the developed model has the ability to predict the two-phase flow behavior precisely, which can be used to assess the production performance of naturally fractured reservoirs. Numerical results of fluid flow profiles for single and multiple fractures with different orientations that match experimental oil drainage tests and field case studies are presented that proves the reliability of the developed multiphase flow model. Results of simulated well production data show an excellent match with the field production data.",,100
149,35983235,EL-RMLocNet: An explainable LSTM network for RNA-associated multi-compartment localization prediction.,"Subcellular localization of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) molecules provide significant insights into the functionality of RNAs and helps to explore their association with various diseases. Predominantly developed single-compartment localization predictors (SCLPs) lack to demystify RNA association with diverse biochemical and pathological processes mainly happen through RNA co-localization in multiple compartments. Limited multi-compartment localization predictors (MCLPs) manage to produce decent performance only for target RNA class of particular sub-type. Further, existing computational approaches have limited practical significance and potential to optimize therapeutics due to the poor degree of model explainability. The paper in hand presents an explainable Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network EL-RMLocNet, predictive performance and interpretability of which are optimized using a novel GeneticSeq2Vec statistical representation learning scheme and attention mechanism for accurate multi-compartment localization prediction of different RNAs solely using raw RNA sequences. GeneticSeq2Vec generates optimized statistical vectors of raw RNA sequences by capturing short and long range relations of nucleotide k-mers. Using sequence vectors generated by GeneticSeq2Vec scheme, Long Short Term Memory layers extract most informative features, weighting of which on the basis of discriminative potential for accurate multi-compartment localization prediction is performed using attention layer. Through reverse engineering, weights of statistical feature space are mapped to nucleotide k-mers patterns to make multi-compartment localization prediction decision making transparent and explainable for different RNA classes and species. Empirical evaluation indicates that EL-RMLocNet outperforms state-of-the-art predictor for subcellular localization prediction of 4 different RNA classes by an average accuracy figure of 8% for Homo Sapiens species and 6% for Mus Musculus species. EL-RMLocNet is freely available as a web server at (https://sds_genetic_analysis.opendfki.de/subcellular_loc/).",,101
527,35978731,Correlation between hepatorenal index and attenuation imaging for assessing hepatic steatosis.,"Hepatic steatosis screening is required to assess high-risk populations, identify those for intervention, monitor response and prevent disease progression and complications. Liver biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction are current gold standards, but are limited by biopsy risk factors, patient tolerance and cost. Non-invasive, cost-effective, semi-quantitative and quantitative ultrasound assessment exists. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between the semi-quantitative hepatorenal index (HRI) to assess hepatic steatosis using the quantitative attenuation imaging (ATI) as a reference standard, in adults with varied suspected liver pathologies. Data were collected prospectively between April 2019 and March 2020 at a tertiary institution on any patient >18 years referred to US assessment of suspected liver pathology. The only exclusion criteria were absent or invalid HRI or ATI measurements. Three hundred fifty eight patients were included. There was a significant weak positive correlation between HRI and ATI (r = 0.351, P < 0.001) and between HRI steatosis grade (SG) and ATI SG (r = 0.329, P < 0.001), using previously established cut-off values. With ATI as the reference standard, there was no significant correlation between HRI and hepatic steatosis within steatosis grades, nor for no (SG = 0) or any (SG > 0) hepatic steatosis. Our study in a typical heterogeneous clinical population suggests the semi-quantitative HRI is of limited use in hepatic steatosis imaging. As HRI is the objective measure of the subjective brightness (B)-mode assessment, this imaging feature may not be as reliable as previously thought. Quantitative ATI may be the preferred non-invasive technique for hepatic steatosis assessment.",,102
2475,35966783,The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations signals related to amyloid uptake in high-risk populations-A pilot fMRI study.,"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) have a higher risk to develop Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Resting-state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to document neurological involvement in the two groups from the aspect of brain dysfunction. Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) starts decades ago before the onset of clinical symptoms and may already have been associated with brain function in high-risk populations. However, this study aims to compare the patterns of fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) maps between cognitively normal high-risk groups (SCD and T2DM) and healthy elderly and evaluate the association between regional amyloid deposition and local fALFF signals in certain cortical regions. A total of 18 T2DM, 11 SCD, and 18 healthy elderlies were included in this study. The differences in the fALFF maps were compared between HC and high-risk groups. Regional amyloid deposition and local fALFF signals were obtained and further correlated in two high-risk groups. Compared to HC, the altered fALFF signals of regions were shown in SCD such as the left posterior cerebellum, left putamen, and cingulate gyrus. The T2DM group illustrated altered neural activity in the superior temporal gyrus, supplementary motor area, and precentral gyrus. The correlation between fALFF signals and amyloid deposition was negative in the left anterior cingulate cortex for both groups. In the T2DM group, a positive correlation was shown in the right occipital lobe and left mesial temporal lobe. The altered fALFF signals were demonstrated in high-risk groups compared to HC. Very early amyloid deposition in SCD and T2DM groups was observed to affect the neural activity mainly involved in the default mode network (DMN).",,103
1148,35973773,Proteome analysis reveals the molecular basis of honeybee brain and midgut response to sulfoxaflor.,"Sulfoxaflor is a widely used pesticide in agriculture. However, the molecular effects of sublethal sulfoxaflor on honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) remain elusive. Here, the effects of a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor (0.05 μg/bee) on the brain and midgut proteome response of the honeybee were investigated. Exposure to sublethal sulfoxaflor doses did not cause significant honeybee death, but it induced significant alterations in the brain and midgut proteomes. After sulfoxaflor challenge, 135 and 28 proteins were differentially regulated in the brain and midgut, respectively. The up-regulated proteins were mainly implicated in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter transport and drug metabolism processes, and included in particular enzymes of the citrate cycle and cellular respiration process, such as ATP citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunits, and NADH dehydrogenase. These findings suggest that honeybees enhance energy metabolism in the midgut and brain to resist sulfoxaflor challenge. Notably, treatment with sulfoxaflor resulted in a 6.8 times increase in expression levels of the major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJP1) in the brain, and knockdown of MRJP1 mRNA expression using RNA interference significantly decreased the survival rate, indicating that MRJP1 may play an important role in sulfoxaflor tolerance. Our data reveals that sulfoxaflor influences multiple processes related to both metabolism and the nervous system, and provides novel insights into the molecular basis of the honeybee brain and midgut response to sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor.",,104
2129,35967389,Monoclonal antibodies targeting the influenza virus N6 neuraminidase.,"Influenza A viruses are a diverse species that include 16 true hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes and 9 true neuraminidase (NA) subtypes. While the antigenicity of many HA subtypes is reasonably well studied, less is known about NA antigenicity, especially when it comes to non-human subtypes that only circulate in animal reservoirs. The N6 subtype NAs are mostly found in viruses infecting birds. However, they have also been identified in viruses that infect mammals, such as swine and seals. More recently, highly pathogenic H5N6 subtype viruses have caused rare infections and mortality in humans. Here, we generated murine mAbs to the N6 NA, characterized their breadth and antiviral properties in vitro and in vivo and mapped their epitopes by generating escape mutant viruses. We found that the antibodies had broad reactivity across the American and Eurasian N6 lineages, but relatively little binding to the H5N6 NA. Several of the antibodies exhibited strong NA inhibition activity and some also showed activity in the antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity reporter assay and neutralization assay. In addition, we generated escape mutant viruses for six monoclonal antibodies and found mutations on the lateral ridge of the NA. Lastly, we observed variable protection in H4N6 mouse challenge models when the antibodies were given prophylactically.",,105

2116,35967402,Identification of CD8+ T-cell epitope from multiple myeloma-specific antigen AKAP4.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder affecting mainly the elderly population. Revolutionary progress in immunotherapy has been made recently, including monoclonal antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapies; however, the high relapse rate remains problematic. Therefore, combination therapies against different targets would be a reasonable strategy. In this study, we present a new X-chromosome encoded testis-cancer antigen (CTA) AKAP4 as a potential target for MM. AKAP4 is expressed in MM cell lines and MM primary malignant plasma cells. HLA-A*0201-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) induced by dendritic cells (DCs) transduced with an adenovirus vector encoding the full-length AKAP4 gene were demonstrated to lyse AKAP4+ myeloma cells. Seven of the 12 candidate epitopes predicated by the BIMAS and SYFPEITH algorithms were able to bind HLA-A*0201 in the T2 binding assay, of which only two peptides were able to induce CTL cytotoxicity in the co-culture of peptide-loaded human mature dendritic cells and the autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the same HLA-A*0201 donor. The AKAP4 630-638 VLMLIQKLL was identified as the strongest CTL epitope by the human IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. Finally, the VLMLIQKLL-specific CTLs can lyse the HLA-A*0201+AKAP4+ myeloma cell line U266 in vitro, and inhibit tumor growth in the mice bearing U266 tumors in vivo. These results suggest that the VLMLIQKLL epitope could be used to develop cancer vaccine or T-cell receptor transgenic T cells (TCR-T) to kill myeloma cells.",,108
1303,35970560,Complementary roles of primate dorsal premotor and pre-supplementary motor areas to the control of motor sequences.,"We are able to temporally organize multiple movements in a purposeful manner in everyday life. Both the dorsal premotor (PMd) and pre-supplementary motor areas (pre-SMA) are known to be involved in the performance of motor sequences. However, it is unclear how each area differentially contributes to controlling multiple motor sequences. To address this issue, we recorded single-unit activity in both areas while monkeys (one male, one female) performed sixteen motor sequences. Each sequence comprised either a series of two identical movements (repetitive) or two different movements (non-repetitive). The sequence was initially instructed with visual signals but had to be remembered thereafter. Here we showed that the activity of single neurons in both areas transitioned from reactive- to predictive encoding while motor sequences were memorized. In the memory-guided trials, in particular, the activity of PMd cells preferentially represented the second movement in the sequence leading to a reward generally irrespective of the first movement. Such activity frequently began even before the first movement in a prospective manner, and was enhanced in non-repetitive sequences. Behaviorally, a lack of the activity enhancement often resulted in premature execution of the second movement. In contrast, cells in pre-SMA instantiated particular sequences of actions by coordinating switching or non-switching movements in sequence. Our findings suggest that PMd and pre-SMA play complementary roles within behavioral contexts: PMd preferentially controls the movement that leads to a reward rather than the sequence per se, whereas pre-SMA coordinates all elements in a sequence by integrating temporal orders of multiple movements.Significance statement:Although both PMd and pre-SMA are involved in the control of motor sequences, it is not clear how these two areas contribute to coordination of sequential movements differently. To address this issue, we directly compared neuronal activity in the two areas recorded while monkeys memorized and performed multiple motor sequences. Our findings suggest that PMd preferentially represents the final action that ultimately leads to a reward in a prospective manner, whereas the pre-SMA coordinates switching among multiple actions within the context of the sequence. Our findings are of significance to understand the distinct roles for motor-related areas in the planning and executing motor sequences and the pathophysiology of apraxia and/or Parkinson's diseases that disables skilled motor actions.",,109
1499,35968388,Automatic method for individual parcellation of manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of rat brain.,"To construct an automatic method for individual parcellation of manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) of rat brain with high accuracy, which could preserve the inherent voxel intensity and Regions of interest (ROI) morphological characteristics simultaneously. The transformation relationship from standardized space to individual space was obtained by firstly normalizing individual image to the Paxinos space and then inversely transformed. On the other hand, all the regions defined in the atlas image were separated and resaved as binary mask images. Then, transforming the mask images into individual space via the inverse transformations and reslicing using the 4th B-spline interpolation algorithm. The boundary of these transformed regions was further refined by image erosion and expansion operator, and finally combined together to generate the individual parcellations. Moreover, two groups of MEMRI images were used for evaluation. We found that the individual parcellations were satisfied, and the inherent image intensity was preserved. The statistical significance of case-control comparisons was further optimized. We have constructed a new automatic method for individual parcellation of rat brain MEMRI images, which could preserve the inherent voxel intensity and further be beneficial in case-control statistical analyses. This method could also be extended to other imaging modalities, even other experiments species. It would facilitate the accuracy and significance of ROI-based imaging analyses.",,110

422,35979189,Dedicated Psychiatry Clinic for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Has a Positive Impact on Depression Scores.,"Psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, are significantly more common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We established an integrated psychiatry clinic for IBD patients at our tertiary center IBD clinic to provide patients with critical, but frequently unavailable, coordinated mental health services. We undertook this study to evaluate the impact of this service on psychiatric outcomes, quality of life, and symptom experience. We performed a longitudinal prospective study comparing patients who had been cared for at our integrated IBD-psychiatry clinic to those who had not. We abstracted demographic and clinical information as well as contemporaneous responses to validated surveys. Thirty-six patients cared for in the IBD psychiatry clinic were compared to a control cohort of 35 IBD patients. There was a significant reduction in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) depression score over time in the study cohort (p = 0.001), though not in the HADS anxiety score. When compared to the control group, the study cohort showed a significant reduction in the HADS depression score. No significant differences were observed in the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index, or Short IBD Questionnaire. This is the first study to evaluate the impact of an integrated psychiatry clinic for IBD patients. Unlike their control counterparts, individuals treated in this clinic had a significant reduction in the mean HADS depression score. Larger scale studies are necessary to verify these findings. However, this study suggests that use of an integrated psychiatry IBD clinic model can result in improvement in mental health outcomes, even in the absence of significant changes in IBD activity.",,112
1506,35968381,The effect of photobiomodulation on the brain during wakefulness and sleep.,"Over the last seventy years or so, many previous studies have shown that photobiomodulation, the use of red to near infrared light on body tissues, can improve central and peripheral neuronal function and survival in both health and in disease. These improvements are thought to arise principally from an impact of photobiomodulation on mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial mechanisms in a range of different cell types, including neurones. This impact has downstream effects on many stimulatory and protective genes. An often-neglected feature of nearly all of these improvements is that they have been induced during the state of wakefulness. Recent studies have shown that when applied during the state of sleep, photobiomodulation can also be of benefit, but in a different way, by improving the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and the clearance of toxic waste-products from the brain. In this review, we consider the potential differential effects of photobiomodulation dependent on the state of arousal. We speculate that the effects of photobiomodulation is on different cells and systems depending on whether it is applied during wakefulness or sleep, that it may follow a circadian rhythm. We speculate further that the arousal-dependent photobiomodulation effects are mediated principally through a biophoton - ultra-weak light emission - network of communication and repair across the brain.",,113
2207,35967311,Polyethylene glycol 20 kDa-induced vacuolation does not impair phagocytic function of human monocyte-derived macrophages.,"Conjugation to polyethylene glycol (PEG) is commonly used to enhance drug delivery and efficacy by extending the half-life of the drug molecule. This has important implications for reducing treatment burden in diseases that require chronic prophylaxis, such as hemophilia. Clearance of PEG molecules with high molecular weights (≥ 40 kDa) has been reported to cause cellular vacuolation in mammals. Rurioctocog alfa pegol (PEGylated recombinant coagulation factor VIII) contains a 20-kDa PEG. This study investigated the effects of exposure to 20-kDa PEG (10 μg/ml to 10 mg/ml) on the morphology and function of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in vitro. Exposure to PEG for 24 hours was associated with significant vacuolation only at concentrations of 1 mg/ml or more, which far exceed the levels associated with clinically relevant doses of rurioctocog alfa pegol. Immunofluorescence staining of PEG was detected in the cytoplasm of MDMs, indicating uptake into the cells. No impairment of MDM phagocytic activity (ability to ingest fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli) was observed with 24-hour exposure to PEG, even at concentrations associated with significant vacuolation. Furthermore, PEG exposure did not have significant effects on cytokine secretion in resting or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated MDMs, or on the expression of cell surface markers in stimulated MDMs. Cell viability was not affected by 24-hour exposure to PEG. In conclusion, vacuolation of human MDMs after exposure to 20-kDa PEG only occurred with PEG concentrations far in excess of those equivalent to clinically relevant doses of rurioctocog alfa pegol and did not affect MDM viability or functionality. Together, these results support the concept that PEG-mediated vacuolation is an adaptive cellular response rather than a toxic effect.",,114
1756,35967980,Establishment of blood glycosidase activities and their excursions in sepsis.,"Glycosidases are hydrolytic enzymes studied principally in the context of intracellular catabolism within the lysosome. Therefore, glycosidase activities are classically measured in experimentally acidified assay conditions reflecting their low pH optima. However, glycosidases are also present in the bloodstream where they may retain sufficient activity to participate in the regulation of glycoprotein half-lives, proteostasis, and disease pathogenesis. We have, herein, established at physiological pH 7.4 in blood plasma and sera the normal ranges of four major glycosidase activities essential for blood glycoprotein remodeling in healthy mice and humans. These activities included β-galactosidase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, α-mannosidase, and α-fucosidase. We have identified their origins to include the mammalian genes Glb1, HexB, Man2a1, and Fuca1. In experimental sepsis, excursions of glycosidase activities occurred with differences in host responses to discrete bacterial pathogens. Among similar excursions in human sepsis, the elevation of β-galactosidase activity was a prognostic indicator of increased likelihood of patient death.",,115
1862,35967778,Fructose metabolism and its role in pig production: A mini-review.,"Epidemiological studies have shown that excessive intake of fructose is largely responsible for the increasing incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver, obesity, and diabetes. However, depending on the amount of fructose consumption from diet, the metabolic role of fructose is controversial. Recently, there have been increasing studies reporting that diets low in fructose expand the surface area of the gut and increase nutrient absorption in mouse model, which is widely used in fructose-related studies. However, excessive fructose consumption spills over from the small intestine into the liver for steatosis and increases the risk of colon cancer. Therefore, suitable animal models may be needed to study fructose-induced metabolic changes. Along with its use in global meat production, pig is well-known as a biomedical model with an advantage over murine and other animal models as it has similar nutrition and metabolism to human in anatomical and physiological aspects. Here, we review the characteristics and metabolism of fructose and summarize observations of fructose in pig reproduction, growth, and development as well as acting as a human biomedical model. This review highlights fructose metabolism from the intestine to the blood cycle and presents the critical role of fructose in pig, which could provide new strategies for curbing human metabolic diseases and promoting pig production.",,116
2135,35967383,An update on Ym1 and its immunoregulatory role in diseases.,"Ym1 is a rodent-specific chitinase-like protein (CLP) lacking catalytic activity, whose cellular origins are mainly macrophages, neutrophils and other cells. Although the detailed function of Ym1 remains poorly understood, Ym1 has been generally recognized as a fundamental feature of alternative activation of macrophages in mice and hence one of the prevalent detecting targets in macrophage phenotype distinguishment. Studies have pointed out that Ym1 may have regulatory effects, which are multifaceted and even contradictory, far more than just a mere marker. Allergic lung inflammation, parasite infection, autoimmune diseases, and central nervous system diseases have been found associations with Ym1 to varying degrees. Thus, insights into Ym1's role in diseases would help us understand the pathogenesis of different diseases and clarify the genuine roles of CLPs in mammals. This review summarizes the information on Ym1 from the gene to its expression and regulation and focuses on the association between Ym1 and diseases.",,117
1877,35967739,ADSC-exo@MMP-PEG smart hydrogel promotes diabetic wound healing by optimizing cellular functions and relieving oxidative stress.,"Diabetic wound complications are financially costly and difficult to heal in worldwide. Whereas the therapies of diabetic wound, such as wound dressing, endocrine therapy or flap-transplantations, were not satisfied. Based on our previous study of exosome secreted by adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC-exo), we loaded ADSC-exo into the matrix metalloproteinase degradable polyethylene glycol (MMP-PEG) smart hydrogel. Physical and chemical properties of ADSC-exo@MMP-PEG smart hydrogel were tested by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), weight loss examination, etc. As the hydrogel degraded in response to MMP, ADSC-exo was released and subsequently enhanced cell function via Akt signaling. Moreover, treatment with ADSC-exo@MMP-PEG smart hydrogel significantly relieved the H2O2-induced oxidative stress, which was widely recognized as a major cause of diabetic wound nonhealing. Similar results were achieved in mice diabetic wound models, in which the ADSC-exo@MMP-PEG treatment group displayed a significantly accelerated wound healing. To summarize, the present smart hydrogel with enzyme-response and exosome-release was proved to be benefit for diabetic wounds healing, which provides a reliable theoretical basis for application of ADSC-exo in treatment of diabetic wounds.",,118
385,35979289,Successful treatment of Morbihan disease with total glucosides of paeony: A case report.,"Morbihan disease is a rare cutaneous disorder characterized by non-pitting edema and erythema of the upper two-thirds of the face. In severe cases, orbital and facial contour changes may affect the visual field, and there is no guideline for the standard treatment of this disease. Existing treatment methods have been reported to be associated with long medication cycle, easy recurrence after drug withdrawal, and multiple adverse reactions. A 55-year-old Chinese woman presented to our hospital with non-pitting edema and erythema of the upper two thirds of her face for 5 mo. Physical examination showed obvious edema and erythema on the upper face. The boundary was unclear, the lesions were hard and non-pitting, and infiltration was obvious by touch. Pathological examination revealed mild hyperkeratosis of the epidermis, nodular inflammatory lesions in the dermis, epithelioid granuloma, and inflammatory cell infiltration with lymphocytes and histiocytes around skin appendages and blood vessels. Alcian blue staining, acid fast staining, silver staining and periodic acid-Schiff staining were negative. The patient was diagnosed with Morbihan disease. She was treated with prednisone acetate and tripterygium wilfordii polyglycoside tablets for 4 mo, and the edema was slightly reduced, but transaminase levels were significantly increased. Compound glycyrrhizin capsules were administered for liver protection for 1 mo; however, facial edema did not significantly improve and transaminase levels continued to increase. Total glucosides of paeony capsules were then administered for 4 mo, and transaminase level returned to normal and the patient's facial edema disappeared completely. Total glucosides of paeony has a remarkable effect in Morbihan disease, without adverse reactions.",,119
2226,35967291,In rheumatoid arthritis inflamed joints share dominant patient-specific B-cell clones.,"In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) different joints were shown to share the same dominant T-cell clones, suggesting shared characteristics of the inflammatory process and indicating that strategies to selectively target the antigen receptor might be feasible. Since T- and B-lymphocytes closely interact in adaptive responses, we analysed to what extent different joints also share dominant B-cell clones. In 11 RA patients, quantitative B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire analysis was performed in simultaneously obtained samples from inflamed synovial tissue (ST) from distinct locations within one joint, from multiple joints, from synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB). ST biopsies from different locations in the same joint showed clear overlap in the top-25 dominant BCR clones (16.7%, SD 12.5), in the same range as the overlap between ST and SF in the same joint (8.0%, SD 8.8) and the overlap between ST-ST between different joints (9.1%, SD 8.2), but clearly higher than the overlap between ST and PB (1.7%, SD 2.4; p<0.05) and SF and PB (2.7%, SD 4.1; p<0.05). Interestingly, these figures were substantially lower than the overlap observed in previous T-cell clonality studies. We conclude that in RA BCR clonal responses may be more localized than TCR clonal responses, pointing to antigen-selective influx, proliferation and/or maturation of B-cells. B lineage cells in the SF may adequately represent the dominant BCR clones of the ST, which is in contrast to T-cells. Collectively, the presence of shared B- and especially T-cells in different joints from the same patient suggests that approaches might be feasible that aim to develop antigen-receptor specific targeting of lymphocyte clones in RA as an alternative to more generalized immunosuppressive strategies.",,120
2476,35966782,ObReco-2: Two-step validation of a tool to assess memory deficits using 360° videos.,"Traditional neuropsychological evaluations are usually carried out using psychometric paper and pencil tests. Nevertheless, there is a continuous discussion concerning their efficacy to capture life-like abilities. The introduction of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality (VR) and 360° spherical photos and videos, has improved the ecological validity of the neuropsychological assessment. The possibility of simulating realistic environments and situations allows clinicians to evaluate patients in realistic activities. Moreover, 360° photos and videos seem to provide higher levels of graphical realism and technical user-friendliness compared to standard VR, regardless of their limitations in terms of interactivity. We developed a novel 360° tool, ObReco-2 (Object Recognition version 2), for the assessment of visual memory which simulates a daily situation in a virtual house. More precisely, patients are asked to memorize some objects that need to be moved for a relocation. After this phase, they are asked to recall them after 15 min and later to recognize them in the same environment. Here we present a first study about the usability of ObReco-2, and a second one exploring its clinical efficacy and updated usability data. We focused on Free Recall and Recognition scores, comparing the performances obtained by the participants in the standard and the 360° test. The preliminary results support the use of 360° technology for enhancing the ecological value of standard memory assessment tests.",,121
419,35979192,Diagnostic Delay of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Is Significantly Higher in Public versus Private Health Care System in Mexican Patients.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) characterized by a fluctuating course with periods of clinical activity and remission. No previous studies have demonstrated the frequency of delay at diagnosis and its associated factors in Mexico and Latin America. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic delay of IBD in the last 4 decades in 2 different health care systems (public vs. private) and its associated factors. This is a cohort study that included 1,056 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of IBD from public and private health care systems. The diagnostic delay was defined as time >1 year from the onset of symptoms to the confirmed diagnosis for patients with UC and 2 years for patients with CD. Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS v.24 program. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was taken as significant. The delay at diagnosis decreased significantly by 24.9% in the last 4 decades. The factors associated with the diagnostic delay were proctitis in UC, clinical course >2 relapses per year and IBD surgeries for CD. We found a delay at diagnosis in 35.2% of IBD patients in the public versus 16.9% in the private health care system (p = 0.00001). We found a significant diagnosis delay of IBD in 35.2% from the public health care system versus 16.9% in the private health care system.",,122
172,35982984,Benefits of Hypothermia for Young Patients with Acute Subdural Hematoma: A Computed Tomography Analysis of the Brain Hypothermia Study.,"Therapeutic hypothermia for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been repeatedly studied, but no past studies have assessed the detailed head computed tomography (CT) findings. We sought to investigate individual CT findings of severe TBI patients treated with targeted temperature management utilizing the head CT database obtained from the Brain Hypothermia study. Enrolled patients underwent either mild therapeutic hypothermia (32.0°C-34.0°C) or fever control (35.5°C-37.0°C). We assessed individual head CT images on arrival and after rewarming and investigated the correlations with outcomes. The initial CT data were available for 125 patients (hypothermia group = 80, fever control group = 45). Baseline characteristics and CT findings, such as hematoma thickness and midline shift, were similar in all aspects between the two groups. The favorable outcomes in the hypothermia and fever control groups were 38 (47.5%) and 24 (53.3%; p = 0.53) for all 125 patients, respectively; 21 (46.7%) vs. 10 (38.5%; p = 0.50) for 71 patients with acute subdural hematoma (SDH), respectively; and 12 (75.0%) vs. 4 (36.4%; p = 0.045) in 27 young adults (≤50 years) with acute SDH, respectively. There was a trend toward favorable outcomes for earlier time to reach 35.5°C (190 vs. 377 min, p = 0.052) and surgery (155 vs. 180 min, p = 0.096) in young patients with acute SDH. The second CT image revealed progression of the brain injury. This study demonstrated the potential benefits of early hypothermia in young patients with acute SDH, despite no difference in CT findings between the two groups. However, the small number of cases involved hindered the drawing of definitive conclusions. Future studies are warranted to validate the results.",,123
1149,35973772,Why is oral-induced RNAi inefficient in Diatraea saccharalis? A possible role for DsREase and other nucleases.,"The efficiency of RNAi technology in insects varies considerably, particularly in lepidopterans. An important limiting factor of RNAi-mediated gene silencing is the degradation of dsRNA by insect nucleases before cellular uptake. To date, few studies have reported effective gene knockdown in the sugarcane borer Diatraea saccharalis. However, yielding contradictory results when using oral delivery. Further, the RNAi efficiency in D. saccharalis and presumed activity of gut nucleases remain poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated whether gene silencing was feasible via dsRNA feeding in D. saccharalis. Two different genes were tested, juvenile hormone esterase (DsJHE) and chitin synthase 1 (DsCHS1). Discrete knockdown was verified only for DsCHS1 with high dsRNA dosages and long exposure times. Neither mortality nor abnormal phenotypes were observed after treatment with any tested dsRNA. It was also verified that dsRNAs were quickly degraded when incubated with gut juice. Furthermore, we identified four possible nucleases that could reduce the knockdown efficiency in D. saccharalis. Three of them had the endonuclease_NS domain (DsNucleases), and one had the PIN domain (DsREase), with REase-like genes being scarcely represented in databanks. We further remark that DsNuclease1 and DsREase are highly expressed in the larval gut, and DsREase was upregulated as insects were fed with artificial diet (without dsRNA), and also when injected with dsRNA. Conversely, no nuclease was triggered when insects were fed with a sucrose droplet containing dsRNA. Thus, our findings suggest that nuclease activity within the gut is one of the possible reasons for the inefficiency of RNAi in D. saccharalis. Our data may shed light on the challenges to overcome when introducing RNAi as a strategy for controlling lepidopteran pests.",,124
1380,35969072,Enhanced Reproducibility and Precision of High-Throughput Quantification of Bacterial Growth Data Using a Microplate Reader.,"This study aimed to develop a repeatable, reliable, high-throughput protocol to monitor bacterial growth in 96-well plates and analyze the maximum growth rate. The growth curves and maximum growth rates of two bacterial species were determined. Issues including (i) lid condensation, (ii) pathlength correction, (iii) inoculation size, (iv) sampling time interval, and (v) spatial bias were investigated. The repeatability of the protocol was assessed with three independent technical replications, with a standard deviation of 0.03 between the runs. The maximum growth rates of Bacillus mycoides and Paenibacillus tundrae were determined to be (mean ± SD) 0.99 h-1 ±  0.03 h-1 and 0.85 h-1 ± 0.025 h-1, respectively. These bacteria are more challenging to monitor optically due to their affinity to clump together. This study demonstrates the critical importance of inoculation size, path length correction, lid warming, sampling time intervals, and well-plate spatial bias to obtain reliable, accurate, and reproducible data on microplate readers. The developed protocol and its verification steps can be expanded to other methods using microplate readers and high-throughput protocols, reducing the researchers' innate errors and material costs.",,125
2355,35967021,Experimental Research on Enhanced Oil Recovery Methods for Gas Injection of Fractured Reservoirs Based on Microfluidic Chips.,"Gas injection is an effective method to enhance oil recovery of low-permeability and tight reservoirs, while the complicated fractures distributed in the formation have a noticeable effect on the performance of gas injection. In this study, three methods of gas injection were employed to conduct microfluidic experiments using micromodels simulating fractured reservoirs. The sweep efficiency and oil displacement efficiency of pores and throats, fractures, and the whole region were measured respectively to evaluate the oil displacement effects of the different gas injection methods. Moreover, the microscopic displacement process and the morphology of residual oil in porous media were analyzed to investigate the behavior of gas activated oil. The experimental results show that there are three stages of gas displacing oil: the oil in fractures was displaced first, then the oil in the pores and throats around the fracture was displaced, and finally the gas channeling occurred in fractures. Moreover, the sweep efficiency and oil displacement efficiency showed a tendency of increasing fast first and then reaching a steady state. Simultaneous injection of gas and water showed an optimal enhanced oil recovery effect among these three injection methods. Gas can invade deep throats, and those are difficult for water to sweep. However, the higher viscosity of water endowed it a smaller mobility than gas. And, the channeling in the two-phase mixing region was inhibited more obviously. The overall sweep efficiency and oil displacement efficiency increased about 18.4% and 13.4%, respectively.",,126
1389,35969049,Light-induced In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy for Observation of the Liquid-Soft Matter Interaction.,"The current protocol describes the modifications of the transmission electron microscope (TEM) setup for in situ light-induced observations. A glass optical fiber inserted into the electron column above the objective lens polepiece, and a laser, an adjustable light source, was used to fabricate the device. After the illuminator has been calibrated using an external measuring system, it allows one to adjust the intensity of the lighting to the needs of the observed process. This lighting system was utilized to image antimicrobial photodynamic therapy phenomena, which are currently the subject of intense research. The sample was prepared by spotting a suspension of bacteria on a carbon, graphene, or silicon nitride substrate, blotting the excess solution, spotting the photosensitizer solution, blotting the excess liquid again, and then assembling the liquid cell with a second substrate or graphene film. The process of the imaging experiment itself includes choosing the right place for observation with the use of low magnification and a minimum dose of electrons, and then cyclical activation of the light source to capture subsequent images at specified intervals with the minimum amount of electrons necessary. The electron dose of each exposure and the time and intensity of lighting used need to be carefully recorded due to the complexity of the observed phenomena as, at the same time, the process is both light- and electron-driven. After the actual experiment is performed, additional control observations must be made, in which the same doses of electrons are used but without additional light influence and smaller doses of electrons are used for higher doses of light. This makes it possible to distinguish light-induced microstructural effects from those caused by electrons in both the fields of life and materials science.",,127
1185,35973239,Aberrant beta-band brain connectivity predicts speech motor planning deficits in post-stroke aphasia.,"Impairments in speech production can have devastating effects on the overall quality of life in left-hemisphere stroke survivors with aphasia; however, there is a paucity of research focusing on neural deficits in speech motor planning networks that are activated prior to the onset of speech production in this clinical population. In the present study, we examined directional brain connectivity correlates of speech preparation and planning in low-β (13-20 Hz) and high-β (21-30 Hz) band neural oscillations in participants aphasia compared with controls prior to the onset of speech. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were concurrently recorded from 33 participants with post-stroke aphasia and 22 neurologically intact controls while they engaged in speech production tasks. Using Granger causality, brain connectivity was calculated between electrode pairs that fell within fronto-frontal, fronto-central, and fronto-parietal networks implicated in sensorimotor integration and speech planning. Clinical assessment was further conducted in post-stroke participants to measure the severity of language impairment associated with aphasia. Increased intra-hemispheric connectivity was found within low- and high-β bands in the left parieto-central and parieto-frontal as well as the right fronto-frontal and fronto-central electrodes in post-stroke participants compared with controls prior to the onset of speech production. In addition, we found that decreased inter-hemispheric centro-central connectivity within high-β band was negatively correlated with aphasia severity whereas increased parieto-frontal connectivity within high-β band was positively correlated with aphasia severity. These findings suggest that participants with left-hemisphere stroke express aberrant brain connectivity within low- and high-β bands in both left and right hemispheres during the planning phase of speech production, and that these deficits are associated with specific aspects of their language impairment, as indicated by their clinical symptoms due to aphasia.",,128
226,35982794,Multivalent interactions with RNA drive recruitment and dynamics in biomolecular condensates in Xenopus oocytes.,"RNA localization and biomolecular condensate formation are key biological strategies for organizing the cytoplasm and generating cellular polarity. In Xenopus oocytes, RNAs required for germ layer patterning localize in biomolecular condensates, termed Localization bodies (L-bodies). Here, we have used an L-body RNA-binding protein, PTBP3, to test the role of RNA-protein interactions in regulating the biophysical characteristics of L-bodies in vivo and PTBP3-RNA condensates in vitro. Our results reveal that RNA-protein interactions drive recruitment of PTBP3 and localized RNA to L-bodies and that multivalent interactions tune the dynamics of the PTBP3 after localization. In a concentration-dependent manner, RNA becomes non-dynamic and interactions with the RNA determine PTBP3 dynamics within these biomolecular condensates in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, RNA, and not protein, is required for maintenance of the PTBP3-RNA condensates in vitro, pointing to a model where RNA serves as a non-dynamic substructure in these condensates.",,129
1758,35967978,Temporal analysis of Lassa virus infection and transmission in experimentally infected Mastomys natalensis.,"Little is known about the temporal patterns of infection and transmission of Lassa virus (LASV) within its natural reservoir (Mastomys natalensis). Here, we characterize infection dynamics and transmissibility of a LASV isolate (Soromba-R) in adult lab-reared M. natalensis originating from Mali. The lab-reared M. natalenesis proved to be highly susceptible to LASV isolates from geographically distinct regions of West Africa via multiple routes of exposure, with 50% infectious doses of < 1 TCID50. Postinoculation, LASV Soromba-R established a systemic infection with no signs of clinical disease. Viral RNA was detected in all nine tissues examined with peak concentrations detected between days 7 and 14 postinfection within most organs. There was an overall trend toward clearance of virus within 40 days of infection in most organs. The exception is lung specimens, which retained positivity throughout the course of the 85-day study. Direct (contact) and indirect (fomite) transmission experiments demonstrated 40% of experimentally infected M. natalensis were capable of transmitting LASV to naïve animals, with peak transmissibility occurring between 28 and 42 days post-inoculation. No differences in patterns of infection or transmission were noted between male and female experimentally infected rodents. Adult lab-reared M. natalensis are highly susceptible to genetically distinct LASV strains developing a temporary asymptomatic infection associated with virus shedding resulting in contact and fomite transmission within a cohort.",,130
2183,35967335,Monoclonal antibodies effectively potentiate complement activation and phagocytosis of Staphylococcus epidermidis in neonatal human plasma.,"Central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) with Staphylococcus epidermidis are a major cause of morbidity in neonates, who have an increased risk of infection because of their immature immune system. As especially preterm neonates suffer from antibody deficiency, clinical studies into preventive therapies have thus far focused on antibody supplementation with pooled intravenous immunoglobulins from healthy donors (IVIG) but with little success. Here we study the potential of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against S. epidermidis to induce phagocytic killing by human neutrophils. Nine different mAbs recognizing Staphylococcal surface components were cloned and expressed as human IgG1s. In binding assays, clones rF1, CR5133 and CR6453 showed the strongest binding to S. epidermidis ATCC14990 and CR5133 and CR6453 bound the majority of clinical isolates from neonatal sepsis (19 out of 20). To study the immune-activating potential of rF1, CR5133 and CR6453, bacteria were opsonized with mAbs in the presence or absence of complement. We observed that activation of the complement system is essential to induce efficient phagocytosis of S. epidermidis. Complement activation and phagocytic killing could be enhanced by Fc-mutations that improve IgG1 hexamerization on cellular surfaces. Finally, we studied the ability of the mAbs to activate complement in r-Hirudin neonatal plasma conditions. We show that classical pathway complement activity in plasma isolated from neonatal cord blood is comparable to adult levels. Furthermore, mAbs could greatly enhance phagocytosis of S. epidermidis in neonatal plasma. Altogether, our findings provide insights that are crucial for optimizing anti-S. epidermidis mAbs as prophylactic agents for neonatal CLABSI.",,131
2275,35967156,A Case of Steroid-Responsive Severe Pneumonia Following a Recent COVID-19 Infection in a Patient With Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated With Streptococcal Infection.,"A twenty-two-year-old woman with a history of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) on rituximab presented with fever, abdominal pain, and worsening shortness of breath requiring supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula one month after a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection from which she was minimally symptomatic and had recovered. Radiographic studies revealed bilateral patchy consolidations interspersed with ground-glass opacities (GGO). She was started on antibiotics for presumed community-acquired pneumonia with no improvement. Echocardiography revealed preserved biventricular function and a suspected intracardiac mass. A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) revealed myocarditis and no intracardiac mass. Fever persisted and oxygen requirements increased from FiO2 0.4 to 1.0. Repeat CXR showed subtotal left hemithorax opacification. Bronchoscopic samples showed a negative Gram stain and an unremarkable cell count differential. In view of this and given her lack of response to antibiotics with worsening respiratory status, high-dose steroids were started. She improved rapidly, and six days later she was off oxygen. Transbronchial biopsies showed benign parenchyma with some intra-alveolar fibrin deposition with no definitive evidence of viral cytopathic effect, vasculitis, or diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Follow-up imaging in the pulmonary clinic revealed improvement of prior airspace disease with some new migratory opacities that completely resolved after 12 weeks. Pulmonary function tests and repeat CMRI were normal three months after discharge. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MISA), post-covid organizing pneumonia (OP), and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) are rare and potentially steroid-responsive causes of pneumonia, which were in our differential diagnosis. It is imperative to consider the rare possibility of steroid-responsive pneumonia-like MISA, post-COVID-OP, and IRIS in patients with worsening respiratory symptoms following a recent SARS-CoV 2 infection.",,132
1214,35971511,Hydrogen Sulfide and Silicon Together Alleviate Chromium (VI) Toxicity by Modulating Morpho-Physiological and Key Antioxidant Defense Systems in Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) Varieties.,"Extensive use of chromium (Cr) in anthropogenic activities leads to Cr toxicity in plants causing serious threat to the environment. Cr toxicity impairs plant growth, development, and metabolism. In the present study, we explored the effect of NaHS [a hydrogen sulfide; (H2S), donor] and silicon (Si), alone or in combination, on two chickpea (Cicer arietinum) varieties (Pusa 2085 and Pusa Green 112), in pot conditions under Cr stress. Cr stress increased accumulation of Cr reduction of the plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase activity and decreased in photosynthetic pigments, essential minerals, relative water contents (RWC), and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in both the varieties. Exogenous application of NaHS and Si on plants exposed to Cr stress mitigated the effect of Cr and enhanced the physiological and biochemical parameters by reducing Cr accumulation and oxidative stress in roots and leaves. The interactive effects of NaHS and Si showed a highly significant and positive correlation with PM H+-ATPase activity, photosynthetic pigments, essential minerals, RWC, proline content, and enzymatic antioxidant activities (catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, dehydroascorbate reductase, superoxide dismutase, and monodehydroascorbate reductase). A similar trend was observed for non-enzymatic antioxidant activities (ascorbic acid, glutathione, oxidized glutathione, and dehydroascorbic acid level) in leaves while oxidative damage in roots and leaves showed a negative correlation. Exogenous application of NaHS + Si could enhance Cr stress tolerance in chickpea and field studies are warranted for assessing crop yield under Cr-affected area.",,133
2396,35966976,Intriguing Role of the Mesentery in Ileocolic Crohn's Disease.,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory bowel disease with unknown etiology. Up to 80% of patients will eventually require surgery throughout their lifetime, and often repeated resections are required for disease recurrence. Observations of creeping fat surrounding the diseased intestine renewed interest in the mesentery, recently defined as an organ with endocrine and immune functions. According to the inside-out model, the mesentery may be primarily affected in CD and subsequent cause alterations in the mucosa. Recently, lower surgical recurrence rates have been reported with en-bloc excision of the mesentery adjoining the diseased intestine. Results of ongoing randomized controlled trials may clarify the role of the mesentery in CD and possibly lead to its adoption as standard during surgery for Crohn's disease.",,134
2350,35967026,Investigation of Antimicrobial Activity and Biocompatibility of Biogenic Silver Nanoparticles Synthesized using Syzigyum cymosum Extract.,"Nanotherapeutics has emerged as the most sought after approach to tackle the menace of drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. Among others, biogenic silver nanoparticles (bAgNPs) synthesized using medicinal plant extracts demonstrate promising antibacterial propensity with excellent biocompatibility. Herein, bAgNPs were synthesized through the green chemistry approach using Syzygium cymosum leaf extract as a reducing agent at different pH values (i.e., 5, 7, 8, and 10). The average size of bAgNPs synthesized at pH 5, 7, 8, and 10 was 23.3, 21.3, 17.2, and 35.3 nm, respectively, and all the nanoparticles were negatively charged. Their antibacterial potential was investigated against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli DH5α, E. coli K12, enteropathogenic E. coli, and Salmonella typhi. The highest antibacterial activity was exhibited by bAgNPs synthesized at pH 8 against all the tested bacterial strains, which can be attributed to their small size and greater surface area to volume ratio. The bAgNPs demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition (29.5 ± 0.8 mm) against B. subtilis through oxidation of membrane fatty acids that resulted in the formation of the malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric acid (MDA-TBA) adduct. However, bAgNPs demonstrated excellent hemocompatibility with rat and human red blood cells. Biogenic AgNPs synthesized at pH 8 also exhibited biocompatibility in terms of liver and kidney function biomarkers. Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin staining of the tissue sections of vital organs (i.e., liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, spleen, and brain) also confirmed the biocompatibility of bAgNPs.",,135
301,35980784,The Relationship of John Henryism with Cognitive Function and Decline in Older Black Adults.,"To investigate the relationship between John Henryism, a psychological traittypified by high-effort active coping that has been associated with adverse health outcomes among Blacks, and cognitive decline. In a cohort of community-dwelling older Black adults (N = 611), we investigated the relationship between John Henryism and cognitive decline. John Henryism was measured using the John Henryism Active Coping Scale (JHACS), a 9-item validated measure of self-reported high-effort coping (mean = 16.9, sd = 4.8, range: 4-27). We implemented a three-step modeling process using mixed effect models to assess the relationship between the JHACS and global cognitive function as well as five cognitive domains. We adjusted for demographics and for factors known to be associated with cognitive function and decline including vascular risk factors, discrimination, and income. The trait of high-effort active coping was associated with lower average cognitive function (β = -0.07, 95% CI: -0.10, -0.03), but not with decline. The results remained after further adjustment for experiences of discrimination, income, and vascular risk factors. In domain specific analyses, we found that the JHACS was associated with baseline levels of working memory, semantic memory and visuospatial ability, but not decline. These results highlight the importance of using culturally specific measures in considering the heterogeneity of cognitive health outcomes in minoritized populations. Understanding how stress responses relate to late-life cognition among older Black adults could help promote aspects of behavioral resilience along with healthful coping responses.",,136
793,35975044,Non-edible plant seeds of Acacia farnesiana as a new and effective source for biofuel production.,"Currently, the energy crisis is a hot topic for researchers because we are facing serious problems due to overpopulation and natural energy sources are vanishing day-by-day. To overcome the energy crisis, biofuel production from non-edible plant seeds is the best solution for the present era. In the present study, we select the non-edible seeds of Acacia farnesiana for biofuel production from different areas of Pakistan with better oil production results. Different kinds of analytical method, like the American Standard for Testing and Materials and techniques like Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, were used to evaluate the chemical compositions. The maximum oil extraction rate (23%) was produced by petroleum ether. Potassium hydroxide exhibited the best conversion result of 96% fatty acid methyl ester. The transesterification method was used for the preparation of fatty acid methyl ester (96%) using potassium hydroxide and methanol. The viscosity and density of Acacia farnesiana seed oil biodiesel was comparable to American Standard for Testing Material biodiesel standards. By using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, five fatty acids were detected comprising palmitic acid (6.85%), stearic acid (2.36%), oleic acid (12.13%), linoleic acid (46.85%), and α-linolenic acid (1.23%). This study concludes that Acacia farnesiana seed oil biodiesel could be an intriguing raw material for yielding Acacia farnesiana seed oil methyl ester as an alternative fuel source.",,137
779,35975058,Glutathione-depleting polymer delivering chlorin e6 for enhancing photodynamic therapy.,"The therapeutic effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is highly dependent on the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the ROS generated by photosensitizers can be consumed by the highly concentrated glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells, severely impairing the therapeutic effect of PDT. Herein, we synthesized a GSH-scavenging copolymer to deliver photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6). The pyridyl disulfide groups, which have faster reactivity with the thiol groups of GSH than other disulfide groups, were grafted onto a hydrophobic block to encapsulate the Ce6. Under NIR irradiation, the Ce6 generated ROS to kill tumor cells, and the pyridyl disulfide groups depleted the GSH to prevent ROS consumption, which synergistically enhanced the therapeutic effect of PDT. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the combinatory antitumor effect of Ce6-induced ROS generation and the pyridyl disulfide group-induced GSH depletion. Therefore, the pyridyl disulfide group-grafted amphiphilic copolymer provides a more efficient strategy for enhancing PDT and has promising potential for clinical application.",,138
1098,35974521,Information content of brain states is explained by structural constraints on state energetics.,"Signal propagation along the structural connectome of the brain induces changes in the patterns of activity. These activity patterns define global brain states and contain information in accordance with their expected probability of occurrence. Being the physical substrate upon which information propagates, the structural connectome, in conjunction with the dynamics, determines the set of possible brain states and constrains the transition between accessible states. Yet, precisely how these structural constraints on state transitions relate to their information content remains unexplored. To address this gap in knowledge, we defined the information content as a function of the activation distribution, where statistically rare values of activation correspond to high information content. With this numerical definition in hand, we studied the spatiotemporal distribution of information content in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project during different tasks, and report four key findings. First, information content strongly depends on cognitive context; its absolute level and spatial distribution depend on the cognitive task. Second, while information content shows similarities to other measures of brain activity, it is distinct from both Neurosynth maps and task contrast maps generated by a general linear model applied to the fMRI data. Third, the brain's structural wiring constrains the cost to control its state, where the cost to transition into high information content states is larger than that to transition into low information content states. Finally, all state transitions-especially those to high information content states-are less costly than expected from random network null models, thereby indicating the brains marked efficiency. Taken together, our findings establish an explanatory link between the information contained in a brain state and the energetic cost of attaining that state, thereby laying important groundwork for our understanding of large-scale cognitive computations.",,139
912,35974809,High Expression of Heat Shock Protein Family D Member 1 Predicts Poor Prognosis of Esophageal Cancer.,"Heat shock protein family D (Hsp60) member 1 (HSPD1) has been reported as a potential survival-related biomarker in some cancers. However, the correlation between HSPD1 expression with prognosis and clinical features of esophageal cancer (EC) is poorly understood. Our research aimed to explore the clinical and prognostic significance of HSPD1 expression in EC patients. In our study, HSPD1 expression was detected by immunochemistry in 87 EC tissue specimens and 20 normal cancerous peripheral tissue specimens. Meanwhile, we also analyzed the expression of HSPD1 in EC by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank test and logistic regression models were separately used to test the correlation between clinical characteristics and HSPD1 expression in our and TCGA cohort. Moreover, we evaluated the value of HSPD1 in prognosis by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox analysis. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the data accessed from TCGA. The results showed that HSPD1 was overexpressed in EC, and the expression was related to histological type, histological grade, N classification, and clinical stage. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox analysis indicated that high expression of HSPD1 correlated with poor prognosis, and HSPD1 was an independent risk factor for EC. GSEA identified pathways involved in cysteine and methionine metabolism, spliceosome, selenoamino acid metabolism, mismatch repair, RNA degration, DNA replication, and cell cycle as differentially enriched in ECs with high HSPD1 expression. Our results suggest that HSPD1 is expressed at high levels in EC, and has potential to be used as a novel biomarker for the prognosis of patients with EC.",,140
2360,35967016,"Synthesis, Catalytic GPx-like Activity, and SET Reactions of Conformationally Constrained 2,7-Dialkoxy-Substituted Naphthalene-1,8-peri-diselenides.","Several 2,7-dialkoxy-substituted naphthalene-1,8-peri-diselenides were prepared and tested for catalytic antioxidant activity in an NMR-based assay employing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with stoichiometric amounts of benzyl thiol. Acidic conditions enhanced their catalytic activity, whereas basic conditions suppressed it. The highest activity was observed with a 2,7-bis(triethyleneglycol) derivative. These compounds serve as mimetics of the antioxidant selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase. Studies based on NMR peak-broadening effects and EPR spectroscopy indicated that a thiol-dependent SET reaction occurs under the conditions of the assay, which can be reversed by the addition of triethylamine. In contrast, peak broadening induced by proton-catalyzed electron transfer during the treatment of naphthalene-1,8-peri-diselenides with trifluoroacetic acid can be suppressed by the addition of excess thiol. These observations provide new insights into the redox mechanisms of these processes.",,141
1777,35967887,Inhibitory Control in Aging: The Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis.,"As one of the core executive functions, inhibitory control plays an important role in human life. Inhibitory control refers to the ability to suppress task irrelevant information both internally and externally. Modern cognitive neuroscience has extensively investigated the neural basis of inhibitory control, less is known about the inhibitory control mechanisms in aging. Growing interests in cognitive declines of aging have given raise to the compensation-related utilization of neural circuits hypothesis (CRUNCH). In this review, we survey both behavioral, functional, and structural changes relevant to inhibitory control in aging. In line with CRUNCH, we found that older adults engage additional brain regions than younger adults when performing the same cognitive task, to compensate for declining brain structures and functions. Moreover, we propose CRUNCH could well take functional inhibitory deficits in older adults into account. Finally, we provide three sensible future research directions.",,142
1966,35967641,Anxiety and depression mediate the relationship between digestive tract conditions and oral health-related quality of life in orthodontic patients.,"Anxiety and depression are common psychological problems in orthodontic patients whose diet habits and oral health status change frequently during treatment. However, relationships between anxiety and depression, digestive tract condition, and impaired oral health-related quality of life remain unknown. In this study, clinical assessments, including anxiety, depression, digestive tract condition, and oral health-related quality of life, were collected from 769 outpatients in the orthodontic department using three self-reported questionnaires. Correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationships among different clinical assessments. A chained mediation analysis model was further conducted to explore the direct and indirect effects of these various clinical factors. Changes in digestive tract conditions were positively correlated with the psychological status and oral health-related quality of life. Anxiety and depression partially mediated the relationship between them, and the indirect effect was 0.68 (30%), of which the mediation effect of anxiety accounted for 56%. Anxiety and depression mediate the relationship between gastrointestinal conditions and oral health. In particular, anxiety seems to play a significant mediating role. Our findings indicate that psychological status must be paid more attention to in future clinical practices and supervision for digestive tract symptoms of orthodontic patients.",,143
2208,35967310,Monocyte biology conserved across species: Functional insights from cattle.,"Similar to human monocytes, bovine monocytes can be split into CD14highCD16- classical, CD14highCD16high intermediate and CD14-/dimCD16high nonclassical monocytes (cM, intM, and ncM, respectively). Here, we present an in-depth analysis of their steady-state bulk- and single-cell transcriptomes, highlighting both pronounced functional specializations and transcriptomic relatedness. Bulk gene transcription indicates pro-inflammatory and antibacterial roles of cM, while ncM and intM appear to be specialized in regulatory/anti-inflammatory functions and tissue repair, as well as antiviral responses and T-cell immunomodulation. Notably, intM stood out by high expression of several genes associated with antigen presentation. Anti-inflammatory and antiviral functions of ncM are further supported by dominant oxidative phosphorylation and selective strong responses to TLR7/8 ligands, respectively. Moreover, single-cell RNA-seq revealed previously unappreciated heterogeneity within cM and proposes intM as a transient differentiation intermediate between cM and ncM.",,144
2174,35967344,Comparison of three validated PD-L1 immunohistochemical assays in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder: interchangeability and issues related to patient selection.,"Different programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) assays and scoring algorithms are being used in the evaluation of PD-L1 expression for the selection of patients for immunotherapy in specific settings of advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). In this paper, we sought to investigate three approved assays (Ventana SP142 and SP263, and Dako 22C3) in UC with emphasis on implications for patient selection for atezolizumab/pembrolizumab as the first line of treatment. Tumors from 124 patients with invasive UC of the bladder were analyzed using tissue microarrays (TMA). Serial sections were stained with SP263 and SP142 on Ventana Benchmark Ultra and with 22C3 on Dako Autostainer Link 48. Stains were evaluated independently by two observers and scored using the combined positive score (CPS) and tumor infiltrating immune cells (IC) algorithms. Differences in proportions (DP), overall percent agreement (OPA), positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and Cohen κ were calculated for all comparable cases. Good overall concordance in analytic performance was observed for 22C3 and SP263 with both scoring algorithms; specifically, the highest OPA was observed between 22C3 and SP263 (89.6%) when using CPS. On the other hand, SP142 consistently showed lower positivity rates with high differences in proportions (DP) compared with 22C3 and SP263 with both CPS and IC, and with a low PPA, especially when using the CPS algorithm. In conclusion, 22C3 and SP263 assays show comparable analytical performance while SP142 shows divergent staining results, with important implications for the selection of patients for both pembrolizumab and atezolizumab.",,145
1511,35968375,"Source localized infraslow neurofeedback training in people with chronic painful knee osteoarthritis: A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled feasibility clinical trial.","Persistent pain is a key symptom in people living with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Infra-slow Neurofeedback (ISF-NF) training is a recent development focusing on modulating cortical slow-wave activity to improve pain outcomes. A parallel, two-armed double-blinded, randomized sham-controlled, feasibility clinical trial aimed to determine the feasibility and safety of a novel electroencephalography-based infraslow fluctuation neurofeedback (EEG ISF-NF) training in people with KOA and determine the variability of clinical outcomes and EEG changes following NF training. Eligible participants attended nine 30-min ISF-NF training sessions involving three cortical regions linked to pain. Feasibility measures were monitored during the trial period. Pain and functional outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up after 2 weeks. Resting-state EEG was recorded at baseline and immediate post-intervention. Participants were middle-aged (61.7 ± 7.6 years), New Zealand European (90.5%), and mostly females (62%) with an average knee pain duration of 4 ± 3.4 years. The study achieved a retention rate of 91%, with 20/22 participants completing all the sessions. Participants rated high levels of acceptance and moderate to high levels of perceived effectiveness of the training. No serious adverse events were reported during the trial. Mean difference (95% CI) for clinical pain and function measures are as follows for pain severity [active: 0.89 ± 1.7 (-0.27 to 2.0); sham: 0.98 ± 1.1 (0.22-1.7)], pain interference [active: 0.75 ± 2.3 (-0.82 to 2.3); Sham: 0.89 ± 2.1 (-0.60 to 2.4)], pain unpleasantness [active: 2.6 ± 3.7 (0.17-5.1); sham: 2.8 ± 3 (0.62-5.0)] and physical function [active: 6.2 ± 13 (-2.6 to 15); sham: 1.6 ± 12 (-6.8 to 10)]. EEG sources demonstrated frequency-specific neuronal activity, functional connectivity, and ISF ratio changes following NF training. The findings of the study indicated that the ISF-NF training is a feasible, safe, and acceptable intervention for pain management in people with KOA, with high levels of perceived effectiveness. The study also reports the variability in clinical, brain activity, and connectivity changes following training.",,146
188,35982889,Aberrant splicing events caused by insertion of genes of interest into expression vectors.,"Background: Expression of genes of interest from plasmids or lentiviral vectors is one of the most common tools in molecular and gene therapy. Aberrant splicing between the inserted gene of interest and downstream vector sequence has not been systematically analyzed. Methods: Formation of aberrant fusion transcripts and proteins was detected by RT-PCR, sequencing, Western blotting and mass spectrometry. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify all human and mouse genes prone to vector-dependent aberrant splicing. Selected genes were experimentally validated. Results: When we expressed human FACI in cultured cells, an aberrant splicing event was found to occur between FACI transcript and downstream plasmid sequence through one exon-exon junction in FACI that accidentally contributes a splice donor site. To explore whether this could be a general phenomenon, we searched the whole human and mouse genomes for protein-coding genes that harbor an exon-exon junction resembling a splice donor site. Almost all genes prone to this type of aberrant splicing were identified. A total of 17 genes among the hits were randomly selected for experimental validation. RT-PCR and sequencing results verified that 13 genes were aberrantly spliced on the identified exon-exon junctions. In addition, all 17 genes were aberrantly spliced on their V5 tag sequence. Aberrant fusion protein expression from all 17 genes was validated by immunoblotting. Aberrant splicing was prevented by recoding the V5 tag or the splice sites. Conclusions: Our study revealed an unexpectedly high frequency of vector-dependent aberrant splicing events. Aberrant formation of the resulting fusion proteins could undermine the accuracy of gain-of-function studies and might cause potential side effects when the therapeutic gene is expressed in vivo. Our work has implications in improving vector construction and epitope tagging for gene expression and therapy.",,147
2084,35967434,Molecular characterization of thioester-containing proteins in Biomphalaria glabrata and their differential gene expression upon Schistosoma mansoni exposure.,"Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by trematode parasites of the genus Schistosoma that affects approximately 200 million people worldwide. Schistosomiasis has been a persistent problem in endemic areas as there is no vaccine available, currently used anti-helmintic medications do not prevent reinfection, and most concerning, drug resistance has been documented in laboratory and field isolates. Thus, alternative approaches to curtail this human disease are warranted. Understanding the immunobiology of the obligate intermediate host of these parasites, which include the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata, may facilitate the development of novel methods to stop or reduce transmission to humans. Molecules from the thioester-containing protein (TEP) superfamily have been shown to be involved in immunological functions in many animals including corals and humans. In this study we identified, characterized, and compared TEP transcripts and their expression upon S. mansoni exposure in resistant and susceptible strains of B. glabrata snails. Results showed the expression of 11 unique TEPs in B. glabrata snails. These transcripts present high sequence identity at the nucleotide and putative amino acid levels between susceptible and resistant strains. Further analysis revealed differences in several TEPs' constitutive expression levels between resistant and susceptible snail strains, with C3-1, C3-3, and CD109 having higher constitutive expression levels in the resistant (BS90) strain, whereas C3-2 and TEP-1 showed higher constitutive expression levels in the susceptible (NMRI) strain. Furthermore, TEP-specific response to S. mansoni miracidia exposure reiterated their differential expression, with resistant snails upregulating the expression of both TEP-4 and TEP-3 at 2 h and 48 h post-exposure, respectively. Further understanding the diverse TEP genes and their functions in invertebrate animal vectors will not only expand our knowledge in regard to this ancient family of immune proteins, but also offer the opportunity to identify novel molecular targets that could aid in the efforts to develop control methods to reduce schistosomiasis transmission.",,148
1378,35969075,Analyzing Multifactorial RNA-Seq Experiments with DicoExpress.,"The proper use of statistical modeling in NGS data analysis requires an advanced level of expertise. There has recently been a growing consensus on using generalized linear models for differential analysis of RNA-Seq data and the advantage of mixture models to perform co-expression analysis. To offer a managed setting to use these modeling approaches, we developed DiCoExpress that provides a standardized R pipeline to perform an RNA-Seq analysis. Without any particular knowledge in statistics or R programming, beginners can perform a complete RNA-Seq analysis from quality controls to co-expression through differential analysis based on contrasts inside a generalized linear model. An enrichment analysis is proposed both on the lists of differentially expressed genes, and the co-expressed gene clusters. This video tutorial is conceived as a step-by-step protocol to help users take full advantage of DiCoExpress and its potential in empowering the biological interpretation of an RNA-Seq experiment.",,149
216,35982804,99mTc-Ethambutol Scintigraphy with Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography/Computed Tomography in Vertebral Tuberculosis.,"Vertebral tuberculosis (TB) is a common form of extrapulmonary TB. Here, the slow-growing Mycobacterium bacillus reaches the disc space through the hematogenous route and leads to various complications. Radiological imaging and histopathology have been the mainstay of diagnosis, but radionuclide imaging techniques using radiolabeled antitubercular drugs have rarely found space in the clinical domain. Here, we present a case of vertebral TB, where a technetium-labeled antitubercular drug, ethambutol, was synthesized and used for imaging the bacteria in vivo. Thus, we demonstrate a rarely used potentially specific agent for tuberculous-infection imaging, which can be produced in-house, and provides rapid results.",,150
1773,35967898,Resting-State Functional Connectivity Characteristics of Resilience to Traumatic Stress in Dutch Police Officers.,"Insights into the neurobiological basis of resilience can have important implications for the prevention and treatment of stress-related disorders, especially in populations that are subjected to high-stress environments. Evaluating large-scale resting-state networks (RSNs) can provide information regarding resilient specific brain function which may be useful in understanding resilience. This study aimed to explore functional connectivity patterns specific for (high) resilience in Dutch policemen after exposure to multiple work-related traumatic events. We investigated resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the salience network (SN), limbic network, and the default-mode network (DMN). Resting-state functional MRI scans were obtained from trauma-exposed executive personnel of the Dutch police force and non-trauma-exposed recruits from the police academy. Participants were divided into three groups: a resilient group (n = 31; trauma exposure; no psychopathology), a vulnerable group (n = 32; trauma exposure, psychopathology), and a control group (n = 19; no trauma exposure, no psychopathology). RSFC of the three networks of interest was compared between these groups, using an independent component analysis and a dual regression approach. We found decreased resilience-specific positive RSFC of the salience network with several prefrontal regions. The DMN and limbic network RFSC did not show resilience-specific patterns. This study shows a differential RSFC specific for resilient police officers. This differential RSFC may be related to a greater capacity for internal-focused thought and interoceptive awareness, allowing more effective higher-order responses to stress in highly resilient individuals.",,151

1656,35968118,Clarifying the mechanisms of the light-induced color formation of apple peel under dark conditions through metabolomics and transcriptomic analyses.,"Many studies have demonstrated that anthocyanin synthesis in apple peel is induced by light, but the color of bagged apple peel continues to change under dark conditions after light induction has not been characterized. Here, transcriptional and metabolic changes associated with changes in apple peel coloration in the dark after different light induction treatments were studied. Apple pericarp can achieve a normal color under complete darkness followed by light induction. Metabolomics analysis indicated that the expression levels of cyanidin-3-O-galactoside and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside were high, which might be associated with the red color development of apple peel. Transcriptome analysis revealed high expression levels of MdUFGTs, MdMYBs, and MdNACs, which might play a key role in light-induced anthocyanin accumulation under dark conditions. 13 key genes related to dark coloring after light induction was screened. The results of this study provide new insights into the mechanism of anthocyanin synthesis under dark conditions.",,153
2215,35967303,Radiosensitivity in patients affected by ARPC1B deficiency: a new disease trait?,"Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 1B (ARPC1B) deficiency is a recently described inborn error of immunity (IEI) presenting with combined immunodeficiency and characterized by recurrent infections and thrombocytopenia. Manifestations of immune dysregulation, including colitis, vasculitis, and severe dermatitis, associated with eosinophilia, hyper-IgA, and hyper-IgE are also described in ARPC1B-deficient patients. To date, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation seems to be the only curative option for patients. ARPC1B is part of the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3) and cooperates with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton remodeling and in driving double-strand break clustering for homology-directed repair. In this study, we aimed to investigate radiosensitivity (RS) in ARPC1B-deficient patients to assess whether it can be considered an additional disease trait. First, we performed trio-based next-generation-sequencing studies to obtain the ARPC1B molecular diagnosis in our index case characterized by increased RS, and then we confirmed, using three different methods, an increment of radiosensitivity in all enrolled ARPC1B-deficient patients. In particular, higher levels of chromatid-type aberrations and γH2AX foci, with an increased number of cells arrested in the G2/M-phase of the cell cycle, were found in patients' cells after ionizing radiation exposition and radiomimetic bleomycin treatment. Overall, our data suggest increased radiosensitivity as an additional trait in ARPC1B deficiency and support the necessity to investigate this feature in ARPC1B patients as well as in other IEI with cytoskeleton defects to address specific clinical follow-up and optimize therapeutic interventions.",,154
2482,35966776,Constructing prediction models for excessive daytime sleepiness by nomogram and machine learning: A large Chinese multicenter cohort study.,"Although risk factors for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) have been reported, there are still few cohort-based predictive models for EDS in Parkinson's disease (PD). This 1-year longitudinal study aimed to develop a predictive model of EDS in patients with PD using a nomogram and machine learning (ML). A total of 995 patients with PD without EDS were included, and clinical data during the baseline period were recorded, which included basic information as well as motor and non-motor symptoms. One year later, the presence of EDS in this population was re-evaluated. First, the baseline characteristics of patients with PD with or without EDS were analyzed. Furthermore, a Cox proportional risk regression model and XGBoost ML were used to construct a prediction model of EDS in PD. At the 1-year follow-up, EDS occurred in 260 of 995 patients with PD (26.13%). Baseline features analysis showed that EDS correlated significantly with age, age of onset (AOO), hypertension, freezing of gait (FOG). In the Cox proportional risk regression model, we included high body mass index (BMI), late AOO, low motor score on the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), low orientation score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and absence of FOG. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the survival prognosis of patients with PD in the high-risk group was significantly worse than that in the low-risk group. XGBoost demonstrated that BMI, AOO, PDQ-39 motor score, MMSE orientation score, and FOG contributed to the model to different degrees, in decreasing order of importance, and the overall accuracy of the model was 71.86% after testing. In this study, we showed that risk factors for EDS in patients with PD include high BMI, late AOO, a low motor score of PDQ-39, low orientation score of MMSE, and lack of FOG, and their importance decreased in turn. Our model can predict EDS in PD with relative effectivity and accuracy.",,155
2361,35967015,Experimental Study to Quantify Fracture Propagation in Hydraulic Fracturing Treatment.,"Hydraulic fracturing plays an important role in the commercial development of unconventional oil and gas, which is directly related to the production of oil and gas wells. An accurate evaluation is critical for hydraulic fracturing, but it is urgent to propose a quantitative assessment of hydraulic fracturing fracture propagation for realizing hydraulic fracturing fracture propagation and multiposition permeability measurement under an in situ stress environment. Herein, a true triaxial stress loading and permeability testing device was designed and fabricated, and a permeability evaluation model was established under various states, which can realize the accurate measurement of multiple faces and the total permeability of tight specimens before and after hydraulic fracturing. It can directly measure permeability under the conditions of the true triaxial fracture propagation experiment. The comparative experimental result shows that the new technique can quantitatively evaluate the fracture propagation experiment of true triaxial hydraulic fracturing. The overall permeability and the directional permeability of the five faces were obtained, and the fracture propagation was evaluated by comparing the change in permeability. The test permeability error rate is within ±10%. Furthermore, a more refined evaluation of hydraulic fracturing fracture propagation can be carried out based on the fracture observation and AE event results. The research results provide a new strategy for a more quantitative and refined evaluation of fracture propagation and help to optimize the parameters of hydraulic fracturing.",,156
828,35974943,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy combined with repetitive transracial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on information processing and working memory of patients with multiple sclerosis.,"MS is a demyelinating disease that can result in significant disability. Along with physical complications, this disease is associated with significant psychological complications, including cognitive decline. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in combination with rTMS on information processing and working memory in patients with MS. The current study used a single-case experimental design and included a follow-up (A-B-A). The statistical population of the present study was all MS patients in Tehran who referred to Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran in 2020. The present study sample consisted of 5 MS patients selected by the sampling methods available. Subjects were assessed three times before, during, and after the intervention using the Zahlen-Verbindongs and n-back tests in the two-back position. Subjects received cognitive therapy based on mindfulness and rTMS at a frequency of 10 Hz. Visual and graphical recovery percentage and effect size methods were used to analyze the data. The current study's findings indicate that combining mindfulness with rTMS has a beneficial effect on the information processing and working memory of MS patients. Overall, 67.24% recovered following the intervention stage, 53.64% recovered following the follow-up for information processing, 104.04% recovered following the intervention stage, and 76.98% recovered following the follow-up for working memory. The study shows the effect of mindfulness combined with rTMS on cognitive problems in MS patients. Significant improvements in MS patients' information processing, working memory, and therapeutic outcomes were observed throughout the follow-up period.",,157
2410,35966901,Disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection in a cat on long-term ciclosporin therapy and potential latent infection of an in-contact cat.,"An 8-year-old domestic shorthair cat receiving long-term ciclosporin treatment was evaluated for a history of weight loss and hyporexia. The main clinical finding was a cluster of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Cytological examination of fine-needle aspirates showed granulomatous inflammation with abundant acid-fast bacilli. A diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection was confirmed by PCR. The cat's clinical condition deteriorated rapidly despite appropriate antibiotic treatment and it was euthanased 2 weeks after initial presentation due to development of severe paraparesis and ataxia. Post-mortem examination revealed granulomatous inflammation affecting multiple lymph nodes and other organs with intrahistiocytic acid-fast bacilli consistent with mycobacteria when stained using Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Another cat in the same household was screened for infection using the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), with the result being consistent with infection by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which includes MAC; however, it had no grossly detectable disease. This case report is an unusual presentation of disseminated MAC infection in a cat, which remains a rare diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of unusual and rare presentations of this infection. The clinical findings, progression of disease and histopathology results add to the current clinical database for feline disseminated MAC infections. Another cat in the same household tested positive for NTM by IGRA without any gross disease. This was suggestive of latent MAC infection which, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported in an in-contact cat.",,158
2196,35967322,Therapeutic potential of an anti-CCR9 mAb evidenced in xenografts of human CCR9+ tumors.,"Relapsed or refractory T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) still carries poor prognosis. Aiming to improve outcomes, the therapeutic potential of an anti-CCR9 monoclonal antibody (mAb 92R), targeting the human chemokine-receptor CCR9 is analyzed on orthotopic xenotransplants. 92R mAb treatment of mice carrying human CCR9+ T-ALL cell lines or primary T cell leukemias inhibits tumor growth and increases survival. The therapeutic effects of 92R are specific and synergize with chemotherapeutic agents increasing survival. Furthermore, 92R decreases size of non-hematopoietic tumors with a forced CCR9 expression and of solid tumors generated by the pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line AsPC-1. In addition, a humanized version of 92R mAb (Srb1) is also able to inhibit growth of CCR9+ T-ALL tumor cells in vivo, increasing survival 2.66-fold. Finally, 92R mAb prevents liver accumulation of infiltrates and reduces tumor cell numbers in already formed infiltrates. Thus, the humanized version of 92R mAb (Srb1), displays therapeutic potential for CCR9+ tumor treatment and might represent one of the first therapeutic antibodies for precision medicine on T-ALL patients.",,159
420,35979191,Therapy Patterns and Surveillance Measures of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients beyond Disease-Related Hospitalization: A Claims-Based Cohort Study.,"Medical care and surveillance of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have been shown to be far from satisfactory. Data on therapy patterns and surveillance measures in IBD patients are scarce. We, therefore, aimed to compare the therapy patterns and surveillance management of IBD patients in the year before and after IBD-related hospitalization. We examined medical therapy, surveillance management (influenza vaccination, dermatologist visits, Pap smear screening, creatinine measurements, iron measurements, and ophthalmologist visits) and healthcare utilization in 214 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 259 Crohn's disease (CD) patients who underwent IBD-related hospitalization from 2012 to 2014. IBD-related drug classes changed in 64.5% of IBD patients following hospitalization. During the 1-year follow-up period, biological treatment increased in UC and CD patients, while steroid use decreased. Following hospitalization, 63.1% of UC and 27.0% of CD patients received 5-ASA. Only 21.6% of all IBD patients had a flu shot, and 19.6% of immunosuppressed IBD patients were seen by a dermatologist in the follow-up; other surveillance measures were more frequent. Surveillance before hospital admission and consultations by gastroenterologists were strongly correlated with surveillance during the postoperative follow-up, while gender and diagnosis (UC vs. CD) were not. During the 1-year follow-up, 20.5% of all IBD patients had no diagnostic or disease-monitoring procedure. Surveillance measures for IBD patients are underused in Switzerland. Further research is needed to examine the impact of annual screenings and surveillance on patient outcomes.",,160
1367,35969095,RNA Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) to Visualize Microbial Colonization and Infection in Caenorhabditis elegans Intestines.,"The intestines of wild Caenorhabditis nematodes are inhabited by a variety of microorganisms, including gut microbiome bacteria and pathogens, such as microsporidia and viruses. Because of the similarities between Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian intestinal cells, as well as the power of the C. elegans system, this host has emerged as a model system to study host intestine-microbe interactions in vivo. While it is possible to observe some aspects of these interactions with bright-field microscopy, it is difficult to accurately classify microbes and characterize the extent of colonization or infection without more precise tools. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be used as a tool to identify and visualize microbes in nematodes from the wild or to experimentally characterize and quantify infection in nematodes infected with microbes in the lab. FISH probes, labeling the highly abundant small subunit ribosomal RNA, produce a bright signal for bacteria and microsporidian cells. Probes designed to target conserved regions of ribosomal RNA common to many species can detect a broad range of microbes, whereas targeting divergent regions of the ribosomal RNA is useful for narrower detection. Similarly, probes can be designed to label viral RNA. A protocol for RNA FISH staining with either paraformaldehyde (PFA) or acetone fixation is presented. PFA fixation is ideal for nematodes associated with bacteria, microsporidia, and viruses, whereas acetone fixation is necessary for the visualization of microsporida spores. Animals were first washed and fixed in paraformaldehyde or acetone. After fixation, FISH probes were incubated with samples to allow for the hybridization of probes to the desired target. The animals were again washed and then examined on microscope slides or using automated approaches. Overall, this FISH protocol enables detection, identification, and quantification of the microbes that inhabit the C. elegans intestine, including microbes for which there are no genetic tools available.",,161
1318,35970050,Implementation of analytical quality by design and green chemistry principles to develop an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of Fluocinolone Acetonide impurities from its drug substance and topical oil formulations.,"An anti-inflammatory skin condition is treated with fluocinolone acetonide (FLA), a synthetic corticoid. The current study aims to develop a stability-indicating UPLC method for the determination of impurities present in fluocinolone acetonide and its topical oil formulation. The method development was performed by implementing Analytical Quality by Design (AQbD) and green chemistry principles. A detailed risk assessment was conducted based on the cause-and-effect relationship. d-optimal split-plot design was employed to screen the critical method parameters (CMPs). The central composite design (CCD) was employed to optimize the final method conditions. p-values for the model and lack of fit were <0.0001 and >0.05, respectively, which indicates the best fit statistical model for the studied responses (peak resolutions R1 - R5). The critical method attributes (CMAs) and CMPs such as the ratio of ACN: Water in mobile phase-B as 600:400 (v/v), the ratio of mobile phase-A & B in initial gradient program as 60:40, flow rate as 0.3 mL min-1, and column oven temperature as 50 °C were optimized from the CCD. The best possible separation among all components was achieved with a gradient elution using Waters Acquity UPLC HSS C18, 100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm analytical column. The optimized gradient program is time (min)/%B: 0.0/40, 1.5/40, 6.0/60, 8.0/70, 9.0/80, 12.0/100, 15.0/100, 15.1/40 & 18.0/40. Optimization of diluent is highly critical for any oil-based formulations. The experimental results show that acetonitrile is the most suitable diluent for the current study. The method validation was executed in compliance with ICH and USP 〈1225〉 guidelines. Mean recovery of the impurities ranged between 95.7 and 105.7%, the correlation coefficient(r) was> 0.999, the RSD values (n = 6) ranged between 0.9 - 3.2% across the range for LOQ - 150% levels. The peaks from the specificity study did not interfere with the known and active analyte peaks. The major degradation products were identified as Imp-C, B, and A, and established their degradation pathways from FLA based on the stress studies. The method greenness was evaluated using GAPI, AGREE and analytical eco scale and found that the method is green.",,162
2418,35966878,The Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Diagnosis and Drug Resistance Prediction of Pulmonary Tuberculosis.,"With the increasing incidence and mortality of pulmonary tuberculosis, in addition to tough and controversial disease management, time-wasting and resource-limited conventional approaches to the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of tuberculosis are still awkward issues, especially in countries with high tuberculosis burden and backwardness. In the meantime, the climbing proportion of drug-resistant tuberculosis poses a significant hazard to public health. Thus, auxiliary diagnostic tools with higher efficiency and accuracy are urgently required. Artificial intelligence (AI), which is not new but has recently grown in popularity, provides researchers with opportunities and technical underpinnings to develop novel, precise, rapid, and automated implements for pulmonary tuberculosis care, including but not limited to tuberculosis detection. In this review, we aimed to introduce representative AI methods, focusing on deep learning and radiomics, followed by definite descriptions of the state-of-the-art AI models developed using medical images and genetic data to detect pulmonary tuberculosis, distinguish the infection from other pulmonary diseases, and identify drug resistance of tuberculosis, with the purpose of assisting physicians in deciding the appropriate therapeutic schedule in the early stage of the disease. We also enumerated the challenges in maximizing the impact of AI in this field such as generalization and clinical utility of the deep learning models.",,163
1919,35967690,The age differences and effect of mild cognitive impairment on perceptual-motor and executive functions.,"It is unclear whether the decline in executive function (EF) and perceptual-motor function (PMF) found in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the result of a normal aging process or due to MCI. This study aimed to determine age-related and MCI-related cognitive impairments of the EF and PMF. The EF and PMF were investigated across four groups of 240 participants, 60 in each group, including early adult, middle adult, older adult, and older adult with probable MCI. The EF, working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility were evaluated using digit span backward tasks, the Stroop color-word test, and the modified switching verbal fluency test, respectively. The PMF, visual perception, visuoconstructional reasoning, and perceptual-motor coordination were evaluated using the clock reading test, stick design test, and stick catching test, respectively. Group differences were found for all subdomains of EF and PMF (p < 0.05), except for perceptual-motor coordination, indicating that this subdomain could be maintained in older adults and was not affected by MCI. For the age difference, working memory, cognitive flexibility, visual perception, and visuoconstructional reasoning remained stable across middle adults and started to decline in older adults, while cognitive inhibition began to decrease in middle adults and it further declined in older adults. To control the confounding effect of education level, the results showed that only cognitive flexibility was further decreased in older adults with probable MCI compared to those without MCI (p < 0.05). In conclusion, cognitive inhibition decreased earlier in middle adults, whereas EF and PMF started to decline in older adults. Cognitive flexibility was the only MCI-sensitive cognitive function.",,164
1334,35969929,Modelling the rate-dependency of the mechanical behaviour of the aortic heart valve: An experimentally guided theoretical framework.,"A theoretical framework, based on extant experimental findings, is presented to devise a novel viscous dissipation function Wv in order to model the rate-dependent mechanical behaviour of the aortic heart valve. The experimental data encompasses Cauchy stress-stretch (σ-λ) curves obtained across a 10,000-fold range of stretch rates (λ˙), from quasi-static (λ˙= 0.001 s-1) to upper-range of physiological (λ˙= 12.4 s-1) deformation rates. The analysis of the data elicits two important trends: (i) the mechanical behaviour of the aortic valve across the tested rates is rate-dependent, with specimens becoming stiffer by increasing rate; and (ii) there appears to be a plateau in the rate-effects on the σ-λ curves; i.e. the rate-effects approach an asymptote with increase in the stretch rate λ˙. Guided by these empirical observations, we devise our new Wv function and demonstrate that the well-known form of the dissipation function commonly used in the literature is a special case of our proposed Wv. The ensuing model is then compared against the experimental σ-λ curves and is shown to provide favourable predictions. An important advantage of the employed modelling framework is that it allows the incorporation of the rate of deformation, which is a direct experimental control parameter, as an explicit modelling variable. The application of the proposed model is thereby recommended for heart valves and other soft tissues that exhibit similar rate-dependent features.",,165
1163,35973401,Surgery for Epilepsy Involving Rolandic and Perirolandic Cortex: A Case Series Assessing Complications and Efficacy.,"Surgical removal of lesions around the rolandic cortex remains a challenge for neurosurgeons owing to the high risk of neurological deficits. Evaluating the risk factors associated with motor deficits after surgery in this region may help reduce the occurrence of motor deficits. To report our surgical experience in treating epileptic lesions involving the rolandic and perirolandic cortices. We performed a single-center retrospective review of patients undergoing epilepsy surgeries with lesions located in the rolandic and perirolandic cortices. Patients with detailed follow-up information were included. The lesion locations, resected regions, and invasive exploration techniques were studied to assess their relationship with postoperative motor deficits. Forty-one patients were included. Twenty-three patients suffered from a transient motor deficit, and 2 had permanent disabilities after surgery. Six patients with lesions at the posterior bank of the precentral sulcus underwent resection, and 5 experienced short-term motor deficits. Two patients with lesions adjacent to the anterior part of the precentral gyrus, in whom the adjacent precentral gyrus was removed, experienced permanent motor deficits. Lesions located at the bottom of the central sulcus and invading the anterior bank of the central sulcus were observed in 3 patients. The patients did not experience permanent motor deficits after surgery. The anterior bank of the central sulcus is indispensable for motor function, and destruction of this region would inevitably cause motor deficits. The anterior bank of the precentral gyrus can also be removed without motor impairment if there is a preexisting epileptogenic lesion.",,166
2487,35966771,Cognition impairment and risk of subclinical cardiovascular disease in older adults: The atherosclerosis risk in communities study.,"Clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cognition impairment are common and often coexist in aging populations, and CVD is associated with greater cognition impairment risk; however, the association between cognition impairment and CVD risk is inconsistent. It is unknown if pathways that contribute to CVD are caused by impaired cognition. We hypothesized that cognition impairment would be associated with greater subclinical CVD including subclinical myocardial damage [assessed by high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT)] and cardiac strain or dysfunction [assessed by N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)]. This analysis included Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) participants who underwent global cognition z-score tests between 1991 and 1993. Cardiac biomarkers were measured from stored plasma samples collected between 1996 and 1999. Logistic regression models were used to determine the association of cognitive function with subclinical CVD risk. There were 558/9216 (6.1%) and 447/9097 (5.0%) participants with incident elevated hs-CTnT (≥14 ng/L) and NT-proBNP (≥300 pg/mL) levels, respectively. Comparing the lowest and highest quartiles of global cognition z-scores, a higher incidence of elevated hs-CTnT [odds ratio (OR) = 1.511, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.093-2.088, P = 0.013] and NT-proBNP (OR = 1.929, 95% CI: 1.350-2.755, P < 0.001) were observed, respectively. In structural equation modeling, the indirect effect of global cognition z-score on major adverse cardiac events was 42.1% (P < 0.05). Impairments in baseline cognitive function were associated with subclinical myocardial damage or wall strain. Although future studies are warranted to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms behind these associations, our study suggests common pathways between cognitive and cardiac dysfunction.",,167
812,35975000,Importance of two-dimensional cation clusters induced by protein folding in intrinsic intracellular membrane permeability.,"We investigated the cell penetration of Sp1 zinc finger proteins (Sp1 ZF) and the mechanism via which the total cationic charge and distribution of cationic residues on the protein surface affect intracellular trafficking. Sp1 ZFs showed intrinsic cell membrane permeability. The intracellular transfer of Sp1 ZFs other than 1F3 was dependent on the total cationic charge. Investigation of the effect of cationic residue distribution on intracellular membrane permeability revealed that the cellular uptake of unfolded Zn2+-non-coordinating Ala mutants was lower than that of the wild type. Therefore, the total cationic charge and distribution of cationic residues on the protein played crucial roles in intracellular translocation. Mutational studies revealed that the two-dimensional cation cluster on the protein surface significantly improved their cellular uptake. This study will contribute to the design of artificial cargoes that can efficiently transport target substances into cells.",,168
1527,35968359,Bortezomib- and carfilzomib-resistant myeloma cells show increased activity of all three arms of the unfolded protein response.,"Proteasome inhibitors are among the most potent classes of drugs in multiple myeloma treatment. One of the main challenges in myeloma therapy is acquired resistance to drugs. Several theories have been proposed to describe the mechanisms responsible for resistance to the most commonly used proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib. This study aimed to describe functional differences between sensitive myeloma cells (MM1S WT) and their daughter cell lines resistant to either bortezomib (MM1S/R BTZ) or carfilzomib (MM1S/R CFZ), as well as between both resistant cell lines. Bortezomib- and carfilzomib-resistant cell lines were successfully generated by continuous exposure to the drugs. When exposed to different drugs than during the resistance generation period, MM1S/R BTZ cells showed cross-resistance to carfilzomib, whereas MM1S/R CFZ cells were similarly sensitive to bortezomib as MM1S WT cells. Following proteomic profiling, unsupervised principal component analysis revealed that the MM1S/R BTZ and MM1S/R CFZ cell lines differed significantly from the MM1S WT cell line and from each other. Canonical pathway analysis showed similar pathways enriched in both comparisons - MM1S WT vs. MM1S/R CFZ and MM1S WT vs. MM1S/R BTZ. However, important differences were present in the statistical significance of particular pathways. Key alterations included the ubiquitin-proteasome system, metabolic pathways responsible for redox homeostasis and the unfolded protein response. In functional studies, both drugs continued to reduce chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity in resistant cells. However, the baseline activity of all three catalytic domains of the proteasome was higher in the resistant cells. Differences in generation of reactive oxygen species were identified in MM1S/R BTZ (decreased) and MM1S/CFZ cells (increased) in comparison to MM1S WT cells. Both baseline and drug-induced activity of the unfolded protein response were higher in resistant cells than in MM1S WT cells and included all three arms of this pathway: IRE1α/XBP1s, ATF6 and EIF2α/ATF4 (downstream effectors of PERK). In conclusion, contrary to some previous reports, resistant MM1S cells show upregulation of unfolded protein response activity, reflecting the heterogeneity of multiple myeloma and prompting further studies on the role of this pathway in resistance to proteasome inhibitors.",,169
2176,35967342,Proposed clinical phases for the improvement of personalized treatment of checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis.,"Checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP) is a lethal immune-related adverse event. However, the development process of CIP, which may provide insight into more effective management, has not been extensively examined. We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis of 56 patients who developed CIP. Clinical characteristics, radiological features, histologic features, and laboratory tests were analyzed. After a comprehensive analysis, we proposed acute, subacute, and chronic phases of CIP and summarized each phase's characteristics. There were 51 patients in the acute phase, 22 in the subacute phase, and 11 in the chronic phase. The median interval time from the beginning of CIP to the different phases was calculated (acute phase: ≤4.9 weeks; subacute phase: 4.9~13.1 weeks; and chronic phase: ≥13.1 weeks). The symptoms relieved from the acute phase to the chronic phase, and the CIP grade and Performance Status score decreased (P<0.05). The main change in radiologic features was the absorption of the lesions, and 3 (3/11) patients in the chronic phase had persistent traction bronchiectasis. For histologic features, most patients had acute fibrinous pneumonitis in the acute phase (5/8), and most had organizing pneumonia in the subacute phase (5/6). Other histologic changes advanced over time, with the lesions entering a state of fibrosis. Moreover, the levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) increased in the acute phase and decreased as CIP progressed (IL-6: 17.9 vs. 9.8 vs. 5.7, P=0.018; IL-10: 4.6 vs 3.0 vs. 2.0, P=0.041; hsCRP: 88.2 vs. 19.4 vs. 14.4, P=0.005). The general development process of CIP can be divided into acute, subacute, and chronic phases, upon which a better management strategy might be based devised.",,170
2162,35967356,Increased frequency of TIGIT+ CD4 T Cell subset in autoantibody-positive first-degree relatives of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,"Despite immune cell dysregulation being an important event preceding the onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the phenotype of T and B cells in preclinical RA is less understood. The aim of this study was to characterize T and B cell populations in RA patients and their autoantibody (aAb) negative and positive first-degree relatives (FDR). Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected at scheduled visits from aAb-(n=25), and aAb+ FDR (n=10) and RA patients (n=13) were thawed and stained using optimized antibody cocktails as per a specific 13-color T or B cell panel. Immunophenotyping was performed using a Cytoflex LX (Beckman-Coulter) flow cytometer and FlowJo software was used for analyzing the frequency of immune cell populations. Multicolor flow cytometry experiments identified an increased TIGIT expression in circulating lymphocytes of aAb+ FDR and RA patients, relative to aAb- FDR (P<0.01). These TIGIT+ T cells exhibited a memory phenotype and expressed high levels of PD-1, ICOS, HLA-DR, CXCR3 and CXCR5. Moreover, increased TIGIT+ CD4 T cell frequency correlated with the frequency of PD-1+ CD4 T cells (r = 0.4705: P = 0.0043) and circulating levels of ACPA and RF. We also identified a decreased frequency of CD27+IgD- switched memory B cells in RA patients (P < 0.01), while increased frequency of TIGIT+ CD4 T cells in FDR correlated with the frequency of PD1+PTEN+ B cells (r = 0.6838, P = 0.0004) and autoantibody positivity (P = 0.01). We demonstrate TIGIT as a distinct CD4 T cell marker for differentiating aAb- FDR from aAb+FDR and might play a critical role in regulating T and B cell crosstalk in preclinical RA.",,171
2132,35967386,Emerging translational strategies and challenges for enhancing regulatory T cell therapy for graft-versus-host disease.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a curative therapy for many types of cancer. Genetic disparities between donor and host can result in immune-mediated attack of host tissues, known as graft versus host disease (GVHD), a major cause of morbidity and mortality following HSCT. Regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) are a rare cell type crucial for immune system homeostasis, limiting the activation and differentiation of effector T cells (Teff) that are self-reactive or stimulated by foreign antigen exposure. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with Treg has demonstrated, first in murine models and now in patients, that prophylactic Treg infusion can also suppress GVHD. While clinical trials have demonstrated Treg reduce severe GVHD occurrence, several impediments remain, including Treg variability and practical need for individualized Treg production for each patient. Additionally, there are challenges in the use of in vitro expansion techniques and in achieving in vivo Treg persistence in context of both immune suppressive drugs and in lymphoreplete patients being treated for GVHD. This review will focus on 3 main translational approaches taken to improve the efficacy of tTreg ACT in GVHD prophylaxis and development of treatment options, following HSCT: genetic modification, manipulating TCR and cytokine signaling, and Treg production protocols. In vitro expansion for Treg ACT presents a multitude of approaches for gene modification to improve efficacy, including: antigen specificity, tissue targeting, deletion of negative regulators/exhaustion markers, resistance to immunosuppressive drugs common in GVHD treatment. Such expansion is particularly important in patients without significant lymphopenia that can drive Treg expansion, enabling a favorable Treg:Teff ratio in vivo. Several potential therapeutics have also been identified that enhance tTreg stability or persistence/expansion following ACT that target specific pathways, including: DNA/histone methylation status, TCR/co-stimulation signaling, and IL-2/STAT5 signaling. Finally, this review will discuss improvements in Treg production related to tissue source, Treg subsets, therapeutic approaches to increase Treg suppression and stability during tTreg expansion, and potential for storing large numbers of Treg from a single production run to be used as an off-the-shelf infusion product capable of treating multiple recipients.",,172
1629,35968149,"Insights into the control of taxane metabolism: Molecular, cellular, and metabolic changes induced by elicitation in Taxus baccata cell suspensions.","More knowledge is needed about the molecular/cellular control of paclitaxel (PTX) production in Taxus spp. cell cultures. In this study, the yield of this anticancer agent in Taxus baccata cell suspensions was improved 11-fold after elicitation with coronatine (COR) compared to the untreated cells, and 18-fold when co-supplemented with methyl-β-cyclodextrins (β-CDs). In the dual treatment, the release of taxanes from the producer cells was greatly enhanced, with 81.6% of the total taxane content being found in the medium at the end of the experiment. The experimental conditions that caused the highest PTX production also induced its maximum excretion, and increased the expression of taxane biosynthetic genes, especially the flux-limiting BAPT and DBTNBT. The application of COR, which activates PTX biosynthesis, together with β - CDs, which form inclusion complexes with PTX and related taxanes, is evidently an efficient strategy for enhancing PTX production and release to the culture medium. Due to the recently described role of lipid droplets (LDs) in the trafficking and accumulation of hydrophobic taxanes in Taxus spp. cell cultures, the structure, number and taxane storage capacity of these organelles was also studied. In elicited cultures, the number of LDs increased and they mainly accumulated taxanes with a side chain, especially PTX. Thus, PTX constituted up to 50-70% of the total taxanes found in LDs throughout the experiment in the COR + β - CD-treated cultures. These results confirm that LDs can store taxanes and distribute them inside and outside cells.",,173
1376,35969078,Normothermic Ex Vivo Pancreas Perfusion for the Preservation of Pancreas Allografts before Transplantation.,"Pancreas transplantation (PTx) is a curative treatment for people who live with the burden of a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM). However, due to organ shortages and increasing numbers of patients being listed for PTx, new strategies are needed to increase the number of available grafts for transplantation. Static cold storage (SCS) is considered the gold standard for standard criteria organs. However, standard criteria donors (SCD) are becoming scarce and new strategies that can increase the rate of organ acceptance from extended criteria donors (ECD) are urgently needed. Normothermic ex vivo perfusion (NEVP) is one of the strategies that has become increasingly popular over the past couple of decades. This preservation method has already been used successfully in other organs (liver, kidneys, and lungs) but has been minimally explored in pancreas transplantation. The few papers that describe the method for pancreas show little success, edema being one of the major issues. The following manuscript describes the successful NEVP method and setup developed by our group to perfuse swine pancreas.",,174
2092,35967426,Identification and characterization of four immune-related signatures in keloid.,"A keloid is a fibroproliferative disorder of unknown etiopathogenesis that requires ill-defined treatment. Existing evidence indicates that the immune system plays an important role in the occurrence and development of keloid. However, there is still a lack of research on the immune-related signatures of keloid. Here we identified immune-related signatures in keloid and explored their pathological mechanisms. Transcriptomic datasets (GSE7890, GSE92566, and GSE44270) of keloid and normal skin tissues were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The overlap of differentially expressed genes and immune-related genes was considered as differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIGs). Functional analysis, expression, and distribution were applied to explore the function and characteristics of DEIGs, and the expression of these DEIGs in keloid and normal skin tissues was verified by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we conducted interactive network analysis and immune infiltration analysis to determine the therapeutic potential and immune correlation. We identified four DEIGs (LGR5, PTN, JAG1, and DKK1). In these datasets, only GSE7890 met the screening criteria. In the GSE7890 dataset, DKK1 and PTN were downregulated in keloid, whereas JAG1 and LGR5 were upregulated in keloid. In addition, we obtained the same conclusion through immunohistochemistry. Functional analysis indicated that these four DEIGs were mainly involved in stem cell, cell cycle, UV response, and therapy resistance. Through interactive network analysis, we found that these DEIGs were associated with drugs currently used to treat keloid, such as hydrocortisone, androstanolone, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, BHQ-880, and lecoleucovorin. Finally, many immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, resting memory CD4+ T cells, and M1 macrophages, were obtained by immune infiltration analysis. In conclusion, we identified four immune signaling molecules associated with keloid (LGR5, PTN, JAG1, and DKK1). These immune-related signaling molecules may be important modules in the pathogenesis of keloid. Additionally, we developed novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of this challenging disease.",,175
1727,35968016,BigBovid- Evaluation of a Newly Developed 9 mm Bullet-Shooting Stunner for Adequate Stunning of Heavy Cattle.,"The stunning of heavy cattle and water buffalo is an animal welfare problem, as conventional cartridge fired captive-bolt stunners are not suitable due to the thicker skull bones and the greater depth of penetration required to reach and damage the relevant brain regions for deep unconsciousness. This current animal welfare problem requires a suitable and feasible as well as commercially available and legally approved stunning device to ensure deep unconsciousness of these animals. In this study, the use of a newly developed bullet-shooting stunner, the BigBovid, with two different types of hunting ammunition, namely .38 SPL FMJ-TC and .357 MAG FTX ® bullets, was evaluated on 22 heavy cattle (mean weight: 1062.27 kg, standard deviation: 124.09 kg). In ballistic experiments, the BigBovid reached a mean energy density of 8.18 J/mm2 (mean error: 0.45 J/mm2) for the .38 SPL FMJ-TC and 17.56 J/mm2 (mean error: 2.67 J/mm2) for the .357 MAG FTX ®. In in vivo experiments, the use of the .38 SPL FMJ-TC resulted in overpenetration three times. The .357 MAG FTX ® bullets showed to be more advantageous, because on the one hand no overpenetration occurred and on the other hand the bullets fragmented into small parts after penetration into the skull. The fragments were scattered in the brain tissue, such as the thalamus and the brain stem, and thus there is a high probability to damage the brain regions relevant for deep unconsciousness. Based on the results of this study, the use of the BigBovid in combination with the .357 MAG FTX ® bullet is found to be suitable for stunning heavy cattle.",,176
77,35983406,Longer leukocyte telomere length is associated with myeloid inflammation and increased mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"Inflammatory activation of leukocytes may limit prognosis of patients (pts) with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a marker of proliferative capacity and inflammatory responsiveness but the impact of LTL on the prognosis in AS remains elusive. The aim of this study was to analyse the association of LTL with inflammatory markers and prognosis of pts undergoing TAVR. LTL was analysed using quantitative real-time PCR in 285 consecutive pts (median age 82 years) undergoing TAVR and correlated with 18-month all-cause mortality. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in pts with the longest LTL (P = 0.017), paralleled by increased procalcitonin (PCT) serum levels (P = 0.0006). This inflammatory reaction was accompanied by increased myeloid cells in the highest LTL tertile, mainly a rise in circulating neutrophils (P = 0.0025) and monocytes (P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed LTL (HR 2.6, 95%CI 1.4-5.1,  P= 0.004) and PCT levels (HR 4.3, 95%CI 1.7-11.0, P = 0.003) as independent predictors of mortality. Longer LTL is associated with increased mortality after TAVR. This might be explained by enhanced proliferative capacity of cells resulting in myeloid and systemic inflammation. Our findings suggest that targeting the specific inflammation pathways could present a novel strategy to augment survival in selected patients with degenerative aortic stenosis.",,177
873,35974850,The Efficacy of Platelet-Rich Fibrin in the Management of Chronic Nonhealing Ulcers of the Lower Limb.,"Introduction Nonhealing ulcers have a huge burden on the patient, by having high morbidity in terms of chronic pain, partial or complete loss of function, mental health issues, and social isolation, and can have a massive financial burden on the patient. Various novel therapies have been developed to treat nonhealing ulcers. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) has been developed in the recent era initially in the dental world for treating oral ulcers. Now, the role of PRF is strongly established in treating nonhealing ulcers. PRF has an aggregate of a myriad of growth factors and cytokines that stimulate healing of the wounds. In this study, we have compared the efficacy of PRF in treating nonhealing ulcers of the lower limb against normal saline dressings. Aims and objectives This study aims to determine the efficacy of platelet-rich fibrin over normal saline dressings in the treatment of nonhealing ulcers of the lower limb by comparing the percentage reduction in the surface area of wounds after treatment in both groups. Methods Fifty patients with nonhealing ulcers were selected and randomly divided into two groups with 25 patients in each group. Cases were treated with PRF dressings weekly for a period of six weeks. Controls were treated with normal saline dressings weekly for a period of six weeks. The percentage reduction in the size of the ulcer after treatment was recorded in both groups and compared. Patients of age 18-60 with nonhealing ulcers of the lower limb of >12 weeks duration have been included in the study. Patients having wounds with active infection, wound size > 35 cm2, uncontrolled diabetes, peripheral vascular disease with Ankle-Brachial Index < 0.9, osteomyelitis of the underlying bone, and immunocompromised state, and patients on antiplatelet drugs have been excluded from the study. Results The mean age of the patients included in the study was 42.88 ± 2.73 years. The mean initial surface of the wound​​​ was 14.95 ± 3.08 cm2 among cases and 13.28 ± 2.83 cm2 among controls. The mean surface area of the wound after six weeks was 1.59 ± 0.78 cm2 among cases and 11.08 ± 2.74 cm2 among controls. The mean percentage reduction in the wound size after six weeks of treatment was 89.3% among cases and is significantly higher than in the normal saline group (16.5%) (Mdn = 14.63, U = 23, p < 0.00001). Conclusion Platelet-rich fibrin is an emerging potential topical agent for the treatment of nonhealing ulcers of the lower limbs and is more effective than normal saline dressings and also has the advantage of being cost-effective.",,178
1329,35969959,"Cognitive impairment, childhood trauma, sedentary behaviour, and elevated C-reactive protein levels in major affective disorders.","Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were associated with cognitive decline, sedentary behaviour, and childhood trauma in patients with major affective disorders. This study aims to examine the association of peripheral CRP levels, cognitive function, childhood trauma, sedentary behaviour, and quality of life in individuals with major affective disorders, including bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and individuals without mood disorders (controls). We included outpatients with BD (n = 42), MDD (n = 27), and healthy controls (n = 40). All participants were assessed by a questionnaire, structured clinical interview, and the following scales: international physical activity questionnaire, childhood trauma questionnaire, 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17), and World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument, brief version (WHOQOL-BREF). Other measures were included: hs-CRP levels, anthropometric measures, and cognitive tests (Trail-making test part A and part B, Stroop test, phonemic verbal fluency test, and semantic verbal fluency test). Our results indicated that BD outpatients were less significantly physically active on leisure domain than controls. Levels of hs-CRP ≥ 5 mg/L were significantly linked with a history of childhood sexual abuse and childhood physical abuse, as well as worse neurocognitive performance in major depressive disorders, mainly in BD. There was a significant negative correlation between Trail-making part B score and WHOQOL-BREF total score. The findings support the hypothesis that levels of hs-CRP ≥ 5 mg/L may be a possible predictor of cognitive dysfunction, childhood sexual abuse and sedentary behaviour in major affective disorders.",,179
421,35979190,Impact of Diagnostic Delay on Disease Course in Pediatric- versus Adult-Onset Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: Data from the Swiss IBD Cohort.,"Given the lack of data, we aimed to assess the impact of the length of diagnostic delay on the natural history of ulcerative colitis (UC) in pediatric (diagnosed <18 years) and adult patients (diagnosed ≥18 years). Data from the Swiss Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort Study were analyzed. Diagnostic delay was defined as the interval between the first appearance of UC-related symptoms until diagnosis. Logistic regression modeling evaluated the appearance of the following complications in the long term according to the length of diagnostic delay: colonic dysplasia, colorectal cancer, UC-related hospitalization, colectomy, and extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs). A total of 184 pediatric and 846 adult patients were included. The median diagnostic delay was 4 [IQR 2-7.5] months for the pediatric-onset group and 3 [IQR 2-10] months for the adult-onset group (p = 0.873). In both, pediatric- and adult-onset groups, the length of diagnostic delay at UC diagnosis was not associated with colectomy, UC-related hospitalization, colon dysplasia, and colorectal cancer. EIMs were significantly more prevalent at UC diagnosis in the adult-onset group with long diagnostic delay than in the adult-onset group with short diagnostic delay (p = 0.022). In the long term, the length of diagnostic delay was associated in the adult-onset group with colorectal dysplasia (p = 0.023), EIMs (p < 0.001), and more specifically arthritis/arthralgias (p < 0.001) and ankylosing spondylitis/sacroiliitis (p < 0.001). In the pediatric-onset UC group, the length of diagnostic delay in the long term was associated with arthritis/arthralgias (p = 0.017); however, it was not predictive for colectomy and UC-related hospitalization. As colorectal cancer and EIMs are associated with considerable morbidity and costs, every effort should be made to reduce diagnostic delay in UC patients.",,180
1352,35969695,Estimating milk production losses by heat stress and its impacts on greenhouse gas emissions in Korean dairy farms.,"Meteorological disasters caused by climate change like heat, cold waves, and unusually long rainy seasons affect the milk productivity of cows. Studies have been conducted on how milk productivity and milk compositions change due to heat stress (HS). However, the estimation of losses in milk production due to HS and hereby environmental impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are yet to be evaluated in Korean dairy farms. Dairy milk production and milk compositions data from March to October 2018, provided by the Korea Dairy Committee (KDC), were used to compare regional milk production with the temperature-humidity index (THI). Raw data for the daily temperature and relative humidity in 2018 were obtained from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). This data was used to calculate the THI and the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature changing rate, as the average daily temperature range, to show the extent to which the temperature gap can affect milk productivity. The amount of milk was calculated based on the price of 926 won/kg from KDC. The results showed that the average milk production rate was the highest within the THI range 60-73 in three regions in May: Chulwon (northern region), Hwasung (central region), and Gunwi (southern region). The average milk production decreased by 4.96 ± 1.48% in northern region, 7.12 ± 2.36% in central region, and 7.94 ± 2.57% in southern region from June to August, which had a THI range of 73 or more, when compared to May. Based on the results, the level of THI should be maintained like May. If so, the farmers can earn a profit of 9,128,730 won/farm in northern region, 9,967,880 won/farm in central region, and 12,245,300 won/farm in southern region. Additionally, the average number of cows raised can be reduced by 2.41 ± 0.35 heads/farm, thereby reducing GHG emissions by 29.61 ± 4.36 kg CO2eq/day on average. Overall, the conclusion suggests that maintaining environmental conditions in the summer that are similar to those in May is necessary. This knowledge can be used for basic research to persuade farmers to change farm facilities to increase the economic benefits and improve animal welfare.",,181
1745,35967997,Mapping sheep to human brain: The need for a sheep brain atlas.,"A brain atlas is essential for understanding the anatomical relationship between neuroanatomical structures. Standard stereotaxic coordinates and reference systems have been developed for humans, non-human primates and small laboratory animals to contribute to translational neuroscience research. Despite similar neuroanatomical and neurofunctional features between the sheep and human brain, little is known of the sheep brain stereotaxy, and a detailed sheep atlas is scarce. Here, we briefly discuss the value of using sheep in neurological research and the paucity of literature concerning the coordinates system during neurosurgical approaches. Recent advancements such as computerized tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging are used for targeting and localizing the coordinates and brain areas in humans. Still, their application in sheep is rare due to the lack of a 3D stereotaxic sheep atlas by which to map sheep brain structures to its human counterparts. More recently, a T1- and T2-weighted high-resolution MRI 3D stereotaxic atlas of the sheep brain has been generated, however, the journey to create a sheep brain atlas by which to map directly to the human brain is still uncharted. Therefore, developing a detailed sheep brain atlas is valuable for the future to facilitate the use of sheep as a large animal experimental non-primate model for translational neurological research.",,182
1524,35968362,"Cognition, Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Repressor Methylation, and Abstinence Duration-Associated Multimodal Brain Networks in Smoking and Long-Term Smoking Cessation.","Cigarette smoking and smoking cessation are associated with changes in cognition and DNA methylation; however, the neurobiological correlates of these effects have not been fully elucidated, especially in long-term cessation. Cognitive performance, percent methylation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene, and abstinence duration were used as references to supervise a multimodal fusion analysis of functional, structural, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, in order to identify associated brain networks in smokers and ex-smokers. Correlations among these networks and with smoking-related measures were performed. Cognition-, methylation-, and abstinence duration-associated networks discriminated between smokers and ex-smokers and correlated with differences in fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) values, gray matter volume (GMV), and fractional anisotropy (FA) values. Long-term smoking cessation was associated with more accurate cognitive performance, as well as lower fALFF and more GMV in the hippocampus complex. The methylation- and abstinence duration-associated networks positively correlated with smoking-related measures of abstinence duration and percent methylation, respectively, suggesting they are complementary measures. This analysis revealed structural and functional co-alterations linked to smoking abstinence and cognitive performance in brain regions including the insula, frontal gyri, and lingual gyri. Furthermore, AHRR methylation, a promising epigenetic biomarker of smoking recency, may provide an important complement to self-reported abstinence duration.",,183
2210,35967308,Immunogenicity Risk Assessment of Spontaneously Occurring Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibody Aggregates.,"Aggregates of therapeutic proteins have been associated with increased immunogenicity in pre-clinical models as well as in human patients. Recent studies to understand aggregates and their immunogenicity risks use artificial stress methods to induce high levels of aggregation. These methods may be less biologically relevant in terms of their quantity than those that occur spontaneously during processing and storage. Here we describe the immunogenicity risk due to spontaneously occurring therapeutic antibody aggregates using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and a cell line with a reporter gene for immune activation: THP-1 BLUE NFκB. The spontaneously occurring therapeutic protein aggregates were obtained from process intermediates and final formulated drug substance from stability retains. Spontaneously occurring aggregates elicited innate immune responses for several donors in a PBMC assay with cytokine and chemokine production as a readout for immune activation. Meanwhile, no significant adaptive phase responses to spontaneously occurring aggregate samples were detected. While the THP-1 BLUE NFκB cell line and PBMC assays both responded to high stress induced aggregates, only the PBMC from a limited subset of donors responded to processing-induced aggregates. In this case study, levels of antibody aggregation occurring at process relevant levels are lower than those induced by stirring and may pose lower risk in vivo. Our methodologies can further inform additional immunogenicity risk assessments using a pre-clinical in vitro risk assessment approach utilizing human derived immune cells.",,184
563,35978571,Fluorescence Imaging of 3D Cell Models with Subcellular Resolution.,"Over the past years, research has made impressive breakthroughs towards the development and implementation of 3D cell models for a wide range of applications, such as drug development and testing, organogenesis, cancer biology, and personalized medicine. Opposed to 2D cell monolayer culture systems, advanced 3D cell models better represent the in vivo physiology. However, for these models to deliver scientific insights, appropriate investigation techniques are required. Despite the potential of fluorescence microscopy to visualize these models with high spatial resolution, sample preparation and imaging assays are not straightforward. Here, we provide different protocols of sample preparation for fluorescence imaging, for both matrix-embedded and matrix-free models ( e.g ., organoids and spheroids, respectively). Additionally, we provide detailed guidelines for imaging 3D cell models via confocal multi-photon fluorescence microscopy. We show that using these protocols, images of 3D cell culture systems can be obtained with sub-cellular resolution. Graphical abstract.",,185
472,35978883,Characteristics of inflammatory bowel diseases in patients with concurrent immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are more likely to have concurrent immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) than those without IBD. IMIDs have been observed to alter the phenotype and outcomes of IBD in recent studies. Several studies have found that IBD patients with concurrent IMIDs may have more extensive or severe disease phenotypes, and are considered to be at increased risk of requiring biologics and IBD-related surgeries, suggesting that having multiple IMIDs is a poor prognostic factor for IBD. Furthermore, IBD patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and Takayasu arteritis are reported to have unique endoscopic phenotypes, suggesting concurrent IMIDs can influence IBD phenotype with specific intestinal inflammatory distributions. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis, disease phenotypes, and clinical outcomes in IBD patients with concomitant IMIDs.",,186
1366,35969097,Self-Nanoemulsification of Healthy Oils to Enhance the Solubility of Lipophilic Drugs.,"The low aqueous solubility of many drugs reduces their bioavailability in the blood. Oils have been used for centuries to enhance the solubility of drugs; however, they can disturb the lipid profile of the patients. In this study, self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems of omega-3 fatty acids-rich oils are prepared and optimized for the delivery of lipophilic drugs. Rosuvastatin, a potent hypolipidemic drug, was used as a model lipophilic drug. Fish oil showed more than 7-fold higher solubility of rosuvastatin than other oils and therefore it was selected for the development of self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS). Different combinations of surfactants and co-surfactants were screened and a surfactant mixture of Tween 80 (surfactant) and Capryol PGMC (cosurfactant) were selected for compatibility with fish oil and rosuvastatin. A pseudoternary phase diagram of oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant was designed to identify the emulsion region. The pseudoternary phase diagram predicted a 1:3 oil and surfactant mixture as the most stable ratio for the emulsion system. Then, a response-surface methodology (Box-Behnken design) was applied to calculate the optimal composition. After 17 runs, fish oil, Tween 80, and Capryol PGMC in proportions of 0.399, 0.67, and 0.17, respectively, were selected as the optimized formulation. The self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems showed excellent emulsification potential, robustness, stability, and drug release characteristics. In the drug release studies, SNEDDS released 100% of the payload in around 6 h whereas, release of the plain drug was less than 70% even after 12 h. Therefore, omega-3 fatty acids-rich healthy lipids have enormous potential to enhance the solubility of lipophilic drugs whereas, self-emulsification can be used as a simple and feasible approach to exploit this potential.",,187
24,35985125,High-density EEG power topography and connectivity during confusional arousal.,"Confusional arousal is the milder expression of a family of disorders known as Disorders of Arousal (DOA) from non-REM sleep. These disorders are characterized by recurrent abnormal behaviors that occur in a state of reduced awareness for the external environment. Despite frequent amnesia for the nocturnal events, when actively probed, patients are able to report vivid hallucinatory/dream-like mental imagery. Traditional (low-density) scalp and stereo-electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings previously showed a pathological admixture of slow oscillations typical of NREM sleep and wake-like fast-mixed frequencies during these phenomena. However, our knowledge about the specific neural EEG dynamics over the entire brain is limited. We collected 2 consecutive in-laboratory sleep recordings using high-density (hd)-EEG (256 vertex-referenced geodesic system) coupled with standard video-polysomnography (v-PSG) from a 12-year-old drug-naïve and otherwise healthy child with a long-lasting history of sleepwalking. Source power topography and functional connectivity were computed during 20 selected confusional arousal episodes (from -6 to +18 sec after motor onset), and during baseline slow wave sleep preceding each episode (from - 3 to -2 min before onset). We found a widespread increase in slow wave activity (SWA) theta, alpha, beta, gamma power, associated with a parallel decrease in the sigma range during behavioral episodes compared to baseline sleep. Bilateral Broadman area 7 and right Broadman areas 39 and 40 were relatively spared by the massive increase in SWA power. Functional SWA connectivity analysis revealed a drastic increase in the number and complexity of connections from baseline sleep to full-blown episodes, that mainly involved an increased out-flow from bilateral fronto-medial prefrontal cortex and left temporal lobe to other cortical regions. These effects could be appreciated in the 6 sec window preceding behavioral onset. Overall, our results support the idea that DOA are the expression of peculiar brain states, compatible with a partial re-emergence of consciousness.",,188
2453,35966839,Sepsis affects kidney graft function and one-year mortality of the recipients in contrast with systemic inflammatory response.,"Infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality after kidney transplantation. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of sepsis on kidney graft function and recipient mortality. A prospective, observational, single-center study was performed. Selected clinical and biochemical parameters were recorded and compared between an experimental group (with sepsis, n = 34) and a control group (with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, n = 31) comprising kidney allograft recipients. Sepsis worsened both patient (HR = 14.77, p = 0.007) and graft survival (HR = 15.07, p = 0.007). Overall one-year mortality was associated with age (HR = 1.08, p = 0.048), APACHE II score (HR = 1.13, p = 0.035), and combination immunosuppression therapy (HR = 0.1, p = 0.006), while graft survival was associated with APACHE II (HR = 1.25, p = 0.004) and immunosuppression. In sepsis patients, mortality correlated with the maximal dose of noradrenalin (HR = 100.96, p = 0.008), fungal infection (HR = 5.64, p = 0.024), SAPS II score (HR = 1.06, p = 0.033), and mechanical ventilation (HR = 5.97, p = 0.033), while graft survival was influenced by renal replacement therapy (HR = 21.16, p = 0.005), APACHE II (HR = 1.19, p = 0.035), and duration of mechanical ventilation (HR = 1.01, p = 0.015). In contrast with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, septic kidney allograft injury is associated with early graft loss and may represent a significant risk of mortality.",,189
1129,35973930,Enhanced recovery after surgery is feasible and safe in liver transplantation: a cohort study.,"The principles of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) are being applied to still more advanced procedures. Liver transplantation offers a unique opportunity for a multimodal approach including donor care as well. Our objective was to determine if ERAS was applicable and safe in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). A national single centre retrospective study showing the implementation of ERAS from 2013 to 2019 with the proceeding 2 years serving as baseline. The primary endpoints were mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the ward and intensive care unit stay. Secondary endpoints were complications estimated by Dindo-Clavien classification, comprehensive complication index (CCI®) and re-admissions. A total of 334 patients were included. LOS was significantly reduced from a median of 22.5 days at introduction to 14 days at 2019. Cold ischaemia time was reduced from a mean of 10.7 to 6.0 h and the use of blood products (erythrocytes, plasma and thrombocytes) from a median of 28 to 6 units. Complications were reduced in severity. Mortality and readmission rates were not affected. ERAS principles are safe and recommended in patients undergoing OLT resulting in reduced severity of complications and LOS without affecting re-admissions or mortality.",,190
1736,35968006,Integrative Model of Human-Animal Interactions: A One Health-One Welfare Systemic Approach to Studying HAI.,"The Integrative Model of Human-Animal Interactions (IMHAI) described herewith provides a conceptual framework for the study of interspecies interactions and aims to model the primary emotional processes involved in human-animal interactions. This model was developed from theoretical inputs from three fundamental disciplines for understanding interspecies interactions: neuroscience, psychology and ethology, with the objective of providing a transdisciplinary approach on which field professionals and researchers can build and collaborate. Seminal works in affective neuroscience offer a common basis between humans and animals and, as such, can be applied to the study of interspecies interactions from a One Health-One Welfare perspective. On the one hand, Jaak Panksepp's research revealed that primary/basic emotions originate in the deep subcortical regions of the brain and are shared by all mammals, including humans. On the other hand, several works in the field of neuroscience show that the basic physiological state is largely determined by the perception of safety. Thus, emotional expression reflects the state of an individual's permanent adaptation to ever-changing environmental demands. Based on this evidence and over 5 years of action research using grounded theory, alternating between research and practice, the IMHAI proposes a systemic approach to the study of primary-process emotional affects during interspecies social interactions, through the processes of emotional transfer, embodied communication and interactive emotional regulation. IMHAI aims to generate new hypotheses and predictions on affective behavior and interspecies communication. Application of such a model should promote risk prevention and the establishment of positive links between humans and animals thereby contributing to their respective wellbeing.",,191
2101,35967417,Gut mucosal immune responses and protective efficacy of oral yeast Cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV-2) vaccine in Carassius auratus gibelio.,"Cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV-2) causes herpesviral hematopoietic necrosis (HVHN) disease outbreaks in farmed Cyprinid fish, which leads to serious economic losses worldwide. Although oral vaccination is considered the most suitable strategy for preventing infectious diseases in farmed fish, so far there is no commercial oral vaccine available for controlling HVNN in gibel carp (C. auratus gibelio). In the present study, we developed for the first time an oral vaccine against CyHV-2 by using yeast cell surface display technology and then investigated the effect of this vaccine in gibel carp. Furthermore, the protective efficacy was evaluated by comparing the immune response of a single vaccination with that of a booster vaccination (booster-vaccinated once 2 weeks after the initial vaccination). Critically, the activities of immune-related enzymes and genes expression in vaccine group, especially in the booster vaccine group, were higher than those in the control group. Moreover, strong innate and adaptive immune responses could be elicited in both mucosal and systemic tissues after receipt of the oral yeast vaccine. To further understand the protective efficacy of this vaccine in gibel carp, we successfully developed the challenge model with CyHV-2. Our results showed the relative percent survival was 66.7% in the booster vaccine group, indicating this oral yeast vaccine is a promising vaccine for controlling CyHV-2 disease in gibel carp aquaculture.",,192
1810,35967845,Investigating the effect of bacteriophages on bacterial FtsZ localisation.,"Escherichia coli is one of the most common Gram-negative pathogens and is responsible for infection leading to neonatal meningitis and sepsis. The FtsZ protein is a bacterial tubulin homolog required for cell division in most species, including E. coli. Several agents that block cell division have been shown to mislocalise FtsZ, including the bacteriophage λ-encoded Kil peptide, resulting in defective cell division and a filamentous phenotype, making FtsZ an attractive target for antimicrobials. In this study, we have used an in vitro meningitis model system for studying the effect of bacteriophages on FtsZ using fluorescent E. coli EV36/FtsZ-mCherry and K12/FtsZ-mNeon strains. We show localisation of FtsZ to the bacterial cell midbody as a single ring during normal growth conditions, and mislocalisation of FtsZ producing filamentous multi-ringed bacterial cells upon addition of the known inhibitor Kil peptide. We also show that when bacteriophages K1F-GFP and T7-mCherry were applied to their respective host strains, these phages can inhibit FtsZ and block bacterial cell division leading to a filamentous multi-ringed phenotype, potentially delaying lysis and increasing progeny number. This occurs in the exponential growth phase, as actively dividing hosts are needed. We present that ZapA protein is needed for phage inhibition by showing a phenotype recovery with a ZapA mutant strain, and we show that FtsI protein is also mislocalised upon phage infection. Finally, we show that the T7 peptide gp0.4 is responsible for the inhibition of FtsZ in K12 strains by observing a phenotype recovery with a T7Δ0.4 mutant.",,193
1725,35968018,Loss of H3K27me3 expression in canine nerve sheath tumors.,"Nerve sheath tumors (NSTs) are characterized by neoplastic proliferation of Schwann cells, perineurial cells, endoneurial and/or epineurial fibroblasts. Diagnosis of NST is often challenging, particularly in distinguishing malignant NST (MNST) from other soft tissue sarcomas, or sometimes between low-grade MNST and benign NST. Recent studies in human pathology have demonstrated loss of trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) in a subset of MNSTs using immunohistochemistry. Loss of H3K27me3 expression is rare in other high-grade sarcomas and also appears to be useful in distinguishing benign and low-grade MNSTs from high-grade subsets. In our retrospective study, we performed H3K27me3 immunohistochemistry in 68 canine tumors previously diagnosed as NST. We detected loss of H3K27me3 expression in 25% (n = 17) of all canine NST, including one neurofibroma, whereas 49% (n = 33) of tumors had mosaic loss of expression and 26% (n = 18) retained expression. No statistically significant differences were found between H3K27me3 expression, histopathological features of tumors, and their immunoreactivity for Sox10, claudin-1, GFAP, and Ki67. Because the classification of canine NST is not yet fully established and its correlation with the prognosis and clinical course of the disease is lacking, prospective studies with possible genetic analyses are needed to assess the true diagnostic value of H3K27me3 loss in canine NST.",,194
272,35982552,The effects of pH on the production of volatile fatty acids and microbial dynamics in long-term reactor operation.,"Volatile fatty acids, intermediate products of anaerobic digestion, are one of the most promising biobased products. In this study, the effects of acidic (pH 5), neutral (without pH adjustment) and alkali (pH 10) pH on production efficiency and composition of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and bacterial community profile were analyzed. The anaerobic sequencing batch reactors were fed cheese production wastewater as substrate and inoculated by anaerobic granular seed sludge. The results showed that acidic pH improved VFA production yield (0.92 at pH 5; 0.42 at pH 10 and 0.21 gCOD/gVS at neutral pH). Furthermore, propionic acid was dominant under both pH 10 (64 ± 20%) and neutral pH (72 ± 8%), whereas, acetic acid (23 ± 20%4), propionic acid (22 ± 3%), butyric acid (21 ± 4%) and valeric acid (15 ± 8%) were almost equally distributed under pH 5. Adaptation of bacterial community to different pH conditions might steer the acid profile: Bacteroidetes (50.07 ± 2%) under pH 10, Proteobacteria (40.74 ± 7%) under neutral pH and Firmicutes (47.64 ± 9%) under pH 5 were the most dominant phylum, respectively. Results indicated pH plays a significant role in VFA production, acid composition, and bacterial community structure. However, in order to gain a concrete understanding effects of pH, characterization of intracellular and extracellular metabolites with dynamics of the microbial community is required.",,195
841,35974930,Effect of low dose nebulized morphine on respiratory function improvement in mustard gas-exposed patients: A double-blind crossover clinical trial study.,"Mustard is one of the most destructive chemical gases used in chemical warfare. Several studies showed effectiveness of inhaled morphine as a secondary treatment for the improvement of dyspnea. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the efficacy of low dose inhaled morphine for respiratory function improvement in patients who were exposed to the mustard gas. This study was designed as a cross-over double-blinded clinical trial. Patients exposed to mustard gas were randomly assigned into two groups: 1) received 0.4 mg of morphine by inhalation and 2) received 5 ml of normal saline serum as a placebo in the same manner. After a washout period of one week, the first group received the placebo and the second group received morphine for 5 days. Spirometric indices, expiratory flow peak, exercise test, severity of dyspnea, and quality of life were evaluated as respiratory function parameters. Data analysis was done using SPSS software Version 16. The mean maximum expiratory flow was significantly higher among cases who used morphine in comparison with the placebo group (p<0.05). Moreover, the severity of dyspnea, quality of life, and the frequency of coughing during the day were significantly improved among the recipients of morphine (p<0.05) while the spirometric indices and exercise tolerance tests were similar between the two groups (p>0.05), but the mean peak expiratory flow (PEFR) was significantly higher among the patients receiving morphine than the placebo patients (p<0.001). The use of inhaled morphine had a significant positive effect on the respiratory system of people exposed to mustard gas. We can use low doses of inhaled morphine to improve the respiratory function of these patients as a secondary therapy.",,196
384,35979290,Magnetic resonance imaging features of intrahepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis: Three case reports.,"Extramedullary hematopoiesis rarely occurs within the liver alone, and is easily misdiagnosed. The radiological literature on this disease is exclusively case reports. There is a paucity of literature on the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The most common imaging modalities used are computed tomography and ultrasound. This report aims to provide more data on the appearance of extramedullary hematopoiesis using MRI to help radiologists establish the diagnosis. Three patients (one male and two females) were incidentally found to have a hepatic mass or nodule, without hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Laboratory tests including liver function, serum hepatic tumor markers, and hepatitis serologic markers were normal. On MRI scans, all lesions showed lower signal intensity on in-phase images than on out-phase images. One case showed changes in signal intensity on T2 weighted images (WI) and diffusion WI, which shifted from hyperintensity to hypointensity with size enlargement between two rounds of imaging examination. These lesions exhibited different enhancement patterns on dynamic contrast enhancement series. The MRI signal change and in-/out-phase image might provide useful information and help radiologists establish the diagnosis of intrahepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis.",,197
1012,35974607,Inferring spatial source of disease outbreaks using maximum entropy.,"Mathematical modeling of disease outbreaks can infer the future trajectory of an epidemic, allowing for making more informed policy decisions. Another task is inferring the origin of a disease, which is relatively difficult with current mathematical models. Such frameworks, across varying levels of complexity, are typically sensitive to input data on epidemic parameters, case counts, and mortality rates, which are generally noisy and incomplete. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a maximum entropy framework that fits epidemiological models, provides calibrated infection origin probabilities, and is robust to noise due to a prior belief model. Maximum entropy is agnostic to the parameters or model structure used and allows for flexible use when faced with sparse data conditions and incomplete knowledge in the dynamical phase of disease-spread, providing for more reliable modeling at early stages of outbreaks. We evaluate the performance of our model by predicting future disease trajectories based on simulated epidemiological data in synthetic graph networks and the real mobility network of New York State. In addition, unlike existing approaches, we demonstrate that the method can be used to infer the origin of the outbreak with accurate confidence. Indeed, despite the prevalent belief on the feasibility of contact-tracing being limited to the initial stages of an outbreak, we report the possibility of reconstructing early disease dynamics, including the epidemic seed, at advanced stages.",,198
1370,35969090,Generation of a Mouse Artificial Decidualization Model with Ovariectomy for Endometrial Decidualization Research.,"Endometrial decidualization is a unique differentiation process of the endometrium, closely related to menstruation and pregnancy. Impairment of decidualization leads to various endometrial disorders, such as infertility, recurrent miscarriage, and preterm birth. The development and use of the endometrial decidualization model in reproductive studies have been a highlight for reproductive researchers for a long time. The mouse has been extensively used in studying reproduction and decidualization. There are three well-established mouse models regarding decidualization, namely natural pregnancy decidualization (NPD), artificial decidualization (AD), and in vitro decidualization (IVD). Among them, AD is considered a reliable model for mouse decidualization, which is easy to implement and close to NPD. This paper focuses on a modified method of the generation and application process of the mouse artificial decidualization model with ovariectomy to avoid ovarian effects, which can obtain highly reproducible results with small within group variances. This method provides a good and reliable animal model for the study of endometrial decidualization.",,199
1645,35968129,A Moss 2-Oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-Dependent Dioxygenases (2-ODD) Gene of Flavonoids Biosynthesis Positively Regulates Plants Abiotic Stress Tolerance.,"Flavonoids, the largest group of polyphenolic secondary metabolites present in all land plants, play essential roles in many biological processes and defense against abiotic stresses. In the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, flavones synthase I (FNSI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS), and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) all belong to 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODDs) family, which catalyzes the critical oxidative reactions to form different flavonoid subgroups. Here, a novel 2-ODD gene was cloned from Antarctic moss Pohlia nutans (Pn2-ODD1) and its functions were investigated both in two model plants, Physcomitrella patens and Arabidopsis thaliana. Heterologous expression of Pn2-ODD1 increased the accumulation of anthocyanins and flavonol in Arabidopsis. Meanwhile, the transgenic P. patens and Arabidopsis with expressing Pn2-ODD1 exhibited enhanced tolerance to salinity and drought stresses, with larger gametophyte sizes, better seed germination, and longer root growth. Heterologous expression of Pn2-ODD1 in Arabidopsis also conferred the tolerance to UV-B radiation and oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant capacity. Therefore, we showed that Pn2-ODD1 participated in the accumulation of anthocyanins and flavonol in transgenic plants, and regulated the tolerance to abiotic stresses in plants, contributing to the adaptation of P. nutans to the polar environment.",,200
1808,35967847,Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with ICU-acquired infections in sepsis: A retrospective cohort study.,"Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infection is a common cause of poor prognosis of sepsis in the ICU. However, sepsis-associated ICU-acquired infections have not been fully characterized. The study aims to assess the risk factors and develop a model that predicts the risk of ICU-acquired infections in patients with sepsis. We retrieved data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify independent risk factors that could predict ICU-acquired infection. We also assessed its discrimination and calibration abilities and compared them with classical score systems. Of 16,808 included septic patients, 2,871 (17.1%) developed ICU-acquired infection. These patients with ICU-acquired infection had a 17.7% ICU mortality and 31.8% in-hospital mortality and showed a continued rise in mortality from 28 to 100 days after ICU admission. The classical Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Score (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III) scores were associated with ICU-acquired infection, and cerebrovascular insufficiency, Gram-negative bacteria, surgical ICU, tracheostomy, central venous catheter, urinary catheter, mechanical ventilation, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, LODS score and anticoagulant therapy were independent predictors of developing ICU-acquired infection in septic patients. The nomogram on the basis of these independent predictors showed good calibration and discrimination in both the derivation (AUROC = 0.737; 95% CI, 0.725-0.749) and validation (AUROC = 0.751; 95% CI, 0.734-0.769) populations and was superior to that of SIRS, SOFA, OASIS, SAPS II, LODS, CCI, and APS III models. ICU-acquired infections increase the likelihood of septic mortality. The individualized prognostic model on the basis of the nomogram could accurately predict ICU-acquired infection and optimize management or tailored therapy.",,201
214,35982806,Comparison of Accuracy in Calculation of Absorbed Dose to the Kidneys Following Radioligand Therapy with 177Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 by Two Different Background Correction Methods.,"To improve the accuracy of activity image quality, scatter correction is a critical method. The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy in calculation of absorbed dose to patients following radioligand therapy (RLT) with 177Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 by two different methods of background correction in the conjugate view method. This study involved 10 patients. The individualized patient dosimetry calculations were based on whole-body planar scintigraphy images acquired in 10 patients with a mean age of 71.4 ± 6.07 years (range 63-85 years) at approximately 0-2 h, 4-6 h, 18-24 h, and 36-48 h after administration of the mean 6253 ± 826.4 MBq (range 5500-7400 MBq) of 177Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617. Organ activities were calculated using the conjugate view method by Buijs and conventional background correction. Eventually, the absorbed dose of radiation was calculated using Medical Internal Radiation Dose formalism. The dose per unit of injected activity (mGy/MBq) ± standard deviation for kidney using Buijs and conventional methods was 1.05 ± 0.11 and 0.63 ± 0.14, respectively. The Buijs background correction method was more accurate than the conventional method.",,202
103,35983380,Disseminated Salmonella Infection in an Immunocompromised Patient.,"Salmonella infection is a major public health concern worldwide. While non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars typically present with gastroenteritis, a disseminated infection may occur in high-risk individuals. After the initial invasion of the gastrointestinal mucosa, Salmonella spp. are capable of hematogenous dissemination throughout the body, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. We present a case of an immunocompromised patient with lower extremity abscesses, septic arthritis, and necrotizing fasciitis to highlight an uncommon presentation of disseminated Salmonella infection.",,203
2447,35966848,Multi-utility of therapeutic drug monitoring in inflammatory bowel diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment targets have progressed over time from clinical response to clinical and endoscopic remission. Several data have shown a positive correlation between serum biologic drug concentrations and favorable therapeutic outcomes. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has evolved as an important approach for optimizing the use of immunobiologics, especially antitumor necrosis factor therapy, in patients with IBD. The use of TDM is supported by medical societies and IBD experts in different contexts; however, challenges remain due to knowledge gaps that limit the widespread use of it. The aim of this review is to assess the role of TDM in IBD, focusing on the implementation of this strategy in different scenarios and demonstrating the multi-utility aspects of this approach in clinical practice.",,204
2382,35966991,A novel multiple time-frequency sequential coding strategy for hybrid brain-computer interface.,"For brain-computer interface (BCI) communication, electroencephalography provides a preferable choice due to its high temporal resolution and portability over other neural recording techniques. However, current BCIs are unable to sufficiently use the information from time and frequency domains simultaneously. Thus, we proposed a novel hybrid time-frequency paradigm to investigate better ways of using the time and frequency information. We adopt multiple omitted stimulus potential (OSP) and steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP) to design the hybrid paradigm. A series of pre-experiments were undertaken to study factors that would influence the feasibility of the hybrid paradigm and the interaction between multiple features. After that, a novel Multiple Time-Frequencies Sequential Coding (MTFSC) strategy was introduced and explored in experiments. Omissions with multiple short and long durations could effectively elicit time and frequency features, including the multi-OSP, ERP, and SSVEP in this hybrid paradigm. The MTFSC was feasible and efficient. The preliminary online analysis showed that the accuracy and the ITR of the nine-target stimulator over thirteen subjects were 89.04% and 36.37 bits/min. This study first combined the SSMVEP and multi-OSP in a hybrid paradigm to produce robust and abundant time features for coding BCI. Meanwhile, the MTFSC proved feasible and showed great potential in improving performance, such as expanding the number of BCI targets by better using time information in specific stimulated frequencies.

The abusive use of antimicrobials may be an essential factor for the emergence of ESC resistance in N. gonorrhoeae. Cephalosporin resistance mechanisms have not been fully clarified. In this study, we mapped mutations in the genome of N. gonorrhoeae isolates after resistance induction with cefixime and explored related metabolic pathways. Six clinical isolates with different antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and genotypes and two gonococcal reference strains (WHO F and WHO Y) were induced with increasing concentrations of cefixime. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed against six antimicrobial agents before and after induction. Clinical isolates were whole-genome sequenced before and after induction, whereas reference strains were sequenced after induction only. Cefixime resistance induction was completed after 138 subcultures. Several metabolic pathways were affected by resistance induction. Five isolates showed SNPs in PBP2. The isolates M111 and M128 (ST1407 with mosaic penA-34.001) acquired one and four novel missense mutations in PBP2, respectively. These isolates exhibited the highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for cefixime among all clinical isolates. Mutations in genes contributing to ESC resistance and in other genes were also observed. Interestingly, M107 and M110 (ST338) showed no mutations in key determinants of ESC resistance despite having a 127-fold increase in the MIC of cefixime. These findings point to the existence of different mechanisms of acquisition of ESC resistance induced by cefixime exposure. Furthermore, the results reinforce the importance of the gonococcal antimicrobial resistance surveillance program in Brazil, given the changes in treatment protocols made in 2017 and the nationwide prevalence of sequence types that can develop resistance to ESC.",,206
1256,35971359,Serial Electrocardiographic Changes in Early Post-myocardial Infarction Pericarditis.,"A 72-year-old man developed fever and chest pain, accompanied by an increase in C-reactive protein, four days after successful emergency catheter intervention for an acute wide anterior myocardial infarction (MI). A twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed marked ST elevation in leads V1-6, I, and aVL, with reciprocal ST depression in leads II, III, and aVF. Although these ECG changes improved by day three, he developed fever and chest pain on day four, and an ECG at this timepoint showed ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and mild worsening of the ST elevation in the anterolateral leads, indicating diffuse ST-segment elevation consistent with acute pericarditis. Despite the presence of a typical friction rub, there was no pericardial effusion on an echocardiogram. No elevation of cardiac enzymes was noted. A diagnosis of early post-infarction pericarditis was made, and the patient was successfully treated with acetaminophen and colchicine. Early post-infarction pericarditis (EPIP), albeit rare in the era of emergency catheter treatment, is important because it may indicate a large transmural infarction and must be differentiated from re-infarction. Fever, chest pain, friction rub, ST elevation in the leads distant from the infarct area, recurrence of ST-segment elevation in the infarct area, and increase in inflammatory markers but not cardiac enzymes were crucial for establishing a diagnosis of EPIP.",,207
866,35974857,A Systematic Review of SARS-CoV-2-Associated Hepatic Dysfunction and the Impact on the Clinical Outcome of COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe since December 2019. The spectrum of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 ranges from mild to life-threatening forms. Alteration of hepatic function in COVID-19 is multifactorial. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced hepatic dysfunction and the clinical outcome in patients infected with COVID-19. We methodically explored several electronic databases (PubMed, PubMed Central, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar) in April 2022 using focused words and terms of medical subject headings for appropriate studies. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for conducting our systematic review. Hepatic dysfunction was identified as elevation of liver function tests (LFTs) above the upper limit of normal. The clinical outcome was described as a combination of mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, and the need for mechanical ventilation (MV). The initial search yielded a total of 7187 studies. After elimination of duplicates, exclusion of studies based on irrelevant titles and abstracts, comprehensive analysis of full-text formats, and evaluation of quality, a total of 16 studies were eligible to be included in our systematic review. In the 16 selected studies, there were 23,962 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can negatively affect several organ systems by interacting with specific receptors widely expressed in the human body. A multifactorial etiology of hepatic dysfunction is observed in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with abnormal LFTs. Significantly higher mortality, ICU admissions, and requirement for MV are associated with LFT alterations. For this reason, patients infected with COVID-19 must have their hepatic function closely monitored.",,208
1046,35974573,"Diffusion on a lattice: Transition rates, interactions, and memory effects.","We analyze diffusion of particles on a two-dimensional square lattice. Each lattice site contains an arbitrary number of particles. Interactions affect particles only in the same site, and are macroscopically represented by the excess chemical potential. In a recent work, a general expression for transition rates between neighboring cells as functions of the excess chemical potential was derived. With transition rates, the mean-field tracer diffusivity, D^{MF}, is immediately obtained. The tracer diffusivity, D=D^{MF}f, contains the correlation factor f, representing memory effects. An analysis of the joint probability of having given numbers of particles at different sites when a force is applied to a tagged particle allows an approximate expression for f to be derived. The expression is applied to soft core interaction (different values for the maximum number of particles in a site are considered) and extended hard core.",,209
594,35977903,Advances in the management of diabetic kidney disease: beyond sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors.,"Progress in the treatment of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has been modest since the early trials on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis). Although sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have revolutionized the management of DKD by lowering proteinuria and protecting organs, other novel treatment approaches with good evidence and efficacy that can be used in conjunction with a RAASi or SGLT2i in managing DKD have emerged in the past few years. This review discusses the evidence for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and selective endothelin A receptor antagonist, emerging treatment options for DKD beyond SGLT2 inhibition.",,210
676,35975536,Method Performance Verification of Anti-GAD65 and Anti-Insulin antibody Assays.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of chemiluminescence immunoassays for anti-GAD65 and anti-insulin antibodies following user verification guidelines. The analytical performance of anti-GAD65 and anti-insulin antibodies using a MAGLUMI 2000 analyzer was verified following user verification guidelines by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Performance specifications including precision, linearity, carry-over, cutoffs for positive results, reference intervals, and comparability with pre-existing commercially available radioimmunoassays using patient specimens and certified reference material were verified (coefficients of variation for precision of anti-GAD65 and anti-insulin antibodies were 2.6% and 3.4%, respectively). Comparability assessed using clinical serum specimens showed overall agreement with radioimmunoassay of 87.2% (95% confidence interval 74.8% - 94.0%) for the anti-GAD65 antibody assay and 85.4% (95% confidence interval 71.6% - 93.1%) for the anti-insulin antibody assay. The results of this study verified the analytical performance of MAGLUMI anti-GAD65 and anti-insulin antibody assays for clinical use.",,211
781,35975056,Eight new phenolic acids from the leaves of Illicium dunnianum and their osteoprotective activities.,"Eight previously unreported phenolic acids (1-8), including three new phenylpropenoid glycosides (1-3), and five undescribed shikimic acid derivatives (4-8), together with six known analogues (9-14), were obtained from the dried leaves of Illicium dunnianum. The structures of these new compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses (1D, 2D-NMR, HRESIMS, IR, UV) and chemical methods. Compounds 1, 2, 4, and 5 were tested for their promotion effect on osteoblastogenesis of pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis of RANKL-induced RAW264.7 cells. As a result, 1 and 4 exerted a promotion effect on osteoblastogenesis, but without activity on osteoclastogenesis. Our studies not only enrich the structural diversity of phenolic acids in nature, but also discover new lead compounds from folk plants with activities on osteoblastogenesis or osteoclastogenesis.",,212
1781,35967876,The role of probiotics in vaginal health.,"Probiotics have been widely used in the treatment of intestinal diseases, but the effect of probiotics on female reproductive tract health is still controversial. Lactobacillus is the most abundant microorganism in the vagina, which is related to the vaginal mucosal barrier. Lactobacillus adheres to the vaginal epithelium and can competitively antagonize the colonization of pathogens. The factors produced by Lactobacillus, such as bacteriocin and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), can inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms and maintain the low pH environment of the vagina. Probiotics play an important role in maintaining the stability of vaginal microenvironment, improving immune defense and blocking the progression of cervical cancer. We review the research progress of probiotics represented by Lactobacillus in gynecological diseases such as human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM), so as to provide basis for further exerting the role of probiotics in women's health.",,213
2328,35967050,Entropy Generation and Thermal Analysis on MHD Second-Grade Fluid with Variable Thermophysical Properties over a Stratified Permeable Surface of Paraboloid Revolution.,"Stratification is used in a wide range of energy storage fields, including solar thermal energy systems. This paper investigates entropy optimization and the effects of heat production, magnetic field, and various fluid parameters on the flow of second-grade fluid through unstratified and stably stratified paraboloids of revolution. In the heat transfer equation, stratification, linear thermal radiation, and Joule dissipation have all been explored. The similarity transformation is used to convert the governing PDEs into nonlinear ODEs. The HAM (homotopy analysis method) is used to solve dimensionless nonlinear ODEs. The impact of significant elements on various profiles is exposed and explored. Graphical results are used to examine the influence of the velocity profile, temperature, concentration, and entropy formation rate using tables to indicate the characteristics of skin friction, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number for numerous parameters. It is noticed that the velocity is enhanced by raising the stratification parameter, while the opposite behavior is observed for temperature distribution. The concentration profile declined as the solute stratification parameter was enhanced. For both the unstratified and stratified regions, incremental values of the Brinkman number and magnetic parameter depict augmentation in entropy production, while entropy production drops for a large value of the temperature ratio parameter.",,214
1839,35967801,Effects of intramuscular fat on meat quality and its regulation mechanism in Tan sheep.,"Intramuscular fat (IMF) contributes importantly to various aspects of meat quality, and genetic regulation is an effective pathway to improve IMF deposition in sheep. In this study, we systematically explored the effect of IMF content on meat quality in Tan sheep and investigated the regulatory mechanism of flavor precursors metabolism and IMF deposition. The results revealed that IMF significantly affected meat color, total muscle fiber numbers, and muscle fiber types in Tan sheep. Widely-targeted metabolomic analysis showed that amino acids were the main differential flavor precursors between lambs with different IMF content. Importantly, the comparison of fatty acid profiles revealed that saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids are beneficial for IMF deposition. Furthermore, integrated analysis between metabolome and transcriptome indicated that MME is a key gene resulting in the reduction of amino acids in lambs with high IMF content; and the joint analysis between fatty acid profiles and transcript profiles showed that ADIPOQ, FABP4, PLIN1, PPARGC1A, SLC2A1 accelerated IMF deposition through positive regulation of saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids metabolism. These results revealed key changes in meat quality affected by IMF content and the corresponding genetic mechanism, which may provide a new insight for understanding the IMF differential deposition and for improving meat quality in Tan sheep.",,215
146,35983254,"Causes of Dental Trauma: Results of Findings Among Patients in a Secondary Oral Healthcare Center, Jos, Nigeria.","Dental trauma is a major type of traumatic dental injury (TDI) and a common presentation in many oral health facilities in Nigeria. Despite the high prevalence of TDIs, causes of dental trauma are yet to be fully investigated among Nigerians. The aim of this study is to determine the types of dental trauma, aetiology, and the causes of dental trauma as it relates with sociodemographic characteristics among dental patients. This was a cross-sectional study among patients attending a secondary oral healthcare facility in the North Central city of Jos between January 2019 and December 2020. The sociodemographic features of the patients include patients' complaints, clinical and social history, result of simple clinical oral examinations, and diagnoses of dental trauma. The classification of Ellis and Davey (1970) was used to classify dental trauma for this study. One hundred and seventy-six (6.7%) patients presented with dental trauma involving 281 teeth. The mean age was 37.54 ± 2.16 years. The most common cause of dental trauma in 48 (27.3%) patients was bone cracking, followed by falls in 33 (18.8%), road traffic accidents (RTAs) in 26 (14.8%), and bottle opening with teeth in 26 (14.8%). Bone cracking was the major cause of dental trauma in 18 (31.0%) educated and 2 (28.6%) non-educated patients. Among the patients, 118 (67.1%) presented with single traumatized tooth. Permanent anterior teeth 151 (53.74%) were more involved, and class 2 trauma involving enamel and dentinal structure was the most common presentation. Oral health awareness campaign on the damaging effect of bone cracking and use of tooth for opening metal caps of bottled drinks among adult population will reduce the prevalence of dental trauma among many adult Nigerians.",,216
2399,35966957,Comparative analysis of potential broad-spectrum neuronal Cre drivers.,"Cre/Lox technology is a powerful tool in the mouse genetics tool-box as it enables tissue-specific and inducible mutagenesis of specific gene loci. Correct interpretation of phenotypes depends upon knowledge of the Cre expression pattern in the chosen mouse driver line to ensure that appropriate cell types are targeted. For studies of the brain and neurological disease a pan-neuronal promoter that reliably drives efficient neuron-specific transgene expression would be valuable. Here we compare a widely used pan-neuronal mouse Cre driver line, Syn1-cre, with a little-known alternative, Snap25-IRES2-cre. Our results show that the Syn1-cre line broadly expresses in the brain but is indetectable in more than half of all neurons and weakly active in testes. In contrast the Snap25-IRES2-cre line expressed Cre in a high proportion of neurons (~85%) and was indetectable in all non-brain tissues that were analysed, including testes. Our findings suggest that for many purposes Snap25-IRES2-cre is superior to Syn1-cre as a potential pan-neuronal cre driver.",,217
2150,35967368,"Analysis of immunization time, amplitude, and adverse events of seven different vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 across four different countries.","Scarce information exists in relation to the comparison of seroconversion and adverse events following immunization (AEFI) with different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Our aim was to correlate the magnitude of the antibody response to vaccination with previous clinical conditions and AEFI. A multicentric comparative study where SARS-CoV-2 spike 1-2 IgG antibodies IgG titers were measured at baseline, 21-28 days after the first and second dose (when applicable) of the following vaccines: BNT162b2 mRNA, mRNA-1273, Gam-COVID-Vac, Coronavac, ChAdOx1-S, Ad5-nCoV and Ad26.COV2. Mixed model and Poisson generalized linear models were performed. We recruited 1867 individuals [52 (SD 16.8) years old, 52% men]. All vaccines enhanced anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgG antibodies over time (p<0.01). The highest increase after the first and second dose was observed in mRNA-1273 (p<0.001). There was an effect of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection; and an interaction of age with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, Gam-COVID-Vac and ChAdOx1-S (p<0.01). There was a negative correlation of Severe or Systemic AEFI (AEs) of naïve SARS-CoV-2 subjects with age and sex (p<0.001); a positive interaction between the delta of antibodies with Gam-COVID-Vac (p=0.002). Coronavac, Gam-COVID-Vac and ChAdOx1-S had less AEs compared to BNT162b (p<0.01). mRNA-1273 had the highest number of AEFIs. The delta of the antibodies showed an association with AEFIs in previously infected individuals (p<0.001). The magnitude of seroconversion is predicted by age, vaccine type and SARS-CoV-2 exposure. AEs are correlated with age, sex, and vaccine type. The delta of the antibody response only correlates with AEs in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

1733,35968009,"Early feeding strategies in lambs affect rumen development and growth performance, with advantages persisting for two weeks after the transition to fattening diets.","This study aimed to explore the effects of early feeding strategies on the growth and rumen development of lambs from pre-weaning to the transition to fattening diets. Ninety-six newborn, male lambs with similar body weights were randomly assigned to three treatments: fed starter at 42 days old + weaned at 56 days old (Ctrl, n = 36), fed starter at 7 days old + weaned at 56 days old (ES, n = 36), and fed starter at 7 days old + weaned at 28 days old (ES + EW, n = 24). The fattening diets of all lambs were gradually replaced from 60 to 70 days of age. Six randomly selected lambs from each treatment were slaughtered at 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 84 days of age. The results showed that the richness and diversity of rumen microbiota of lambs in the Ctrl group were distinct from those of lambs in the other groups at 42 days of age. Moreover, transcriptome analysis revealed 407, 219, and 1,211 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the rumen tissue of ES vs. Ctrl, ES vs. ES + EW, and ES + EW vs. Ctrl groups, respectively, at 42 days of age. Different early feeding strategies resulted in differences in ruminal anatomy, morphology, and fermentation in lambs from 42 to 84 days of age (P < 0.05). Lambs in the ES + EW group had a higher average starter diet intake than those in the other groups (P < 0.05) from 28 to 56 days of age, which affected their growth performance. After 42 days of age, the body and carcass weights of lambs in the ES and ES + EW groups were higher than those in the Ctrl group (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that feeding lambs with a starter diet at 7 days of age and weaning them at 28 days of age can promote rumen development and improve growth performance, and this advantage persists for up to 2 weeks after transition to the fattening diet.",,219
127,35983280,"Validating the Arrhythmogenic Potential of High-, Intermediate-, and Low-Risk Drugs in a Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiac Microphysiological System.","Evaluation of arrhythmogenic drugs is required by regulatory agencies before any new compound can obtain market approval. Despite rigorous review, cardiac disorders remain the second most common cause for safety-related market withdrawal. On the other hand, false-positive preclinical findings prohibit potentially beneficial candidates from moving forward in the development pipeline. Complex in vitro models using cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CM) have been identified as a useful tool that allows for rapid and cost-efficient screening of proarrhythmic drug risk. Currently available hiPSC-CM models employ simple two-dimensional (2D) culture formats with limited structural and functional relevance to the human heart muscle. Here, we present the use of our 3D cardiac microphysiological system (MPS), composed of a hiPSC-derived heart micromuscle, as a platform for arrhythmia risk assessment. We employed two different hiPSC lines and tested seven drugs with known ion channel effects and known clinical risk: dofetilide and bepridil (high risk); amiodarone and terfenadine (intermediate risk); and nifedipine, mexiletine, and lidocaine (low risk). The cardiac MPS successfully predicted drug cardiotoxicity risks based on changes in action potential duration, beat waveform (i.e., shape), and occurrence of proarrhythmic events of healthy patient hiPSC lines in the absence of risk cofactors. We showcase examples where the cardiac MPS outperformed existing hiPSC-CM 2D models.",,220
1368,35969094,Postural Organization of Gait Initiation for Biomechanical Analysis Using Force Platform Recordings.,"Gait initiation (GI), the transient phase between orthograde posture and steady-state locomotion, is a functional task and an experimental paradigm that is classically used in the literature to obtain insight into the basic postural mechanisms underlying body motion and balance control. Investigating GI has also contributed to a better understanding of the physiopathology of postural disorders in elderly and neurological participants (e.g., patients with Parkinson's disease). As such, it is recognized to have important clinical implications, especially in terms of fall prevention. This paper aims to provide scholars, clinicians, and higher education students information on the material and method developed to investigate GI postural organization via a biomechanical approach. The method is based on force platform recordings and the direct principle of mechanics to compute the kinematics of the center of gravity and center of pressure. The interaction between these two virtual points is a key element in this method since it determines the conditions of stability and whole-body progression. The protocol involves the participant initially standing immobile in an upright posture and starting to walk until the end of an at least 5 m track. It is recommended to vary the GI velocity (slow, spontaneous, fast) and the level of temporal pressure - gait may be initiated as soon as possible after the deliverance of a departure signal (high level of temporal pressure) or when the participant feels ready (low level of temporal pressure). Biomechanical parameters obtained with this method (e.g., duration and amplitude of anticipatory postural adjustments, step length/width, performance, and stability) are defined, and their computation method is detailed. In addition, typical values obtained in healthy young adults are provided. Finally, critical steps, limitations, and significance of the method with respect to the alternative method (motion capture system) are discussed.",,221
2156,35967362,Serotonin system is partially involved in immunomodulation of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) immune cells.,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is a well-known neurotransmitter affecting emotion, behavior, and cognition. Additionally, numerous immunomodulatory functions of serotonin have been discovered in mammals. However, the regulatory role of the serotonin system in fish immunity remains unclear. In this study, various serotonergic markers in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were identified and characterized. The involvement of the serotonin system during bacterial infection was investigated. Moreover, the expression characteristics and specific functions of serotonergic markers within Nile tilapia immune cells were also assessed. Overall, 22 evolutionarily conserved serotonergic marker genes in Nile tilapia were cloned and characterized. Transcriptional levels of these molecules were most abundant in the brain, and their transcripts were induced during Streptococcus agalactiae infection. Nevertheless, few serotonergic markers exist on Nile tilapia immune cells, and no distinct immunomodulation effect was observed during an immune response. The present study lays a theoretical foundation for further investigation of the immunological mechanisms in fish as well as the evolution of the serotonin system in animals.",,222
120,35983312,Structure and Interaction of Ceramide-Containing Liposomes with Gold Nanoparticles as Characterized by SERS and Cryo-EM.,"Due to the great potential of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as local vibrational probe of lipid-nanostructure interaction in lipid bilayers, it is important to characterize these interactions in detail. The interpretation of SERS data of lipids in living cells requires an understanding of how the molecules interact with gold nanostructures and how intermolecular interactions influence the proximity and contact between lipids and nanoparticles. Ceramide, a sphingolipid that acts as important structural component and regulator of biological function, therefore of interest to probing, lacks a phosphocholine head group that is common to many lipids used in liposome models. SERS spectra of liposomes of a mixture of ceramide, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylcholine, as well as of pure ceramide and of the phospholipid mixture are reported. Distinct groups of SERS spectra represent varied contributions of the choline, sphingosine, and phosphate head groups and the structures of the acyl chains. Spectral bands related to the state of order of the membrane and moreover to the amide function of the sphingosine head groups indicate that the gold nanoparticles interact with molecules involved in different intermolecular relations. While cryogenic electron microscopy shows the formation of bilayer liposomes in all preparations, pure ceramide was found to also form supramolecular, concentric stacked and densely packed lamellar, nonliposomal structures. That the formation of such supramolecular assemblies supports the intermolecular interactions of ceramide is indicated by the SERS data. The unique spectral features that are assigned to the ceramide-containing lipid model systems here enable an identification of these molecules in biological systems and allow us to obtain information on their structure and interaction by SERS.",,223
462,35978924,Utility of routine laboratory tests in the assessment of chronic venous disease progression in female patients.,"Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a frequently encountered disease that progresses with age. Although the principal method of evaluation and diagnosis is Doppler ultrasound, routine laboratory tests may be an easier and more accessible way to evaluate CVD progression. The present retrospective study evaluated the laboratory results of 256 patients diagnosed with CVD. According to the Clinical, Etiological, Anatomical and Pathophysiological classification, depending on the CVD stage, patients were stratified into three groups: Group 1 (C2-C3; mild disease), Group 2 (C4; moderate to severe disease) and Group 3 (C5-C6; severe disease). The considered parameters were age, red blood cell count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (PLT), percentage of neutrophils and lymphocytes, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, prothrombin time (in percentages and seconds), internal normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, creatine kinase (CK), CK myocardial band, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, total bilirubin and urea. No significant differences among the groups were noted in RBC, WBC, PLT and coagulation factors; on the other hand, inflammatory markers exhibited differences among the groups. Several differences were observed in hepatic, metabolic and muscle tissue markers. Intraluminal thrombus formation in the case of varicose veins (thrombophlebitis) may be due to conditions of turbulent flow, stasis and endothelial inflammation, rather than hypercoagulability. The results of the present study confirmed the implication of inflammatory factors in pathophysiological modifications, including thickening of venous walls and valvular modification, as well as the appearance of intraluminal thrombi and trophic lesions. NLR, ESR, CRP and fibrinogen were increased with CVD progression and may be considered useful markers in evaluating CVD progression. Simple blood tests may provide phlebologists with additional insight for the management of those patients.",,224
1528,35968358,LncRNA MEG3 inhibits retinoblastoma invasion and metastasis by inducing β-catenin degradation.,"In our previous study, we found that low expression of LncRNA-MEG3 was closely associated with the invasion and metastasis of retinoblastomas. The molecular mechanism by which MEG3 inactivation induces the invasion and metastasis of retinoblastoma cell lines remains unclear. We used the GEO database to analyze the expression of MEG3 in retinoblastoma tissues and MEG3-related pathways. The scratch, transwell migration, mouse tumor metastasis, and mouse fluorescence live imaging assays were performed to detect migration and invasion of retinoblastoma cell lines. The RNA pull down, electrophoretic mobility shift, RIP, co-immunoprecipitation, and ubiquitination assays were performed to analyze the molecular mechanisms. The GEO database showed that the expression of MEG3 was low in retinoblastoma tissues and was closely associated with the invasion of retinoblastoma cells and activity of the Wnt pathway. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed that MEG3 inhibited the migration and invasion of retinoblastoma cells. Cell experiments confirmed that MEG3 could promote the binding of β-catenin and GSK-3β and induce phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin indirectly. In conclusion, MEG3 can promote the degradation of β-catenin via GSK-3β, which in turn inactivates the Wnt pathway and ultimately inhibits the invasion and metastasis of retinoblastoma cells.",,225
1828,35967812,Adequate 25(OH)D moderates the relationship between dietary inflammatory potential and cardiovascular health risk during the second trimester of pregnancy.,"Pro-inflammatory diets play an important role in developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Vitamin D has been demonstrated to have an anti-inflammatory effect and promote cardiovascular health (CVH). However, it is unclear whether adequate vitamin D during pregnancy protects against poor CVH caused by pro-inflammatory diets. To investigate the association of pro-inflammatory diets with the cardiovascular risk (CVR) among pregnant women and whether such association was modified by vitamin D status. The study was based on a prospective birth cohort that included 3,713 pregnant women between 16 and 23 gestational weeks. In total, 25(OH)D concentrations and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured from the collected blood. The dietary inflammatory potential was evaluated using the empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) score based on a validated food frequency questionnaire. Gestational CVR was evaluated using the CVR score based on five clinical CVR metrics, including body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, glucose levels, and smoking status. The proportion of women with a CVR score >0 was 54.3%. We observed a positive association between the EDIP score and CVR score. Compared with the lowest quartile, the CVR score (β = -0.114, 95% CI, -0.217, -0.011) and hs-CRP levels (β = -0.280, 95% CI, -0.495, -0.065) were lower in the highest quartile (P for trend <0.05). Increased CVR connected with high EDIP score was observed only in women with 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nmol/L (RR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.35, 2.54). Mediation analysis revealed that the proportion of association between the EDIP score and CVR score mediated by 25(OH)D was 28.7%, and the proportion of the association between 25(OH)D and the CVR score mediated by hs-CRP was 21.9%. The higher dietary inflammatory potential was associated with an increased CVR during pregnancy by promoting inflammation. Adequate vitamin D could exert anti-inflammatory effects and modify such association.",,226
2386,35966987,Type of bilingualism conditions individual differences in the oscillatory dynamics of inhibitory control.,"The present study uses EEG time-frequency representations (TFRs) with a Flanker task to investigate if and how individual differences in bilingual language experience modulate neurocognitive outcomes (oscillatory dynamics) in two bilingual group types: late bilinguals (L2 learners) and early bilinguals (heritage speakers-HSs). TFRs were computed for both incongruent and congruent trials. The difference between the two (Flanker effect vis-à-vis cognitive interference) was then (1) compared between the HSs and the L2 learners, (2) modeled as a function of individual differences with bilingual experience within each group separately and (3) probed for its potential (a)symmetry between brain and behavioral data. We found no differences at the behavioral and neural levels for the between-groups comparisons. However, oscillatory dynamics (mainly theta increase and alpha suppression) of inhibition and cognitive control were found to be modulated by individual differences in bilingual language experience, albeit distinctly within each bilingual group. While the results indicate adaptations toward differential brain recruitment in line with bilingual language experience variation overall, this does not manifest uniformly. Rather, earlier versus later onset to bilingualism-the bilingual type-seems to constitute an independent qualifier to how individual differences play out.",,227
2315,35967064,Titanium Surfaces Modified with Graphene Oxide/Gelatin Composite Coatings for Enhanced Antibacterial Properties and Biological Activities.,"Titanium alloys have been widely used in orthopedic implants due to their excellent physicochemical properties and good biocompatibility. However, in practice, titanium implants may fail to integrate or develop an implant-centered infection. Because of its excellent mechanical properties, bone integrability, biocompatibility, antibacterial properties, and so on, graphene oxide is increasingly being used in the preparation of composite biomaterials. The percutaneous titanium implants are used as the research object in this project. To solve the integration of implant and tissue, a graphene oxide/gelatin (GO/gel) composite coating was used to optimize the implant surface. Bacterial and cell experiments were used to investigate the antimicrobial activity, biocompatibility, and regulation of macrophage polarization of GO/gel-modified titanium. According to our findings, GO/gel-modified titanium has a good bacteriostatic effect against Staphylococcus aureus. On the modified surface, L929 cells proliferated well and showed no cytotoxicity. Simultaneously, the GO/gel-modified titanium surface could inhibit macrophage adhesion and spread in the early stage of culture and showed a more obvious inflammatory decline in the late stage of culture. These findings implied that GO/gel-modified titanium is advantageous for resistant bacteria and tissue remolding.",,228
250,35982597,Development of a Frailty Detection Model Using Machine Learning with the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study Data.,"This paper aimed to use machine learning to identify a new group of factors predicting frailty in the elderly population by utilizing the existing frailty criteria as a basis, as well as to validate the obtained results. This study was conducted using data from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study (KFACS). The KFACS participants were classified as robust or frail based on Fried's frailty phenotype and excluded if they did not properly answer the questions, resulting in 1,066 robust and 165 frail participants. We then selected influential features through feature selection and trained the model using support vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms with the prepared dataset. Due to the imbalanced distribution in the dataset with a low sample size, holdout was applied with stratified 10-fold and cross-validation for estimating the model performance. The reliability of the constructed model was validated using an unseen test set. The model was then trained with hyperparameter optimization. During the feature selection process, 27 features were identified as meaningful factors for frailty. The model was trained based on the selected features, and the weighted average F1-score reached 95.30% with the random forest algorithm. The results of the study demonstrated the possibility of adopting machine learning to strengthen existing frailty criteria. As the method analyzes questionnaire responses in a short time, it can support higher volumes of data on participants' health conditions and alert them regarding potential risks in advance.",,229
461,35978925,Bioinformatics analysis of KLF2 as a potential prognostic factor in ccRCC and association with epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a primary pathological subtype of RCC and has poor clinical outcome. Krüppel-like factors (KLFs), which are zinc-finger proteins, may be involved in ccRCC development and progression. KLFs belong to the zinc-finger family of DNA-binding transcription factors and regulate transcription of downstream target genes. KLFs are involved in cancer development. The present study aimed to investigate the role of KLFs in ccRCC prognosis. The Cancer Genome Atlas database and multifactorial analysis showed that KLFs were widely expressed in pan-cancers and KLF2 was an independent protective factor for ccRCC prognosis. Patients with low KLF2 expression had a low survival probability and expression of KLF2 was downregulated in patients with ccRCC with high pathological grade (II + III vs. I). In addition, western blot and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR revealed that KLF2 was expressed at low levels in ccRCC cell lines and overexpression of KLF2 inhibited cell migration. In addition, KLF2 expression was negatively correlated with methylation. KLF2 expression was elevated following treatment of ccRCC cells with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. A prognostic risk index prediction model was constructed based on multiple Cox regression. The receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.780 (area under curve >0.5). Furthermore, Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that 'cell adhesion' and 'junction' were negatively correlated with KLF2 and that high-risk group exhibited significantly activated 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition'. Western blot analysis showed that overexpression of KLF2 increased expression of E-cadherin, while decreasing levels of N-cadherin and vimentin. The present study highlighted the role of KLFs in ccRCC prognosis prediction and provides a research base for the search of validated prognostic biological markers for ccRCC.",,230
1390,35969047,Single-Molecule Analysis of Sf9 Purified Superprocessive Kinesin-3 Family Motors.,"A complex cellular environment poses challenges for single-molecule motility analysis. However, advancement in imaging techniques have improved single-molecule studies and has gained immense popularity in detecting and understanding the dynamic behavior of fluorescent-tagged molecules. Here, we describe a detailed method for in vitro single-molecule studies of kinesin-3 family motors using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Kinesin-3 is a large family that plays critical roles in cellular and physiological functions ranging from intracellular cargo transport to cell division to development. We have shown previously that constitutively active dimeric kinesin-3 motors exhibit fast and superprocessive motility with high microtubule affinity at the single-molecule level using cell lysates prepared by expressing motor in mammalian cells. Our lab studies kinesin-3 motors and their regulatory mechanisms using cellular, biochemical and biophysical approaches, and such studies demand purified proteins at a large scale. Expression and purification of these motors using mammalian cells would be expensive and time-consuming, whereas expression in a prokaryotic expression system resulted in significantly aggregated and inactive protein. To overcome the limitations posed by bacterial purification systems and mammalian cell lysate, we have established a robust Sf9-baculovirus expression system to express and purify these motors. The kinesin-3 motors are C-terminally tagged with 3-tandem fluorescent proteins (3xmCitirine or 3xmCit) that provide enhanced signals and decreased photobleaching. In vitro single-molecule and multi-motor gliding analysis of Sf9 purified proteins demonstrate that kinesin-3 motors are fast and superprocessive akin to our previous studies using mammalian cell lysates. Other applications using these assays include detailed knowledge of oligomer conditions of motors, specific binding partners paralleling biochemical studies, and their kinetic state.",,231
27,35985098,Sex differences in patterns of associative memory-related activation in individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia is higher in females compared to males and is greater in individuals with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment than in healthy controls. We used a multivariate behavioral partial least square correlation analysis to examine how relationships between memory-related activation and associative memory performance vary as a function of sex and clinical status. This was assessed in 182 participants from the Consortium for the Early Identification of Alzheimer's Disease-Quebec cohort, which were stratified according to sex (Male, Female) and clinical status (healthy controls, subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment). We found 6 significant latent variables mainly expressing: (1) overall sex differences; (2) between-sex differences according to clinical status; and (3) within-sex differences according to clinical status in relationships between whole-brain memory-related activation and memory performance. These patterns of activation mostly involved the default mode and fronto-parietal networks. Our results have implication in understanding the macro-scale functional processes possibly contributing to the higher risk of cognitive decline in females compared to males in the context of aging and early Alzheimer's disease.",,232
1680,35968093,Constitutive expression of VviNAC17 transcription factor significantly induces the synthesis of flavonoids and other phenolics in transgenic grape berry cells.,"VviNAC17 is a grapevine transcription factor activated by ABA. Because ABA has been proposed as the main signal modulating the secondary metabolism in grape berry skins, here we postulated VviNAC17 as a positive regulator of secondary metabolism in grape cells. To validate the hypothesis, VviNAC17 was constitutively and stably overexpressed in grape berry suspension-cultured cells of Gamay Fréaux cv. by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Targeted transcriptional analyses by qPCR showed that several genes involved the phenylpropanoid (VviPAL1), stilbenoid (VviSTS1) and flavonoid pathways (VviDFR, VviLAR1, VviANR, VviLDOX, and VviUFGT1), as well as anthocyanin vacuolar transport and accumulation (VviGST4 and VvMATE1) were significantly upregulated in VviNAC17-overexpressing transgenic cells, which translated in the stimulation of a number of enzymatic activities in those pathways. This was the case of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) that were about 2-fold and 3.5-fold higher in VviNAC17-overexpressing cells than in control cells. VviNAC17-overexpressing cells accumulated significantly higher amounts of anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, total flavonoids and total phenolics. These findings confirmed that VviNAC17 is an important positive regulator of secondary metabolism in grapevine contributing to the accumulation of important berry quality-related secondary metabolites.",,233
2099,35967419,Spindle pole body component 25 and platelet-derived growth factor mediate crosstalk between tumor-associated macrophages and prostate cancer cells.,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are involved in the growth of prostate cancer (PrC), while the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactive crosstalk between TAM and PrC cells remain largely unknown. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is known to promote mesenchymal stromal cell chemotaxis to the tumor microenvironment. Recently, activation of spindle pole body component 25 (SPC25) has been shown to promote PrC cell proliferation and is associated with PrC stemness. Here, the relationship between SPC25 and PDGF in the crosstalk between TAM and PrC was investigated. Significant increases in both PDGF and SPC25 levels were detected in PrC specimens compared to paired adjacent normal prostate tissues. A significant correlation was detected between PDGF and SPC25 levels in PrC specimens and cell lines. SPC25 increased PDGF production and tumor cell growth in cultured PrC cells and in xenotransplantation. Mechanistically, SPC25 appeared to activate PDGF in PrC likely through Early Growth Response 1 (Egr1), while the secreted PDGF signaled to TAM through PDGFR on macrophages and polarized macrophages, which, in turn, induced the growth of PrC cells likely through their production and secretion of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1). Thus, our data suggest that SPC25 triggers the crosstalk between TAM and PrC cells via SPC25/PDGF/PDGFR/TGFβ1 receptor signaling to enhance PrC growth.",,234
1648,35968126,Inoculation With Azospirillum spp. Acts as the Liming Source for Improving Growth and Nitrogen Use Efficiency of Potato.,"Nitrogen (N) is one of the limiting factors for plant growth, and it is mainly supplied exogenously by fertilizer application. It is well documented that diazotrophic rhizobacteria improve plant growth by fixing atmospheric N in the soil. The present study investigates the nitrogen-fixing potential of two Azospirillum spp. strains using the 15N isotope-dilution method. The two diazotrophic strains (TN03 and TN09) native to the rhizosphere of potato belong to the genus Azospirillum (16S rRNA gene accession numbers LN833443 and LN833448, respectively). Both strains were able to grow on an N-free medium with N-fixation potential (138-143 nmol mg-1 protein h-1) and contained the nifH gene. Strain TN03 showed highest indole acetic acid (IAA) production (30.43 μg/mL), while TN09 showed highest phosphate solubilization activity (249.38 μg/mL) while both diazotrophs showed the production of organic acids. A 15N dilution experiment was conducted with different fertilizer inputs to evaluate the N-fixing potential of both diazotrophs in pots. The results showed that plant growth parameters and N contents increased significantly by the inoculations. Moreover, reduced 15N enrichment was found compared to uninoculated controls that received similar N fertilizer levels. This validates the occurrence of N-fixation through isotopic dilution. Strain TN09 showed higher N-fixing potential than TN03 and the uninoculated controls. Inoculation with either strain also showed a remarkable increase in plant growth under field conditions. Thus, there were remarkable increases in N use efficiency, N uptake and N utilization levels. Confocal laser scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that TN03 is an ectophyte, i.e., present outside root cells or within the grooves of root hairs, while TN09 is an endophyte, i.e., present within root cells, forming a strong association withroot it. This study confirms that diazotrophic Azospirillum spp. added to potato systems can improve plant growth and N use efficiency, opening avenues for improvement of potato crop growth with reduced input of N fertilizer.",,235
242,35982691,Combining Metabolic Analysis With Biological Endpoints Provides a View Into the Drought Resistance Mechanism of Carex breviculmis.,"Metabolomics is an effective tool to test the response of plants to environmental stress; however, the relationships between metabolites and biological endpoints remained obscure in response to drought stress. Carex breviculmis is widely used in forage production, turf management, and landscape application and it is particularly resistant to drought stress. We investigated the metabolomic responses of C. breviculmis to drought stress by imposing a 22-day natural soil water loss. The results showed that water-deficit restrained plant growth, reducing plant height, leaf fresh weight, and total weight, however, increasing soluble protein content and malondialdehyde content. In total, 129 differential metabolites in the leaves were detected between drought and control using the Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (UPLC-MS) method. Drought enhanced most of the primary and secondary metabolites in the differential metabolites. Almost all the sugars, amino acids, organic acids, phytohormones, nucleotides, phenylpropanoids and polyketides in the differential metabolites were negatively correlated with plant height and leaf fresh weight, while they were positively correlated with soluble protein content and malondialdehyde content. Metabolic pathway analysis showed that drought stress significantly affected aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, TCA cycling, starch and sucrose metabolism. Our study is the first statement on metabolomic responses to drought stress in the drought-enduring plant C. breviculmis. According to the result, the coordination between diverse metabolic pathways in C. breviculmis enables the plant to adapt to a drought environment. This study will provide a systematic framework for explaining the metabolic plasticity and drought tolerance mechanisms of C. breviculmis under drought stress.",,236
2308,35967072,"Ultrasonic-Assisted Extraction of Toxic Acidic Components from Acidic Oil Using 1,8-Diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene-Based Ionic Liquids.","Ionic liquids (ILs) show remarkable performance in enhancing the naphthenic acid extraction efficiency and decreasing the extraction time. However, the ultrasonic-assisted IL-based extraction of naphthenic acid is merely addressed previously. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of essential ultrasonic parameters, including amplitude and time, on naphthenic acid extraction using different ILs, and the system was optimized for maximum extraction. The IL 1,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene (DBU) with thiocyanate anions revealed the highest efficiency in extracting naphthenic acid from a model oil (dodecane) at optimized conditions, and the experimental liquid-liquid equilibrium data were obtained at atmospheric pressure for the mixture of dodecane, [DBU], thiocyanate, and naphthenic acid. In addition, the influence of the chain length of the cation (hexyl, octyl, or decyl) on the extraction efficiency was also evaluated by determining the distribution coefficients, and the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) study was carried out at infinite dilution. It was found that [DBU-Dec] [SCN] gives the best extraction efficiency and has a distribution coefficient of 9.2707 and a performance index of 49.48. Based on these values, ILs can be ordered as follows: [DBU-Dec] [SCN] > [DBU-Oct][SCN] > [DBU-Hex][SCN] in the decreasing order of performance index 49.48, 41.58, and 28.13. Moreover, non-random two liquid and Margules thermodynamic models were employed to investigate the interaction parameters between the components. Both models showed excellent agreement with the experimental results and could successfully be used for ultrasonic-assisted IL extraction of naphthenic acid.",,237
1322,35970019,Borrelia burgdorferi specific serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibodies in Lyme neuroborreliosis.,"We used definite Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) adult patient acute and convalescent phase serum (n = 63 and 61, respectively) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; acute n = 63, 3 weeks timepoint n = 41) samples to characterize Borrelia burgdorferi specific antibody responses in patient subgroups categorized by demographics, infection manifestation and phase, infecting B. burgdorferi genospecies, received antibiotic treatments, and treatment outcome. B. burgdorferi antibodies were analyzed using 4 different assays incorporating a large array of antigens. We observed that B. burgdorferi specific serum antibodies show a universal, antigen independent declining trend after antibiotic treatment of LNB at 1 year. Antibodies declined similarly among women and men over time, and the decline was independent of patient age. The antibody responses were independent of the predominant LNB manifestation, treatment received by the patient, infecting B. burgdorferi genospecies, or the subjective improvement experienced by the patients. Finally, the antibody specificities in CSF reflected the specificities observed in serum samples.",,238
91,35983392,Suspected Gastroparesis With Concurrent Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Induced by Low-Dose Liraglutide.,"A 74-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with nausea and abdomen distension. Four days prior, liraglutide 0.6 mg had been commenced. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed gastric dilatation without mechanical obstruction which clinically suggested gastroparesis (GP). Her symptoms resolved after liraglutide discontinuation. A gastroscopy revealed reflux esophagitis. Taken together, GP may have developed along with reflux esophagitis due to liraglutide administration. Liraglutide's action inhibits gastric motility. Physicians should be cognizant of the side effects of GLP-1 agonists even in low dose in patients who have gastric emptying symptoms suggesting GP.",,239
747,35975090,Intermolecular hydrogen bonds between catechin and theanine in tea: slow release of the antioxidant capacity by a synergetic effect.,"The health benefits of drinking tea stem from it being rich in polyphenols and other physiologically-active substances. Thus, exploring the synergistic effect between polyphenols and a variety of physiologically-active substances can contribute to our understanding of how tea benefits health. In this work, we have studied the interactions between catechin and theanine, exploring the synergetic antioxidant mechanism of the two molecules. Electrochemical characterization results showed that the oxidation peak current of catechin decreased gradually with the concentration of theanine, which is due to theanine spontaneously binding to catechin through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and forming molecular clusters via two hydrogen bonds. The binding constant is 4.75 at room temperature. The molecular clusters reduce the diffusion coefficient of catechin in solution, leading to the slow release of its antioxidant capacity (ability to effectively inhibit free radical oxidation reactions). Density functional theory calculations were also performed and verified the binding behavior. In identifying the synergistic effect between catechin and theanine on the antioxidant capacity of tea, this study adds to our understanding of the efficacy of tea polyphenols.",,240
1718,35968026,Veterinary Guidelines for Electrochemotherapy of Superficial Tumors.,"Electrochemotherapy (ECT) consists in the application of electric pulses to increase chemotherapeutic drug intake (bleomycin, cisplatin, or calcium) into the tumor cells. It has become a very valuable treatment option in veterinary oncology. It is an effective and safe treatment modality, which is not only beneficial as a palliative treatment, but also for a curative approach. Performing the treatment adequately will ensure the best results possible, in the minimum number of sessions, and reduce complications. Usually, only one session is enough to achieve excellent results, but the treatment can be repeated. Several sessions can be necessary in the case of incompletely treated or very extended lesions, as well as in the occurrence of new lesions. ECT is effective for superficial or oral tumors of any histology that are accessible to the electrodes. Intravenous bleomycin is the preferred drug and route of administration, leaving other ways of administration and drugs for selected cases. The guidelines presented here are destined to veterinarians who want to develop their understanding of the basis of ECT and wish to perform it adequately and effectively. In this paper, we also discuss common problems and how to solve them, and we include practical tips to improve the treatment results based on common questions and mistakes of beginner users.",,241
328,35979907,A Cryoprotectant-Gel Composite Designed to Preserve Articular Cartilage during Frozen Osteoarticular Autograft Reconstruction for Malignant Bone Tumors: An Animal-Based Study.,"We designed a highly adhesive cryoprotectant-gel composite (CGC), based on regular liquid-form cryoprotectant base (CB), aiming to protect cartilage tissue during frozen osteoarticular autograft reconstruction for high-grade sarcoma around the joint. This study aimed to evaluate its effectiveness in rat and porcine distal femur models. Fresh articular cartilage samples harvested from distal rat and porcine femurs were divided into 4 test groups: untreated control group, liquid nitrogen (LN) freezing group, LN freezing group pretreated with CB (CB group), and LN freezing group pretreated with CGC (CGC group). Microscopic and macroscopic evaluation of cartilage condition, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) assay, and apoptotic protein analysis of chondrocytes were performed to confirm our results. In the rat model, CGC could prevent articular cartilage from roughness and preserve more proteoglycans when compared with the LN freezing and CB groups. Western blot analysis showed CGC could prevent cartilage from LN-induced apoptosis supported by caspase-3/8 apoptotic signaling cascade. Macroscopically, we observed CGC could reduce both articular clefting and loss of articular luminance after freezing in the porcine model. In both models, CGC could reduce articular chondrocytes from degeneration. Fewer TUNEL-positive apoptotic and more viable chondrocytes in cartilage tissue were observed in the CGC group in our animal models. Our study proved that CGC could effectively prevent cartilage surface and chondrocytes from cryoinjury after LN freezing. Freezing articular cartilage surrounded with high concentration of CGC can be a better alternative to preserve articular cartilage during limb salvage surgery for malignant bone tumor.",,242
2444,35966852,Altered Lung Microbiome and Metabolome Profile in Children With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated With Congenital Heart Disease.,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by progressive pulmonary vascular functional and structural changes, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and eventually right heart failure and death. Congenital Left-to-Right shunts (LTRS) is one type of congenital heart disease (CHD) and PAH associated with the congenital Left-to-Right shunt (PAH-LTRS) is a severe disease in children. However, changes in the lung microbiome and their potential impact on PAH-LTRS have not been not fully studied. We hypothesized that lung microbiota and their derived metabolites have been disturbed in children with PAH-LTRS, which might contribute to the progression and outcomes of PAH-LTRS. In this study, 68 age- and sex-matched children of three different groups (patients with PAH-LTRS cohort, patients with LTRS but have no pathologic features of PAH cohort, and healthy reference cohort) were enrolled in the current study. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from these participants were conducted for multi-omics analysis, including 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomic profiling. Data progressing and integration analysis were performed to identify pulmonary microbial and metabolic characteristics of PAH-LTRS in children. We found that microbial community density was not significantly altered in PAH-LTRS based on α-diversity analysis. Microbial composition analysis indicated phylum of Bacteroidetes was that less abundant while Lactobacillus, Alicycliphilus, and Parapusillimonas were significantly altered and might contribute to PAH in children with LTRS. Moreover, metabolome profiling data showed that metabolites involved in Purine metabolism, Glycerophospholipid metabolism, Galactose metabolism, and Pyrimidine metabolism were also significantly disturbed in the PAH-LTRS cohort. Correlation analysis between microbes and metabolites indicated that alterations in the microbial composition from the lung microbiota could eventually result in the disturbance in certain metabolites, and might finally contribute to the pathology of PAH-LTRS. Lung microbial density was not significantly altered in patients with PAH-LTRS. Composition analysis results showed that the relative microbiome abundance was different between groups. Metabolome profiling and correlation analysis with microbiota showed that metabolome also altered in children with PAH-LTRS. This study indicated that pulmonary microbes and metabolites disturbed in PAH-LTRS could be potentially effective biomarkers and provides valuable perspectives on clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of pediatric PAH-LTRS.",,243
345,35979350,An integrated model of acinar to ductal metaplasia-related N7-methyladenosine regulators predicts prognosis and immunotherapy in pancreatic carcinoma based on digital spatial profiling.,"Acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) is a recently recognized, yet less well-studied, precursor lesion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) developed in the setting of chronic pancreatitis. Through digital spatial mRNA profiling, we compared ADM and adjacent PDAC tissues from patient samples to unveil the bridging genes during the malignant transformation of pancreatitis. By comparing the bridging genes with the 7-methylguanosine (m7G)-seq dataset, we screened 19 m7G methylation genes for a subsequent large sample analysis. We constructed the m7G score model based on the RNA-seq data for pancreatic cancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Tumors with a high m7G score were characterized by increased immune cell infiltration, increased genomic instability, higher response rate to combined immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and overall poor survival. These findings indicate that the m7G score is associated with tumor invasiveness, immune cell infiltration, ICI treatment response, and overall patients' survival. We also identified FN1 and ITGB1 as core genes in the m7Gscore model, which affect immune cell infiltration and genomic instability not only in pancreatic cancer but also in pan-cancer. FN1 and ITGB1 can inhibit immune T cell activition by upregulation of macrophages and neutrophils, thereby leading to immune escape of pancreatic cancer cells and reducing the response rate of ICI treatment.",,244
1152,35973767,Knockdown of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase and chitin synthase A increases the insecticidal efficiency of Lufenuron to Spodoptera exigua.,"Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) has been responsible for causing considerable and widespread agricultural losses worldwide. Owing to strong selective pressure, S. exigua showed increased resistance to Lufenuron (LUF). Consequently, RNA interference (RNAi)-based insecticides had more benefits than chemical insecticides. Therefore, to enhance the insecticidal activity of LUF to S. exigua, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate the impact of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) on S. exigua larval susceptibility to LUF. First, the transcriptome of S. exigua was sequenced following the treatment with LUF. By comparing the upregulated and downregulated GO enrichment, chitin binding and chitin metabolic processes were the significantly enriched pathways. According to transcriptome sequencing, 8 genes associated with chitin biosynthesis, 8 chitin degradation genes, and 17 cuticle protein genes were obtained. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP) and Chitin synthase A (CHSA) showed significantly downregulated expression after treatment with different sublethal doses of LUF. Downregulation of UAP increased mortality from 31.97% to 47.91% when the larvae were exposed to LUF. A significant increase in the mortality of S. exigua from 30.63% to 50.19% was observed following LUF administration after dsCHSA. In addition, the expression analysis of genes associated with chitin biosynthesis was significantly changed after LUF treatment, dsRNAs-RNAi, and their combination (LUF-dsRNAs). Significant differences were observed in the chitin content between the control group at 72 h after treatments. Results of the present study can help further elucidate the understanding of the combined effects of RNAi and LUF on S. exigua. Additionally, this research provides a suitable foundation for future studies with the aim to develop an efficient method of delivery for large-scale pest control in the fields.",,245
484,35978871,Micelles as potential drug delivery systems for colorectal cancer treatment.,"Despite the significant progress in cancer therapy, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the most fatal malignancies worldwide. Chemotherapy is currently the mainstay therapeutic modality adopted for CRC treatment. However, the long-term effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs has been hampered by their low bioavailability, non-selective tumor targeting mechanisms, non-specific biodistribution associated with low drug concentrations at the tumor site and undesirable side effects. Over the last decade, there has been increasing interest in using nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems to circumvent these limitations. Various nanoparticles have been developed for delivering chemotherapeutic drugs among which polymeric micelles are attractive candidates. Polymeric micelles are biocompatible nanocarriers that can bypass the biological barriers and preferentially accumulate in tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. They can be easily engineered with stimuli-responsive and tumor targeting moieties to further ensure their selective uptake by cancer cells and controlled drug release at the desirable tumor site. They have been shown to effectively improve the pharmacokinetic properties of chemotherapeutic drugs and enhance their safety profile and anticancer efficacy in different types of cancer. Given that combination therapy is the new strategy implemented in cancer therapy, polymeric micelles are suitable for multidrug delivery and allow drugs to act concurrently at the action site to achieve synergistic therapeutic outcomes. They also allow the delivery of anticancer genetic material along with chemotherapy drugs offering a novel approach for CRC therapy. Here, we highlight the properties of polymeric micelles that make them promising drug delivery systems for CRC treatment. We also review their application in CRC chemotherapy and gene therapy as well as in combination cancer chemotherapy.",,246
2260,35967171,AQP9 (Aquaporin 9) Determines Arsenic Uptake and Tolerance in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells In Vitro.,"Arsenic-based therapeutic strategies, even though promising for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), are limited by arsenic-related toxic effect and resistance with unknown mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to better understand the different sensitivities of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to arsenic and its mechanism. Arsenic-sensitive liver cancer cell line (HepG2) and arsenic-resistant HepG2 (AsHepG2) cells are employed to study the role of aquaporin 9 (AQP9) in arsenic uptake and tolerance. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of arsenic in AsHepG2 cells (15.59 ± 1.36 µM) is significantly higher than that in HepG2 cells (7.33 ± 0.93 µM; p= 0.0288). We demonstrated that, with the treatment of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2), arsenic was accumulated at a significantly lower level in AsHepG2 cells in comparison with HepG2 cells (p= 0.00549). Further, arsenic level in AsHepG2 cells reaches a plateau after six hours of treatment, whereas arsenic continues to increase in HepG2 cells during the entire experimental period. Mechanistic study showed that the expression of AQP9 is decreased in a dose-dependent manner in AsHepG2 cells, but no significant difference in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, NaAsO2 dramatically increases AQP9 and p38 phosphorylation, which may partially regulate arsenic sensitivity in both cell lines. In conclusion, the expression and phosphorylation of AQP9 regulated by p38 kinase are involved in the arsenic uptake, thus regulating cellular arsenic sensitivity.",,247
2401,35966954,"The relationship between self-care activities, social support, and glycemic control in primary healthcare patients with type 2 diabetes.","Egyptian studies in assessing the relationship between diabetes self-care, social support, and glycemic control in primary healthcare (PHC) are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to assess this relationship, and to evaluate the associated factors of diabetes self-care, social support, and glycemic control in Egyptian PHC patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). A cross-sectional study was conducted on 320 T2DM patients at four PHC settings in Port Said city, affiliated with the General Authority of Healthcare. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data, including demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status scale, disease profile, the Arabic versions of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities, and the received social support scales. Data were collected from January 2020 to June 2020. Diabetes self-care activities, and self-monitoring of blood glucose had a very weak negative correlations with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (rho = - 0.125, p = 0.025, rho = - 0.112, p = 0.044, respectively). Receiving social support on following a meal correlated positively and very weakly with HbA1c levels (rho = 0.145, p = 0.010). Hardly positive correlation was found between receiving emotional support on feelings about diabetes, and following a specific diet (rho = 0.169, p = 0.002). Diabetes self-care activities were positively associated with higher education levels, and elevated BMI. Received social support was negatively associated with having coronary artery disease, and marital status e.g. divorced and widow. Increased age, and female gender were the predictors of good glycemic control. Diabetes self-care activities were linked with reduced HBA1c levels. Further studies are needed to evaluate the buffering effect of social support on glycemic outcomes in PHC patients with T2DM.",,248
178,35982911,Tumor-associated macrophage-derived chemokine CCL5 facilitates the progression and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,"Background: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) dominate the malignancy of cancers by perturbing the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the clinical implications of heterogeneous subpopulations of TAMs in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remain to be elucidated. Methods: We comprehensively evaluated the prognostic implications, biological behaviors, and immunogenomics features of the C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 5 (CCL5) expression and CCL5+ TME in vitro and in 932 real-world ccRCC patients from testing and public validation cohorts. Flow cytometry was used to examine the functional patterns of CCL5+ TAMs with TME cell-infiltrating characterizations. Results: Our results identified distinct prognostic clusters with gradual changes in clinicopathological indicators based on CCL5 expression. Knockdown of CCL5 significantly restrained cell viability, migration capabilities of ccRCC cells, and the inhibits the proliferation and chemotaxis of THP1-derived TAMs. Mechanically, down-regulation of CCL5 arrested epithelial-mesenchymal transition by modulating the PI3K/AKT pathway in ccRCC cells. In ccRCC samples with CCL5 upregulation, the proportion of CCL5+ TAMs and PD-L1+ CD68+ TAMs were prominently increased, showing a typical suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Besides, intra-tumoral CCL5+ TAMs showed distinct pro-tumorigenic TME features characterized by exhausted CD8+ T cells and increased expression of immune checkpoints. Furthermore, elevated CCL5+ TAMs infiltration was prominently associated with a dismal prognosis for patients with ccRCC. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study first revealed the predictive value of the chemokine CCL5 on the progression and TME of ccRCC. The intra-tumoral CCL5+ TAMs could be applied to comprehensively evaluate the prognostic patterns as well as unique TME characteristics among individuals, allowing for the identification of immunophenotypes and promotion of treatment efficiency for ccRCC.",,249
1565,35968321,RNA methylation regulators contribute to poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with the suppression of bile acid metabolism: a multi-omics analysis.,"RNA methylation has been known to promote the initiation and progression of many types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To fully understand the importance of this post-transcriptional modification in HCC, a thorough investigation that combines different patterns of RNA methylation is urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the regulators of the three most common types of RNA methylation: m6A, N1-methyladenosine (m1A) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C). Based on the genomic and proteomic data, we constructed a classifier consisting of seven RNA methylation regulators. This classifier performed well and robustly predicted the prognosis of HCC patients. By analysis using this classifier, we found that the primary bile acid biosynthesis pathway was mostly downregulated in high-risk HCC patients. Furthermore, we found that the gene expression patterns regulated by several bile acids were similar to those regulated by some well-defined anti-tumor compounds, indicating that bile acid metabolism plays a crucial role in the progression of HCC, and the related metabolites can be used as the potential agents for HCC treatments. Moreover, our study revealed a crosstalk between RNA methylation and bile acid regulators, demonstrating a novel mechanism of the downregulation of bile acid metabolism in HCC and providing new insights into how RNA methylation regulators affect the oncogenesis of HCC.",,250
796,35975041,Attenuation of the Bauschinger effect and enhancement of tension-compression asymmetry in single crystal aluminum by temperature.,"Temperature has a great influence on the mechanical properties of nano-materials. The molecular dynamics method was used to study the effect of temperature on the tension-compression asymmetry and Bauschinger effect of nano single crystal aluminum (NSCA). The strain-hardening behavior of NSCA in the tensile plastic stage is significantly enhanced when the temperature is higher than 400 K. The plastic deformation mechanism of tensile loading shifts from slip blocking of dislocations in grains to dislocation nucleation. The degradation of the mechanical properties of NSCA under compressive loading increases gradually with the increase of temperature. Dislocation emission is limited under compressive loading. Nonetheless, plastic deformation may still be regulated by dislocation slip during severe plastic deformation stages and at elevated temperatures. Temperature enhancement can effectively promote the movement of pre-dislocations and eliminate residual stresses. A new microscopic insight into the temperature attenuated Bauschinger effect is provided. This study provides important theoretical guidance for a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the high-temperature mechanical properties and microstructure evolution mechanism of NSCA.",,251
131,35983275,Hemopexin as a Potential Binding Partner of Arginine-Rich Cell-Penetrating Peptides in Serum.,"Serum proteins affect the in vivo fate and cellular uptake of arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and drugs delivered by CPPs. Although the binding of CPPs to serum proteins may possibly reduce their cellular uptake to some extent, it may also prolong their circulation half-life in vivo. We aimed to identify novel binding proteins of arginine-rich CPPs in serum to better understand their in vivo fate and develop more sophisticated drug delivery systems using CPPs. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis suggests that albumin, the most abundant protein in serum, binds to d-forms of oligoarginine; however, the dissociation constants are several tens of a micromolar. Candidate proteins with the potential of binding to arginine-rich CPPs in serum were then explored using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Studies using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy determined hemopexin as a potential binding partner of d-forms of arginine-rich CPPs, including d-octaarginine (r 8) and the d-form of the peptide, corresponding to HIV-1 Rev (34-50), with dissociation constants of submicromolar to micromolar range. Using flow cytometry and a split-luciferase-based system, the promotion effect of hemopexin on the total cellular uptake and cytosolic localization of cargos conjugated with these CPPs was confirmed. Therefore, this study elucidated hemopexin as a potential binding partner of d-arginine-rich CPPs that may affect their in vivo fate and cellular uptake.",,252
2435,35966861,Evolution of red blood cell membrane complement regulatory proteins and rheology in septic patients: An exploratory study.,"During sepsis, red blood cell (RBC) deformability is altered. Persistence of these alterations is associated with poor outcome. Activation of the complement system is enhanced during sepsis and RBCs are protected by membrane surface proteins like CD35, CD55 and CD59. In malaria characterized by severe anemia, a study reported links between the modifications of the expression of these RBCs membrane proteins and erythrophagocytosis. We studied the evolution of RBCs deformability and the expression of RBC membrane surface IgG and regulatory proteins in septic patients. By flow cytometry technics, we measured at ICU admission and at day 3-5, the RBC membrane expression of IgG and complement proteins (CD35, 55, 59) in septic patients compared to RBCs from healthy volunteers. Results were expressed in percentage of RBCs positive for the protein. RBC shape was assessed using Pearson's second coefficient of dissymmetry (PCD) on the histogram obtained with a flow cytometer technique. A null value represents a perfect spherical shape. RBC deformability was determined using ektacytometry by the elongation index in relation to the shear stress (0.3-50 Pa) applied to the RBC membrane. A higher elongation index indicates greater RBC deformability. RBCs from 11 septic patients were compared to RBCs from 21 volunteers. At ICU admission, RBCs from septic patients were significantly more spherical and RBC deformability was significantly lower in septic patients for all shear stress ≥1.93 Pa. These alterations of shape and deformability persists at day 3-5. We observed a significant decrease at ICU admission only in CD35 expression on RBCs from septic patients. This low expression remained at day 3-5. We observed in RBCs from septic patients a rapid decrease expression of CD35 membrane protein protecting against complement activation. These modifications associated with altered RBC deformability and shape could facilitate erythrophagocytosis, contributing to anemia observed in sepsis. Other studies with a large number of patients and assessment of erythrophagocytosis were needed to confirm these preliminary data.",,253
2290,35967141,Advanced Case of Cardiac Amyloidosis Presents With Chronic Diarrhea.,"Late diagnosis of light chain (AL) amyloidosis can lead to catastrophic consequences on the quality of life of affected patients and overall disease prognosis. Therefore, clinicians should have high suspicion and recognize clinical red flags for amyloidosis. This case report presents a 65-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with chronic diarrhea and significant weight loss with significant hypotension. The patient was treated four weeks prior to admission with a five-day course of nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infection. The initial workup was positive for Clostridium difficile(C.diff), which was treated medically; however, the patient started to complain of mild shortness of breath accompanied by mildly elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Later on, the patient had a cardiac arrest and was appropriately resuscitated. Subsequent ECHO showed significant left ventricular hypertrophy, raising high suspicion of myocardial infiltration. Because of persistent diarrhea despite aggressive medical management and an inconclusive workup, the patient underwent colonoscopy with duodenum biopsy, which revealed amyloid deposition confirmed by Congo red staining. The patient afterward suffered from a stroke and recurrent syncopal episodes requiring critical care admission. Due to a compromised quality of life, the patient eventually opted for hospice care. In view of insufficient prospective data spotlighting AL amyloidosis, all patients should be treated within clinical trials whenever possible and ideally evaluated for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) eligibility.",,254
1754,35967984,First Therapeutic Approval for Eosinophilic Esophagitis.,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a chronic, immune-mediated or antigen-mediated esophageal disease. Treatment for patients with EE can be challenging with no previously approved medications. Current management strategies follow the four D's paradigm of drugs, dietary elimination, dilation, and disease anxiety and hypervigilance therapy. On 20 May 2022, dupilumab was approved by FDA for EE. A dose of 300 mg dupilumab weekly significantly improved signs and symptoms of EE compared to placebo in a phase 3 trial. The approval of dupilumab will fulfill an unmet need for the increasing number of patients with EE.",,255
670,35975542,Prognostic Value of Serial Measurement of Serum Des-Arg(6)-Bradykinin Levels in Severe COVID-19 Patients.,"Excessive inflammatory immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to severe disease in COVID-19 patients. Recently, some researchers hypothesized that dysregulation of the bradykinin (BK) system may also play a role in the pathogenesis of severe disease. Des-Arg(9)-bradykinin (DABK), an active metabolite of BK, is responsible for vasodilatation and increased permeability in the lungs and regulated by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). Viral inhibition of ACE-2 by SARS-CoV-2 increases DABK levels. Serum levels of this metabolite may be linked to disease severity in COVID-19 patients. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the prognostic value of serial measurement of serum DABK levels in severe COVID-19 patients. This prospective cohort study was conducted in hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients. Serum DABK levels of patients were serially measured on day 0, day 3 and day 5. Patients were categorized as cases with poor or good prognosis and critical or non-critical cases. Serum DABK levels of these patient groups were compared with paired sample t-test. Serum DABK levels on different days in the same patients were compared with repeated measures ANOVA tests. There was no statistically significant difference in serum DABK levels measured at day 0, day 3, and day 5 between good and poor prognosis groups. DABK levels in critical and non-critical COVID-19 patients also did not show any significant difference. According to our results serially measured serum DABK levels did not correlate with outcome of severe COVID-19 and do not have prognostic value in severe COVID-19 patients.",,256
1478,35968419,Spread of infection and treatment interruption among Japanese workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in treatment interruption for chronic diseases. The scale of COVID-19 in Japan has varied greatly in terms of the scale of infection and the speed of spread depending on the region. This study aimed to examine the relationship between local infection level and treatment interruption among Japanese workers. Cross-sectional internet survey was conducted from December 22 to 26, 2020. Of 33,302 participants, 9,510 (5,392 males and 4,118 females) who responded that they required regular treatment were included in the analysis. The infection level in each participant's prefecture of residence was assessed based on the incidence rate (per 1,000 population) and the number of people infected. Age-sex and multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of regional infection levels associated with treatment interruption were estimated by multilevel logistic models, nested by prefecture of residence. The multivariate model was adjusted for sex, age, marital status, equivalent household income, educational level, occupation, self-rated health status and anxiety. The ORs of treatment interruption for the lowest and highest levels of infection in the region were 1.32 [95 % confidence interval (CI) were 1.09-1.59] for the overall morbidity rate (per 1,000) and 1.34 (95 % CI 1.10-1.63) for the overall number of people infected. Higher local infection levels were linked to a greater number of workers experiencing treatment interruption. Higher local infection levels were linked to more workers experiencing treatment interruption. Our results suggest that apart from individual characteristics such as socioeconomic and health status, treatment interruption during the pandemic is also subject to contextual effects related to regional infection levels. Preventing community spread of COVID-19 may thus protect individuals from indirect effects of the pandemic, such as treatment interruption.",,257
2065,35967453,Profiling the peripheral blood T cell receptor repertoires of gastric cancer patients.,"Cancer driven by somatic mutations may express neoantigens that can trigger T-cell immune responses. Since T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires play critical roles in anti-tumor immune responses for oncology, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to profile the hypervariable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR-beta chain in peripheral blood samples from 68 gastric cancer patients and 49 healthy controls. We found that most hyper-expanded CDR3 are individual-specific, and the gene usage of TRBV3-1 is more frequent in the tumor group regardless of tumor stage than in the healthy control group. We identified 374 hyper-expanded tumor-specific CDR3, which may play a vital role in anti-tumor immune responses. The patients with stage IV gastric cancer have higher EBV-specific CDR3 abundance than the control. In conclusion, analysis of the peripheral blood TCR repertoires may provide the biomarker for gastric cancer prognosis and guide future immunotherapy.",,258
1462,35968436,Understanding the vaccine stance of Italian tweets and addressing language changes through the COVID-19 pandemic: Development and validation of a machine learning model.,"Social media is increasingly being used to express opinions and attitudes toward vaccines. The vaccine stance of social media posts can be classified in almost real-time using machine learning. We describe the use of a Transformer-based machine learning model for analyzing vaccine stance of Italian tweets, and demonstrate the need to address changes over time in vaccine-related language, through periodic model retraining. Vaccine-related tweets were collected through a platform developed for the European Joint Action on Vaccination. Two datasets were collected, the first between November 2019 and June 2020, the second from April to September 2021. The tweets were manually categorized by three independent annotators. After cleaning, the total dataset consisted of 1,736 tweets with 3 categories (promotional, neutral, and discouraging). The manually classified tweets were used to train and test various machine learning models. The model that classified the data most similarly to humans was XLM-Roberta-large, a multilingual version of the Transformer-based model RoBERTa. The model hyper-parameters were tuned and then the model ran five times. The fine-tuned model with the best F-score over the validation dataset was selected. Running the selected fine-tuned model on just the first test dataset resulted in an accuracy of 72.8% (F-score 0.713). Using this model on the second test dataset resulted in a 10% drop in accuracy to 62.1% (F-score 0.617), indicating that the model recognized a difference in language between the datasets. On the combined test datasets the accuracy was 70.1% (F-score 0.689). Retraining the model using data from the first and second datasets increased the accuracy over the second test dataset to 71.3% (F-score 0.713), a 9% improvement from when using just the first dataset for training. The accuracy over the first test dataset remained the same at 72.8% (F-score 0.721). The accuracy over the combined test datasets was then 72.4% (F-score 0.720), a 2% improvement. Through fine-tuning a machine-learning model on task-specific data, the accuracy achieved in categorizing tweets was close to that expected by a single human annotator. Regular training of machine-learning models with recent data is advisable to maximize accuracy.",,259
1150,35973771,Investigation of resistance mechanisms to bentazone in multiple resistant Amaranthus retroflexus populations.,"Redroot amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) is a noxious weed that affects soybean production in China. Experiments were conducted to determine the molecular basis of resistance to bentazone. Whole-plant dose-response experiments showed that two populations (R1 and R2) exhibited resistance to bentazone with resistance indices of 9.01 and 6.85, respectively. Sequencing of the psbA gene revealed no amino acid substitution in the two populations. qRT-PCR analysis verified that psbA gene expression in R1 and R2 populations was increased significantly after treatment with bentazone, which was 3-fold and 5-fold higher than that in S1 and S2 populations, respectively. The P450 inhibitor malathion significantly reduced the level of resistance in the R1 and R2 populations when used prior to bentazone treatment. The R1 population exhibited multiple resistance to thifensulfuron-methyl and lactofen, caused by target site mutations (Asp-376-Glu in ALS, Arg-128-Gly in PPO2). In conclusion, increased gene expression of the psbA gene and enhanced herbicide metabolism seem to be the basis of resistance to bentazone in these A. retroflexus populations.",,260
1063,35974556,Resolution exchange with tunneling for enhanced sampling of protein landscapes.,"Simulations of protein folding and protein association happen on timescales that are orders of magnitude larger than what can typically be covered in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Use of low-resolution models alleviates this problem but may reduce the accuracy of the simulations. We introduce a replica-exchange-based multiscale sampling technique that combines the faster sampling in coarse-grained simulations with the potentially higher accuracy of all-atom simulations. After testing the efficiency of our Resolution Exchange with Tunneling (ResET) in simulations of the Trp-cage protein, an often used model to evaluate sampling techniques in protein simulations, we use our approach to compare the landscape of wild-type and A2T mutant Aβ_{1-42} peptides. Our results suggest a mechanism by that the mutation of a small hydrophobic alanine (A) into a bulky polar threonine (T) may interfere with the self-assembly of Aβ fibrils.",,261
2395,35966977,"Mesenteric Panniculitis, Sclerosing Mesenteritis and Mesenteric Lipodystrophy: Descriptive Review of a Rare Condition.","Mesenteric panniculitis (MP) is the preferred nomenclature for a continuum of inflammatory diseases of the mesentery. The diagnosis of MP is often based on the appearance of a mass-like structure at the root of the mesentery. Characteristic histology includes focal fat necrosis, chronic inflammation, and sometimes mesenteric fibrosis. At present, robust literature related to diagnosis and management of MP are limited. MP is postulated to be an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory and/or a paraneoplastic disease. A personal or family history of other autoimmune diseases is commonly apparent. Several inciting events have been identified that possibly act as triggers in the development of the disease. Trauma, abdominal surgery, infection, and various cancers have been associated with mesenteric panniculitis. There are several diagnostic and histologic criteria that aid in making the diagnosis of MP. The differential diagnosis for a mesenteric mass includes neoplastic disease, and a biopsy may be indicated to rule out other conditions. While cases of MP with a short duration of symptoms, or spontaneously regression may occur, some patients experience prolonged periods of pain, fever, and alterations in bowel habit, causing significant morbidity. A variety of medical therapies have been suggested for MP. Only two, thalidomide and low-dose naltrexone, have been prospectively evaluated. For patients with chronic MP, good responses to prolonged corticosteroid treatment have been reported. Novel therapies include thalidomide and low-dose naltrexone. Hormonal and immunomodulatory therapies are also used based on small case series, but these treatments may have significant side effects. Surgical intervention is not curative and is avoided except for relief of focal bowel obstruction secondary to fibrotic forms of the disease.",,262
925,35974765,Molecular basis for turnover inefficiencies (misses) during water oxidation in photosystem II.,"Photosynthesis stores solar light as chemical energy and efficiency of this process is highly important. The electrons required for CO2 reduction are extracted from water in a reaction driven by light-induced charge separations in the Photosystem II reaction center and catalyzed by the CaMn4O5-cluster. This cyclic process involves five redox intermediates known as the S0-S4 states. In this study, we quantify the flash-induced turnover efficiency of each S state by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Measurements were performed in photosystem II membrane preparations from spinach in the presence of an exogenous electron acceptor at selected temperatures between -10 °C and +20 °C and at flash frequencies of 1.25, 5 and 10 Hz. The results show that at optimal conditions the turnover efficiencies are limited by reactions occurring in the water oxidizing complex, allowing the extraction of their S state dependence and correlating low efficiencies to structural changes and chemical events during the reaction cycle. At temperatures 10 °C and below, the highest efficiency (i.e. lowest miss parameter) was found for the S1 → S2 transition, while the S2 → S3 transition was least efficient (highest miss parameter) over the whole temperature range. These electron paramagnetic resonance results were confirmed by measurements of flash-induced oxygen release patterns in thylakoid membranes and are explained on the basis of S state dependent structural changes at the CaMn4O5-cluster that were determined recently by femtosecond X-ray crystallography. Thereby, possible molecular errors connected to the e - transfer, H+ transfer, H2O binding and O2 release are identified.",,263
1542,35968344,Nuclear interaction of Arp2/3 complex and BRAFV600E promotes aggressive behavior and vemurafenib resistance of thyroid cancer.,"The presence of mutant BRAF V600E correlates with the risk of recurrence in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients. However, not all PTC patients with BRAF V600E are associated with poor prognosis. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which certain PTC patients with nuclear BRAF V600E become aggressive and develop resistance to a selective BRAF inhibitor, PLX-4032, is urgently needed. The effect of nuclear localization of BRAFV600E using in vitro studies, xenograft mouse-model and human tissues was evaluated. PTC cells harboring a nuclear localization signal (NLS) of BRAFV600E were established and examined in nude mice implanted with TPC1-NLS-BRAFV600E cells followed by PLX-4032 treatment. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed on 100 PTC specimens previously confirmed that they have BRAFV600E mutations. Our results demonstrate that 21 of 100 (21%) PTC tissues stained with specific BRAFV600E antibody had nuclear staining with more aggressive features compared to their cytosolic counterparts. In vitro studies show that BRAFV600E is transported between the nucleus and the cytosol through CRM1 and importin (α/β) system. Sequestration of BRAFV600E in the cytosol sensitized resistant cells to PLX-4032, whereas nuclear BRAFV600E was associated with aggressive phenotypes and developed drug resistance. Proteomic analysis revealed Arp2/3 complex members, actin-related protein 2 (ACTR2 aliases ARP2) and actin-related protein 3 (ACTR3 aliases ARP3), as the most enriched nuclear BRAFV600E partners. ACTR3 was highly correlated to lymph node stage and extrathyroidal extension and was validated with different functional assays. Our findings provide new insights into the clinical utility of the nuclear BRAFV600E as a prognostic marker for PTC aggressiveness and determine the efficacy of selective BRAFV600E inhibitor treatment which opens new avenues for future treatment options.",,264
105,35983354,Flexible Assertive Community Treatment in Rural and Remote Areas: A Qualitative Study of the Challenges and Adaptations of the Model.,"Flexible assertive community treatment (FACT) is an innovative model for providing long-term treatment to people with severe mental illness. The model was developed in the Netherlands but is now used in other countries, including Norway, which has a geography different from the Netherlands, with many rural and remote areas. Implementation of innovations is context dependent. The FACT model's potential in rural and remote areas has not been studied. Therefore, we aimed to gain knowledge regarding the challenges and modifications of the model in rural and remote contexts and discuss how they can affect the model's potential in such areas. This knowledge can improve the understanding of how FACT or similar services can be adapted to function most optimally in such conditions. We sought to address the following questions: Which elements of the FACT model do team leaders of the rural FACT teams find particularly challenging due to the context, and what modifications have the teams made to the model? Digital interviews were conducted with five team leaders from five rural FACT teams in different parts of Norway. They were selected using purposive sampling to include team leaders from some of the most rural teams in Norway. The interviews were analyzed using thematic text analysis. The following three themes described elements of the FACT model that were experienced particularly challenging in the rural and remote context: multidisciplinary shared caseload approach, intensive outreach and crisis management. The following eight themes described the modifications that the teams had made to the model: intermunicipal collaboration, context-adaptive planning, delegation of tasks to municipal services, part-time employment, different geographical locations of staff, use of digital tools, fewer FACT board meetings, and reduced caseload. Rural and remote contexts challenge the FACT model's potential. However, modifications can be made, some of which can be considered innovative modifications that can increase the model's potential in such areas, while others might move the teams further away from the model.",,265
2484,35966774,Early increase of cerebrospinal fluid 14-3-3ζ protein in the alzheimer's disease continuum.,"The earlier research has shown that the 14-3-3ζ is increased in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains and stimulates the tau phosphorylation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 14-3-3ζ along the AD continuum remains to be explored. We analyzed 113 cognitive normal (CN) controls, 372 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 225 patients with AD dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. CSF 14-3-3ζ protein was measured by Mass Spectrometry. We observed higher CSF 14-3-3ζ in the MCI group vs. the CN group and in the AD group vs. the MCI or CN group. The 14-3-3ζ was able to distinguish AD from CN and MCI. High 14-3-3ζ predicted conversion from MCI to AD. In CSF, phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 and total-tau were associated with 14-3-3ζ in MCI and AD groups, and beta-amyloid (Aβ) 42 correlated with 14-3-3ζ in the MCI group. Baseline high 14-3-3ζ was associated with cognitive decline, brain atrophy, glucose hypometabolism, and Aβ deposition in MCI and AD at baseline and follow-up. Our findings revealed the potential diagnostic and prognostic utility of CSF 14-3-3ζ in the AD continuum. The 14-3-3ζ could be a promising therapeutic target for the intervention of AD.",,266
186,35982897,The Novel Role of hnRNP UL1 in Human Cell Nucleoli.,"hnRNP UL1 plays an important role in cell nuclei, where it is recruited to DNA damage sites and is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Furthermore, this protein is known as a transcriptional repressor of RNA polymerase II genes. In the present study, we have shown that hnRNP UL1 is also localized in the nucleoli of human cells. Upon investigating its function, we found that hnRNP UL1 stimulates ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene transcription. Moreover, we observed that cells with hnRNP UL1 silencing exhibited increased sensitivity to DNA damage. We also showed that hnRNP UL1 interacts with γH2A.X, RPA32, XRCC1, and Chk1 in cell nucleoli, suggesting its involvement in the repair of rDNA damage.",,267
822,35974949,Mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavioral therapy: Is it effective on stress coping strategies in women with multiple sclerosis?,"Patients with chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer more from psychiatric consequences than others, and their quality of life may be drastically affected, causing syndromes like depression and anxiety. Mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavioral therapy (Mi-CBT) seems to improve stress coping strategies in chronically ill patients, but its effectiveness has been little studied in MS. So, in this study, we aimed to assess its effectiveness on stress coping strategies in women suffering from MS in Mazandaran province, Iran. In this semi-experimental study, we selected 40 women with MS who had been referred to a neurologist in Mazandaran province, Iran during the year 2016 by convenient sampling and randomly assigned to the Mi-CBT and control group with a one-to-one ratio. Patients in the intervention group were under treatment for eight 120-minutes session, while the control group only stayed on the waiting list. After obtaining the ethics committee's approval (IR.IAU.CHALUS.REC.1397.018) and patient's informed consent, both groups underwent a pre-test assessment with a stress status questionnaire developed by Endler and Parker in 1988. The same assessment was done for both groups two times more, one after compilation of all sessions, and one 45 days later. Repeated measures analysis of variance was done using SPSS Version 24 software. There was a difference between intervention and the control group for avoidance-oriented, and problem-oriented stress coping strategies (p<0.01), but there was not a significant difference for emotion-oriented strategy between groups (P=0.22). MiCBT is effective in improving stress coping strategies in women with MS, and overall mental health.",,268
2036,35967550,Lactoferrin and Human Neutrophil Protein (HNP) 1-3 Levels During the Neonatal Period in Preterm Infants.,"Antimicrobial polypeptides (APPs) are part of the innate immune system, but their specific role in the context of preterm birth is not yet understood. The aim of this investigation was to determine the systemic expression of APPs, i.e., lactoferrin (LF) and human neutrophil protein (HNP) 1-3 in preterm infants in the period of highest vulnerability for infection and to correlate these biomarkers with short-term outcome. We therefore conducted a prospective two-center study including plasma samples of 278 preterm infants and 78 corresponding mothers. APP levels were analyzed on day 1, 3, 7, and 21 of life via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of LF and HNP1-3 remained stable during the first 21 days of life and were not influenced by maternal levels. Elevated APP levels were found at day 1 in infants born to mothers with amniotic infection syndrome (AIS vs. no AIS, mean ± SD in ng/ml: LF 199.8 ± 300 vs. 124.1 ± 216.8, HNP 1-3 16,819 ± 36,124 vs. 8,701 ± 11,840; p = 0.021, n = 179). We found no elevated levels of APPs before the onset of sepsis episodes or in association with other short-term outcomes that are in part mediated by inflammation such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Interestingly, infants developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) showed higher levels of HNP1-3 on day 21 than infants without BPD (13,473 ± 16,135 vs. 8,388 ± 15,938, n = 111, p = 0.008). In infants born without amniotic infection, levels of the measured APPs correlated with gestational age and birth weight. In our longitudinal study, systemic levels of LF and HNP 1-3 were not associated with postnatal infection and adverse short-term outcomes in preterm infants.",,269
855,35974868,Vanishing Bile Duct Syndrome in the Presence of Hodgkin Lymphoma.,"Vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS) is an acquired condition characterized by the destruction and loss of intrahepatic bile ducts resulting in cholestasis. VBDS has been described in various conditions including neoplastic and immunologic disorders, infections, hepatic ischemia, and drug toxicity. The diagnosis is confirmed by liver biopsy revealing the loss of interlobular bile ducts in greater than 50% of portal tracts. Prognosis is variable and often unpredictable but appears to be influenced by the etiology of bile duct destruction and overall patient health. VBDS has been described as a rare paraneoplastic process in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. This case describes a 26-year-old female who presented with a neck mass, jaundice, and pruritus. Initial workup revealed direct hyperbilirubinemia, transaminitis, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and elevated international normalized ratio. She went on to receive a diagnosis of stage II classical Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosing subtype, and biopsy-proven VBDS. Over the course of chemotherapy, complete metabolic resolution of Hodgkin lymphoma and complete normalization of bilirubin were achieved. She was given gemcitabine and cyclophosphamide as a liver sparing regimen initially with some improvement in liver function tests and a reduction in lymph node volumes. She received six cycles of adriamycin/bleomycin/vinblastine/dacarbazine (ABVD) with complete remission attained after four cycles by positron emission tomography/computed tomography criteria. This report illustrates asafe chemotherapy regimen in the presence of marked liver dysfunction. Workup for VBDS including liver biopsy should be pursued in Hodgkin lymphoma patients with evidence of cholestasis in the absence of extrahepatic bile duct damage or other known etiology of liver injury.",,270
2268,35967163,"Association Between Metabolic Syndrome, Its Components, and Knee Osteoarthritis in Premenopausal and Menopausal Women: A Pilot Study.","This pilot study aimed to determine the correlation of metabolic syndrome (MetS), its components, and increased LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and total cholesterol levels with osteoarthritis (OA). In addition, our goal was to establish the association between MetS and the degree of handicap measured by the Lequesne index of functionality and severity of knee osteoarthritis. The pilot study included 25 subjects with knee OA and 19 subjects without knee OA. All subjects were menopausal or premenopausal women. MetS was diagnosed according to the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III. OA was diagnosed if Kellgren-Lawrence ≥ 2. MetS was detected in 80% of subjects with OA. In the non-OA group, MetS was detected in 26% of subjects. The difference in MetS prevalence between the two groups was significant (p=0.000). The presence of each MetS component was significant in the OA group, except for central obesity, which presence was marginally significant (p=0.054). Prevalence of increased total (p=0.019) and LDL cholesterol (p=0.000) was also significant in the OA group. A significant difference between OA and the non-OA group was detected in the prevalence of all five MetS components (p=0.016). In the OA group, the Lequesne index of functionality and severity of knee osteoarthritis was not significantly altered between subjects with and without MetS. Metabolic syndrome, its components, increased LDL, and total cholesterol are correlated with osteoarthritis in premenopausal and menopausal women. MetS is not correlated with the degree of handicap in the knee joint measured by the Lequesne index.",,271

Besides, the metabolic characteristics of BIC remain unclear. In the current study, we identified the metabolite of BIC in rat plasma, urine and feces, and evaluated the efficacy and safety of these metabolites. Based on the fragmentation behavior, we totally identified 11 metabolites and 7 metabolites in plasma, 8 metabolites in urine and 8 metabolites in feces. Notably, M1-M3, M6, M7, M10 and M11 were identified for the first time. M7 was the most abundant metabolite in the rat plasma. The metabolic pathways mainly involved demethylation, dealkylation, hydrolysis, methylation, oxidation and glucuronidation. In addition, the efficacy and safety of BIC's metabolites were evaluated by network pharmacology and molecular docking combined with toxicity prediction. The analysis of network pharmacology indicated that BIC's metabolites against DILI through the MAPK signaling pathway and Hepatitis B pathway. The molecular docking results showed that the binding energy of 5 compounds that docked with 7nuw and 10 compounds that docked with 4tjz was lower than BIC. 11 compounds possessed higher solubility and lower toxicity than BIC in prediction. Thus, the identification and evaluation of BIC's metabolites contributed to a better understanding of pharmacological mechanism of BIC and the high-value metabolites of high efficacy, safety and solubility provided a basis for drug development.",,272
2349,35967027,Experimental Investigation of CO2-Induced Silica Gel as the Water Blocking Grout Effect of Aquifer Ions.,"This study aimed to prevent water flow in microcracks and simultaneously achieve CO2 capture during grouting (CCG). Using sodium silicate (SS) as the primary material, the microcracks were grouted by a two-step approach. The low-initial-viscosity (5 mPa s) SS was first saturated within the microcracks followed by CO2 injection at 2 MPa. Through CO2 dissolution, silica gel was developed and tolerated a hydraulic pressure of up to 5.5 MPa. The effects of aquifer ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3 -, and SO4 2-) were equally evaluated at harsh conditions, and it was found that the strength of the silica gel was reduced, which was caused by salting out, low CO2 solubility, and precipitation. As a result, the hydraulic pressure was reduced to as low as 3 MPa. After 210 days, 16% of the silica gels (without ion inclusion) were reversible to the liquid phase, where a similar effect was found in the cases of Na+ and Mg2+ ions. The degradation increased with more Ca2+ ions (up to 55%) and decreased with more HCO3 - and SO4 2- ions. Microcracks grouted with CCG extended the CO2 utilization in grouting application. Combined with the effect of dissolved ions, the proposed approach is feasible in the field implementation for underground engineering under water bodies.",,273
1768,35967907,Development of a human antibody that exhibits antagonistic activity toward CC chemokine receptor 7.,"CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) is a member of G-protein-coupled receptor family and mediates chemotactic migration of immune cells and different cancer cells induced via chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19 (CCL19) or chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21). Hence, the identification of blockade antibodies against CCR7 could lead to the development of therapeutics targeting metastatic cancer. CCR7 was purified and stabilized in its active conformation, and antibodies specific to purified CCR7 were screened from the synthetic M13 phage library displaying humanized scFvs. The in vitro characterization of selected scFvs identified two scFvs that exhibited CCL19-competitive binding to CCR7. IgG4's harboring selected scFv sequences were characterized for binding activity in CCR7+ cells, inhibitory activity toward CCR7-dependent cAMP attenuation, and the CCL19 or CCL21-dependent migration of CCR7+ cells. Antibodies specifically binding to purified CCR7 and CCR7+ cells were isolated and characterized. Two antibodies, IgG4(6RG11) and IgG4(72C7), showed ligand-dependent competitive binding to CCR7 with KD values of 40 nM and 50 nM, respectively. Particularly, IgG4(6RG11) showed antagonistic activity against CCR7, whereas both antibodies significantly blocked the ligand-induced migration and invasion activity of CCR7+ cancer cells. Two antibody clones were successfully identified from a synthetic scFv-displaying phage library using purified recombinant CCR7 as an antigen. Antibodies specifically bound to the surface of CCR7+ cells and blocked CCR7+ cell migration. Particularly, 6RG11 showed antagonist activity against CCR7-dependent cAMP attenuation.",,274
531,35978702,Discovery of Insulin/GLP-1/Glucagon Triagonists for the Treatment of Diabetes and Obesity.,"The combination of insulin and incretin-based therapies has emerged as a potential promising tactic for the treatment of diabetes. Here we report the first example of a unimolecular triagonist to simultaneously target insulin, GLP-1, and glucagon receptors, aiming for better glycemic control and superior weight loss. The strategy for constructing such a unimolecular triagonist is the conjugation of the insulin moiety and GLP-1R/GCGR coagonist peptide via alkyne-azide click chemistry. Two tractable series differentiated by insulin conjugation sites, B1F and B29K, were identified. Triagonist 13 prepared through the conjugation at insulin B1F and position 24 of GLP-1R/GCGR coagonist exhibited insulin activity comparable to that of insulin degludec and potent and balanced GLP-1R and GCGR activities. Pharmacokinetic profiles of 13 in both rat and minipig were also discussed.",,275
383,35979291,Acute choroidal involvement in lupus nephritis: A case report and review of literature.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), characterized by the production of autoantibodies and widespread deposition of immune complexes, predominantly affects women of childbearing age. More than one-third of SLE patients present ocular manifestations. Choroidal disease is currently not completely understood, and its precise differentiation from central serous chorioretinopathy is rarely achieved. To date, no more than 60 patients with choroidal involvement have been reported. A 37-year-old Chinese woman experienced decreased visual acuity bilaterally, accompanied by increasing periorbital swelling and severe conjunctival chemosis. Decreased breath sounds in both bases were detected via auscultation, as well as pitting edema in both ankles. SLE and lupus nephritis were diagnosed based on serositis, renal disorder, leukopenia and positive anti-Smith and anti-nuclear antibodies. Lupus choroidopathy was diagnosed based on ocular presentation and imaging. The patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids, spironolactone, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and intravenous immunoglobulin. After 4 wk of hospitalization, the patient was discharged. Indocyanine green angiography showed no leakage from choroidal vessels, and ocular coherence tomography detected low amounts of subretinal fluid right before discharge. The patient was prescribed oral methylprednisolone, HCQ, and MMF. Two months after the first visit, ophthalmological examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/20 bilaterally, and SLE disease activity was well controlled; her symptoms disappeared completely. Here we presented a case of lupus choroidopathy, successfully treated with systemic corticosteroids, and discussed previously reported cases, focusing on differential diagnosis with a central serous chorioretinopathy.",,276
621,35977443,Association of glial tau pathology and LATE-NC in the ageing brain.,"Ageing-related pathologies of the brain include neurofibrillary tangles, argyrophilic grains, ageing-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy-neuropathological change (LATE-NC), vascular pathology and corpora amylacea. This study used an unbiased approach to evaluate a broad range of pathologies in an unselected European community-dwelling ageing cohort of 101 individuals (77-90 years). Pathological alterations observed included neurofibrillary tangles and corpora amylacea in all cases, ARTAG (79%), Thal amyloid-β phase >1 (60%), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (39%), Lewy bodies (22%), LATE-NC (21%), oligodendroglial tau-positive coiled bodies (33%), and argyrophilic grains (15%). We demonstrate association of LATE-NC with the previously unappreciated age-related tau oligodendrogliopathy (ARTOG) and highlight the association of LATE-NC with various ARTAG types pointing toward common pathogenic aspects. Only neurofibrillary tangles and LATE-NC were associated with cognitive decline. This study broadens the spectrum of age-related brain pathologies and highlights a novel ageing-related tau pathology in oligodendroglia. Results from this study suggest overlapping pathogenic mechanisms between LATE-NC and glial tau pathologies in the medial temporal lobe.",,277
2137,35967381,The expression pattern of Immune checkpoints after chemo/radiotherapy in the tumor microenvironment.,"As a disease with the highest disease-associated burden worldwide, cancer has been the main subject of a considerable proportion of medical research in recent years, intending to find more effective therapeutic approaches with fewer side effects. Combining conventional methods with newer biologically based treatments such as immunotherapy can be a promising approach to treating different tumors. The concept of cancer immunoediting that occurs in the field of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is the aspect of cancer therapy that has not been at the center of attention. One group of the role players of the so-called immunoediting process are the immune checkpoint molecules that exert either co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory effects in the anti-tumor immunity of the host. It involves alterations in a wide variety of immunologic pathways. Recent studies have proven that conventional cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of them, i.e., chemoradiotherapy, alter the immune compartment of the TME. The mentioned changes encompass a wide range of variations, including the changes in the density and immunologic type of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the alterations in the expression patterns of the different immune checkpoints. These rearrangements can have either anti-tumor immunity empowering or immune attenuating sequels. Thus, recognizing the consequences of various chemo(radio)therapeutic regimens in the TME seems to be of great significance in the evolution of therapeutic approaches. Therefore, the present review intends to summarize how chemo(radio)therapy affects the TME and specifically some of the most important, well-known immune checkpoints' expressions according to the recent studies in this field.",,278
1289,35970687,Glycated albumin is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among U.S. adults with and without diabetes: A retrospective cohort study.,"Glycated albumin (GA) reflects short-term glycemic control, but few data are available on its association with hard clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between GA levels and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in people with and without a previous diagnosis of diabetes. Serum GA levels were measured in 12147 people from the general population (1319 with and 10828 without diabetes) that participated in the 1999-2004 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We evaluated the association between GA and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality through December 2015 by linking NHANES data with data from the National Death Index. Associations were compared with those observed for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). After a median follow-up of 13 years, 2785 participants (619 with and 2166 without diabetes) died, 651 of cardiovascular causes. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models showed that higher baseline GA levels were significantly associated with a higher incidence of both outcomes in participants with (all-cause: HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04; cardiovascular: HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07) and without diabetes (all-cause: HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.08; cardiovascular: HR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14); on the other hand, we found a trend for increased mortality with increasing HbA1c levels in patients with known diabetes, but not in participants without. For a novel measure of hyperglycemia to be considered useful, its association with hard, long term clinical outcomes is of great importance. We showed that GA is associated with mortality in the general population independently of a previous diagnosis of diabetes.",,279
1868,35967772,Association between the mediterranean diet and cognitive health among healthy adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"An increasing prevalence of cognitive disorders warrants comprehensive systematic reviews on the effect of diet on cognitive health. Studies have suggested that the Mediterranean (MeDi) diet has protective effects against metabolic diseases. However, comprehensive systematic reviews on the effect of the MeDi diet on the cognitive decline are limited. We investigated whether adherence to the MeDi diet could lower the risk of the cognitive disorder or improve cognitive function in older adults. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to June 2021. Cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The effect sizes were estimated as log risk ratios and standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The Newcastle-Ottawa score and Cochrane Collaboration's tool were used to assess the risk of bias in cohort studies and RCTs, respectively. Of the 1,687 screened studies, 31 cohort studies and five RCTs met the eligibility criteria for qualitative analysis; 26 cohort studies and two RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. In the cohort studies, high adherence to the MeDi diet was associated with lower risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [risk ratio (RR) = 0.75 (0.66-0.86)], and Alzheimer's disease (AD) [RR = 0.71 (0.56-0.89)]. In the RCTs, high adherence to the MeDi diet was associated with better episodic [SMD = 0.20 (0.09-0.30)] and working memories [SMD = 0.17 (0.01-0.32)] than lowest group. Adherence to the MeDi diet may reduce the risk of MCI and AD. However, other associations with cognitive outcomes (global cognition, working memory, and episodic memory) remain open to interpretation. Overall, the MeDi diet is recommended to prevent or delay cognitive disorders and improve cognitive function. Further, long-term RCTs are warranted to strengthen the evidence.

2469,35966789,Multiple step saccades in simply reactive saccades could serve as a complementary biomarker for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.,"It has been argued that the incidence of multiple step saccades (MSS) in voluntary saccades could serve as a complementary biomarker for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD). However, voluntary saccadic tasks are usually difficult for elderly subjects to complete. Therefore, task difficulties restrict the application of MSS measurements for the diagnosis of PD. The primary objective of the present study is to assess whether the incidence of MSS in simply reactive saccades could serve as a complementary biomarker for the early diagnosis of PD. There were four groups of human subjects: PD patients, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, elderly healthy controls (EHCs), and young healthy controls (YHCs). There were four monkeys with subclinical hemi-PD induced by injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) through the unilateral internal carotid artery and three healthy control monkeys. The behavioral task was a visually guided reactive saccade. In a human study, the incidence of MSS was significantly higher in PD than in YHC, EHC, and MCI groups. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis could discriminate PD from the EHC and MCI groups, with areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.76 and 0.69, respectively. In a monkey study, while typical PD symptoms were absent, subclinical hemi-PD monkeys showed a significantly higher incidence of MSS than control monkeys when the dose of MPTP was greater than 0.4 mg/kg. The incidence of MSS in simply reactive saccades could be a complementary biomarker for the early diagnosis of PD.",,281
1137,35973884,Effects of different levels of weightlifting training on bone mineral density in a group of adolescents.,"The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of different levels of weightlifting training on bone mineral density (BMD) at different body sites (whole body (WB), lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), upper limbs (UL) and lower limbs (LL)) in a group of adolescents. Three groups of pubertal boys aged 13-15 years were recruited, including a control group (which included 13 untrained adolescents), a moderately trained group (which included 13 non-elite weightlifters, with four sessions of 2 hours per week) and a highly trained group (which included 13 elite weightlifters, with eight sessions of 2 hours per week). The three groups were paired for age and maturation index (using Tanner stages). Body composition, bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD were evaluated by dual-energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA). Physical performance variables (including weightlifting specific exercises, counter movement jump and squat jump) were measured using validated methods. Results showed that the values of BMD and physical performance variables were greater in the group of elite weightlifters compared to the group of non-elite weightlifters and the control group. In addition, the values of BMD and physical performance variables were higher in the group of the non-elite weightlifters compared to those of the control group. After adjusting for lean mass and squat jump, lumbar spine BMD, FN BMD, UL BMD and LL BMD remained significantly higher in the elite weightlifters' group compared to the two other groups. In conclusion, the current study suggests that elite adolescent weightlifters have greater bone health parameters compared to moderately-trained adolescent weightlifters and untrained adolescents.",,282
1010,35974609,Moment closure approximations of susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemics on adaptive networks.,"The influence of people's individual responses to the spread of contagious phenomena, like the COVID-19 pandemic, is still not well understood. We investigate the Markovian Generalized Adaptive Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (G-ASIS) epidemic model. The G-ASIS model comprises many contagious phenomena on networks, ranging from epidemics and information diffusion to innovation spread and human brain interactions. The connections between nodes in the G-ASIS model change adaptively over time, because nodes make decisions to create or break links based on the health state of their neighbors. Our contribution is fourfold. First, we rigorously derive the first-order and second-order mean-field approximations from the continuous-time Markov chain. Second, we illustrate that the first-order mean-field approximation fails to approximate the epidemic threshold of the Markovian G-ASIS model accurately. Third, we show that the second-order mean-field approximation is a qualitative good approximation of the Markovian G-ASIS model. Finally, we discuss the Adaptive Information Diffusion (AID) model in detail, which is contained in the G-ASIS model. We show that, similar to most other instances of the G-ASIS model, the AID model possesses a unique steady state, but that in the AID model, the convergence time toward the steady state is very large. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.",,283
2445,35966851,Weight change and fracture risk in patients with diabetic kidney disease: A nationwide population-based study.,"The increased risk of fracture has been associated with weight loss in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. However, the relationship between weight changes over time and fracture risk in patients with diabetic kidney disease is still unknown. A total number of 78,922 patients with diabetic kidney disease, aged ≥ 40 years, were selected using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, between 2009 and 2012. They were followed up until the end of 2018. Weight change was defined as the difference in body weight from the index year to 2 years later. Weight changes were then divided into five categories, ranging from weight loss of ≥10% to weight gain of ≥10%. Fractures were identified in 9,847 patients with diabetic kidney disease, over a median follow-up of 5.2 years. The risk of composite fracture of the vertebral, hip, or other sites increased as the weight change increased. Specifically, patients with ≥10% weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.286; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.184-1.398) and ≥10% weight gain (HR, 1.198; 95% CI, 1.080-1.330) showed a higher HR compared to those with ≤ 5% weight change after adjusting for several confounding factors. Higher HR of vertebral and hip fractures was also seen with increased weight loss or gain. In particular, patients with ≥10% weight loss showed the highest HR for hip fractures (HR, 1.738; 95% CI, 1.489-2.028). Both weight loss and weight gain increase the risk of fracture in patients with diabetic kidney disease. Therefore, patients with diabetic kidney disease who experience weight changes should be made aware of the risk of fracture.",,284
1354,35969134,"ZOOMICS: comparative metabolomics of red blood cells from dogs, cows, horses and donkeys during refrigerated storage for up to 42 days.","The use of omics technologies in human transfusion medicine has improved our understanding of the red blood cell (RBC) storage lesion(s). Despite significant progress towards understanding the storage lesion(s) of human RBCs, a comparison of basal and post-storage RBC metabolism across multiple species using omics technologies has not yet been reported, and is the focus of this study. Blood was collected in a standard bag system (CPD-SAG-Mannitol) from dogs (n=8), horses, bovines, and donkeys (n=6). All bags were stored at 4°C for up to 42 days (i.e., the end of the shelf life in Italian veterinary clinics) and sampled weekly for metabolomics analyses. In addition, data comparisons to on our ongoing Zoomics project are included to compare this study's results with those of non-human primates and humans. Significant interspecies differences in RBC metabolism were observed at baseline, at the time of donation, with bovine showing significantly higher levels of metabolites in the tryptophan/kynurenine pathway; dogs showing elevated levels of high-energy compounds (especially adenosine triphosphate and S-adenosyl-methionine) and equine (donkey and horse) RBCs showing almost overlapping phenotypes, with the highest levels of free branched chain amino acids, glycolytic metabolites (including 2,3-diphosphoglycerate), higher total glutathione pools, and elevated metabolites of the folate pathway compared to the other species. Strikingly, previously described metabolic markers of the storage lesion(s) in humans followed similar trends across all species, though the rate of accumulation/depletion of metabolites in energy and redox metabolism varied by species, with equine blood showing the lowest degree of storage lesion(s). These results interrogate RBC metabolism across a range of mammalian species and improve our understanding of both human and veterinary blood storage and transfusion.",,285
1865,35967775,"Hydrolysable tannins, physicochemical properties, and antioxidant property of wild-harvested Terminalia ferdinandiana (exell) fruit at different maturity stages.","Terminalia ferdinandiana Exell., also known as Kakadu plum, is a wild-harvested native Australian fruit with limited information on how maturity is affecting the phytonutritional properties and bioactivities of the fruit. Thus, this study investigated changes in hydrolysable tannins, phenolic acids, sugar profile, standard physicochemical parameters, and antioxidant-scavenging capacity of wild-harvested Kakadu plum fruits at four different maturity stages, from immature to fully mature. Fruits harvested <25, 25-50, 50-75, and 75-100% degree of fullness were classified as highly immature (stage 1), immature (stage 2), semi-mature (stage 3), and fully mature (stage 4), respectively. Results showed that chebulagic acid, geraniin, chebulinic acid, castalagin, punicalagin, and gallic acid continuously decreased during fruit maturity, while elaeocarpusin, helioscopin B, corilagin, 3,4,6-tri-O-galloyl-S-glucose, and ellagic acid increased at the beginning of fruit growth (from stage 1 to 2), but decreased when the fruits reached their full maturity (stage 4). The levels of hydrolysable tannins and phenolic acids in fully mature fruits (stage 4) were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) lower than that in their immature counterparts (stages 1 and 2). Total phenolic content (TPC) and DPPH antioxidant radical-scavenging activity did not vary significantly between different maturity stages. Pearson's correlation coefficient test indicated that TPC and DPPH positively (p ≤ 0.05) correlate with most of the studied tannin compounds. Sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose), total soluble solid content, and titratable acidity increased during the fruit development. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the difference between the immature and mature samples, based on their nutritional profile and bioactive compounds. The PCA results also suggested a considerable variability between the individual trees, highlighting the challenges of wild-harvest practice.",,286
2283,35967148,The Impact of Acute Care Surgery Model on the Management of Acute Appendicitis and Cholecystitis: A Single-Center Study.,"Background Acute care surgery (ACS) is a novel model for the provision of emergency general surgery (GS) care. Investigating the impact of the ACS team on the management of acute emergencies can help in establishing proper management measures and improving patient care in an emergency setting. The study aims to compare the performance indicators and patient outcomes such as hospital length of stay (LOS), time to diagnosis, and operation before and after the implementation of the acute care system. Methods The study reviewed two retrospective cohorts: the pre-ACS system (n = 202) from January 2012 to December 2013 and the post-ACS system (n = 188) from January 2014 to December 2015, which were done in a tertiary care center. All adult patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis and cholecystitis requiring emergency surgery were included. Results There was an improvement in the time interval between GS referral to the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and cholecystitis (p = 0.07) and from diagnosis to the start of the operation (p = 0.38). Patients in the post-ACS model had a shorter hospital stay than the pre-ACS model patients with [M = 3.69 SD(3.18) days versus M = 3.57 SD (3.60) days, p = 0.25]. Time from the emergency department arrival to GS referral did not show an improvement [M = 4.36 SD(3.34)] hours in the pre-ACS model versus [M = 4.53 SD(3.98)] hours in the ACS model, p = 0.86). Conclusion The ACS model led to earlier diagnosis of acute appendectomy and cholecystectomy cases and reduced the LOS. The introduction of the ACS model in Saudi Arabia showed improvement in patient care during acute emergencies. Further studies including multiple centers with larger sample sizes and longer review periods are needed to evaluate the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the ACS model.",,287
1479,35968418,Health shocks and changes in preventive behaviors: Results from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study.,"China is facing the challenge of rising prevalence and ballooning burden of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs); however, the Chinese middle- and older-aged population considerably lack preventive behaviors. Health shocks (HS), widely defined as sudden health deterioration brought on by diseases or accidents, bring a teachable moment to motivate changes in preventive behaviors. This study aims to examine the effect of HS on changes in preventive behaviors, including personal health practices and preventive care utilization. HS was defined as any five chronic disease diagnoses (cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension). The impacts of HS on smoking, drinking, and exercise, physical examination were estimated. The panel data of 13,705 respondents were obtained from the latest two waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) in 2015 and 2018. A multilevel propensity score match difference-in-difference (multilevel PSM-DID) model was constructed. HS significantly decreased smoking (OR = 0.59, p < 0.05) and drinking (OR = 0.62, p < 0.01) and increased the utilization of auxiliary inspection in physical examination (OR = 1.19, p < 0.1). Major HS had significantly considerable and specific effects on reducing smoking and drinking (OR = 0.37 and 0.56, p < 0.01), while minor HS had relatively small effects on reducing smoking (OR = 0.74, p < 0.05) and drinking (OR = 0.69, p < 0.01), but extensive effects on initiating exercise (OR = 1.32, p < 0.05), physical examination (OR = 1.18, p < 0.1), and auxiliary inspection (OR = 1.30, p < 0.05). After HS, there is a teachable moment to promote positive changes in preventive behaviors. Guided by the 5A's brief intervention model (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange), tailored interventions should be targeted at these populations to reduce the risk of the progression and complications of existing diseases, prevent the related comorbidity, and prolong the expected life-span.",,288

A crucial factor of promoting metastasis in epithelium-derived carcinoma has been considered as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Rictor, one of the components of mTORC2, has been reportedly involved in EMT and metastasis of human malignancies. However, the regulatory mechanisms of Rictor, Rictor-mediated EMT and metastasis in cancers remain unknown. Our present study indicates that Rictor is highly expressed in human NSCLC cell lines and tissues and is regulated, at least partially, at the transcriptional level. Knockdown of Rictor expression causes phenotype alterations through EMT, which is accompanied by the impairment of migration and invasion ability in NSCLC cells. Additionally, we have cloned and identified the human Rictor core promoter for the first time and confirmed that transcription factor KLF4 directly binds to the Rictor promoter and transcriptionally upregulated Rictor expression. Knockdown of KLF4 results in Rictor's downregulation accompanied by a series of characteristic changes of mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and significantly decreases migration, invasion as well as metastasis of NSCLC cells. Re-introducing Rictor in KLF4-knockdown NSCLC cells partially reverses the epithelial phenotype to the mesenchymal phenotype and attenuates the inhibition of cell migration and invasion caused by KLF4 knocking down. Knockdown of KLF4 prevents mTOR/Rictor interaction and metastasis of NSCLC in vivo. The understanding of the regulator upstream of Rictor may provide an opportunity for the development of new inhibitors and the rational design of combination regimens based on different metastasis-related molecular targets and finally prevents cancer metastasis.",,289
917,35974803,Negative Outcome Following Systemic Alteplase Administration Prior to Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in a Kidney Transplant Patient With Cardiac Arrest: A Case Report.,"A case of a negative outcome following systemic alteplase administration prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in a kidney transplant patient with cardiac arrest is reported. A patient status-post kidney transplantation was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) and experienced cardiac arrest after developing sudden-onset chest pain and shortness of breath. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, alteplase 50 mg was administered intravenous push for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) before the patient was evaluated for and started on veno-arterial ECMO. Within several hours, cardiopulmonary resuscitation needed to be reinitiated. Ultimately, the decision was made to cede further resuscitation efforts due to futility. A post-mortem examination included an immediate cause of death of acute myocardial infarction with extensive retroperitoneal hemorrhage. The role of ECMO is emerging in cardiac arrest, and should be considered as a management option before the administration of systemic thrombolysis in patients with increased bleeding risk.",,290
38,35983726,Risk of acquiring Ascaris lumbricoides infection in an endemically infected rural community in Venezuela.,"Soil-transmitted helminths, such as Ascaris lumbricoides, are the most prevalent parasites globally. Optimal anthelmintic treatment for A. lumbricoides in endemically infected communities is challenged by several host-related and environmental factors influencing infection acquisition. We assessed the risk of A. lumbricoides (re)infection after treatment in a Venezuelan rural community. Individual merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde-fixed faecal samples were collected from 224 persons before a single-dose pyrantel treatment and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 15 months after treatment. Effects of age, sex and socioeconomic status (SES) on A. lumbricoides prevalence, eggs/gram faeces (EPG) and infection (re)acquisition were assessed using both generalised linear mixed-effects models and survival analysis. Pre-treatment A. lumbricoides prevalence was 39.7%. Higher prevalence was associated with younger age and lower SES. Higher EPG values were observed among young children. Median time to A. lumbricoides infection was six months after treatment: at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 15 months post-treatment, cumulative incidence was 6.7%, 18.9%, 34.6%, 42.2%, and 52.6%, respectively. Younger age, lower SES, and pre-treatment A. lumbricoides infection status showed significantly elevated hazard ratios. Mass drug administration protocols would benefit from considering these factors in selective treatment strategies and possibly more than just annual or biannual treatments in the target population.",,291
340,35979404,"Can dog-assisted and relaxation interventions boost spatial ability in children with and without special educational needs? A longitudinal, randomized controlled trial.","Children's spatial cognition abilities are a vital part of their learning and cognitive development, and important for their problem-solving capabilities, the development of mathematical skills and progress in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) topics. As many children have difficulties with STEM topic areas, and as these topics have suffered a decline in uptake in students, it is worthwhile to find out how learning and performance can be enhanced at an early age. The current study is the first to investigate if dog-assisted and relaxation interventions can improve spatial abilities in school children. It makes a novel contribution to empirical research by measuring longitudinally if an Animal-Assisted Intervention (AAI) or relaxation intervention can boost children's development of spatial abilities. Randomized controlled trials were employed over time including dog intervention, relaxation intervention and no treatment control groups. Interventions were carried out over 4 weeks, twice a week for 20 min. Children were tested in mainstream schools (N = 105) and in special educational needs (SEN) schools (N = 64) before and after interventions, after 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. To assess intervention type and to provide advice for subsequent best practice recommendations, dog-assisted interventions were run as individual or small group interventions. Overall, children's spatial abilities improved over the year with highest increases in the first 4 months. In Study 1, typically developing children showed higher scores and more continuous learning overall compared to children with special educational needs. Children in the dog intervention group showed higher spatial ability scores immediately after interventions and after a further 6 weeks (short-term). Children in the relaxation group also showed improved scores short-term after relaxation intervention. In contrast, the no treatment control group did not improve significantly. No long-term effects were observed. Interestingly, no gender differences could be observed in mainstream school children's spatial skills. In study 2, children in SEN schools saw immediate improvements in spatial abilities after relaxation intervention sessions. No changes were seen after dog interventions or in the no treatment control group. Participants' pet ownership status did not have an effect in either cohort. These are the first findings showing that AAI and relaxation interventions benefit children's spatial abilities in varied educational settings. This research represents an original contribution to Developmental Psychology and to the field of Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) and is an important step towards further in-depth investigation of how AAI and relaxation interventions can help children achieve their learning potential, both in mainstream schools and in schools for SEN.",,292
1652,35968122,Linkage analysis and residual heterozygotes derived near isogenic lines reveals a novel protein quantitative trait loci from a Glycine soja accession.,"Modern soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] cultivars have low overall genetic variation due to repeated bottleneck events that arose during domestication and from selection strategies typical of many soybean breeding programs. In both public and private soybean breeding programs, the introgression of wild soybean (Glycine soja Siebold and Zucc.) alleles is a viable option to increase genetic diversity and identify new sources for traits of value. The objectives of our study were to examine the genetic architecture responsible for seed protein and oil using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from hybridizing a G. max line ('Osage') with a G. soja accession (PI 593983). Linkage mapping identified a total of seven significant quantitative trait loci on chromosomes 14 and 20 for seed protein and on chromosome 8 for seed oil with LOD scores ranging from 5.3 to 31.7 for seed protein content and from 9.8 to 25.9 for seed oil content. We analyzed 3,015 single F4:9 soybean plants to develop two residual heterozygotes derived near isogenic lines (RHD-NIL) populations by targeting nine SNP markers from genotype-by-sequencing, which corresponded to two novel quantitative trait loci (QTL) derived from G. soja: one for a novel seed oil QTL on chromosome 8 and another for a novel protein QTL on chromosome 14. Single marker analysis and linkage analysis using 50 RHD-NILs validated the chromosome 14 protein QTL, and whole genome sequencing of RHD-NILs allowed us to reduce the QTL interval from ∼16.5 to ∼4.6 Mbp. We identified two genomic regions based on recombination events which had significant increases of 0.65 and 0.72% in seed protein content without a significant decrease in seed oil content. A new Kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (KASP) assay, which will be useful for introgression of this trait into modern elite G. max cultivars, was developed in one region. Within the significantly associated genomic regions, a total of eight genes are considered as candidate genes, based on the presence of gene annotations associated with the protein or amino acid metabolism/movement. Our results provide better insights into utilizing wild soybean as a source of genetic diversity for soybean cultivar improvement utilizing native traits.",,293
1593,35968291,Rhythmic auditory stimulation promotes gait recovery in Parkinson's patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Using rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) to improve gait disturbance in Parkinson's disease (PD) is an available treatment option, yet a consensus on its effectiveness remains controversial. We summarized the effects of RAS on gait, functional activity and quality of life in PD patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, and Cochrane Library databases were initially searched to identify relevant literature up to August 2021. Next, the methodological quality of eligible comparative studies was assessed by the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale. The treatment effects to clinical outcome in relation to gait, motor activities, and quality of life were analyzed. A total of 18 studies consisted of 774 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. Comparing with the control group, RAS had significantly increased stride length (p < 0.001), accelerated gait speed (p < 0.001), reduced the occurrence of freezing events during walking (P = 0.009), achieved an improvement in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II (P = 0.030), UPDRS-III (P < 0.001) and Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQL) (p = 0.009) scores over an interval of 1-26 months. In this meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, we have demonstrated that RAS improves the general motor functions (UPDRS-III), particularly in gait, mobility and quality of life, in patients with Parkinson's disease.",,294
491,35978819,"Identified Gefitinib Metabolism-Related lncRNAs can be Applied to Predict Prognosis, Tumor Microenvironment, and Drug Sensitivity in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","Gefitinib has shown promising efficacy in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Molecular biomarkers for gefitinib metabolism-related lncRNAs have not yet been elucidated. Here, we downloaded relevant genes and matched them to relevant lncRNAs. We then used univariate, LASSO, and multivariate regression to screen for significant genes to construct prognostic models. We investigated TME and drug sensitivity by risk score data. All lncRNAs with differential expression were selected for GO/KEGG analysis. Imvigor210 cohort was used to validate the value of the prognostic model. Finally, we performed a stemness indices difference analysis. lncRNA-constructed prognostic models were significant in the high-risk and low-risk subgroups. Immune pathways were identified in both groups at low risk. The higher the risk score the greater the value of exclusion, MDSC, and CAF. PRRophetic algorithm screened a total of 58 compounds. In conclusion, the prognostic model we constructed can accurately predict OS in NSCLC patients. Two groups of low-risk immune pathways are beneficial to patients. Gefitinib metabolism was again validated to be related to cytochrome P450 and lipid metabolism. Finally, drugs that might be used to treat NSCLC patients were screened.",,295
2462,35966796,The influence of metabolic syndrome on age-related hearing loss from the perspective of mitochondrial dysfunction.,"With the increase in life expectancy in the global population, aging societies have emerged in many countries, including China. As a common sensory defect in the elderly population, the prevalence of age-related hearing loss and its influence on society are increasing yearly. Metabolic syndrome is currently one of the main health problems in the world. Many studies have demonstrated that metabolic syndrome and its components are correlated with a variety of age-related diseases of the peripheral sensory system, including age-related hearing loss. Both age-related hearing loss and metabolic syndrome are high-prevalence chronic diseases, and many people suffer from both at the same time. In recent years, more and more studies have found that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in both metabolic syndrome and age-related hearing loss. Therefore, to better understand the impact of metabolic syndrome on age-related hearing loss from the perspective of mitochondrial dysfunction, we reviewed the literature related to the relationship between age-related hearing loss and metabolic syndrome and their components to discern the possible role of mitochondria in both conditions.",,296
2430,35966866,13C-sucrose breath test for the non-invasive assessment of environmental enteropathy in Zambian adults.,"Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a subclinical disorder highly prevalent in tropical and disadvantaged populations and is thought to play a role in growth faltering in children, poor responses to oral vaccines, and micronutrient deficiencies. This study aims to evaluate the potential of a non-invasive breath test based on stable isotopes for evaluation of impaired digestion and absorption of sucrose in EE. We optimized a 13C-sucrose breath test (13C-SBT) in 19 young adults in Glasgow, United Kingdom. In a further experiment (in 18 adults) we validated the 13C-SBT using Reducose, an intestinal glucosidase inhibitor. We then compared the 13C-SBT to intestinal mucosal morphometry, immunostaining for sucrose-isomaltase (SI) expression, and SI activity in 24 Zambian adults with EE. Fully labeled sucrose (0.3 mg/kg) provided clear breath enrichment signals over 2-3 h in both British and Zambian adults, more than fivefold higher than naturally enriched sucrose. Reducose dramatically impaired 13C-sucrose digestion, reducing 4 h 13CO2 breath recovery by > 50%. Duodenal biopsies in Zambian adults confirmed the presence of EE, and SI immunostaining was present in 16/24 adults. The kinetics of 13CO2 evolution were consistently faster in participants with detectable SI immunostaining. Although sucrase activity was strongly correlated with villus height (r = 0.72; P < 0.05) after adjustment for age, sex and body mass index, there were no correlations between 13C-SBT and villus height or measured sucrase activity in pinch biopsies. A 13C-SBT was developed which was easy to perform, generated clear enrichment of 13CO2 in breath samples, and clearly reports sucrase activity. Further work is needed to validate it and understand its applications in evaluating EE.",,297
533,35978700,An Unexpected Deuterium-Induced Metabolic Switch in Doxophylline.,"Precision deuteration has become part of the medicinal chemist's toolbox, but its usefulness can be undermined by unpredictable metabolic switch effects. Herein we report the deuteration of doxophylline, a drug used in the treatment of asthma and COPD that undergoes extensive oxidative metabolism. Labeling of the main metabolic soft spots triggered an unexpected multidirectional metabolic switch that, while not improving the pharmacokinetic parameters, changed the metabolic scenario and, in turn, the pharmacodynamic features in two murine models of lung injury.",,298
1774,35967897,Time-Restricted Ketogenic Diet in Huntington's Disease: A Case Study.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. Substantial evidence implicates mitochondria dysfunction in brain and skeletal muscle in the pathogenesis of HD. Metabolic strategies, such as fasting and ketogenic diets, theoretically enhance brain and muscle metabolism and mitochondria function, which may improve the clinical symptoms of HD. We report the case of a 41-year-old man with progressive, deteriorating HD who pursued a time-restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD) for 48 weeks. Improvements were measured in his motor symptoms (52% improvement from baseline), activities of daily living (28% improvement), composite Unified HD Rating Scale (cUHDRS) score (20% improvement), HD-related behavior problems (apathy, disorientation, anger, and irritability improved by 50-100%), and mood-related quality of life (25% improvement). Cognition did not improve. Weight remained stable and there were no significant adverse effects. This case study is unique in that a patient with progressive, deteriorating HD was managed with a TRKD, with subsequent improvements in his motor symptoms, activities of daily living, cUHDRS score, most major HD-related behavior problems, and quality of life. Our patient remains dedicated to his TRKD, which continues to provide benefit for him and his family.",,299
264,35982562,Pesticide fate at watershed scale: A new framework integrating multimedia behavior with hydrological processes.,"Pesticide pollution has been one serious ecological and environmental issue due to its wide application, high toxicity, and complex environmental behavior. The fugacity model has been widely used to quantify biogeochemical cycles of pesticides due to its clear compartments, simple structure, and easy-accessible data. However, the lack of detailed hydrological processes limits its application for large and heterogeneous watershed. In present study, a new framework was proposed through integration of hydrological processes of SWAT and pesticide fate of fugacity model, and was applied into a typical watershed in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. The results showed that surface runoff, soil erosion, and percolation varied spatiotemporally, which highlighted the importance of considering regional and seasonal heterogeneity of pesticide transport variables in the fugacity model. The amount of dichlorvos (DDV) and chlorpyrifos (CHP) in air, water, soil, and sediment phase were estimated as 0.26 kg, 19.77 kg, 1.06 × 104 kg, and 0.55 kg, respectively. Spatiotemporally, pesticide concentrations in water phase peaked in summer, while the middle and southwest regions of the watershed were identified as the hotspots for pesticide pollution. Compared with the classical model, the new framework provided technical support for the pesticide assessment at watershed scale with heterogeneous hydrological conditions, which can be easily extended to other watersheds, and integrated with other models for comprehensive agricultural management.",,300
1634,35968143,The primary function of Six5 of Fusarium oxysporum is to facilitate Avr2 activity by together manipulating the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata.,"Pathogens produce effector proteins to manipulate their hosts. While most effectors act autonomously, some fungal effectors act in pairs and rely on each other for function. During the colonization of the plant vasculature, the root-infecting fungus Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) produces 14 so-called Secreted in Xylem (SIX) effectors. Two of these effector genes, Avr2 (Six3) and Six5, form a gene pair on the pathogenicity chromosome of the tomato-infecting Fo strain. Avr2 has been shown to suppress plant defense responses and is required for full pathogenicity. Although Six5 and Avr2 together manipulate the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata to facilitate cell-to-cell movement of Avr2, it is unclear whether Six5 has additional functions as well. To investigate the role of Six5, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing Six5. Notably, increased susceptibility during the early stages of infection was observed in these Six5 lines, but only to Fo strains expressing Avr2 and not to wild-type Arabidopsis-infecting Fo strains lacking this effector gene. Furthermore, neither PAMP-triggered defense responses, such as ROS accumulation and callose deposition upon treatment with Flg22, necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like protein (NLP), or chitosan, nor susceptibility to other plant pathogens, such as the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae or the fungus Verticilium dahlia, were affected by Six5 expression. Further investigation of the ability of the Avr2/Six5 effector pair to manipulate plasmodesmata (PD) revealed that it not only permits cell-to-cell movement of Avr2, but also facilitates the movement of two additional effectors, Six6 and Six8. Moreover, although Avr2/Six5 expands the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata (i.e., gating) to permit the movement of a 2xFP fusion protein (53 kDa), a larger variant, 3xFP protein (80 kDa), did not move to the neighboring cells. The PD manipulation mechanism employed by Avr2/Six5 did not involve alteration of callose homeostasis in these structures. In conclusion, the primary function of Six5 appears to function together with Avr2 to increase the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata by an unknown mechanism to facilitate cell-to-cell movement of Fo effectors.",,301
437,35979144,Adhesion-independent topography-based leukocyte migration.,"Cells need to couple intracellular actin flows with the substrate to generate forward movement. This has traditionally been studied in the context of specific transmembrane receptors, particularly integrin adhesion receptors, which link extracellular adhesive molecules to the actin cytoskeleton. However, leukocytes and other cells can also migrate using integrin-independent strategies both in vivo and in vitro, though the cellular and environmental requirements for this mode are not fully understood. In seminal recent work, Reversat et al.1 develop a range of innovative 2D and 3D engineered microdevices and probe the biophysical mechanisms underlying T lymphocytes and dendritic cells in conditions of limited substrate adhesion. They identify a physical principle of mechano-coupling between retrograde actin flow and irregular extracellular confinement, which allows the cell to generate mechanical resistance and move in the absence of receptor-mediated adhesion. Through the combined use of experiments and theoretical modeling, this work resolves a long-standing question in cell biology and establishes mechanical interaction with an irregular-shaped 3D environment which may be relevant to cell migration in a range of tissue contexts.",,302
1672,35968102,Endophytic and rhizospheric bacteria associated with Paspalum atratum and its potential for plant growth promotion with different phosphate sources.,"The genus Paspalum belongs to the family Poaceae and has several species that are native to Brazil. The Paspalum Germplasm Bank (GB) of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation comprises approximately 450 accessions from 50 species. Among these accessions, Paspalum atratum (BGP 308) has economic potential for forage purposes. However, the endophytic and rhizospheric microbial communities within this accession and their ability to promote plant growth remain unknown. The present study aimed to isolate the endophytic and rhizospheric bacteria associated with P. atratum and to assess their potential for plant growth improvement, so-called plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB). For the in vitro tests, the ability of nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB), phosphate solubilization (PS) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) production were evaluated. A total of 116 endophytic and rhizosphere bacteria were obtained from the isolation. In the in vitro tests, 43 (37.00%) of these isolates showed positive NFB, PS, and IAA results. These isolates were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing. The phosphate solubilization index (PSI) ranged from 2 to 3.61, all 43 strains performed biological nitrogen fixation and the IAA production ranged from 12.85 to 431.41 μg ml-1. Eight of these 43 isolates were evaluated in vivo in a greenhouse using P. atratum caryopsis. The pots were filled with soil prepared with three different phosphate sources and one control without phosphate. After growth, the plants were submitted to morphological, bromatological and chemical determination. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and principal component analysis (PCA). In the in vivo test, treatments 105 (Pseudomonas sp.) and 458 (Pseudomonas sp.) were the most significant for the crystalline phosphate source, 109 (Bacillus sp.) for the sedimentary phosphate source and, as for the soluble phosphate source most treatments that received bacterial isolates had higher phosphorus content in the dry matter than the uninoculated soluble phosphate control. The 105FCR (crystalline phosphate + Pseudomonas sp.), 109FSE (sedimentary phosphate + Bacillus sp.), and 110 FSE (sedimentary phosphate + Enterobacter sp.) treatments showed the best results for plant growth promotion. This work made it possible to determine the bacterial community associated with P. atratum (BGP308) and to obtain new potential plant growth-promoting strains.",,303
1561,35968325,Different effect of obesity and metabolic syndrome on prostate cancer by age group.,"Substantial evidence supports that metabolic syndrome (MetS) affects the incidence of several cancers, with different effects according to age group. We hypothesized that MetS has an age-specific effect on the occurrence of prostate cancer. We studied a National Health Insurance Service health checkup cohort. A total of 5,370,614 men in the cohort were categorized into three age groups in 2009 (20-39, 40-64, ≥65). Prostate cancer incidence was estimated on a cumulative basis from 2009 to 2018. We tried to identify the correlation of MetS components and prostate cancer by age group using this large retrospective cohort. MetS components included the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, smoking, drinking, serum glucose, serum total cholesterol, serum triglyceride, serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used for the incidence of prostate cancer according to the MetS component. In the young age (20-39) group, the MetS component was not related to prostate cancer. In the middle-aged (40-64) group, the presence of MetS, WC, HDL cholesterol, and hypertension was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of prostate cancer. In the old age (≥65) group, the presence of MetS, WC, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hypertension were significant factors for the incidence of prostate cancer. This tendency was marked in BMI>30 in the old age group (odds ratio: 1.32; P<0.0001). MetS components were age-specifically associated with an increased incidence of prostate cancer. Because the MetS components were related to prostate cancer from middle age to old age, preventing MetS for these age groups is crucial.",,304
1630,35968148,Improved physiological and morphological traits of root synergistically enhanced salinity tolerance in rice under appropriate nitrogen application rate.,"Numerous papers studied the relations between nitrogen rate and rice yield in saline soils, whereas the rice root morphological and physiological characteristics mediating nitrogen rates in yield formation under varied salinity levels remain less concerns. Through a field experiment applied with five nitrogen rates (0, 210, 255, 300, 345, and 390 kg ha-1) in saline land, we found that rice yield peaked at 7.7 t ha-1 under 300 kg ha-1 nitrogen, and excessive N was not conductive for increasing yield. To further elucidate its internal physiological mechanism, a pot experiment was designed with three N rates (210 [N1], 300 [N2], 390 [N3] kg ha-1) and three salt concentrations (0 [S0], 1.5 [S1], 3.0 [S2] g kg-1 NaCl). Results showed that the average grain yield was decreased by 19.1 and 51.1% under S1 and S2, respectively, while notably increased by 18.5 and 14.5% under N2 and N3, respectively. Salinity stress significantly inhibited root biomass, root length and surface area, root oxidation capacity (ROC), K+ and K+/Na+ ratio, and nitrogen metabolism-related enzyme activities, whereas root Na+ and antioxidant enzyme activities were notably increased. The mechanism of how insufficient N supply (N1) affected rice yield formation was consistent at different salinity levels, which displayed adverse impacts on root morphological and physiological traits, thereby significantly inhibiting leaf photosynthesis and grain yield of rice. However, the mechanism thorough which excessive N (N3) affected yield formation was quite different under varied salinity levels. Under lower salinity (S0 and S1), no significant differences on root morphological traits and grain yield were observed except the significantly decline in activities of NR and GS between N3 and N2 treatments. Under higher salinity level (S2), the decreased ROC, K+/Na+ ratio due to increased Na+, antioxidant enzyme activities, and NR and GS activities were the main reason leading to undesirable root morphological traits and leaf photosynthesis, which further triggered decreased grain yield under N3 treatment, compared to that under N2 treatment. Overall, our results suggest that improved physiological and morphological traits of root synergistically enhanced salinity tolerance in rice under appropriate nitrogen application rate.",,305

2289,35967142,The Meaning of Lymphadenopathies During Adjuvant Durvalumab After Chemoradiotherapy for Lung Cancer: Thinking Beyond Disease Progression.,"Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become the mainstay of treatment for many malignancies. With this new strategy, relevant immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have been reported, some of which can be mistaken for disease progression. To better illustrate the current challenges in diagnosing and managing a patient under adjuvant ICI treatment, we present the case of a 67-year-old female patient with stage IIIB unresectable, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated, non-small-cell lung cancer who was initially treated with chemoradiotherapy, followed by immunotherapy with durvalumab. During the course of immunotherapy, the patient presented with madarosis and erythematous and endured skin lesions, in addition to lymphadenopathies and pulmonary infiltrates. She was started on first-line palliative treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. After reviewing the case, a multidisciplinary team meeting suggested diagnostic procedures, including a transbronchial needle aspiration from mediastinal lymph nodes. The histologic examination showed chronic systemic inflammation and non-caseating granulomas of the sarcoid type. In this case, palliative treatment was suspended and systemic therapy with prednisolone was initiated. The patient became asymptomatic and the previously observed radiologic abnormalities resolved. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and appropriate treatment of irAEs, mainly because these conditions remain poorly understood and are probably underdiagnosed. Considering differential diagnosis is paramount to guide clinical management, despite curative or palliative treatment intent.",,307
62,35983467,"An Anti-Interleukin-17A Monoclonal Antibody, Ixekizumab, in the Treatment of Resistant Hidradenitis Suppurativa: A Case Series.","Although adalimumab is the only approved biologic for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), the treatment response may not be satisfactory in all patients. Recently, many other biological agents, including interleukin 17 inhibitors such as ixekizumab, have shown promise. Five severe HS (Hurley stage III) patients resistant to conventional treatments and adalimumab for at least 3 months were recruited. Patients were prescribed ixekizumab with a scheme approved for psoriasis (160 mg once, followed by 80 mg at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.) The primary outcome measure was achieving the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) score following 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included the patient-reported Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and visual analog scale (VAS). Four of 5 patients (80%) achieved HiSCR. While improvement was observed in the VAS and DLQI scores of 4 patients, the decline was limited in 1 patient. No adverse event was recorded related to ixekizumab. The result of our observation suggests that ixekizumab may be effective for HS, especially in challenging cases.",,308
1824,35967816,The effect of intravenous vitamin C on clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis or septic shock: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Vitamin C deficiency is common among patients with sepsis and has been associated with poor clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, the effect of intravenous (IV) vitamin C for the treatment of sepsis remains controversial. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of IV vitamin C in patients with sepsis or septic shock. Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) were searched from inception through May 25, 2022 for randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of IV vitamin C treatment in patients with sepsis. The primary outcome was short-term mortality, and secondary outcomes including the duration of vasopressor, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score after vitamin C treatment. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the type of disease, dose and duration of IV vitamin C. A total of 10 studies were included, with a total sample of 755 septic patients. The IV vitamin C was associated with a significant reduction in the short-term mortality (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37-0.69, I 2 = 0%) and duration of vasopressor (MD -27.88, 95% CI -49.84 to -5.92, I 2 = 95%). The length of ICU stay (MD -0.68, 95% CI -2.13 to 0.78, I 2 = 74%) and SOFA score (MD -0.05, 95% CI -1.69 to 1.58, I 2 = 86%) were not significantly different between two groups. In patients with sepsis or septic shock, the IV vitamin C reduced the short-term mortality rate and duration of vasopressor, with no effect on the length of ICU stay and SOFA score. Further trials are required to explore the optimal dosage and duration of IV vitamin C. https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2022-6-0013/, identifier INPLASY202260013.",,309
1177,35973328,Torcular Dural Sinus Malformation: Fetal and Postnatal Imaging Findings and Their Associations With Clinical Outcomes.,"Torcular dural sinus malformations (tDSMs) are rare vascular malformations that present in fetuses and infants. Existing data on prognostic imaging features, as well as the associated morbidity and mortality, are limited and variable. We therefore reviewed cases of tDSMs diagnosed on fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at our referral center to identify pre- and postnatal MRI imaging features associated with long-term outcomes. We searched our imaging database for fetal and postnatal MRI reports of tDSM cases. The electronic medical record was then reviewed for pre- and postnatal clinical data, including follow-up imaging. Neurological outcomes were characterized using the previously reported scale based on the Bicêtre Score. Imaging features association with outcome scores were compared using the Fisher exact test. Sixteen cases of tDMS diagnosed by fetal MRI with postnatal clinical follow-up were identified, 11 of whom underwent postnatal MRI. The majority of cases of tDSM (73%) decreased in size or resolved on postnatal follow-up study without treatment. Restricted diffusion and parenchymal hemorrhage on fetal MRI were the only imaging features identified significantly associated with unfavorable neurological outcome or death, present in two patients with poor outcomes (two of two) and only one with a normal outcome (one of 14) (P = 0.025). Findings of tDSM on fetal MRI most often regress and/or resolve with normal or mild neurological outcomes, with the most significant predictor of poor outcome being the presence of parenchymal injury on fetal MRI. In addition, a subset will present with venolymphatic malformations.",,310
1814,35967841,Malproduction of endogenous hydrogen gas in COVID-19.,"The molecular footprints of COVID-19 occur everywhere, even reaching the family of biologically active gases and gasotransmitters. Besides nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide, COVID-19 might also alter the homeostasis of dihydrogen (H2), another gaseous bioactive molecule produced endogenously by the human gut bacteria. Many studies have shown various alterations of the gut microbiota in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, including the lower abundance of hydrogen-producing bacteria that could instigate the shortage of hydrogen output. Since dihydrogen has many important bioactivities, including cytoprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic, its malproduction in COVID-19 might contribute to the disease progression and severity. On the other hand, replenishing dihydrogen by exogenous administration could be beneficial in COVID-19 for both patient- and clinical-reported outcomes. Assessing low dihydrogen along with H2 supplementation to restore normal levels could be thus combined via theranostic approaches to aid COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment.",,311
725,35975158,All-in-one disulfide bridging enables the generation of antibody conjugates with modular cargo loading.,"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are valuable therapeutic entities which leverage the specificity of antibodies to selectively deliver cytotoxins to antigen-expressing targets such as cancer cells. However, current methods for their construction still suffer from a number of shortcomings. For instance, using a single modification technology to modulate the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) in integer increments while maintaining homogeneity and stability remains exceptionally challenging. Herein, we report a novel method for the generation of antibody conjugates with modular cargo loading from native antibodies. Our approach relies on a new class of disulfide rebridging linkers, which can react with eight cysteine residues, thereby effecting all-in-one bridging of all four interchain disulfides in an IgG1 antibody with a single linker molecule. Modification of the antibody with the linker in a 1 : 1 ratio enabled the modulation of cargo loading in a quick and selective manner through derivatization of the linker with varying numbers of payload attachment handles to allow for attachment of either 1, 2, 3 or 4 payloads (fluorescent dyes or cytotoxins). Assessment of the biological activity of these conjugates demonstrated their exceptional stability in human plasma and utility for cell-selective cytotoxin delivery or imaging/diagnostic applications.",,312
1497,35968390,"Vitamin D serum level predicts stroke clinical severity, functional independence, and disability-A retrospective cohort study.","Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability and one of the most common neurological conditions globally. Many studies focused on vitamin D as a stroke risk factor, but only a few focused on its serum level as a predictor of stroke initial clinical severity and recovery with inconsistent results. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between serum vitamin D levels and stroke clinical severity at admission and functional independence and disability at discharge in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective cohort study of adult ischemic stroke patients who had their vitamin D tested and admitted within 7 days of exhibiting stroke symptoms at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Based on vitamin D level, the patients were categorized into normal [25(OH)D serum level ≥ 75 nmol/L], insufficient [25(OH)D serum level is 50-75 nmol/L], and deficient [25(OH)D serum level ≤ 50 nmol/L]. The primary outcome was to assess the vitamin D serum level of ischemic stroke patients' clinical severity at admission and functional independence at discharge. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was used to assess the clinical severity, whereas the modified Rankin scale (mRS) was used to assess functional independence and disability. The study included 294 stroke patients, out of 774, who were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean age of the participants was 68.2 ± 13.4 years, and 49.3% were male. The patients' distribution among the three groups based on their vitamin D levels is: normal (n = 35, 11.9%), insufficient (n = 66, 22.5%), and deficient (n = 196, 65.6%). After adjusting for potential covariates, regression analysis found a significant inverse relationship of NIHSS based on 25(OH)D serum level (beta coefficient: -0.04, SE: 0.01, p = 0.003). Patients with deficient serum vitamin D level also had significantly higher odds of worse functional independence in mRS score [OR: 2.41, 95%CI: (1.13-5.16), p = 0.023] when compared to participants with normal vitamin D level. Low vitamin D levels were associated with higher severity of stroke at admission and poor functional independence and disability at discharge in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Further randomized clinical and interventional studies are required to confirm our findings.",,313
1421,35968480,Assessment of combined exposure to intermediate-frequency electromagnetic fields and pulsed electromagnetic fields among library workers in Japan.,"To assess exposure levels to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) among library workers in Japan, focusing on co-exposure to intermediate-frequency EMF (IF-EMF) and pulsed EMF, to propose a new epidemiological research methodology. The evaluated exposure sources were an electromagnetic type-electronic article surveillance gate (EM-EAS, IF-EMF (operating frequency 220 Hz-14 kHz)) and an activator/deactivator of anti-theft tags termed as book check unit (BCU, pulsed EMF). Short-term exposures were: (E1) whole-body exposure from the EAS gate when sitting within 3 m; (E2) local exposure to transient IF-EMF while passing through or beside the EAS gate; and (E3) local exposure to a pulsed magnetic field on BCU use. E1-E3 were evaluated based on exposure levels relative to magnetic flux density at the occupational reference level (RL; E1) or as per occupational basic restrictions (BR; E2 and E3) delineated by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) 2010 guidelines. Exposure indices based on mid-term exposure (D1-D3), assuming exposure according to employment on a weekly basis, were used to assess exposure in actual working conditions. D1 represents continuous exposure from an EAS gate when sitting within 3 m of the gate. D2 and D3 represent repeated transient exposures occurring during gate pass or on the operation of a BCU. A link to a web-based questionnaire was distributed to librarians working at all libraries where the authors had mailed institutional questionnaires (4,073 libraries). Four exposure patterns were defined according to various exposure scenarios. We obtained information on exposure parameters and working conditions from the 548 completed questionnaires. The ICNIRP guideline levels were not exceeded in any of the E1-E3 scenarios. Median of the D1 (% ICNIRP RL × hour/week) was 1, and >85% respondents had values <10. However, the maximum value was 513. Altogether, these results indicate that continuous exposure was low in most cases. The same tendency was observed regarding repeated transient exposure from EM-EAS gates (i.e., the median value for D2 (% ICNIRP BR × gate pass) was 5). However, there were several cases in which D1 and D2 values were >10 times the median. The median of D3 (% ICNIRP BR × BCU operation) was 10, and most respondents' D3 values were greater than their D2 values, although the derived results depended on the assumptions made for the estimation. We conducted an assessment of combined exposures to IF-EMF and pulsed EMF among library workers in Japan by evaluating both short-term exposures (E1-E3) and exposure indices based on mid-term exposures (D1-D3) assuming actual working conditions per questionnaire results. These results provide useful information for future epidemiological studies.",,314
228,35982792,Susceptibility to the common cold virus is associated with day length.,"Seasonal rhythms are endogenous timing mechanisms that allow animals living at temperate latitudes to synchronize their physiology to the seasons. Human viral respiratory disease is prevalent in the winter at temperate latitudes, but the role of endogenous mechanisms in these recurring annual patterns is unclear. The Common Cold Project is a repository of data describing the experimental viral challenge of 1,337 participants across the seasons of the year. We report a secondary analysis of these data to investigate if susceptibility to the common cold is associated with day length. The majority of the participants (78%) showed signs of infection but only 32% developed clinical signs of disease, and the probability of infection was significantly higher in longer day lengths (summer), but the disease was more likely in short (winter) day lengths. The persistence of winter disease patterns in experimental conditions supports the role of endogenous seasonality in human susceptibility to viral infection.",,315
1889,35967721,"Three tests of the Vulnerability-Stress-Adaptation Model: Independent prediction, mediation, and generalizability.","Efforts to understand why some marriages thrive while others falter are (a) not well integrated conceptually and (b) rely heavily on data collected from White middle-class samples. The Vulnerability-Stress-Adaptation Model (VSA; Karney and Bradbury, 1995) is used here to integrate prior efforts and is tested using data collected from couples living with low incomes. The VSA Model assumes (a) that enduring vulnerabilities, stress, and couple communication account for unique variance in relationship satisfaction, (b) that communication mediates the effects of vulnerabilities and stress on satisfaction, and (c) that the predictors of satisfaction generalize across socioeconomic levels. To date, these assumptions remain untested. With 388 couples from diverse backgrounds (88% Black or Hispanic), we used latent variable structural equation models to examine enduring vulnerabilities, chronic stress, and observed communication as predictors of 4-wave, 27-month satisfaction trajectories, first as main effects and then interacting with a validated 10-item index of sociodemographic risk. (a) The three variable sets independently predict satisfaction trajectories; (b) couple communication does not mediate the effects of enduring vulnerabilities or stress on satisfaction; and (c) in 19% of tests, effects were stronger among couples with higher sociodemographic risk. Effects of established predictor domains on satisfaction replicate in a diverse sample of newlywed couples, and most findings generalize across levels of sociodemographic risk. The failure of couple communication to mediate effects of enduring personal vulnerabilities and stress raises new questions about how these two domains undermine committed partnerships.",,316
745,35975100,Novel ACTN2 missense variant is associated with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation: a case report.,"Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a diagnosis of exclusion made in patients who experience VF without an attributable cause. Pathogenic variants of the ACTN2 gene encoding the sarcomeric protein alpha-actinin-2 are known to cause hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. We show that ACTN2 variants may also be associated with malignant arrhythmias in the absence of overt structural heart disease. A 48-year-old female presented with cardiac arrest due to VF without any history of cardiovascular disease or family history of sudden cardiac death. Troponin I was elevated at 0.698 ng/mL, but coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease. Substance abuse testing showed elevated benzodiazepine and sertraline levels, which she was taking for anxiety. Electrocardiogram showed normal QRS complexes without prolonged PR or QTc intervals. She underwent therapeutic hypothermia. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 2 weeks showed normal biventricular function without structural abnormalities, fibrosis, or evidence of myocardial infarction. A targeted gene panel revealed a heterozygous missense variant of unknown significance (VUS) in exon 18 of the ACTN2 gene (c.2162G > A/p.R721H). The identified VUS is located in a highly conserved residue of a spectrin-like repeat domain of alpha-actinin-2. Spectrin-like domains of alpha-actinin-2 bind and regulate the ion channels Nav1.5, Kv1.4, and Kv1.5, which contribute to the myocardial action potential. The VUS was predicted as pathogenic by MutationTaster, Polymorphism Phenotyping v2, and Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant in silico missense prediction tools. The c.2162G > A/p.R721H alpha-actinin-2 variant may result in dysregulation of cardiac ion channels, leading to arrhythmias.",,317
614,35977785,The Mismatch between Range and Niche Limits due to Source-Sink Dynamics Can Be Greater than Species Mean Dispersal Distance.,"AbstractSpecies distribution models assume that at broad spatial scales, environmental conditions determine species ranges and, as such, source-sink dynamics can be ignored. A rationale behind this assumption is that source-sink dynamics manifest at length scales comparable to species mean dispersal distance, which is much smaller than length scales of species distribution and variation in climate. Using a two-dimensional reaction-diffusion model, we show that species can use sink habitats near the niche limit as stepping-stones to occupy sink habitats much further than the mean dispersal distance, thereby extending the distribution far beyond the environmental niche limit. This mismatch between range and niche limits is mediated by the shape (local curvature) of the niche limit. These curvature effects may be significant for a highly dispersive species with low per capita growth rate sensitivity to changes in the environment. These findings underscore the potential importance of stepping-stone dispersal in determining range limits.",,318
842,35974929,Effect of metformin on the eradication of H.Pylori infection in 25 -75 years old patients referring Loghman Hakim Hospital.,"Various ways of treating H.pylori infection are reported, such as triple-therapy and quadruple therapy for two weeks. Some side effects have been seen during these treatments, besides Helicobacter pylori becoming resistant to these antibiotics easily. According to some studies, there is a relationship between metformin and reduction in Helicobacter pylori infection. Thus, in this study, we determine the effects of metformin on Helicobacter pylori infection. We performed this assessment in a randomized, case-controlled way in the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infected outpatients and inpatients. In both groups (case group and control group), patients took two tablets for a two-week period. In the case group, the patients were given two metformin tablets (each containing 500mg of metformin (extended release) and in the control group, they were given two placebo tablets (each containing 500mg of white flour). We took h.pylori Ag stool test and rapid urease test to confirm the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. In this study, at first all the patients had positive h.pylori Ag stool test or positive rapid urease test. At the end of this study, the results of h.pylori Ag stool*- test presented that Helicobacter pylori infection was negative in 82.7% of the case group patients and 76% of control group patients which illustrates suppression of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, comparing to the control group (P=0.36), this difference was not statistically remarkable. According to these findings, it is stated that having metformin along with prescribed antibiotics can help decrease Helicobacter pylori infection.",,319
1145,35973821,Retroperitoneal fibrosis - diagnosis and treatment.,"Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (IRF) is a rare condition characterized by the development of a peri-aortic and peri-iliac tissue showing chronic inflammatory infiltrates and pronounced fibrosis. Ureteral entrapment with consequent obstructive uropathy is one of the most common complications which can lead to acute renal failure and, in the long term, to varying degrees of chronic kidney disease. Common symptoms at onset include lower back, abdominal or flank pain. Pain is frequently referred to the hip, to the groin and to the lateral regions of the leg, often with nocturnal exacerbations and not responding to position changes. The disease is commonly associated with signs of systemic inflammatory response (malaise, fever, and anorexia and weight loss). Glucocorticoids are considered the cornerstone of the therapy. The use of other immunosuppressive agents, including cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and biological agents such as rituximab, tocilizumab and infliximab have been reported as a valuable option mostly in case reports, cases series and small studies. These agents allowed to reduce cumulative dose of glucocorticoids and their adverse effects. Combined therapy is preferable for all patients who suffer from significant glucocorticoid- related toxicity or in cases where glucocorticoids alone are insufficient to treat the condition.",,320
1911,35967698,An artificial intelligence method for comprehensive evaluation of preschool education quality.,"The evolution in the quality of teaching for preschool education is worth studying. In this article, we solved the qualitative problems in the comprehensive quality evaluation by suggesting a method of quantitative combination and establishing a set of indicators suitable for the comprehensive quality evaluation of students in the kindergarten. According to the experience summed up by previous scholars, the weight of each index is obtained by an analytic hierarchy process. This study analyzed the defects and causes of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and the neural network model in the construction of early childhood and preschool education's comprehensive quality evaluation model and propose a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) model. FNN combined with neural network (NN) and fuzzy logic characteristics introduces fuzzy concepts and fuzzy inference rules into neural networks of neurons, the connection power, and network learning. It improves the learning ability of NN and fuzzy evaluation of the power of expression and effectively exerts the advantages of fuzzy logic and neural network to make up for their shortcomings. However, the convergence speed is very slow. To solve this problem, the similarity measure was used to improve the number of hidden layer nodes of the network. The effectiveness and feasibility of the FNN improved hidden layer nodes are verified by an example so as to realize the automation of comprehensive quality evaluation.",,321
2323,35967055,Response Surface Methodology for Optimization of Operational Parameters To Remove Ciprofloxacin from Contaminated Water in the Presence of a Bacterial Consortium.,"Ciprofloxacin (CFX) is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is widely used to treat bacterial infections in humans and other animals. However, its unwanted occurrence in any (eco)system can affect nontarget bacterial communities, which may also impair the performance of the natural or artificially established bioremediation system. The problem could be minimized by optimization of operational parameters via modeling of multifactorial tests. To this end, we used a Box-Behnken design in response surface methodology (RSM) to generate the experimental layout for testing the effect of the CFX biodegradation for four important parameters, that is, temperature (°C), pH, inoculum size (v/v %), and CFX concentration (mg L-1). For inoculation, a consortium of three bacterial strains, namely, Acenitobacter lwofii ACRH76, Bacillus pumilus C2A1, and Mesorihizobium sp. HN3 was used to degrade 26 mg L-1 of CFX. We found maximum degradation of CFX (98.97%; initial concentration of 25 mg L-1) at 2% inoculum size, 7 pH, and 35 °C of temperature in 16 days. However, minimum degradation of CFX (48%; initial concentration of 50 mg L-1) was found at pH 6, temperature 30 °C, and inoculum size 1%. Among different tested parameters, pH appears to be the main limiting factor for CFX degradation. Independent factors attributed 89.37% of variation toward CFX degradation as revealed by the value of the determination coefficient, that is, R 2 = 0.8937. These results were used to formulate a mathematical model in which the computational data strongly correlated with the experimental results. This study showcases the importance of parameter optimization via RSM for any bioremediation studies particularly for antibiotics in an economical, harmless, and eco-friendly manner.",,322
2312,35967067,Toward the Development of GE11-Based Radioligands for Imaging of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Positive Tumors.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is closely associated with tumor development and progression and thus an important target structure for imaging and therapy of various tumors. As a result of its important role in malignancies of various origins and the fact that antibody-based compounds targeting the EGFR have significant drawbacks in terms of in vivo pharmacokinetics, several attempts have been made within the last five years to develop peptide-based EGFR-specific radioligands based on the GE11 scaffold. However, none of these approaches have shown convincing results so far, which has been proposed to be attributed to different potential challenges associated with the GE11 lead structure: first, an aggregation of radiolabeled peptides, which might prevent their interaction with their target receptor, or second, a relatively low affinity of monomeric GE11, necessitating its conversion into a multimeric or polymeric form to achieve adequate EGFR-targeting properties. In the present work, we investigated if these aforementioned points are indeed critical and if the EGFR-targeting ability of GE11 can be improved by choosing an appropriate hydrophilic molecular design or a peptide multimer system to obtain a promising radiopeptide for the visualization of EGFR-overexpressing malignancies by positron emission tomography (PET). For this purpose, we developed several monovalent 68Ga-labeled GE11-based agents, a peptide homodimer and a homotetramer to overcome the challenges associated with GE11. The developed ligands were successfully labeled with 68Ga3+ in high radiochemical yields of ≥97% and molar activities of 41-104 GBq/μmol. The resulting radiotracers presented log D(7.4) values between -2.17 ± 0.21 and -3.79 ± 0.04 as well as a good stability in human serum with serum half-lives of 112 to 217 min for the monovalent radiopeptides and 84 and 62 min for the GE11 homodimer and homotetramer, respectively. In the following in vitro studies, none of the 68Ga-labeled radiopeptides demonstrated a considerable EGF receptor-specific uptake in EGFR-positive A431 cells. Moreover, none of the agents was able to displace [125I]I-EGF from the EGFR in competitive displacement assays in the same cell line in concentrations of up to 1 mM, whereas the endogenous receptor ligand hEGF demonstrated a high affinity of 15.2 ± 3.3 nM. These results indicate that it is not the aggregation of the GE11 sequence that seems to be the factor limiting the usefulness of the peptide as basis for radiotracer design but the limited affinity of monovalent and small homomultivalent GE11-based radiotracers to the EGFR. This highlights that the development of small-molecule GE11-based radioligands is not promising.",,323
1535,35968351,The functions and prognostic values of chemokine and chemokine receptors in gastric cancer.,"Chemokine and chemokine receptors (CCRs) play a significant role in tumor infiltration of immune cells, tumor angiogenesis and distant metastasis. In this study, we explored the importance of CCRs in gastric cancer (GC) by analyzing the datasets from TCGA database. First, we analyzed the characteristics of the CCRs mutations. Then, we screened the differentially expressed CCRs and performed GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway analyses to explore their potential biological functions. Using multivariate Cox regression analyses, we constructed a prediction model based on four-CCRs (CCL15, CCL21, CCR3 and ACKR3) signature, and we found that the risk score of the model was an independent prognostic factor of GC. Next, a nomogram was constructed to assess the prognosis of GC patients. GSEA indicated that the high-risk group was significantly enriched in immune response and immune system process. Moreover, GSVA was employed to investigate the up- and down-regulated signaling pathways in the high- and low-risk groups. The correlation between risk score and immune-cell infiltration indicated that the four-CCRs signature might play a pivotal role in GC immune microenvironment. In conclusion, we revealed the potential molecular mechanisms of CCRs in GC and constructed a prediction model which might guide personalized treatment and prognosis for GC patients.",,324
1521,35968365,Neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying estrogen positive feedback and the LH surge.,"A fundamental principle in reproductive neuroendocrinology is sex steroid feedback: steroid hormones secreted by the gonads circulate back to the brain to regulate the neural circuits governing the reproductive neuroendocrine axis. These regulatory feedback loops ultimately act to modulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, thereby affecting gonadotropin secretion from the anterior pituitary. In females, rising estradiol (E2) during the middle of the menstrual (or estrous) cycle paradoxically switch from being inhibitory on GnRH secretion (negative feedback) to stimulating GnRH release (positive feedback), resulting in a surge in GnRH secretion and a downstream LH surge that triggers ovulation. While upstream neural afferents of GnRH neurons, including kisspeptin neurons in the rostral hypothalamus, are proposed as critical loci of E2 feedback action, the underlying mechanisms governing the shift between E2 negative and positive feedback are still poorly understood. Indeed, the precise cell targets, neural signaling factors and receptors, hormonal pathways, and molecular mechanisms by which ovarian-derived E2 indirectly stimulates GnRH surge secretion remain incompletely known. In many species, there is also a circadian component to the LH surge, restricting its occurrence to specific times of day, but how the circadian clock interacts with endocrine signals to ultimately time LH surge generation also remains a major gap in knowledge. Here, we focus on classic and recent data from rodent models and discuss the consensus knowledge of the neural players, including kisspeptin, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and glia, as well as endocrine players, including estradiol and progesterone, in the complex regulation and generation of E2-induced LH surges in females.",,325
379,35979295,Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor non responses in an adult with a history of coronary revascularization: A case report.,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by severely increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. At the same time, elevated LDL levels accelerated the development of coronary heart disease. Several classes of drugs are currently in use to treat FH. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) is novel one of these. This manuscript reports a case of FH that responded modestly after treatment with PCSK9i and statin drugs. Of even more concern is that the patient frequently admitted to the hospital during a 12-year follow-up period. Subsequently, we identified a heterozygous mutation, 1448G>A (W483X) of the LDL receptor (LDLR) in this patient. The serum levels of PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) in the patient was 71.30 ± 26.66 ng/mL, which is close the average level reported in the literature. This LDLR mutation affects LDLR metabolism or structure, which may make it unsuitable for use of PCSK9i. Our outcome demonstrates that LDLR-W483X represents a partial loss-of-function LDLR and may contribute to PCSK9i ineffective. In the meanwhile, additional measures are therefore required (particularly with gene sequencing or change the treatment plan) must be initiated as early as possible. Genetic testing for clinically challenging cases who do not respond to PCSK9i therapy is very helpful.",,326
980,35974639,Collective dynamics of liquid sulfur scrutinized over three decades in frequency.,"Liquid sulfur consists mainly of eight-membered rings and hence can be regarded as a model of a molecular liquid. A liquid, which is built from different molecular structures, will demonstrate a wide range in relaxation processes and excitation modes. Three inelastic neutron scattering experiments have been performed to study the collective dynamics of liquid sulfur over three decades in frequencies. A wide range of wave vectors was studied to reveal the response of density fluctuations over different lengthscales. A viscoelastic model with a two-times memory function was applied to the data. The analysis revealed a slow relaxation mode, an acoustic-type excitation, and a high-frequency mode, which resembles an optic-type excitation. The wave-vector dependence of the slow relaxation mode width exhibits the signs of a de Gennes narrowing around the wave vector where the structure factor has a shoulder. This slow relaxation process could be related to diffusive particle movements. The acoustic-type modes evidence a viscoelastic reaction with a 50% enhancement of the sound velocity. This enhancement of the sound velocity and the spectral line shape is qualitatively similar to spectra of molecular liquids. The two relaxation times of the memory function are separated by about two orders of magnitude and underpin the need for a wide frequency range investigation of this complex liquid. The high-frequency response can be interpreted as optic-type modes in the liquid.",,327
304,35980778,Longitudinal relationship between posttraumatic stress symptoms and physical symptoms in military veterans.,"To assess the temporal relationship of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and physical symptoms in a non-treatment seeking deployed military sample. Data were from a longitudinal study of Australian Defence Force personnel deployed to the Middle East Area of Operations between 2010 and 2012 (N = 1871). Pre-deployment assessment was conducted 4 months prior to deployment (T1). Of these, 1324 (70.8% retention rate) participated in assessment within 4 months of post-deployment (T2), and 1122 (60.0%) completed the third time point at 4 years post-deployment (T3). PTSD symptoms were assessed with the posttraumatic stress checklist and Physical symptoms with a 67-item self-report health symptom checklist (HSC). To explore directional influences between symptoms over time, longitudinal cross-lagged association between the modelled latent factors for PTSD symptoms and physical symptoms were estimated using structural equation modelling. From T1 to T2 there was a significant bidirectional effect with higher physical symptom count at T1 predicting higher PTSD symptom severity at T2 (β = 0.17 p < .001), and higher PTSD symptom severity at T1 predicting higher physical symptom count at T2 (β = 0.13 p < .001). The effect of T2 on T3 was unidirectional. PTSD symptom severity at T2 had no effect on physical symptom count at T3, but physical symptom count at T2 predicted an increase in PTSD symptom severity at T3 (β = 0.11 p = .013). Considering early physical symptoms and their physiological underpinnings following traumatic exposures could help identify those at risk of later PTSD.",,328
1348,35969700,Functions of somatic cells for spermatogenesis in stallions.,"Spermatogenesis and testis development are highly structured physiological processes responsible for post-pubertal fertility in stallions. Spermatogenesis comprises spermatocytogenesis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. Although germ cell degeneration is a continuous process, its effects are more pronounced during spermatocytogenesis and meiosis. The productivity and efficiency of spermatogenesis are directly linked to pubertal development, degenerated germ cell populations, aging, nutrition, and season of the year in stallions. The multiplex interplay of germ cells with somatic cells, endocrine and paracrine factors, growth factors, and signaling molecules contributes to the regulation of spermatogenesis. A cell-to-cell communication within the testes of these factors is a fundamental requirement of normal spermatogenesis. A noteworthy development has been made recently on discovering the effects of different somatic cells including Leydig, Sertoli, and peritubular myoid cells on manipulation the fate of spermatogonial stem cells. In this review, we discuss the self-renewal, differentiation, and apoptotic roles of somatic cells and the relationship between somatic and germ cells during normal spermatogenesis. We also summarize the roles of different growth factors, their paracrine/endocrine/autocrine pathways, and the different cytokines associated with spermatogenesis. Furthermore, we highlight important matters for further studies on the regulation of spermatogenesis. This review presents an insight into the mechanism of spermatogenesis, and helpful in developing better understanding of the functions of somatic cells, particularly in stallions and would offer new research goals for developing curative techniques to address infertility/subfertility in stallions.",,329
994,35974625,Group formation and collective motion of colloidal rods with an activity triggered by visual perception.,"We investigate the formation of cohesive groups and the collective diffusion of colloidal spherocylinders with a motility driven by a simple visual perception model. For this, we perform Brownian dynamics simulations without hydrodynamic interactions. The visual perception is based on sight cones attached to the spherocylinders and perception functions quantifying the visual stimuli. If the perception function of a particle reaches a predefined threshold, an active component is added to its motion. We find that, in addition to the opening angle of the cone of sight, the aspect ratio of the particles plays an important role for the formation of cohesive groups. If the elongation of the particles is increased, the maximum angle for which the rods organize themselves into such groups decreases distinctly. After a system forms a cohesive group, it performs a diffusive motion, which can be quantified by an effective diffusion coefficient. For increasing aspect ratios, the spatial expansion of the cohesive groups and the effective diffusion coefficient of the collective motion increase, while the number of active group members decreases. We also find that a larger particle number, a smaller propulsion velocity of the group members, and a smaller threshold for the visual stimulus increase the maximum opening angle for which cohesive groups form. Based on our results, we expect anisotropic particles to be of great relevance for the adjustability of visual perception-dependent motility.",,330
1623,35968193,Extreme-Ultraviolet Excited Scintillation of Methylammonium Lead Bromide Perovskites.,"Inorganic-Organic lead halide materials have been recognized as potential high-energy X-ray detectors because of their high quantum efficiencies and radiation hardness. Surprisingly little is known about whether the same is true for extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) radiation, despite applications in nuclear fusion research and astrophysics. We used a table-top high-harmonic generation setup in the XUV range between 20 and 45 eV to photoexcite methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) and measure its scintillation properties. The strong absorbance combined with multiple carriers being excited per photon yield a very high carrier density at the surface, triggering photobleaching reactions that rapidly reduce the emission intensity. Concurrent to and in spite of this photobleaching, a recovery of the emission intensity as a function of dose was observed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements of XUV-exposed and unexposed areas show that this recovery is caused by XUV-induced oxidation of MAPbBr3, which removes trap states that normally quench emission, thus counteracting the rapid photobleaching caused by the extremely high carrier densities. Furthermore, it was found that preoxidizing the sample with ozone was able to prolong and improve this intensity recovery, highlighting the impact of surface passivation on the scintillation properties of perovskite materials in the XUV range.",,331
1617,35968239,A Background Search on the Potential Role of Scutellaria and Its Essential Oils.,"Scutellaria (Lamiaceae), which contains over 350 species, usually known as skullcaps, is found throughout Europe, the United States, and East Asia. In traditional Chinese medicine, several species are used to wipe out heat-evil and remove surface ills (TCM). The current study examines the ethnopharmacology, biological activity, and chemical substances associated with Scutellaria species. More than 295 chemicals, including flavonoids and diterpenes, have been identified. Scutellaria and its active principles have been shown in studies to have a wide range of pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, antifeedant, phytotoxic, acaricidal toxicity, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antianalgesic activities. Currently, effective monomeric compounds or active components from Scutellaria have been evaluated for pharmacological action in vivo and in vitro. More data facilitates applications and exploitation of novel medication development.",,332
2461,35966797,Associations of multiple visual rating scales based on structural magnetic resonance imaging with disease severity and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"The relationships between multiple visual rating scales based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) with disease severity and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were ambiguous. In this study, a total of 438 patients with clinically diagnosed AD were recruited. All participants underwent brain sMRI scan, and medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), posterior atrophy (PA), global cerebral atrophy-frontal sub-scale (GCA-F), and Fazekas rating scores were visually evaluated. Meanwhile, disease severity was assessed by neuropsychological tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Among them, 95 patients were tested for CSF core biomarkers, including Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau, and t-tau. As a result, the GCA-F and Fazekas scales showed positively significant correlations with onset age (r = 0.181, p < 0.001; r = 0.411, p < 0.001, respectively). Patients with late-onset AD (LOAD) showed higher GCA-F and Fazekas scores (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). With regard to the disease duration, the MTA and GCA-F were positively correlated (r = 0.137, p < 0.05; r = 0.106, p < 0.05, respectively). In terms of disease severity, a positively significant association emerged between disease severity and the MTA, PA GCA-F, and Fazekas scores (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.05, respectively). Moreover, after adjusting for age, gender, and APOE alleles, the MTA scale contributed to moderate to severe AD in statistical significance independently by multivariate logistic regression analysis (p < 0.05). The model combining visual rating scales, age, gender, and APOE alleles showed the best performance for the prediction of moderate to severe AD significantly (AUC = 0.712, sensitivity = 51.5%, specificity = 84.6%). In addition, we observed that the MTA and Fazekas scores were associated with a lower concentration of Aβ1-42 (p < 0.031, p < 0.022, respectively). In summary, we systematically analyzed the benefits of multiple visual rating scales in predicting the clinical status of AD. The visual rating scales combined with age, gender, and APOE alleles showed best performance in predicting the severity of AD. MRI biomarkers in combination with CSF biomarkers can be used in clinical practice.",,333
82,35983401,A Case Report of Severe Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Due to Accelerated Hypertension in a Young Patient.,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) refers to white matter vasogenic edema primarily affecting the brain's posterior occipital and parietal lobes, causing acute neurological symptoms like headaches, visual symptoms, seizures, and altered mental status. We present the case of a 32-year-old male with uncontrolled hypertension, altered mental status, and left-sided weakness. He had a rapid neurological decline, and a computed tomography (CT) head showed blurring of gray-white matter interfaces in the right posterior parietal lobe, suggesting infarction or PRES. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain suggested worsening with acute-early subacute infarction involving the right temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes and diffuse cerebral edema causing compression of the right ventricle with diffuse sulcal effacement and central downward herniation. There were flair hyperintensities in the bifrontal, pons, and cerebellum. Given the history of uncontrolled hypertension, the right hemispheric infarction and edema were thought to be due to secondary complications of severe PRES. He underwent urgent bilateral craniectomies with dural augmentation and external ventricular drain placement to control the intracranial pressure the next day. His mental status, as well as neurologic function, showed gradual improvement in the next few months. A high index of suspicion and rapid treatment can pave the way for a quick recovery and help reduce morbidity and death.",,334
667,35975579,The development of input-monitoring system on biofuel economics and social welfare analysis.,"Biofuel production relies on stable supply of biomass which would be significantly influenced by climate-induced impacts. Since the actual agricultural outputs are relatively unpredictable in the face of uncertain environmental conditions and can only be realized in the harvest season, providing useful information regarding the stability of biomass supply to the downstream biofuel industry is crucial. This study firstly illustrates a theoretical framework to explore the resultant market equilibrium and optimal conditions of agricultural and bioenergy production in the face of highly uncertain environmental risks and then employs a two-stage stochastic programming model to investigate the optimal biofuel development and associated economic and environmental effects. The results show that total welfare may not always increase because the loss of other agricultural commodities induced by climate impacts may be greater than the gains received by biofuel production and emission reduction. This study provides insights into the area where artificial intelligence monitoring system can be implemented to analyze the input data associated with agricultural activities and help the biofuel industry to improve its production possibilities.",,335
2363,35967013,Dynamic Distribution Characteristics of Oil and Water during Water Flooding in a Fishbone Well with Different Branch Angles.,"Lab experiments, field pilots, and numerical modeling focusing on fluid flow aspects have indicated that multi-branch wells are technically effective and promising. Several researchers have conducted some experiments for a fishbone well strategy with mixed results. Our objective in this work is to study the impact of the different fishbone well patterns, such as branch angle, on the distribution of remaining oil after water flooding. In this paper, the interference effect between branches on oil recovery is studied in three steps. First, the interferences between fishbone wells with different branch angles were measured by hydro-electric simulation experiments. Second, two-dimensional visualization water flooding experiments were carried out to clarify the remaining oil distribution at different branch angles. Third, the distribution of oil and water in fishbone wells was verified by establishing a numerical model. The modeling results agree well with the experimental phenomena. At the same time, the variation trend of water and oil production in each branch is analyzed by numerical simulation results. The results indicate that the production is strongly dependent on the branch angles, and the highest recovery was 60.2% at a 45° branch angle.",,336
440,35979070,Skimmia anquetilia N.P. Taylor and Airy Shaw (Rutaceae): A Critical Appriasal of its Ethnobotanical and Pharmacological Activities.,"Skimmia anquetilia N.P. Taylor and Airy Shaw (Rutaceae) is a perennial, aromatic, gregarious wild ornamental shrub native to the Western Himalaya. The plant is used in the traditional medicinal system to treat copious health conditions like rheumatism, fever, inflammation, headache, influenza, body-ache, clearing of the nose, diabetes, lowering the body temperature, smallpox, wounds, burns, snake, and scorpion bites. Phytochemical and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analysis of S. anquetilia showed the presence of alkanes, alkenes, carboxylic acids, fatty acids, and their esters, simple coumarins, terpenes, phenylpropanoid, and so on. These active principles exhibit a wide array of pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancerous, anti-feedant, and antibacterial properties. Most pharmacological studies were based on the essential oil and the crude extracts of the plant and the bioactive compounds responsible for the bioefficacy have not been well-identified. Further investigations are required to transform the experience-based claims on the use of S. anquetilia in traditional medicine practices into evidence-based information. Detailed in-vitro and in-vivo studies on the mechanisms of action of pure bioactive compounds and more elaborate toxicity studies to ensure plant safety for human use should be conducted. This review recapitulates the current status of its use in the ethnobotany, phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities. It also offers a critical assessment of the plant's existing information which would help to recuperate its potential as a source for drug development of lead molecules.",,337
1576,35968310,The relationship between red blood cell distribution width at admission and post-stroke fatigue in the acute phase of acute ischemic stroke.,"Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is a common complication in the patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This prospective study aimed to investigate the relationship between red blood cell distribution width (RDW) at admission and PSF in the acute phase. The AIS patients were enrolled in Nantong Third People's Hospital, consecutively. PSF in the acute phase was scored according to the Fatigue Severity Scale. Levels of RDW were measured at admission. The associations were analyzed using multivariate regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS). From April 2021 to March 2022, a total of 206 AIS patients (mean age, 69.3 ± 10.7 years; 52.9% men) were recruited. After the adjustment for potential confounding factors, RDW at admission remained the independent associated factor with PSF in the acute phase (OR [odds ratio], 1.635; 95% CI [confidence interval], 1.153-2.318; P = 0.006). The linear dose-response associations of RDW with PSF in the acute phase were found, based on the RCS model (P for non-linearity = 0.372; P for linearity = 0.037). These results remained significant in other models. RDW at admission could serve as a novel biomarker of PSF in the acute phase of AIS.",,338
1582,35968302,Longitudinal changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system are related to the prognosis of stroke.,"This study sought to improve methods to identify biomarkers in the neuroendocrine system related to stroke progression to improve the accuracy of traditional tools for evaluating stroke prognosis. Seventy-four stroke patients and 237 healthy controls were prospectively included. We measured urinary epinephrine (E), noradrenaline (NE), dopamine (DA) and cortisol (F) on days 1, 3, and 5 after stroke onset and plasma F, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyrotropin (TSH), prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth hormone (GH). The correlation between these hormone levels and 90-day prognosis was analyzed, their value in assessing prognosis was compared with lesion volume and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and their correlation with conventional clinical variables was assessed. Levels of F, 24-h urinary free cortisol(UFC), E, NE, DA, and GH on days 1, 3, and 5 were significantly higher in stroke patients than in controls (P < 0.01), while ACTH and TSH decreased, gradually approaching normal within 5 days of onset. Levels of E, NE, F, and 24-h UFC were proportional to severity, and all gradually decreased within 5 days of onset in patients with a good prognosis and gradually increased or remained high in those with a poor prognosis. After adjustment for age, sex, NIHSS, or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, F > 13.6 μg/dL, ACTH > 22.02 pg/mL and NE > 123.5 μg/ 24 h were identified as risk factors for a poor prognosis 90 days after stroke (P < 0.05). The combination of F, ACTH, NE, white blood cell count (WBC), glucose (Glu), and hemoglobin (Hb) was significantly more accurate than lesion volume (AUC: 0.931 vs. 0.694 P = 0.019) and NIHSS score (AUC: 0.931 vs. 0.746 P = 0.034) in predicting poor prognosis of stroke 1 day after onset. Hormones and traditional clinical variables were correlated to varying degrees, with NE correlating most strongly with 24-h UFC (r = 0.54) and moderately positively with lesion volume (r = 0.40) and NIHSS score (r = 0.45). Stroke causes significant time-phased dynamic changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system, and plasma F, ACTH, and urinary NE levels can be used to assess stroke severity and prognosis.

2179,35967339,"DNAM-1-chimeric receptor-engineered NK cells, combined with Nutlin-3a, more effectively fight neuroblastoma cells in vitro: a proof-of-concept study.","Adoptive transfer of engineered NK cells, one of clinical approaches to fight cancer, is gaining great interest in the last decade. However, the development of new strategies is needed to improve clinical efficacy and safety of NK cell-based immunotherapy. NK cell-mediated recognition and lysis of tumor cells are strictly dependent on the expression of ligands for NK cell-activating receptors NKG2D and DNAM-1 on tumor cells. Of note, the PVR/CD155 and Nectin-2/CD112 ligands for DNAM-1 are expressed primarily on solid tumor cells and poorly expressed in normal tissue cells. Here, we generated human NK cells expressing either the full length DNAM-1 receptor or three different DNAM-1-based chimeric receptor that provide the expression of DNAM-1 fused to a costimulatory molecule such as 2B4 and CD3ζ chain. Upon transfection into primary human NK cells isolated from healthy donors, we evaluated the surface expression of DNAM-1 and, as a functional readout, we assessed the extent of degranulation, cytotoxicity and the production of IFNγ and TNFα in response to human leukemic K562 cell line. In addition, we explored the effect of Nutlin-3a, a MDM2-targeting drug able of restoring p53 functions and known to have an immunomodulatory effect, on the degranulation of DNAM-1-engineered NK cells in response to human neuroblastoma (NB) LA-N-5 and SMS-KCNR cell lines. By comparing NK cells transfected with four different plasmid vectors and through blocking experiments, DNAM-1-CD3ζ-engineered NK cells showed the strongest response. Furthermore, both LA-N-5 and SMS-KCNR cells pretreated with Nutlin-3a were significantly more susceptible to DNAM-1-engineered NK cells than NK cells transfected with the empty vector. Our results provide a proof-of-concept suggesting that the combined use of DNAM-1-chimeric receptor-engineered NK cells and Nutlin-3a may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of solid tumors, such as NB, carrying dysfunctional p53.",,340
2121,35967397,Serum concentration of extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein is associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19.,"Uncontrolled release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) is suggested to be a major trigger for the dysregulated host immune response that leads to severe COVID-19. Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP), is a newly identified DAMP that aggravates inflammation and tissue injury, and induces respiratory failure in sepsis. Whether CIRP contributes to the pathogenesis of respiratory failure in COVID-19 has not yet been explored. To investigate if the concentration of extracellular CIRP (eCIRP) in serum associates with respiratory failure and lung involvement by chest computed tomography (CT) in COVID-19. Herein we report a prospective observational study of patients with COVID-19 included at two University Hospitals in Sweden between April 2020 and May 2021. Serum from hospitalized patients in Örebro (N=97) were used to assess the association between eCIRP and the level of respiratory support and its correlation with pulmonary involvement on chest CT and inflammatory biomarkers. A cohort of hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients from Umeå (N=78) was used as an external validation cohort. The severity of disease was defined according to the highest degree of respiratory support; mild disease (no oxygen), non-severe hypoxemia (conventional oxygen or high-flow nasal oxygen, HFNO <50% FiO2), and severe hypoxemia (HFNO ≥50% FiO2, mechanical ventilation). Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression was used to evaluate peak eCIRP day 0-4 in respect to severity, age, sex, Charlson comorbidity score, symptom duration, and BMI. Peak eCIRP concentrations were higher in patients with severe hypoxemia and were independently associated with the degree of respiratory support in both cohorts (Örebro; p=0.01, Umeå; p<0.01). The degree of pulmonary involvement measured by CT correlated with eCIRP, rs=0.30, p<0.01 (n=97). High serum levels of eCIRP are associated with acute respiratory failure in COVID-19. Experimental studies are needed to determine if treatments targeting eCIRP reduces the risk of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19.",,341
1737,35968005,Archaea: An under-estimated kingdom in livestock animals.,"Archaea are considered an essential group of gut microorganisms in both humans and animals. However, they have been neglected in previous studies, especially those involving non-ruminants. In this study, we re-analyzed published metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data sequenced from matched samples to explore the composition and the expression activity of gut archaea in ruminants (cattle and sheep) and monogastric animals (pig and chicken). Our results showed that the alpha and beta diversity of each host species, especially cattle and chickens, calculated from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data were significantly different, suggesting that metatranscriptomic data better represent the functional status of archaea. We detected that the relative abundance of 17 (cattle), 7 (sheep), 20 (pig), and 2 (chicken) archaeal species were identified in the top 100 archaeal taxa when analyzing the metagenomic datasets, and these species were classified as the active archaeal species for each host species by comparison with corresponding metatranscriptomic data. For example, The expressive abundance in metatranscriptomic dataset of Methanosphaera cuniculi and Methanosphaera stadtmanae were 30- and 27-fold higher than that in metagenomic abundance, indicating their potentially important function in the pig gut. Here we aim to show the potential importance of archaea in the livestock digestive tract and encourage future research in this area, especially on the gut archaea of monogastric animals.",,342
1041,35974578,Effect of initial infection size on a network susceptible-infected-recovered model.,"We consider the effect of a nonvanishing fraction of initially infected nodes (seeds) on the susceptible-infected-recovered epidemic model on random networks. This is relevant when the number of arriving infected individuals is large, or to the spread of ideas with publicity campaigns. This model is frequently studied by mapping to a bond percolation problem, in which edges are occupied with the probability p of eventual infection along an edge. This gives accurate measures of the final size of the infection and epidemic threshold in the limit of a vanishingly small seed fraction. We show, however, that when the initial infection occupies a nonvanishing fraction, f, of the network, this method yields ambiguous results, as the correspondence between edge occupation and contagion transmission no longer holds. We propose instead to measure the giant component of recovered individuals within the original contact network. We derive exact equations for the size of the epidemic and the epidemic threshold in the infinite size limit in heterogeneous sparse random networks, and we confirm them with numerical results. We observe that the epidemic threshold correctly depends on f, decreasing as f increases. When the seed fraction tends to zero, we recover the standard results.",,343
1021,35974598,Tensor network renormalization study on the crossover in classical Heisenberg and RP^{2} models in two dimensions.,"We study the classical two-dimensional RP^{2} and Heisenberg models, using the tensor-network renormalization (TNR) method. The determination of the phase diagram of these models has been challenging and controversial due to the very large correlation lengths at low temperatures. The finite-size spectrum of the transfer matrix obtained by TNR is useful in identifying the conformal field theory describing a possible critical point. Our results indicate that the ultraviolet fixed point for the Heisenberg model and the ferromagnetic RP^{2} model in the zero-temperature limit corresponds to a conformal field theory with central charge c=2, in agreement with two independent would-be Nambu-Goldstone modes. On the other hand, the ultraviolet fixed point in the zero-temperature limit for the antiferromagnetic Lebwohl-Lasher model, which is a variant of the RP^{2} model, seems to have a larger central charge. This is consistent with c=4 expected from the effective SO(5) symmetry. At T>0, the convergence of the spectrum is not good in both the Heisenberg and ferromagnetic RP^{2} models. Moreover, there seems to be no appropriate candidate of conformal field theory matching the spectrum, which shows the effective central charge c∼1.9. These suggest that both models have a single disordered phase at finite temperatures, although the ferromagnetic RP^{2} model exhibits a strong crossover at the temperature where the dissociation of Z_{2} vortices has been reported.",,344
2466,35966792,Mitigation of perioperative neurocognitive disorders: A holistic approach.,"William Morton introduced the world to ether anesthesia for use during surgery in the Bullfinch Building of the Massachusetts General Hospital on October 16, 1846. For nearly two centuries, the prevailing wisdom had been that the effects of general anesthetics were rapidly and fully reversible, with no apparent long-term adverse sequelae. Despite occasional concerns of a possible association between surgery and anesthesia with dementia since 1887 (Savage, 1887), our initial belief was robustly punctured following the publication in 1998 of the International Study of Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction [ISPOCD 1] study by Moller et al. (1998) in The Lancet, in which they demonstrated in a prospective fashion that there were in fact persistent adverse effects on neurocognitive function up to 3 months following surgery and that these effects were common. Since the publication of that landmark study, significant strides have been made in redefining the terminology describing cognitive dysfunction, identifying those patients most at risk, and establishing the underlying etiology of the condition, particularly with respect to the relative contributions of anesthesia and surgery. In 2018, the International Nomenclature Consensus Working Group proposed new nomenclature to standardize identification of and classify perioperative cognitive changes under the umbrella of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) (Evered et al., 2018a). Since then, the new nomenclature has tried to describe post-surgical cognitive derangements within a unifying framework and has brought to light the need to standardize methodology in clinical studies and motivate such studies with hypotheses of PND pathogenesis. In this narrative review, we highlight the relevant literature regarding recent key developments in PND identification and management throughout the perioperative period. We provide an overview of the new nomenclature and its implications for interpreting risk factors identified by clinical association studies. We then describe current hypotheses for PND development, using data from clinical association studies and neurophysiologic data where appropriate. Finally, we offer broad clinical guidelines for mitigating PND in the perioperative period, highlighting the role of Brain Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (Brain-ERAS) protocols.",,345
1953,35967654,The Attention Training Technique Reduces Anxiety and Depression in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease: A Pilot Feasibility Study.,"Depression and anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients and associated with poor outcome. Most psychological treatments have shown limited effectiveness on anxiety and depression in these patients. This study evaluates the feasibility of the attention training technique (ATT) in CHD patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Five consecutive CHD patients with significant depression and anxiety symptoms with Hospital Anxiety and Depression rating scale (HADS) -anxiety or -depression subscale score > 8 received 6 weekly group-sessions of ATT in an open trial. Outcomes included feasibility and symptoms measured by HADS, at baseline, post-treatment and at 6 months follow-up. We also assessed psychiatric diagnoses, type D personality, insomnia, worry, and rumination. The sample comprised five men with a mean age of 59.9 (SD 4.4) years. Four of the patients attended all six sessions, and one patient attended all but one session. Mean HADS-A scores at baseline, post-treatment, and follow-up were 9.4 (SD 3.0), 4.2 (SD 3.0), and 4.0 (SD 2.5), and for HADS-D 8.6 (SD 3.3), 3.0 (SD 3.7), and 1.6 (SD 1.5), respectively. The results showed clinically significant changes in anxiety, depression, psychiatric disorders, insomnia, worry, and rumination. Statistically significant changes were found from pre- to post-treatment scores for HADS-A and worry, which were maintained at follow-up, and HADS-D scores significantly decreased from pre-treatment to 6-months follow-up. ATT in a group format appears to be a feasible stand-alone metacognitive treatment for CHD patients. An adequately powered randomized controlled trial is warranted.",,346
2049,35967526,Renal Lymphoma Diagnosed on Kidney Biopsy Presenting as Acute Kidney Injury.,"Renal manifestations associated with hematolymphoid malignancies are known. Primary or secondary involvement of the kidney by lymphomatous infiltration has various clinical presentations. Acute kidney injury is not an uncommon finding in relation to lymphomatous interstitial infiltration proven on kidney biopsy. However, diagnosing it solely on renal biopsy remains a challenge and needs expertise and aid of immunohistochemistry as the prognosis is dismal. This is a retrospective study of kidney biopsy-proven cases of renal lymphoma presenting with acute kidney injury. The study included 12 patients with ages ranging from 4 to 50 years who presented with serum creatinine ranging 2.1-9.6 mg%. Renal biopsy findings showed interstitial lymphomatous infiltrate. Two cases were diagnosed as primary lymphoma and the other 10 as secondary lymphomas. Among the 12 cases, nine were B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, of which diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was diagnosed in six (50%), low-grade B-cell type in two (16.6%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia in one (8.3%), and three were T-cell-type. Two were acute T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and one other was a high-grade T-cell lymphoma. Four patients succumbed. The other four patients are alive; one is on chemotherapy, while two of them are on hemodialysis. Acute kidney injury as a presenting feature with lymphomatous infiltration of renal parenchyma is not uncommon. The patchy involvement makes it challenging on kidney biopsy with definitive diagnosis being made with the help of immunohistochemistry. Appropriate multidisciplinary involvement improves patient outcome.",,347
1757,35967979,Photoinduced isomerization sampling of retinal in bacteriorhodopsin.,"Photoisomerization of retinoids inside a confined protein pocket represents a critical chemical event in many important biological processes from animal vision, nonvisual light effects, to bacterial light sensing and harvesting. Light-driven proton pumping in bacteriorhodopsin entails exquisite electronic and conformational reconfigurations during its photocycle. However, it has been a major challenge to delineate transient molecular events preceding and following the photoisomerization of the retinal from noisy electron density maps when varying populations of intermediates coexist and evolve as a function of time. Here, I report several distinct early photoproducts deconvoluted from the recently observed mixtures in time-resolved serial crystallography. This deconvolution substantially improves the quality of the electron density maps, hence demonstrates that the all-trans retinal undergoes extensive isomerization sampling before it proceeds to the productive 13-cis configuration. Upon light absorption, the chromophore attempts to perform trans-to-cis isomerization at every double bond together with the stalled anti-to-syn rotations at multiple single bonds along its polyene chain. Such isomerization sampling pushes all seven transmembrane helices to bend outward, resulting in a transient expansion of the retinal binding pocket, and later, a contraction due to recoiling. These ultrafast responses observed at the atomic resolution support that the productive photoreaction in bacteriorhodopsin is initiated by light-induced charge separation in the prosthetic chromophore yet governed by stereoselectivity of its protein pocket. The method of a numerical resolution of concurrent events from mixed observations is also generally applicable.",,348
416,35979231,Population Pharmacokinetics of Cyclosporine in Chinese Pediatric Patients With Acquired Aplastic Anemia.,"Cyclosporine (CsA) is a component of the first-line treatment for acquired aplastic anemia (acquired AA) in pediatric patients. This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of CsA in Chinese pediatric patients with acquired AA to inform individual dosage regimens. A total of 681 CsA whole blood concentrations and laboratory data of 157 pediatric patients with acquired AA were retrospectively collected from two hospitals in Shanghai. A nonlinear mixed-effect model approach was used to build the population PK model. Potential covariate effects of age, body weight, and biochemical measurements (renal and liver functions) on CsA PK disposition were evaluated. Model fit was assessed using the basic goodness of fit and a visual predictive check. The CsA concentration data were accurately described using a two-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and elimination. Body weight value was implemented as a fixed allometric function on all clearance and volume of distribution parameters. Total bilirubin level was identified as a significant covariate on apparent clearance (CL/F), with a 1.07% reduction per 1 nmol/L rise in total bilirubin level. The final estimates for CL/F and central volume (Vc/F) were 29.1 L/h and 325 L, respectively, for a typical 28 kg child. Other covariates (e.g., gender, age, albumin, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum creatinine, and concomitant medication) did not significantly affect the PK properties of CsA. This population PK model, along with a maximum a posteriori Bayesian approach, could estimate individual PK parameters in pediatric patients with acquired AA to conduct individual CsA therapy.",,349
564,35978570,A Microfluidic Platform for Tracking Individual Cell Dynamics during an Unperturbed Nutrients Exhaustion.,"Microorganisms have evolved adaptive strategies to respond to the autonomous degradation of their environment. Indeed, a growing culture progressively exhausts nutrients from its media and modifies its composition. Yet, how single cells react to these modifications remains difficult to study since it requires population-scale growth experiments to allow cell proliferation to have a collective impact on the environment, while monitoring the same individuals exposed to this environment for days. For this purpose, we have previously described an integrated microfluidic pipeline, based on continuous separation of the cells from the media and subsequent perfusion of the filtered media in an observation chamber containing isolated single cells. Here, we provide a detailed protocol to implement this methodology, including the setting up of the microfluidic system and the processing of timelapse images.",,350
1317,35970055,Improved generative adversarial network for retinal image super-resolution.,"The retina is the only organ in the body that can use visible light for non-invasive observation. By analyzing retinal images, we can achieve early screening, diagnosis and prevention of many ophthalmological and systemic diseases, helping patients avoid the risk of blindness. Due to the powerful feature extraction capabilities, many deep learning super-resolution reconstruction networks have been applied to retinal image analysis and achieved excellent results. Given the lack of high-frequency information and poor visual perception in the current reconstruction results of super-resolution reconstruction networks under large-scale factors, we present an improved generative adversarial network (IGAN) algorithm for retinal image super-resolution reconstruction. Firstly, we construct a novel residual attention block, improving the reconstruction results lacking high-frequency information and texture details under large-scale factors. Secondly, we remove the Batch Normalization layer that affects the quality of image generation in the residual network. Finally, we use the more robust Charbonnier loss function instead of the mean square error loss function and the TV regular term to smooth the training results. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves objective evaluation indicators such as peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity. The obtained image has rich texture details and a better visual experience than the state-of-the-art image super-resolution methods. Our proposed method can better learn the mapping relationship between low-resolution and high-resolution retinal images. This method can be effectively and stably applied to the analysis of retinal images, providing an effective basis for early clinical treatment.",,351
441,35979068,Combination of an inject-and-transfer system for serial femtosecond crystallography.,"Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) enables the determination of room-temperature crystal structures of macromolecules with minimized radiation damage and provides time-resolved molecular dynamics by pump-probe or mix-and-inject experiments. In SFX, a variety of sample delivery methods with unique advantages have been developed and applied. The combination of existing sample delivery methods can enable a new approach to SFX data collection that combines the advantages of the individual methods. This study introduces a combined inject-and-transfer system (BITS) method for sample delivery in SFX experiments: a hybrid injection and fixed-target scanning method. BITS allows for solution samples to be reliably deposited on ultraviolet ozone (UVO)-treated polyimide films, at a minimum flow rate of 0.5 nl min-1, in both vertical and horizontal scanning modes. To utilize BITS in SFX experiments, lysozyme crystal samples were embedded in a viscous lard medium and injected at flow rates of 50-100 nl min-1 through a syringe needle onto a UVO-treated polyimide film, which was mounted on a fixed-target scan stage. The crystal samples deposited on the film were raster scanned with an X-ray free electron laser using a motion stage in both horizontal and vertical directions. Using the BITS method, the room-temperature structure of lysozyme was successfully determined at a resolution of 2.1 Å, and thus BITS could be utilized in future SFX experiments.",,352
423,35979188,Implementing Collaborative Care Management of Behavioral Health for Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are up to twice as likely to suffer from anxiety and/or depression. Collaborative care management (CoCM) is an evidence-based approach to treating behavioral health disorders that have proven effective for a range of conditions in primary care and some specialty settings. This model involves a team-based approach, with care delivered by a care manager (case reviews and behavioral therapy), psychiatrist (case reviews and psychopharmacological recommendations), and medical provider (ongoing care including psychopharmacological prescriptions). We assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of CoCM in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with IBD. Patients with psychological distress identified by clinical impression and/or the results of the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were referred to the CoCM program. Data from our 9-month CoCM pilot were collected to assess depression and anxiety response and remission rates. We obtained provider surveys to assess provider acceptability with delivering care in this model. Though the SARS-CoV2 COVID-19 pandemic interrupted screening, 39 patients enrolled and 19 active participants completed the program. Overall, 47.4% had either a response or remission in depression, while 36.8% had response or remission in anxiety. The gastroenterologists highly agreed that the program was a beneficial resource for their patients and felt comfortable implementing the recommendations. CoCM is a potentially feasible and well accepted care delivery model for treatment of depression and anxiety in patients with IBD in a specialty gastroenterology clinic setting.",,353
1028,35974591,Structural relaxation dynamics of colloidal nanotrimers.,"By Molecular Dynamics simulation, we investigate the dynamics of isotropic fluids of colloidal nanotrimers whose interactions are described by varying the strength of attractive and repulsive terms of the Mie potential. To provide a consistent comparison between the systems described by different force fields, we determine the phase diagram and critical points of each system, characterize the morphology of high-density liquid phases at the same reduced temperature and density, and finally investigate their long-time relaxation dynamics. In particular, we detect an especially complex dynamics that reveals the existence of slow and fast nanotrimers and the resulting occurrence of non-Gaussianity, which develops at intermediate timescales. Deviations from Gaussianity are temporary and vanish within the timescales of the system's density fluctuations decay, when a Fickian-like diffusion regime is eventually observed.",,354
221,35982799,The BASP1 transcriptional corepressor modifies chromatin through lipid-dependent and lipid-independent mechanisms.,"The transcriptional corepressor BASP1 requires N-terminal myristoylation for its activity and functions through interactions with nuclear lipids. Here we determine the role of BASP1 lipidation in histone modification and the modulation of chromatin accessibility. We find that the removal of the active histone modifications H3K9ac and H3K4me3 by BASP1 requires the N-terminal myristoylation of BASP1. In contrast, the placement of the repressive histone modification, H3K27me3, by BASP1 does not require BASP1 lipidation. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis finds that BASP1 regulates the activity of multiple transcription factors and induces extensive changes in chromatin accessibility. We find that ∼50% of BASP1 target genes show lipidation-dependent chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression. Our results suggest that BASP1 elicits both lipid-dependent and lipid-independent functions in histone modification and transcriptional repression. In accordance with this, we find that the tumor suppressor activity of BASP1 is also partially dependent on its myristoylation.",,355
659,35975828,Role of lone-pair electron localization in temperature-induced phase transitions in mimetite.,"The crystal structure of mimetite Pb5(AsO4)3Cl, a phosphate with apatite structure-type has been investigated in situ at 123, 173, 273, 288, 353 and 393 K. A careful inspection of the diffraction pattern and subsequent structure refinements indicated that mimetite transforms from the monoclinic to the hexagonal polymorph with increasing temperature. At 123 K, a monoclinic superstructure, mimetite-2M, with cell parameters a = 20.4487 (9),  b = 7.4362 (2), c = 20.4513 (9) Å, β = 119.953 (6)°, V = 2694.5 (2) Å3 and space group P21 was observed. From 173 to 353 K, the reflections of the supercell were evident only along one direction of the corresponding hexagonal apatite-cell and the structure transforms to the polymorph mimetite-M with space group P21/b and unit-cell parameters a = 10.2378 (3), b = 20.4573 (7), c = 7.4457 (2) Å, β = 120.039 (5)°, V = 1349.96 (9) Å3. Only at higher temperature, i.e. 393 K, does mimetite adopt the hexagonal space group P63/m characteristic of apatite structure-types. The role of the electron lone pairs of Pb atoms in the phase transition was investigated through the analysis of the electron localization function (ELF) calculated based on the DFT-geometry optimized structures of the three polymorphs. The changes in spatial distribution of the 6s2 electron density during the phase transitions were explored by means of the Wannier Function Centres (WFCs) derived from ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. In the high-temperature hexagonal structure the 6s2 electrons are spherically symmetric relative to the position of Pb atoms. At low temperature the maximum of 6s2 electron density is displaced relative to the position of Pb atom contributing to the polar interaction in the monoclinic polymorphs.",,356
528,35978727,Algorithm-based approach to focal liver lesions in contrast-enhanced ultrasound.,"Focal liver lesions are commonly encountered. Grey-scale and Doppler sonographic characteristics of focal liver lesions are often non-specific and insufficient to conclusively characterise lesions as benign or malignant. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is useful for the characterisation of FLLs in patients who are unable to undergo contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. It is also easily available and relatively cheap. However, interpretation of contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be challenging without a systematic approach. In this pictorial essay, we highlight an algorithm-based approach to FLLs and discuss the characteristic contrast-enhanced ultrasound features of commonly encountered and clinically significant focal liver lesions.",,357
1846,35967794,Therapeutic targets and functions of curcumol against COVID-19 and colon adenocarcinoma.,"Since 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused 6,319,395 deaths worldwide. Although the COVID-19 vaccine is currently available, the latest variant of the virus, Omicron, spreads more easily than earlier strains, and its mortality rate is still high in patients with chronic diseases, especially cancer patients. So, identifying a novel compound for COVID-19 treatment could help reduce the lethal rate of the viral infection in patients with cancer. This study applied network pharmacology and systematic bioinformatics analysis to determine the possible use of curcumol for treating colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) in patients infected with COVID-19. Our results showed that COVID-19 and COAD in patients shared a cluster of genes commonly deregulated by curcumol. The clinical pathological analyses demonstrated that the expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit delta (GABRD) was associated with the patients' hazard ratio. More importantly, the high expression of GABRD was associated with poor survival rates and the late stages of COAD in patients. The network pharmacology result identified seven-core targets, including solute carrier family 6 member 3, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit pi, butyrylcholinesterase, cytochrome P450 3A4, 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, progesterone receptor, and GABRD of curcumol for treating patients with COVID-19 and COAD. The bioinformatic analysis further highlighted their importance in the biological processes and molecular functions in gland development, inflammation, retinol, and steroid metabolism. The findings of this study suggest that curcumol could be an alternative compound for treating patients with COVID-19 and COAD.",,358
514,35978745,Effectiveness of Apple Cider Vinegar and Mechanical Removal on Dental Plaque and Gingival Inflammation of Children With Cerebral Palsy.,"Background This study was designed to evaluate the effect of apple cider vinegar (ACV) 5% and mechanical plaque removal with a manual toothbrush on dental plaque and gingivitis. The objective was to study available, natural, and inexpensive ways to improve oral health status among the studied group. Materials and methods A randomized clinical trial was performed on 50 children with cerebral palsy aged from three to six years. Participants were divided into two groups (n=25, apple cider vinegar, manual brushing without toothpaste). Plaque accumulation and gingival status were evaluated using Turesky of the Quigley-Hein plaque index (TQHPI) and modified gingival index (MGI) seven times: pre-intervention baseline (T0), post-intervention at one month (T1), two months (T2), three months (T3), four months (T4), five months (T5), six months (T6). Results Plaque accumulation and gingivitis decreased significantly for the ACV group between T0 and T6 (p<0.05) and demonstrated significantly lower plaque accumulation and gingivitis compared to the manual brushing group (p<0.05) at T5 and T6. The manual brushing group showed decreasing in TQHPI between T0 and T3, then TQHPI increased significantly (p<0.05) at T4, T5, and T6. Conclusions To sum up, this in vitro study has demonstrated the possibility of using apple cider vinegar to reduce plaque and gingivitis. In addition, without additives, apple cider vinegar has both mechanical and chemical effects on dental plaque, and it may be a natural, available, inexpensive, and harmless substance that can improve the quality of oral care for difficult groups of children and people with special needs. Unlike toothbrushes, especially electric toothbrushes, they are effective, but they may be expensive and not available to all children.",,359
238,35982775,"Influence of Ingestion of Eicosapentaenoic Acid-Rich Fish Oil on Oxidative Stress at the Menstrual Phase: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Trial.","This study examines the effect of the supplements on the redox reaction in menstrual cycle. Participants took eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-rich fish oil supplements over two menstrual cycles. For this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 21 female members of a university basketball team were selected. Participants were allocated into the EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) group (EG, n = 11) and control group (CG, n = 10) through stratified randomization. The EG and CG took 3600 mg fish oil (containing 900 mg EPA and 403 mg DHA) and 3600 mg corn oil (without EPA and DHA), respectively, every day for two menstrual cycles. The redox reaction was measured four times: the menstrual and follicular phases in two menstrual cycles. There was a significant difference in reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) and potential antioxidant capacity during the menstrual phase by the main effect of time (before and after intake) in EG and CG (p < 0.01). In a subsequent test, d-ROMs were significantly lower after intake in EG and CG (p < 0.05); however, no significant difference in potential antioxidant capacity was found. A significant difference was noted in d-ROMs and potential antioxidant capacity during the follicular phase by the effect of time (before and after intake) only in EG (p < 0.01). Significant decreases in d-ROMs and increases in potential antioxidant capacities were observed after intake (p < 0.05). EPA-rich fish oil supplementation over two menstrual cycles demonstrated active involvement in the antioxidant function during menstrual and follicular phases.The protocol was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry (registration no. UMIN000028795).",,360
2298,35967133,Isolated Pyridoxine Deficiency Presenting as Peripheral Neuropathy Post-chemotherapy.,"Pyridoxine deficiency is a rare but identifiable cause of sideroblastic anemia, depression, and peripheral neuropathy. Platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs display structural similarity to pyridoxine, which interferes with the absorption and hence the efficacy of the drug. If left untreated, it can lead to irreversible axonal loss and permanent deficits, leading to falls. Our case is a highly unusual scenario of isolated pyridoxine deficiency presenting as peripheral neuropathy and depression as a delayed side effect of chemotherapeutic drugs.",,361
1473,35968425,"For me, it's just a piece of freedom-Increased empowerment through physical activity promotion among socially disadvantaged women.","Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is an effective health promotion approach for reaching socially disadvantaged groups. However, there is limited evidence on how such interventions and their effects can be reproduced across time and place. The present study examines the effects of BIG (i.e., movement as an investment in health), a long-standing German CBPR project. Since 2005, BIG has aimed to empower women in difficult life situations to increase control over their health determinants and reduce social inequalities by promoting physical activity. One of BIG's key features is its implementation in several German municipalities since 2005. This study explores (a) whether participation could change women's empowerment, and (b) how increased empowerment affects other areas of women's lives. With a total of 63 interviewees (i.e., 40 participating women, 7 trainers, 3 project coordinators, and 13 stakeholders), we conducted 53 semi-structured qualitative interviews in five BIG communities between 2007 and 2011. Some interviews were conducted with two people simultaneously. The interview guide contained questions on various dimensions of empowerment (e.g., project engagement, increased self-efficacy, and developed competencies). Framework analysis was used for the analytical process. BIG contributed to women's empowerment in various ways, including increased self-efficacy, social network promotion, competency development, and increased motivation to change physical activity behavior. Women who took on added tasks and became more involved in project planning also strengthened their organizational empowerment. Furthermore, increased empowerment had a positive influence on the women's quality of life, family, and professional lives. The novel findings helped in understanding the effects of a complex empowerment-based approach that promoted physical activity among women in difficult life situations. Future research should focus on the long-term effects of these programs and their transferability to other sites. Further effort is necessary in the area of public health policy.",,362
335,35979502,PNIPAAm microgels with defined network architecture as temperature sensors in optical stretchers.,"Stretching individual living cells with light is a standard method to assess their mechanical properties. Yet, heat introduced by the laser light of optical stretchers may unwittingly change the mechanical properties of cells therein. To estimate the temperature induced by an optical trap, we introduce cell-sized, elastic poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) microgels that relate temperature changes to hydrogel swelling. For their usage as a standardized calibration tool, we analyze the effect of free-radical chain-growth gelation (FCG) and polymer-analogous photogelation (PAG) on hydrogel network heterogeneity, micromechanics, and temperature response by Brillouin microscopy and optical diffraction tomography. Using a combination of tailor-made PNIPAAm macromers, PAG, and microfluidic processing, we obtain microgels with homogeneous network architecture. With that, we expand the capability of standardized microgels in calibrating and validating cell mechanics analysis, not only considering cell and microgel elasticity but also providing stimuli-responsiveness to consider dynamic changes that cells may undergo during characterization.",,363
995,35974624,Curvature-driven growth and interfacial noise in the voter model with self-induced zealots.,"We introduce a variant of the voter model in which agents may have different degrees of confidence in their opinions. Those with low confidence are normal voters whose state can change upon a single contact with a different neighboring opinion. However, confidence increases with opinion reinforcement, and above a certain threshold, these agents become zealots, irreducible agents who do not change their opinion. We show that both strategies, normal voters and zealots, may coexist (in the thermodynamical limit), leading to competition between two different kinetic mechanisms: curvature-driven growth and interfacial noise. The kinetically constrained zealots are formed well inside the clusters, away from the different opinions at the surfaces that help limit their confidence. Normal voters concentrate in a region around the interfaces, and their number, which is related to the distance between the surface and the zealotry bulk, depends on the rate at which the confidence changes. Despite this interface being rough and fragmented, typical of the voter model, the presence of zealots in the bulk of these domains induces a curvature-driven dynamics, similar to the low temperature coarsening behavior of the nonconserved Ising model after a temperature quench.",,364
1744,35967998,Safety and efficacy of cannabidiol-cannabidiolic acid rich hemp extract in the treatment of refractory epileptic seizures in dogs.,"The use of cannabidiol (CBD) in childhood refractory seizures has become a common therapeutic approach for specific seizure disorders in human medicine. Similarly, there is an interest in using CBD, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) or cannabinoid-rich hemp products in the treatment of idiopathic epilepsy in dogs. We aimed to examine a small cohort in a pilot investigation using a CBD and CBDA-rich hemp product for the treatment of refractory epileptic seizures in dogs. Fourteen dogs were examined in a 24-week randomized cross-over study being provided placebo or CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract treatment at 2 mg/kg orally every 12 h for each 12-week arm of the study. Serum chemistry, complete blood counts, serum anti-seizure medication (ASM) concentrations and epileptic seizure frequency were followed over both arms of the cross-over trial. Results demonstrated that besides a mild increase in alkaline phosphatase, there were no alterations observed on routine bloodwork at 2, 6, and 12 weeks during either arm of the study. Epileptic seizure frequency decreased across the population from a mean of 8.0 ± 4.8 during placebo treatment to 5.0 ± 3.6 with CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract (P = 0.02). In addition, epileptic seizure event days over the 12 weeks of CBD/CBDA-rich hemp treatment were 4.1 ± 3.4, which was significantly different than during the 12 weeks of placebo treatment (5.8 ± 3.1; P =0.02). The number of dogs with a 50% reduction in epileptic activity while on treatment were 6/14, whereas 0/14 had reductions of 50% or greater while on the placebo (P = 0.02). No differences were observed in serum zonisamide, phenobarbital or bromide concentrations while on the treatment across groups. Adverse events were minimal, but included somnolence (3/14) and transient increases in ataxia (4/14) during CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract treatment; this was not significantly different from placebo. This further indicates that providing CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract during refractory epilepsy (only partially responsive to ASM), in conjunction with other ASM appears safe. Based on this information, the use of 2 mg/kg every 12 h of a CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract can have benefits in reducing the incidence of epileptic seizures, when used concurrently with other ASMs.",,365
2141,35967377,Soluble markers of B cell activation suggest a role of B cells in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension.,"Soluble markers of B cell activation are interesting diagnostic and prognostic tools in autoimmune diseases. Data in systemic sclerosis (SSc) are scarce and few studies focused on their association with disease characteristics. 1. Serum levels of 14 B cell biomarkers (β2-microglobulin, rheumatoid factor (RF), immunoglobulins (Ig) G, IgA, IgM, BAFF, APRIL, soluble (s)TACI, sBCMA sCD21, sCD23, sCD25, sCD27, CXCL13) were measured in SSc patients and healthy controls (HC). 2. Associations between these biomarkers and SSc characteristics were assessed. 3. The pathophysiological relevance of identified associations was explored by studying protein production in B cell culture supernatant. In a discovery panel of 80 SSc patients encompassing the broad spectrum of disease manifestations, we observed a higher frequency of RF positivity, and increased levels of β2-microglobulin, IgG and CXCL13 compared with HC. We found significant associations between several biomarkers and SSc characteristics related to disease phenotype, activity and severity. Especially, serum IgG levels were associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH); β2-microglobulin with Nt-pro-BNP and DLCO; and BAFF with peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV). In a validation cohort of limited cutaneous SSc patients without extensive ILD, we observed lower serum IgG levels, and higher β2-microglobulin, sBCMA, sCD23 and sCD27 levels in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). BAFF levels strongly correlated with Nt-pro-BNP levels, FVC/DLCO ratio and peak TRV in SSc-PAH patients. Cultured SSc B cells showed increased production of various angiogenic factors (angiogenin, angiopoietin-1, VEGFR-1, PDGF-AA, MMP-8, TIMP-1, L-selectin) and decreased production of angiopoietin-2 compared to HC. Soluble markers of B cell activation could be relevant tools to assess organ involvements, activity and severity in SSc. Their associations with PAH could plead for a role of B cell activation in the pathogenesis of pulmonary microangiopathy. B cells may contribute to SSc vasculopathy through production of angiogenic mediators.",,366
1858,35967782,"Risk of inflammatory bowel disease appears to vary across different frequency, amount, and subtype of alcoholic beverages.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and alcohol use has become a significant and growing public health concern. Alcohol use has been reported to be the most-avoided diet item among IBD patients. However, knowledge regarding the impact of different classes of alcoholic beverages on the management of IBD is limited. Our study aims to evaluate the association of different frequencies, amounts, and subtypes of alcoholic beverages with IBD risk. The UK Biobank comprised 7,095 subjects with IBD and 4,95,410 subjects without IBD. Multivariate Logistic regression, stratifying analysis, and interaction terms were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of IBD. A generalized additive model was used to evaluate the linearity associations of the total amount of all alcoholic beverages or that of each of five alcoholic beverages with IBD risk. Compared with non-drinkers, the IBD risk was 12 to 16% lower in red wine consumers (1-2 glasses/week, OR [95%CI], 0.88 [0.80, 0.97]; 3-4 glasses/week, 0.84 [0.76, 0.93]; ≥5 glasses/week, 0.86 [0.78, 0.95]), whereas 12% higher in white wine and champagne consumers (1-2 glasses/week, 1.12 [1.03, 1.22]). Stratifying analysis showed low-frequency red wine consumers were associated with a lower IBD risk (0.85 [0.74, 0.97]), whereas spirits consumers were associated with a higher risk (1.28 [1.03, 1.59]). High doge of red wine consumers were associated with a lower IBD risk (above guidelines, 0.80 [0.67, 0.97]; double above, 0.83 [0.71, 0.97]), whereas high doge white wine and champagne (1.32 [1.09, 1.61]) and beer and cider (1.26 [1.02, 1.54]) consumers were associated with a higher IBD risk. White wine and champagne showed a significant interaction effect with high doge alcohol consumption (1.27 [1.03-1.58], p = 0.029). The dose-response association showed an increased IBD risk with more number of alcohol consumption of white wine and champagne, beer and cider, or the total amount of all alcoholic beverages. However, red wine is at low risk across the whole dose cycle. The IBD risk appears to vary across different frequencies, amounts, and subtypes of alcoholic beverages. Overall, alcohol intake is not recommended.",,367
2031,35967555,Standard and increased canakinumab dosing to quiet macrophage activation syndrome in children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.,"Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a life-threatening, potentially fatal condition associated with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of sJIA MAS. Many cases of MAS are medically refractory to traditional doses of biologic cytokine inhibitors and may require increased dosing. When MAS occurs in the setting of sJIA treated with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), anakinra, increased anakinra dosing may be beneficial. Increased dosing of another IL-1 inhibitor, canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody to IL-1β, has not been reported to treat refractory MAS in the setting of sJIA. Retrospective data collection extracted from the electronic medical record focused on canakinumab usage and dosing in 8 children with sJIA who developed MAS at a single academic center from 2011 to 2020. Eight sJIA children (five girls) with median age 8.5 years (range, 0.9-14.2 years) were included in the present study. Five children developed MAS at disease onset and three during ongoing canakinumab therapy. MAS resolved in all eight children with canakinumab treatment. When the canakinumab dosing was insufficient or MAS developed during canakinumab therapy, the dosing was temporally up-titrated (four patients, maximum 300 mg per dose) without observed side effects. This report provides evidence for the efficacy and safety of short-term increased doses (2-3-times normal) of canakinumab in treating sJIA associated MAS. Further study of the efficacy and safety of increased doses of canakinumab for treatment of MAS in children with sJIA is warranted.",,368
852,35974876,"Fatty Acid Taste Receptor GPR120 Activation by Arachidonic Acid, Eicosapentaenoic Acid, and Docosahexaenoic Acid in Chickens.","It has been reported that the supplementation of chicken diet with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) affects the qualities of eggs and meat. Previous studies have shown that a functional fatty acid taste receptor, G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120), is broadly expressed in chicken oral and gastrointestinal tissues, and chickens have a gustatory perception of oleic acid, which is a chicken GPR120 agonist. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of chicken GPR120 in response to PUFAs in chicken diets. Ca2+ imaging analyses revealed that chicken GPR120 was activated by AA, EPA, and DHA in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that chickens can detect PUFAs via GPR120 in the oral and gastrointestinal tissues, implying that chickens have a gustatory perception of PUFAs.",,369
88,35983395,Clinical Study and Profile of Ocular Trauma: Findings From a Rural Hospital in Central India.,"Objective In this study, we aimed to examine the presence of visual damage due to ocular trauma and assess visual outcomes, and document the clinical spectrum and outcomes following ocular injuries among patients presenting to a tertiary care hospital in rural central India. Methods This was a hospital-based prospective interventional study conducted over a period of two years from August 2019 to August 2021. Patients with ocular injuries attending the casualty and the Ophthalmology department were included in the study after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A detailed and comprehensive ophthalmic examination was performed and visual acuity was noted at the presentation and follow-ups. The patients were followed up at regular intervals, initially at one week and subsequently at three and six weeks. Results The incidence of ocular trauma was highest in the age group of 31-40 years. There were only three patients aged more than 60 years; 15 were in the pediatric age group (1-20 years). The ocular trauma was highest in males (88.33%) than in females (11.67%). The majority of the patients were from rural areas (70%) and 30% were from urban areas. In this study, both eyes were equally involved. The right eye was involved in 45% of patients and the left eye was involved in 55%. Of note, 80% of the patients presented with closed globe injury, and 20% presented with open globe injury. On classifying the open and closed globe injuries into their subtypes, it was observed that the majority of the patients had lid laceration (n=43, 71.67%), followed by corneal penetration in 12 patients (20%), corneal abrasion in three patients (5%), and lid abrasion in two patients (3.33%). While 34 patients presented to the hospital with a history of road traffic accidents (56.67%), accidental trauma (by a wooden stick, hook of a blouse, bangle, etc.) was noted in 17 patients (28.33%), trauma by soil particle and hand pump in five patients (8.33%), and electrical trauma caused by the blast of capacitor in one patient (1.67%). One patient (1.67%) had sustained trauma from a piece of wood while working on the farm and two patients (3.33%) had a trauma because of assault. Thirty-four patients (66.67%) had a history of falls from bikes, and the next most common object causing trauma was a wooden piece/stick (four patients, 6.67%), followed by trauma caused by an iron particle in four patients (6.67%), trauma by stone in three patients (5%), and trauma by hand pump in two patients (3.33%). Conclusion Road traffic accidents were the most common cause of ocular trauma in patients attending this rural hospital in central India. The ocular structures involved and types of ocular trauma play a significant role in determining the visual outcomes in these patients.",,370
180,35982908,CPNE8 Promotes Gastric Cancer Metastasis by Modulating Focal Adhesion Pathway and Tumor Microenvironment.,"Little is known about the oncogenic role or biological function of copine Ⅷ (CPNE8) in gastric cancer (GC). Based on TCGA database, we screened for CPNE8 and analyzed the expression of CPNE8 in GC. The correlations between CPNE8 and clinical features were analyzed using TCGA and GEO databases. The prognostic value of CPNE8 was assessed using Cox analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves. The results showed that increased expression of CPNE8 was positively correlated with metastasis and can be considered an independent prognostic risk factor for poor survival. We found that CPNE8 can promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness in GC using in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our study demonstrated that CPNE8 promotes tumor progression via regulation of focal adhesion, and these effects can be rescued by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor GSK2256098 or knockdown of FAK. In addition, CPNE8 was correlated significantly with the infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells, as demonstrated by various algorithms, and high CPNE8 expression predicted poor efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy. Our findings suggest that CPNE8 modulates focal adhesion and tumor microenvironment to promote GC progression and invasiveness and could serve as a novel prognostic biomarker in GC.",,371
2387,35966986,How to orchestrate a soccer team: Generalized synchronization promoted by rhythmic acoustic stimuli.,"Interpersonal coordination requires precise actions concerted in space and time in a self-organized manner. We found, using soccer teams as a testing ground, that a common timeframe provided by adequate acoustic stimuli improves the interplay between teammates. We provide quantitative evidence that the connectivity between teammates and the scoring rate of male soccer teams improve significantly when playing under the influence of an appropriate acoustic environment. Unexpectedly, female teams do not show any improvement under the same experimental conditions. We show by follow-up experiments that the acoustic rhythm modulates the attention level of the participants with a pronounced tempo preference and a marked gender difference in the preferred tempo. These results lead to a consistent explanation in terms of the dynamical system theory, nonlinear resonances, and dynamic attention theory, which may illuminate generic mechanisms of the brain dynamics and may have an impact on the design of novel training strategies in team sports.",,372
477,35978878,Role of transcribed ultraconserved regions in gastric cancer and therapeutic perspectives.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. The occurrence and development of GC is a complex process involving multiple biological mechanisms. Although traditional regulation modulates molecular functions related to the occurrence and development of GC, the comprehensive mechanisms remain unclear. Ultraconserved region (UCR) refers to a genome sequence that is completely conserved in the homologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes, with 100% identity, without any insertions or deletions, and often located in fragile sites and tumour-related genes. The transcribed UCR (T-UCR) is transcribed from the UCR and is a new type of long noncoding RNA. Recent studies have found that the expression level of T-UCRs changes during the occurrence and development of GC, revealing a new mechanism underlying GC. Therefore, this article aims to review the relevant research on T-UCRs in GC, as well as the function of T-UCRs and their regulatory role in the occurrence and development of GC, to provide new strategies for GC diagnosis and treatment.",,373
2218,35967300,Influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in TLR3 (rs3775291) and TLR9 (rs352139) on the risk of CMV infection in kidney transplant recipients.,"Risk stratification for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after kidney transplantation (KT) remains to be determined. Since endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in viral sensing, we investigated the impact of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within TLR3 and TLR9 genes on the occurrence of overall and high-level (≥1,000 IU/ml) CMV infection in a cohort of 197 KT recipients. Homozygous carriers of the minor allele of TLR3 (rs3775291) had higher infection-free survival compared with reference allele carriers (60.0% for TT versus 42.3% for CC/CT genotypes; P-value = 0.050). Decreased infection-free survival was observed with the minor allele of TLR9 (rs352139) (38.2% for TC/CC versus 59.3% for TT genotypes; P-value = 0.004). After multivariable adjustment, the recessive protective effect of the TLR3 (rs3775291) TT genotype was confirmed (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.327; 95% CI: 0.167-0.642; P-value = 0.001), as was the dominant risk-conferring effect of TLR9 (rs352139) TC/CC genotypes (aHR: 1.865; 95% CI: 1.170-2.972; P-value = 0.009). Carriers of the TLR9 (rs352139) TC/CC genotypes showed lower CMV-specific interferon-γ-producing CD4+ T-cell counts measured by intracellular cytokine staining compared with the TT genotype (median of 0.2 versus 0.7 cells/μl; P-value = 0.003). In conclusion, TLR3/TLR9 genotyping may inform CMV infection risk after KT.",,374
2152,35967366,A novel signature to guide osteosarcoma prognosis and immune microenvironment: Cuproptosis-related lncRNA.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a common bone malignancy with poor prognosis. We aimed to investigate the relationship between cuproptosis-related lncRNAs (CRLncs) and the survival outcomes of patients with OS. Transcriptome and clinical data of 86 patients with OS were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The GSE16088 dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The 10 cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) were obtained from a recently published article on cuproptosis in Science. Combined analysis of OS transcriptome data and the GSE16088 dataset identified differentially expressed CRGs related to OS. Next, pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Co-expression analysis obtained CRLncs related to OS. Univariate COX regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis were used to construct the risk prognostic model of CRLncs. The samples were divided evenly into training and test groups to verify the accuracy of the model. Risk curve, survival, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and independent prognostic analyses were performed. Next, principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis were performed. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used to explore the correlation between the risk prognostic models and OS immune microenvironment. Drug sensitivity analysis identified drugs with potential efficacy in OS. Real-time quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry analyses verified the expression of CRGs in OS. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to verify the expression of CRLncs in OS. Six CRLncs that can guide OS prognosis and immune microenvironment were obtained, including three high-risk CRLncs (AL645608.6, AL591767.1, and UNC5B-AS1) and three low-risk CRLncs (CARD8-AS1, AC098487.1, and AC005041.3). Immune cells such as B cells, macrophages, T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells, regulatory T cells (Treg), and immune functions such as APC co-inhibition, checkpoint, and T-cell co-inhibition were significantly downregulated in high-risk groups. In addition, we obtained four drugs with potential efficacy for OS: AUY922, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and Z.LLNle.CHO. The expression of LIPT1, DLAT, and FDX1 at both mRNA and protein levels was significantly elevated in OS cell lines compared with normal osteoblast hFOB1.19. The mRNA expression level of AL591767.1 was decreased in OS, and that of AL645608.6, CARD8-AS1, AC005041.3, AC098487.1, and UNC5B-AS1 was upregulated in OS. CRLncs that can guide OS prognosis and the immune microenvironment and drugs that may have a potential curative effect on OS obtained in this study provide a theoretical basis for OS survival research and clinical decision-making.",,375
2253,35967178,A Rarity Among the Rare: Psychiatric Manifestations in a Young Woman With Stiff-Person Syndrome.,"Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare progressive neurologic disease associated with autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, an intracellular enzyme involved in the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid.  We present a case involving a 35-year-old Haitian female who was placed under the Baker Act in the emergency department for suicidal behavior and acute psychosis. She has a history of SPS with a positive glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody, a condition most commonly found in females between 20 and 50 years of age. The condition was managed by an outpatient neurologist using diazepam, baclofen, and monthly intravenous immunoglobulin treatments. She also has an extensive history of organic neurological conditions, including traumatic brain injury at 18 years old and COVID-19-related anoxic encephalitis that occurred in December 2020. Both psychiatric and neurological physical exams were completed. They revealed a cerebellar tremor, bilateral ptosis, poor eye contact, decreased concentration, poor insight, depressed mood, flat affect, poor judgement, delusional thoughts and a disorganized thought process with tangential speech. CT and MRI imaging of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities. A quantitative titer of the GAD antibody was completed and shown to be elevated >250IU/mL. Depakote 500mg twice daily and risperidone 3mg twice daily were prescribed. The patient had progressive improvement of psychosis including delusional thoughts over the following five days and was able to be discharged with instructions to follow-up with outpatient neurology.",,376
512,35978747,Evaluating Visual Photoplethysmography Method.,"Regular monitoring of common physiological signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, can be an effective way to either prevent or detect many kinds of chronic conditions. In particular, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a worldwide concern. According to the World Health Organization, 32% of all deaths worldwide are from CVDs. In addition, stress-related illnesses cost $190 billion in healthcare costs per year. Currently, contact devices are required to extract most of an individual's physiological information, which can be uncomfortable for users and can cause discomfort. However, in recent years, remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology is gaining interest, which enables contactless monitoring of the blood volume pulse signal using a regular camera, and ultimately can provide the same physiological information as a contact device. In this paper, we propose a benchmark comparison using a new multimodal database consisting of 56 subjects where each subject was submitted to three different tasks. Each subject wore a wearable device capable of extracting photoplethysmography signals and was filmed to allow simultaneous rPPG signal extraction. Several experiments were conducted, including a comparison between information from contact and remote signals and stress state recognition. Results have shown that in this dataset, rPPG signals were capable of dealing with motion artifacts better than contact PPG sensors and overall had better quality if compared to the signals from the contact sensor. Moreover, the statistical analysis of the variance method had shown that at least two heart-rate variability (HRV) features, NNi 20 and SAMPEN, were capable of differentiating between stress and non-stress states. In addition, three features, inter-beat interval (IBI), NNi 20, and SAMPEN, were capable of differentiating between tasks relating to different levels of difficulty. Furthermore, using machine learning to classify a stressed or unstressed state, the models were able to achieve an accuracy score of 83.11%.",,377
1119,35974500,Gene-influx-driven evolution.,"Here we analyze the evolutionary process in the presence of continuous influx of genotypes with submaximum fitness from the outside to the given habitat with finite resources. We show that strong influx from the outside allows the low-fitness genotype to win the competition with the higher fitness genotype, and in a finite population, drive the latter to extinction. We analyze a mathematical model of this phenomenon and obtain the conditions for the transition from the high-fitness to the low-fitness genotype caused by the influx of the latter. We calculate the time to extinction of the high-fitness genotype in a finite population with two alleles and find the exact analytical dynamics of extinction for the case of many genes with epistasis. We solve a related quasispecies model for a single peak (random) fitness landscape as well as for a symmetric fitness landscape. In the symmetric landscape, a nonperturbative effect is observed such that even an extremely low influx of the low-fitness genotype drastically changes the steady state fitness distribution. A similar nonperturbative phenomenon is observed for the allele fixation time as well. The identified regime of influx-driven evolution appears to be relevant for a broad class of biological systems and could be central to the evolution of prokaryotes and viruses.",,378
1399,35968618,Results of percutaneous cervical vertebroplasty using an anterolateral approach for cervical spine tumors.,"The aim of this study was to report the results of percutaneous vertebroplasty in managing symptomatic osteolytic cervical spine tumors. This study comprised a retrospective examination of patients who received percutaneous vertebroplasty between 2008 and 2020 for the treatment of tumor-induced symptomatic cervical vertebra involvement. The study summarized the demographics, vertebral levels, pain control rates, clinical results, and complications of percutaneous vertebroplasty using an anterolateral approach. The study sample consisted of 6 female and 2 male patients aged between 20 and 56 (mean=41.37) years. Tumors were located at C2 in 6 cases, at C3 in 1 case, and at C5 in another. The mean volume of poly (methyl methacrylate) injected was 1.5 mL (range: 1-2 mL). Biopsy results showed the presence of metastasis in 5 cases and plasmacytoma in 3. No postoperative complications or mortality were observed after the procedure. Preoperative mean 7.75 visual analog scale score decreased to 2.62. Pain control was reported to be 66.2%. Anterolateral cervical vertebroplasty seems to be a safe, effective, and helpful therapeutic alternative for the treatment of cervical spine tumors. It reduces the risk of infection compared to the transoral method. Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",,379
787,35975050,"Casiopeinas® third generation, with indomethacin: synthesis, characterization, DFT studies, antiproliferative activity, and nanoencapsulation.","Seven new Casiopeinas® were synthesized and properly characterized. These novel compounds have a general formula [Cu(N-N)(Indo)]NO3, where Indo is deprotonated indomethacin and N-N is either bipyridine or phenanthroline with some methyl-substituted derivatives, belonging to the third generation of Casiopeinas®. Spectroscopic characterization suggests a square-based pyramid geometry and voltammetry experiments indicate that the redox potential is strongly dependent on the N-N ligand. All the presented compounds show high cytotoxic efficiency, and most of them exhibit higher efficacy compared to the well-known cisplatin drug and acetylacetonate analogs of the first generation. Computational calculations show that antiproliferative behavior can be directly related to the volume of the molecules. Besides, a chitosan (CS)-polyacrylamide (PNIPAAm) nanogel was synthesized and characterized to examine the encapsulation and release properties of the [Cu(4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(Indo)]NO3 compound. The results show good encapsulation performance in acidic conditions and a higher kinetic drug release in acidic media than at neutral pH. This result can be described by the Peppas-Sahlin model and indicates a release mechanism predominantly by Fick diffusion.",,380
1475,35968422,Cultivation and interpretation of students' psychological quality: Vocal psychological model.,"Reflecting students' mental health data through vocal music teaching expressive system is a research hotspot in vocal music teaching psychology. Based on the theory of students' expressiveness in vocal music teaching, this paper constructs a psychological model of vocal music teaching. The model uses psychological data mining technology to conduct a feasibility study and analysis on the mental health education of vocal music students, solves the quantitative problem of mental health, and analyzes the relationship between psychological problems and students. In the simulation process, the psychological data of the vocal music freshmen of a certain college was taken as the research object, and the association rule Apriori algorithm was used to analyze the relationship between the factors of the psychological dimension. Psychological data mining was carried out, and descriptive indicators and univariate analysis methods were used to analyze the current situation of students' mental health and personality characteristics, and Pearson correlation analysis and structural equation model were used to explore the relationship between their mental health and personality characteristics. The amount of vocal music learning is the duration of the load and the total number of tasks completed within a single exercise or a series of exercises. ASP-NET and SQLServer2008 and other experimental results show that the chi-square test value of the overall fit of the model is 20.078, and the ratio of the chi-square value to the degree of freedom is 4.016, which has a relatively high accuracy and effectively enhances the psychological data mining technology in vocal music students for operation and practicality of applications in health data analysis.",,381
2412,35966899,Fluoxetine-induced urinary retention in a cat.,"A 2-year-old neutered male domestic shorthair cat presented for a history of several weeks of infrequent urination and hyporexia progressing to anorexia. The cat had been normal prior to being placed on fluoxetine to treat inter-cat aggression, after which it began to display weight loss, hyporexia and abnormal urination habits. The cat had been seen by various veterinary hospitals previously and treated for suspected feline lower urinary tract disease. When the patient still had urinary retention despite perineal urethrostomy surgery, it was presented for ongoing care. Contrast urethrogram showed a mild questionable proximal ureteral narrowing, but other diagnostics were unremarkable. The patient was trialed on various medications, including alpha-antagonists, cholinergics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and different analgesics with no improvement, but would reproducibly urinate only following administration of midazolam intravenously. Ultimately, the cat began urinating normally following the discontinuation of fluoxetine. The cat was urinating normally upon discharge, and when it presented for another complaint several months later, its weight, appetite and urination habits were normal. Fluoxetine is a commonly utilized medication in behavioral medicine. Despite its common use and reports of urinary retention secondary to this medication in humans, this potential side effect is not reported in various veterinary pharmacologic textbooks or the veterinary literature. To our knowledge, this is the first report in veterinary medicine to describe urinary retention suspected to be secondary to prolonged administration of fluoxetine at an excessive dose.",,382
1519,35968367,Imagining interceptions: Eye movements as an online indicator of covert motor processes during motor imagery.,"The analysis of eye movements during motor imagery has been used to understand the influence of covert motor processes on visual-perceptual activity. There is evidence showing that gaze metrics seem to be affected by motor planning often dependent on the spatial and temporal characteristics of a task. However, previous research has focused on simulated actions toward static targets with limited empirical evidence of how eye movements change in more dynamic environments. The study examined the characteristics of eye movements during motor imagery for an interception task. Twenty-four participants were asked to track a moving target over a computer display and either mentally simulate an interception or rest. The results showed that smooth pursuit variables, such as duration and gain, were lower during motor imagery when compared to passive observation. These findings indicate that motor plans integrate visual-perceptual information based on task demands and that eye movements during imagery reflect such constraint.",,383
644,35976788,A tonoplast-localized magnesium transporter is crucial for stomatal opening in Arabidopsis under high Mg2+ conditions.,"Plant stomata play an important role in CO2 uptake for photosynthesis and transpiration, but the mechanisms underlying stomatal opening and closing under changing environmental conditions are still not completely understood. Through large-scale genetic screening, we isolated an Arabidopsis mutant (closed stomata2 (cst2)) that is defective in stomatal opening. We cloned the causal gene (MGR1/CST2) and functionally characterized this gene. The mutant phenotype was caused by a mutation in a gene encoding an unknown protein with similarities to the human magnesium (Mg2+ ) efflux transporter ACDP/CNNM. MGR1/CST2 was localized to the tonoplast and showed transport activity for Mg2+ . This protein was constitutively and highly expressed in guard cells. Knockout of this gene resulted in stomatal closing, decreased photosynthesis and growth retardation, especially under high Mg2+ conditions, while overexpression of this gene increased stomatal opening and tolerance to high Mg2+ concentrations. Furthermore, guard cell-specific expression of MGR1/CST2 in the mutant partially restored its stomatal opening. Our results indicate that MGR1/CST2 expression in the leaf guard cells plays an important role in maintaining cytosolic Mg2+ concentrations through sequestering Mg2+ into vacuoles, which is required for stomatal opening, especially under high Mg2+ conditions.",,384
1549,35968337,SHMT2 promotes tumor growth through VEGF and MAPK signaling pathway in breast cancer.,"Cancer cells modulate their metabolic activities to adapt to their growth and proliferation. Despite advances in breast cancer biology having led to the widespread use of molecular targeted therapy and hormonal drugs, the molecular mechanisms in metabolism related to the regulation of breast cancer cell proliferation are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate the possible role of SHMT2, a key enzyme in serine metabolism, in breast cancer. Firstly, SHMT2 is found highly expressed in both breast cancer cells and tissues, and patients with high expression of SHMT2 have a worse prognosis. Moreover, the intervention of SHMT2 by either knockdown or over-expression in vitro induces the effect on breast cancer proliferation. Mechanistically, RNA-seq shows that over-expression of SHMT2 affect multiple signaling pathways and biological process in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we confirm that SHMT2 promotes breast cancer cell growth through MAPK and VEGF signaling pathways. Finally, we verify the role of SHMT2 in promoting breast cancer growth in the xenograft tumor model. Our results indicate that SHMT2 plays a critical role in regulating breast cancer growth through MAPK, and VEGF signaling pathways, and maybe serve as a therapeutic target for breast cancer therapy.",,385
2353,35967023,"Antiproliferative Activities of the Lipophilic Fraction of Eucalyptus camaldulensis against MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells, UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS Metabolite Profile, and Antioxidative Functions.","Although a number of pharmacological properties have been linked to Eucalyptus camaldulensis leaf essential oil and extracts, the biological attributes of the lipophilic fraction remain unknown. Moreover, only a limited number of active compounds have so far been identified. This work aimed to investigate the anti-oxidative, anti-aggregation, and cytotoxic properties as well as profile the secondary metabolites in the lipophilic fraction of E. camaldulensis leaf extract (Lipo-Eucam) using UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). It was found that Lipo-Eucam possessed potent antioxidant properties against DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP with IC50 values of 31.46, 32.78, and 10.12 μg/mL, respectively. The fraction was able to attenuate metal-catalyzed oxidation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05) and abrogated the aggregation of amyloidogenic BSA as revealed by the Congo red assay and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, Lipo-Eucam demonstrated potent cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 (IC50 7.34 μg/mL) but was noncytotoxic at used concentrations against HEK-293 cells (IC50 > 80 μg/mL), suggestive of its selective anticancer properties. Spectrophotometric, UHPLC-MS, and GC-MS analysis revealed that Lipo-Eucam is rich in phenolics, flavonoids, terpenoids, volatile constituents, and a plethora of active metabolites, probably responsible for the observed activities. These findings indicate that Lipo-Eucam is endowed with pharmacologically relevant active principles with strong potential for use in the amelioration of disease conditions related to oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and breast cancer and therefore worthy of further investigations.",,386
2494,35966720,Improving depression and perceived social support enhances overall quality of life among myocardial infarction survivors: necessity for integrating mental health care into cardiac rehabilitation programs.,"Depression and low perceived social support (PSS) have been found to deleteriously affect quality of life (QoL) among myocardial infarction (MI) survivors. The complex relationship between these variables has not been assessed. We wanted to assess first the prevalence of depression among MI survivors and whether depression mediates the effect of PSS on QoL and, second, whether the physical and social domains of QoL mediated the effect of depression and PSS on the emotional domain. This cross-sectional study was done among MI survivors using Cardiac Depression Scale, MacNew Quality of Life After Myocardial Infarction Questionnaire and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support to assess for depression, QoL and PSS respectively. A total of 103 MI survivors were included in the study, and the mean age was 59.66 (± 10.42) years. Depression was found in 21.36% of the participants. The indirect effect of PSS on QoL with depression as a mediator was significant (b = 0.15, p < 0.001, 95% CI 0.12, 0.18). The direct effect of PSS on QoL controlling for depression was also significant (b = 0.05, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.07). Depression as a mediator in the relationship explained 75.3% of the effect of PSS on QoL. PSS and depression did not have a significant direct effect on emotional QoL, but it became significant when the physical and social domains were included in the model. The total indirect effects of PSS and depression on emotional QoL were b = 0.16, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.17 and b = - 0.05, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.06, - 0.03, respectively. Depression and poor PSS impair physical and social domains, which impairs the emotional domain of QoL; as such, overall QoL is undermined. As limited physical and social activity because of depression and poor PSS may increase the risk of further cardiovascular events, a holistic approach which includes mental health care is warranted.",,387
436,35979148,Evaluation of 3T proton MR spectroscopy in the spinal cord - preliminary results.,"1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a non-invasive technique that provides information on tissue metabolism and biochemistry. Because of technical difficulties, this method is rarely used in spinal cord examination. The main goal of this study was to develop a routine protocol for MRS of intramedullary lesions. A 1H-MRS protocol was set on a group of healthy volunteers. Forty-eight spectra were acquired in total. Thirty of them were acquired in cervical spinal cord, and the remaining 18 spectra were acquired in the thoracic spinal cord. In 1H-MRS of the spinal cord one of the most important problems is small voxel size. Mean voxel size in this study was 7 × 9 × 29 mm, which is much smaller than in brain examinations. Finally, almost 60% of spectra were of acceptable quality in volunteer examinations, which enabled the subsequent examinations. Challenges of spinal cord spectroscopy were discussed, and the ability of providing additional diagnostic information was proven.",,388
1627,35968151,"Bacillus thuringiensis PM25 ameliorates oxidative damage of salinity stress in maize via regulating growth, leaf pigments, antioxidant defense system, and stress responsive gene expression.","Soil salinity is the major abiotic stress that disrupts nutrient uptake, hinders plant growth, and threatens agricultural production. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are the most promising eco-friendly beneficial microorganisms that can be used to improve plant responses against biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, a previously identified B. thuringiensis PM25 showed tolerance to salinity stress up to 3 M NaCl. The Halo-tolerant Bacillus thuringiensis PM25 demonstrated distinct salinity tolerance and enhance plant growth-promoting activities under salinity stress. Antibiotic-resistant Iturin C (ItuC) and bio-surfactant-producing (sfp and srfAA) genes that confer biotic and abiotic stresses were also amplified in B. thuringiensis PM25. Under salinity stress, the physiological and molecular processes were followed by the over-expression of stress-related genes (APX and SOD) in B. thuringiensis PM25. The results detected that B. thuringiensis PM25 inoculation substantially improved phenotypic traits, chlorophyll content, radical scavenging capability, and relative water content under salinity stress. Under salinity stress, the inoculation of B. thuringiensis PM25 significantly increased antioxidant enzyme levels in inoculated maize as compared to uninoculated plants. In addition, B. thuringiensis PM25-inoculation dramatically increased soluble sugars, proteins, total phenols, and flavonoids in maize as compared to uninoculated plants. The inoculation of B. thuringiensis PM25 significantly reduced oxidative burst in inoculated maize under salinity stress, compared to uninoculated plants. Furthermore, B. thuringiensis PM25-inoculated plants had higher levels of compatible solutes than uninoculated controls. The current results demonstrated that B. thuringiensis PM25 plays an important role in reducing salinity stress by influencing antioxidant defense systems and abiotic stress-related genes. These findings also suggest that multi-stress tolerant B. thuringiensis PM25 could enhance plant growth by mitigating salt stress, which might be used as an innovative tool for enhancing plant yield and productivity.",,389
984,35974635,Transition in collective motion decision making.,"Collective decision making in a biological motion group requires fast and robust transmission of information. Typically, directional switching information propagation across the whole group obeys a linear dispersion law. However, conventional dynamic collective motion models, such as the Vicsek model and the Couzin model did not take into account ultrafast directional synchronous motions. In the present paper, a multiparticle model is proposed based on inertial spin self-propel action, which can provide adequate description of such group motion. By considering both spin mechanism and collision avoidance, the proposed self-propelled particle spin model can nicely describe collective motion with fast directional switching. By analyzing the order parameter of the group-velocity synchronization, a mechanism of group decision making is revealed, which is based on the difference between two clusters of divergent leaders, showing a transition from the compromising phase (i.e., following the group average) to the preferred phase (i.e., aligning to a leader cluster). The finding provides new insight to the decision-making process of followers when they face with divergent leaders in group motion.",,390
1670,35968104,Heat wave event facilitates defensive responses in invasive C3 plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. under elevated CO2 concentration to the detriment of Ophraella communa.,"To predict and mitigate the effects of climate change on communities and ecosystems, the joint effects of extreme climatic events on species interactions need to be understood. Using the common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.)-leaf beetle (Ophraella communa) system, we investigated the effects of heat wave and elevated CO2 on common ragweed growth, secondary metabolism, and the consequent impacts on the beetle. The results showed that elevated CO2 and heat wave facilitated A. artemisiifolia growth; further, A. artemisiifolia accumulated large amounts of defensive secondary metabolites. Being fed on A. artemisiifolia grown under elevated CO2 and heat wave conditions resulted in the poor performance of O. communa (high mortality, long development period, and low reproduction). Overall, under elevated CO2, heat wave improved the defensive ability of A. artemisiifolia against herbivores. On the other hand, enhanced adaptability to climatic changes may aggravate invasive plant distribution, posing a challenge to the control of invasive plants in the future.",,391

However, energy distribution between different degrees of freedom in systems with long-range interactions is unclear. We study the dynamics of energy relaxation in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou β model with long-range quartic interactions, which decay as 1/d^{δ} with d being the lattice distance. The dynamic crossover of a mode-energy distribution from localized to equipartitioned with the increase of the power δ is observed. A transition of mode-energy distribution is identified around the value of δ=1, which usually serves as the distinction between strong and weak long-range couplings. We elucidate that the varying frequency overlapping of the mode-energy power spectrum is responsible for this dynamic crossover. Through further calculation of the spectral entropy, the minimum duration of quasistationary states, τ_{QSS}, is found at δ=2, which may provide possible dynamic explanations for the peculiar behavior of heat transport in long-range lattice chains. In addition, the double scaling in τ_{QSS} as a function of energy density is also observed in our long-range lattices. Our results not only contribute to understanding the dynamics of energy relaxation in long-range systems, but also shed light on the longstanding problem of thermalization and low-dimensional heat transport in short-range systems.",,392
387,35979287,Preliminary evidence in treatment of eosinophilic gastroenteritis in children: A case series.,"Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare inflammatory disorder in children. However, there is still no standard guideline in the treatment of pediatric eosinophilic gastroenteritis. To report our experience with the diagnosis and treatment of children with eosinophilic gastroenteritis. From January 2017 to December 2019, a total of 22 children were diagnosed with eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Endoscopic examination showed eosinophil infiltration in the duodenum [mean number of eosinophils/high-power field (HPF) = 53.1 ± 81.5], stomach (mean number of eosinophils/HPF = 36.8 ± 50.5), and terminal ileum (mean number of eosinophils/HPF = 49.0 ± 24.0). All 18 children with low eosinophil infiltration (< 14%) responded well to the initial drug treatment without relapse, while two of four children with high eosinophil infiltration (> 14%) relapsed after initial methylprednisolone/montelukast treatment. In addition, children with high eosinophil infiltration (> 14%) showed symptomatic relief and histological remission without further relapse after receiving budesonide/methylprednisolone as initial or relapse treatment. Methylprednisolone/montelukast is still the best treatment for children with low eosinophil infiltration (< 14%). Budesonide can be considered as the initial or relapse treatment for children with high eosinophil infiltration (> 14%).",,393
1425,35968475,Short-Term Prediction of COVID-19 Using Novel Hybrid Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and Error Trend Seasonal Model.,"In this article, a new hybrid time series model is proposed to predict COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and deaths. Due to the variations and complexity in the data, it is very difficult to predict its future trajectory using linear time series or mathematical models. In this research article, a novel hybrid ensemble empirical mode decomposition and error trend seasonal (EEMD-ETS) model has been developed to forecast the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed hybrid model decomposes the complex, nonlinear, and nonstationary data into different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from low to high frequencies, and a single monotone residue by applying EEMD. The stationarity of each IMF component is checked with the help of the augmented Dicky-Fuller (ADF) test and is then used to build up the EEMD-ETS model, and finally, future predictions have been obtained from the proposed hybrid model. For illustration purposes and to check the performance of the proposed model, four datasets of daily confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), and France have been used. Similarly, four different statistical metrics, i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), symmetric mean absolute parentage error (sMAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) have been used for a comparison of different time series models. It is evident from the results that the proposed hybrid EEMD-ETS model outperforms the other time series and machine learning models. Hence, it is worthy to be used as an effective model for the prediction of COVID-19.",,394
1544,35968342,Interfering with ITGB1-DT expression delays cancer progression and promotes cell sensitivity of NSCLC to cisplatin by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK pathway.,"Long non-coding RNA ITGB1-DT is involved in the regulation of cancer growth and metastasis. However, the roles of ITGB1-DT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression and sensitivity to cisplatin has not been elucidated. ITGB1-DT expression in NSCLC tissues, and the relationship between ITGB1-DT expression with NSCLC diagnosis, prognosis, clinicopathological features, and immune cell infiltration were investigated in The Cancer Gene Atlas (TCGA) database. The roles and mechanisms of ITGB1-DT in cell growth, migration, and drug sensitivity of NSCLC cells were explored in the cell model. The prognostic nomograms of ITGB1-DT-related genes were evaluated using bioinformatics. ITGB1-DT was overexpressed in NSCLC. Elevated ITGB1-DT expression was related to the late T stage, N stage, M stage, short overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI) of NSCLC patients. ITGB1-DT was the independent risk factors for poor prognosis, and had diagnostic value for NSCLC patients. Interfering with the ITGB1-DT expression can inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of A549, H1299, and drug-resistant A549/DDP, possibly due to the inhibition of p38 MAPK and ERK phosphorylation levels. ITGB1-DT expression was correlated with the levels of NSCLC immune infiltration cells, such as the TReg, Th, and NK cells. ITGB1-DT-related gene nomograms were associated with the prognosis, and were expected to evaluate the prognosis of NSCLC patients. In conclusion, inhibition of ITGB1-DT expression delayed the growth and metastasis of NSCLC using the MAPK/ERK signaling mechanism and enhanced the sensitivity of NSCLC to cisplatin drugs. These results indicate that ITGB1-DT might be a biomarker for evaluating the diagnosis and prognosis of NSCLC patients.",,395
561,35978573,Binding Affinity Quantifications of the Bacteriophage Mu DNA Modification Protein Mom Using Microscale Thermophoresis (MST).,"Epigenetic modifications play diverse roles in biological systems. Nucleic acid modifications control gene expression, protein synthesis, and sensitivity to nucleic acid-cleaving enzymes. However, the mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of nucleic acid modifications can be challenging to identify. Studying protein-ligand interactions helps decipher biosynthetic and regulatory pathways underlying biological reactions. Here, we describe a fluorescence labeling-based quantitative method for unraveling the biomolecular interactions of bacteriophage Mu DNA modification protein Mom with its ligands, using microscale thermophoresis (MST). Compared to traditional methods for studying protein-biomolecular interactions, MST requires significantly lower sample amounts, volumes, and analysis time, thus allowing screening of a large number of candidates for interaction with a protein of interest. Another distinguishing feature of the method is that it obviates the need for protein purification, often a time- and resource-consuming step, and works well with whole or partially purified cell extracts. Importantly, the method is sensitive over a broad range of molecular affinities while offering great specificity and can be used to interrogate ligands ranging from metal ions to macromolecules. Although we established this method for a DNA modification protein, it can easily be adapted to study a variety of molecular interactions engaged by proteins.",,396
2383,35966990,Hypersensitivity to passive voice hearing in hallucination proneness.,"Voices are a complex and rich acoustic signal processed in an extensive cortical brain network. Specialized regions within this network support voice perception and production and may be differentially affected in pathological voice processing. For example, the experience of hallucinating voices has been linked to hyperactivity in temporal and extra-temporal voice areas, possibly extending into regions associated with vocalization. Predominant self-monitoring hypotheses ascribe a primary role of voice production regions to auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). Alternative postulations view a generalized perceptual salience bias as causal to AVH. These theories are not mutually exclusive as both ascribe the emergence and phenomenology of AVH to unbalanced top-down and bottom-up signal processing. The focus of the current study was to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying predisposition brain states for emergent hallucinations, detached from the effects of inner speech. Using the temporal voice area (TVA) localizer task, we explored putative hypersalient responses to passively presented sounds in relation to hallucination proneness (HP). Furthermore, to avoid confounds commonly found in in clinical samples, we employed the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale (LSHS) for the quantification of HP levels in healthy people across an experiential continuum spanning the general population. We report increased activation in the right posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) during the perception of voice features that positively correlates with increased HP scores. In line with prior results, we propose that this right-lateralized pSTG activation might indicate early hypersensitivity to acoustic features coding speaker identity that extends beyond own voice production to perception in healthy participants prone to experience AVH.",,397
2373,35967001,Alterations in motor modules and their contribution to limitations in force control in the upper extremity after stroke.,"The generation of isometric force at the hand can be mediated by activating a few motor modules. Stroke induces alterations in motor modules underlying steady-state isometric force generation in the human upper extremity (UE). However, how the altered motor modules impact task performance (force production) remains unclear as stroke survivors develop and converge to the three-dimensional (3D) target force. Thus, we tested whether stroke-specific motor modules would be activated from the onset of force generation and also examined how alterations in motor modules would induce changes in force representation. During 3D isometric force development, electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded from eight major elbow and shoulder muscles in the paretic arm of 10 chronic hemispheric stroke survivors and both arms of six age-matched control participants. A non-negative matrix factorization algorithm identified motor modules in four different time windows: three exploratory force ramping phases (Ramps 1-3; 0-33%, 33-67%, and 67-100% of target force magnitude, respectively) and the stable force match phase (Hold). Motor module similarity and between-force coupling were examined by calculating the scalar product and Pearson correlation across the phases. To investigate the association between the end-point force representation and the activation of the motor modules, principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate multiple linear regression analyses were applied. In addition, the force components regressed on the activation profiles of motor modules were utilized to model the feasible force direction. Both stroke and control groups developed exploratory isometric forces with a non-linear relationship between EMG and force. During the force matching, only the stroke group showed abnormal between-force coupling in medial-lateral and backward-forward and medial-lateral and downward-upward directions. In each group, the same motor modules, including the abnormal deltoid module in stroke survivors, were expressed from the beginning of force development instead of emerging during the force exploration. The PCA and the multivariate multiple linear regression analyses showed that alterations in motor modules were associated with abnormal between-force coupling and limited feasible force direction after stroke. Overall, these results suggest that alterations in intermuscular coordination contribute to the abnormal end-point force control under isometric conditions in the UE after stroke.",,398
1797,35967858,Genetic characterization and passage instability of a novel hybrid virulence plasmid in a ST23 hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae.,"Hypervirulent variants of Klebsiella pnuemoniae (hvKP), which causes life-threatening infections, is a global priority pathogen and frequently harbours virulence plasmids. The virulence plasmids have emerged as the predominant vehicles carrying the major pathogenic determinants of hypermucoviscosity and hypervirulence phenotypes. In the present study, we characterized a novel virulence plasmid in AP8555, an ST23 hvKP strain, which induced a metastatic infection and fatal septic shock in a critically ill patient. The serum killing assay, the quantitative biofilm formation assay, the G.mellonella infection model, and the mouse lethality assay demonstrated that AP8555 was almost as virulent as the hvKP strain NUTH-K2044. The plasmid pAP855 could be conjugated to Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ATCC700603 and E. coli J53 at a frequency of 7.2× 10-5 and 8.7× 10-7, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis confirmed that the plasmid was novel, clustered to the incompatibility type of IncHI1B/IncFIB/IncFII and presented high similarity to the pK2044 plasmid. In contrast, a 130-kb large-fragment insertion was observed on the plasmid, which introduced a genetic hybrid zone with multiple conjugation-related genes of type IV secretion systems (T4SS) and CcdAB toxin-antitoxin systems (TAS) to the plasmid. In the transconjugants, the presence of pAP855 had a negative impact on bacterial fitness, but enhancing the virulence-associated phenotypes. In vitro evolution experiments showed that pAP855 in the transconjugants could not be stably inherited after 10 days of passage. Our study not only reports a novel hybrid plasmid but also highlights the putative pathway of conjugative virulence plasmid formation and evolution by means of genetic rearrangement through sequence insertion. These findings indicate that structural versatility could contribute to the dissemination of cointegrate virulence plasmid, although the plasmid incurred a fitness cost. Therefore, continuous monitoring the acquisition of conjugative virulence plasmids may have critical value for plasmid research and increase awareness of hvKP.",,399
825,35974946,Giant cell arteritis and scleritis: A rare association.,"Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitis of the large and medium-sized arteries in the elderly whose ischemic complications adversely affect the eye. The irreversible loss of visual acuity is most often related to acute anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Very few cases of scleritis have been described in the literature. The patient presented an obvious case of giant cell arteritis, initially revealed by an ophthalmologic involvement in the form of posterior scleritis, an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) involvement with vestibular and neurological involvement with a type of peripheral neuropathy, all evolving in the context of a weight loss of 8 kg and a marked biological inflammatory syndrome. The patient presented several relapses of giant cell arteritis in the form of several episodes of anterior and posterior, right and left, and even bilateral, isolated scleritis without any other clinical or biological abnormalities, always in conjunction with a decrease in corticosteroid therapy. In the presence of corticosteroid dependence and resistance to methotrexate, tocilizumab was initiated. The therapeutic management of scleritis associated with giant cell arteritis is difficult. In the absence of a codified scheme, the treatment remains empirical, based on the experience of the various teams. In this context, biotherapies (anti-IL6 type, such as tocilizumab) are increasingly used.",,400
467,35978918,Myasthenia gravis that has developed long after radical resection of lung cancer: A case report.,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the most common disorder of neuromuscular transmission and is a heterogeneous disorder generally caused by auto-antibody to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The current study presented a rare case of MG that occurred a long time after surgical resection of lung cancer. A 58-year-old man with lung adenocarcinoma underwent upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Severe myasthenic symptoms began 7 years after the operation, and emergent mechanical ventilation was needed because of myasthenic crises. Levels of serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody were high and typical decremental responses to repetitive stimulation on electromyography were observed. Appropriate therapies for a severe acute condition were performed, and MG has been controlled for 6 years since then. There is no recurrence of lung cancer or appearance of thymoma. In conclusion, although very rare, physicians should be aware of MG as a potential comorbidity developing in patients with a history of lung cancer.",,401
1027,35974592,Role of extended coupling in bidirectional transport system.,"Motivated by vehicular traffic phenomena, we study a bidirectional two-lane open totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with extended symmetric coupling conditions in the presence of Langmuir kinetics. The phase diagrams and density profiles are calculated utilizing mean-field theory for different lane-changing rates and are found to be in a good match with Monte Carlo simulation results. It has been observed that the qualitative topology of phase diagrams depends on the lane-switching rate significantly, resulting in nonmonotonic variations in the number of steady-state phases. The proposed model provides various mixed phases leading to bulk induced phase transitions. The interplay between bidirectional movement, extended coupling conditions, and Langmuir kinetics produces unusual phenomena, including a back-and-forth phase transition and partial phase division of the shock region for comparatively smaller values of the lane-changing rate. Moreover, we analyze the shock dynamics and calculate critical values for the lane-changing rate at which the phases appear or disappear.",,402
1190,35972187,Prevalence of oral lichen planus in patients with diabetes mellitus: A cross-sectional study.,"Oral lichen planus, a chronic inflammatory immune disease, occurs in the oral mucosa. We aimed to assess the prevalence and possible influencing factors of oral lichen planus in patients with diabetes mellitus. This cross-sectional study involved 525 patients with diabetes mellitus and 525 controls. We collected information on blood glucose level, duration of diabetes, diabetic complications, treatment methods, other systemic diseases and medication history. Oral lichen planus was significantly more prevalent in the diabetes mellitus/type 2 diabetes mellitus group than in the controls (2.3%/2.2% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.019/0.022). There was no significant association between patients with diabetes mellitus with and those without oral lichen planus in age (p = 0.195), sex (p = 0.390), blood glucose level (p = 1), duration of diabetes (p = 0.638), diabetic complications (p = 1), treatment methods (p = 0.962), other systemic diseases (p = 0.891) and medication history (p = 0.848). Diabetes mellitus was associated with oral lichen planus; there was a higher prevalence of oral lichen planus in patients with diabetes mellitus/type 2 diabetes mellitus than in those without diabetes. Oral lichen planus development in patients with diabetes mellitus was not significantly associated with age, sex, blood glucose level, duration of diabetes, diabetic complications, treatment methods, other systemic diseases and medication history.",,403
233,35982787,LGP2 is essential for zebrafish survival through dual regulation of IFN antiviral response.,"In mammals, LGP2 is the enigmatic RLR family member, being initially believed as an inhibitor of RLR-triggered IFN response but subsequently as an activator of MDA5 signaling and an inhibitor of RIG-I signaling. The contradiction happens to fish LGP2. Here, we generate a lgp2 loss-of-function (lgp2 lof/lof ) zebrafish mutant, which is highly susceptible to SVCV infection, displaying an initially decreased activation of IFN response and a following increased one. Mechanistically, zebrafish LGP2 functions as the essential activator of IFN response dependent on MDA5 at the early stage of viral infection but as a negative regulator by impairing mRNA levels of tbk1 and ikki at the late stage of viral infection. The function switch of LGP2 is related to cellular IFN production during viral infection. Our data demonstrate that zebrafish LGP2 is a key homeostatic regulator of IFN response and thus essential for zebrafish survival against SVCV infection.",,404
2499,35966711,Influence of planting methods and organic amendments on rice yield and bacterial communities in the rhizosphere soil.,"A comprehensive understanding of rice cultivation techniques and organic amendments affecting soil quality, enzyme activities and bacterial community structure is crucial. We investigated two planting methods (direct seeding and transplanting) of paddy rice (Oryza sativa) and organic amendments with rice straw and biochar on crop yield and soil biological and physicochemical properties. Rhizosphere bacterial communities at the maturity stage of rice growth were characterized through high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing. Soil biochemical properties and enzyme activity levels were analyzed. Grain yield of paddy rice with transplanting increased 10.6% more than that with direct seeding. The application of rice straw increased grain yield by 7.1 and 8.2%, more than with biochar and the control, respectively. Compared to biochar and the control, the application of rice straw significantly increased sucrase, cellulase, protease, organic carbon, available phosphorus, nitrate, and ammonium. The application of biochar increased microbial biomass nitrogen and carbon, urease, pH, available nitrogen, and available potassium compared to the application of rice straw and the control. Principal coordinate analysis and dissimilarity distances confirmed significant differences among the microbial communities associated with planting methods and organic amendments. Bacteroidetes, Nitrospirae, Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadetes abundance increased with rice straw relative to biochar and the control. The biochar addition was associated with significant increases in Chloroflexi, Patescibacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria abundance. Pearson's correlation analyzes showed that Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes and Nitrospirae abundance was positively correlated with grain yield. The relative abundance of these bacteria in soil may be beneficial for improving grain yield. These results suggest that planting methods and organic amendments impact soil biochemical characteristics, enzyme activity levels, and microbial community composition.",,405
1679,35968094,Analyzing the effect of ion binding to the membrane-surface on regulating the light-induced transthylakoid electric potential (ΔΨm).,"The transthylakoid membrane potential (ΔΨm) is essential because it can drive the ATP synthesis through the CF0-CF1 type of ATP-synthase in chloroplasts as an energetic equivalent similar to ΔpH. In addition, a high fraction of proton motive force (PMF) stored as the ΔΨm component is physiologically important in the acclimation of photosynthesis to environmental stresses. It has been shown that ΔΨm is the sum of the Donnan potential difference (ΔΨdn) and the diffusion potential difference (ΔΨd). Specifically, ΔΨdn, ΔΨd, and ΔΨm are strongly associated with the ionic activities near the membrane surface, particularly, the extent of ion binding to the charged/neutral sites adjacent to the membrane surface. However, an in-depth analysis of the effect of altered cationic binding to the membrane surface on adjusting the transthylakoid electric potentials (ΔΨdn, ΔΨd, and ΔΨm) is still missing. This lack of a mechanistic understanding is due to the experimental difficulty of closely observing cations binding to the membrane surface in vivo. In this work, a computer model was proposed to investigate the transthylakoid electric phenomena in the chloroplast focusing on the interaction between cations and the negative charges close to the membrane surface. By employing the model, we simulated the membrane potential and consequently, the measured ECS traces, proxing the ΔΨm, were well described by the computing results on continuous illumination followed by a dark-adapted period. Moreover, the computing data clarified the components of transthylakoid membrane potential, unraveled the functional consequences of altered cationic attachment to the membrane surface on adjusting the transthylakoid electric potential, and further revealed the key role played by Donnan potential in regulating the energization of the thylakoid membrane. The current model for calculating electric potentials can function as a preliminary network for the further development into a more detailed theoretical model by which multiple important variables involved in photosynthesis can be explored.",,406
1855,35967785,Associations Between the Modified Food Standard Agency Nutrient Profiling System Dietary Index and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in an Elderly Population.,"Helping consumers to improve the nutritional quality of their diet is a key public health action to prevent cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The modified version of the Food Standard Agency Nutrient Profiling System Dietary Index (FSAm-NPS DI) underpinning the Nutri-Score front-of-pack label has been used in public health strategies to address the deleterious consequences of poor diets. This study aimed to assess the association between the FSAm-NPS DI and some CVD risk factors including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, plasma glucose levels, triglyceride levels, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline and after 1 year of follow-up using a 143-item validated semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Dietary indices based on FSAm-NPS applied at an individual level were computed to characterize the diet quality of 5,921 participants aged 55-75 years with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome from the PREDIMED-plus cohort. Associations between the FSAm-NPS DI and CVD risk factors were assessed using linear regression models. Compared to participants with a higher nutritional quality of diet (measured by a lower FSAm-NPS DI at baseline or a decrease in FSAm-NPS DI after 1 year), those participants with a lower nutritional quality of diet (higher FSAm-NPS DI or an increase in score) showed a significant increase in the levels of plasma glucose, triglycerides, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and waist circumference (β coefficient [95% confidence interval]; P for trend) (1.67 [0.43, 2.90]; <0.001; 6.27 [2.46, 10.09]; <0.001; 0.56 [0.08, 1.05]; 0.001; 0.51 [0.41, 0.60]; <0.001; 1.19 [0.89, 1.50]; <0.001, respectively). No significant associations in relation to changes in HDL and LDL-cholesterol nor with systolic blood pressure were shown. This prospective cohort study suggests that the consumption of food items with a higher FSAm-NPS DI is associated with increased levels of several major risk factors for CVD including adiposity, fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, and diastolic blood pressure. However, results must be cautiously interpreted because no significant prospective associations were identified for critical CVD risk factors, such as HDL and LDL-cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure.",,407
121,35983311,Data-Driven Analysis of Hole-Transporting Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells Performance.,"We have created a dataset of 269 perovskite solar cells, containing information about their perovskite family, cell architecture, and multiple hole-transporting materials features, including fingerprints, additives, and structural and electronic features. We propose a predictive machine learning model that is trained on these data and can be used to screen possible candidate hole-transporting materials. Our approach allows us to predict the performance of perovskite solar cells with reasonable accuracy and is able to successfully identify most of the top-performing and lowest-performing hole-transporting materials in the dataset. We discuss the effect of data biases on the distribution of perovskite families/architectures on the model's accuracy and offer an analysis with a subset of the data to accurately study the effect of the hole-transporting material on the solar cell performance. Finally, we discuss some chemical fragments, like arylamine and aryloxy groups, which present a relatively large positive correlation with the efficiency of the cell, whereas other groups, like thiophene groups, display a negative correlation with power conversion efficiency (PCE).",,408
1794,35967861,Pancreatic colonization of fungi in the development of severe acute pancreatitis.,"Acute pancreatitis is a common emergent disorder, a significant population of which develops the life-threatening condition, called severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). It is generally accepted that bacterial infection is associated with the development and persistence of SAP. In addition to bacterial infection, recent clinical studies disclosed a high incidence of fungal infection in patients with SAP. Moreover, SAP patients with fungal infection exhibit a higher mortality rate than those without infection. Although these clinical studies support pathogenic roles played by fungal infection in SAP, beneficial effects of prophylactic anti-fungal therapy on SAP have not been proved. Here we summarize recent clinical findings as to the relationship between fungal infection and the development of SAP. In addition, we discuss molecular mechanisms accounting for the development of SAP in the presence of fungal infection.",,409
933,35974757,Perpetuating enzymatically induced spatiotemporal pH and catalytic heterogeneity of a hydrogel by nanoparticles.,"The attainment of spatiotemporally inhomogeneous chemical and physical properties within a system is gaining attention across disciplines due to the resemblance to environmental and biological heterogeneity. Notably, the origin of natural pH gradients and how they have been incorporated in cellular systems is one of the most important questions in understanding the prebiotic origin of life. Herein, we have demonstrated a spatiotemporal pH gradient formation pattern on a hydrogel surface by employing two different enzymatic reactions, namely, the reactions of glucose oxidase (pH decreasing) and urease (pH increasing). We found here a generic pattern of spatiotemporal change in pH and proton transfer catalytic activity that was completely altered in a cationic gold nanoparticle containing hydrogel. In the absence of nanoparticles, the gradually generated macroscopic pH gradient slowly diminished with time, whereas the presence of nanoparticles helped to perpetuate the generated gradient effect. This behavior is due to the differential responsiveness of the interface of the cationic nanoparticle in temporally changing surroundings with increasing or decreasing pH or ionic contents. Moreover, the catalytic proton transfer ability of the nanoparticle showed a concerted kinetic response following the spatiotemporal pH dynamics in the gel matrix. Notably, this nanoparticle-driven spatiotemporally resolved gel matrix will find applicability in the area of the membrane-free generation and control of spatially segregated chemistry at the macroscopic scale.",,410
32,35984895,The salivary effector protein Sg2204 in the greenbug Schizaphis graminum suppresses wheat defence and is essential for enabling aphid feeding on host plants.,"Aphids secrete diverse repertoires of salivary effectors into host plant cells to promote infestation by modulating plant defence. The greenbug Schizaphis graminum is an important cereal aphid worldwide. However, the secreted effectors of S. graminum are still uncharacterized. Here, 76 salivary proteins were identified from the watery saliva of S. graminum using transcriptome and proteome analyses. Among them, a putative salivary effector Sg2204 was significantly up-regulated during aphid feeding stages, and transient overexpression of Sg2204 in Nicotiana benthamiana inhibited cell death induced by BAX or INF1. Delivering Sg2204 into wheat via the type III secretion system of Pseudomonas fluorescens EtAnH suppressed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI)-associated callose deposition. The transcript levels of jasmonic acid (JA)- and salicylic acid (SA)-associated defence genes of wheat were significantly down-regulated, and the contents of both JA and SA were also significantly decreased after delivery of Sg2204 into wheat leaves. Additionally, feeding on wheat expressing Sg2204 significantly increased the weight and fecundity of S. graminum and promoted aphid phloem feeding. Sg2204 was efficiently silenced via spray-based application of the nanocarrier-mediated transdermal dsRNA delivery system. Moreover, Sg2204-silenced aphids induced a stronger wheat defence response and resulted in negative impacts on aphid feeding behaviour, survival and fecundity. Silencing of Sg2204 homologues from four aphid species using nanocarrier-delivered dsRNA also significantly reduced aphid performance on host plants. Thus, our study characterized the salivary effector Sg2204 of S. graminum involved in promoting host susceptibility by suppressing wheat defence, which can also be regarded as a promising RNAi target for aphid control.",,411
830,35974941,Evaluation of Normal Renal Size and its Influencing Factors: A Cross-Sectional Study on the Adult Population of Mashhad.,"The normal range of kidney size is a controversial issue among different populations given to its impressibility by multiple factors, therefore, this study aimed to provide valid reference ranges for kidney dimensions in the adult population of Mashhad. Also, we assessed the association of kidney size characteristics with some personal predisposing factors. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 938 healthy individuals. Ultrasound measurement, physical examination, and laboratory analysis were performed. Demographic, dietary, and anthropometric data were obtained. The variables were categorized into 5 groups each, and data analysis were performed using the following statistical tests: Pearson correlation test, variance analysis, t-test, and chi-square test. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Weight had the most association with kidney size followed to a lesser extent by height and age. Even after adjustment for other confounding variables, weight remained as an independent factor, while this effect was resolved for height and age. Also, all values for renal function, body bio-impedance, blood pressure components, and water intake were notably correlated with kidney size. This study determined the normal kidney size in healthy adults. We also declared the normal range of kidney size is a dynamic concept and should be assessed for each individual separately according to their personal determinative factors.",,412
535,35978698,Discovery of Novel Aldo-Keto Reductase 1C3 Inhibitors as Chemotherapeutic Potentiators for Cancer Drug Resistance.,"As a crucial target which is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) confers chemotherapeutic resistance to many clinical agents. However, a limited number of AKR1C3-selective inhibitors are applied clinically, which indicates the importance of identifying active compounds. Herein, we report the discovery, synthesis, and evaluation of novel and potent AKR1C3 inhibitors with structural diversity. Molecular dynamics simulations of these active compounds provide reasonable clarification of the interpreted biological data. Moreover, we demonstrate that AKR1C3 inhibitors have the potential to be superior therapeutic agents for re-sensitizing drug-resistant cell lines to chemotherapy, especially the pan-AKR1C inhibitor S07-2010. Our study identifies new structural classes of AKR1C3 inhibitors and enriches the structural diversity, which facilitates the future rational design of inhibitors and structural optimization.

Eleven participants with CM (11.5 ± 2.8 years) underwent 12 weeks of side-alternating VT at 20 Hz for nine minutes per session, four days a week. VT was preceded by a 12-week control period. Assessments included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans, 6-minute walk and 10-meter run tests, muscle function and motor performance assessment, dynamometry, and pulmonary function. VT was well-tolerated, with occasional mild itchiness reported. The median compliance level with VT treatment was 75%. 12 weeks of VT improved the total score of motor function performance by 2.4 units (p=0.006) and velocity rise maximum of the chair rising test by 0.11 m/s (p=0.029). VT was shown to be feasible, safe, and associated with improving motor function performance. Our findings support further exploration of VT's potential health benefits to patients with CM in larger studies involving a longer intervention period.",,414
1624,35968158,Neurogenic mechanisms for locomotor-respiratory coordination in mammals.,"Central motor rhythm-generating networks controlling different functions are generally considered to operate mostly independently from one another, each controlling the specific behavioral task to which it is assigned. However, under certain physiological circumstances, central pattern generators (CPGs) can exhibit strong uni- or bidirectional interactions that render them closely inter-dependent. One of the best illustrations of such an inter-CPG interaction is the functional relationship that may occur between rhythmic locomotor and respiratory functions. It is well known that in vertebrates, lung ventilatory rates accelerate at the onset of physical exercise in order to satisfy the accompanying rapid increase in metabolism. Part of this acceleration is sustained by a coupling between locomotion and ventilation, which most often results in a periodic drive of the respiratory cycle by the locomotor rhythm. In terrestrial vertebrates, the likely physiological significance of this coordination is that it serves to reduce the mechanical interference between the two motor systems, thereby producing an energetic benefit and ultimately, enabling sustained aerobic activity. Several decades of studies have shown that locomotor-respiratory coupling is present in most species, independent of the mode of locomotion employed. The present article aims to review and discuss mechanisms engaged in shaping locomotor-respiratory coupling (LRC), with an emphasis on the role of sensory feedback inputs, the direct influences between CPG networks themselves, and finally on spinal cellular candidates that are potentially involved in the coupling of these two vital motor functions.",,415
1688,35968084,Subcellular trafficking and post-translational modification regulate PIN polarity in plants.,"Auxin regulates plant growth and tropism responses. As a phytohormone, auxin is transported between its synthesis sites and action sites. Most natural auxin moves between cells via a polar transport system that is mediated by PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin exporters. The asymmetrically localized PINs usually determine the directionality of intercellular auxin flow. Different internal cues and external stimuli modulate PIN polar distribution and activity at multiple levels, including transcription, protein stability, subcellular trafficking, and post-translational modification, and thereby regulate auxin-distribution-dependent development. Thus, the different regulation levels of PIN polarity constitute a complex network. For example, the post-translational modification of PINs can affect the subcellular trafficking of PINs. In this review, we focus on subcellular trafficking and post-translational modification of PINs to summarize recent progress in understanding PIN polarity.",,416
988,35974631,Asymptotic method for entropic multiple relaxation time model in lattice Boltzmann method.,"To improve the numerical stability of the lattice Boltzmann method, Karlin et al. [Phys. Rev. E 90, 031302(R) (2014)10.1103/PhysRevE.90.031302] proposed the entropic multiple relaxation time (EMRT) collision model. The idea behind EMRT is to construct an optimal postcollision state by maximizing its local entropy value. The critical step of the EMRT model is to solve the entropy maximization problem under certain constraints, which is often computationally expensive and even not feasible. In this paper, we propose to employ perturbation theory and obtain an asymptotic solution to the maximum entropy state. With mathematical analysis of particular cases under relaxed constraints, we obtain the unperturbed form of the original problem and derive the asymptotic solution. We show that the asymptotic solution well approximates the optimal states; thus, our approach provides an efficient way to solve the constrained maximum entropy problem in the EMRT model. Also, we use the same idea of the EMRT model for the initial condition of the distribution function and propose to leave the entropy function to determine the missing information at the initial nodes. Finally, we numerically verify that the simulation results of the EMRT model obtained via the perturbation theory agree well with the exact solution to the Taylor-Green vortex problem. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the EMRT model exhibits excellent stability performance for under-resolved simulations in the doubly periodic shear layer flow problem.",,417
1087,35974532,N-strain epidemic model using bond percolation.,"In this paper we examine the emergent structures of random networks that have undergone bond percolation an arbitrary, but finite, number of times. We define two types of sequential branching processes: a competitive branching process, in which each iteration performs bond percolation on the residual graph (RG) resulting from previous generations, and a collaborative branching process, where percolation is performed on the giant connected component (GCC) instead. We investigate the behavior of these models, including the expected size of the GCC for a given generation, the critical percolation probability, and other topological properties of the resulting graph structures using the analytically exact method of generating functions. We explore this model for Erdős-Renyi and scale-free random graphs. This model can be interpreted as a seasonal N-strain model of disease spreading.",,418
1994,35967611,Mental Health Identification of Children and Young Adults in a Pandemic Using Machine Learning Classifiers.,"COVID-19 has altered our lifestyle, communication, employment, and also our emotions. The pandemic and its devastating implications have had a significant impact on higher education, as well as other sectors. Numerous researchers have utilized typical statistical methods to determine the effect of COVID-19 on the psychological wellbeing of young people. Moreover, the primary aspects that have changed in the psychological condition of children and young adults during COVID lockdown is analyzed. These changes are analyzed using machine learning and AI techniques which should be established for the alterations. This research work mainly concentrates on children's and young people's mental health in the first lockdown. There are six processes involved in this work. Initially, it collects the data using questionnaires, and then, the collected data are pre-processed by data cleaning, categorical encoding, and data normalization method. Next, the clustering process is used for grouping the data based on their mood state, and then, the feature selection process is done by chi-square, L1-Norm, and ReliefF. Then, the machine learning classifiers are used for predicting the mood state, and automatic calibration is used for selecting the best model. Finally, it predicts the mood state of the children and young adults. The findings revealed that for a better understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's and youths' mental states, a combination of heterogeneous data from practically all feature groups is required.",,419
1193,35972084,Practical Use of Augmented Reality Modeling to Guide Revision Spine Surgery: An Illustrative Case of Hardware Failure and Overriding Spondyloptosis.,"Augmented reality (AR) is a novel technology with broadening applications to neurosurgery. In deformity spine surgery, it has been primarily directed to the more precise placement of pedicle screws. However, AR may also be used to generate high fidelity three-dimensional (3D) spine models for cases of advanced deformity with existing instrumentation. We present a case in which an AR-generated 3D model was used to facilitate and expedite the removal of embedded instrumentation and guide the reduction of an overriding spondyloptotic deformity. A young adult with a remote history of a motor vehicle accident treated with long-segment posterior spinal stabilization presented with increasing back pain and difficulty sitting upright in a wheelchair. Imaging revealed pseudoarthrosis with multiple rod fractures resulting in an overriding spondyloptosis of T6 on T9. An AR-generated 3D model was useful in the intraoperative localization of rod breaks and other extensively embedded instrumentation. Real-time model thresholding expedited the safe explanation of the defunct system and correction of the spondyloptosis deformity. An AR-generated 3D model proved instrumental in a revision case of hardware failure and high-grade spinal deformity.",,420
2467,35966791,Dynamic modeling of practice effects across the healthy aging-Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"Standardized tests of learning and memory are sensitive to changes associated with both aging and superimposed neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, repeated behavioral test administration can be confounded by practice effects (PE), which may obscure declines in level of abilities and contribute to misdiagnoses. Growing evidence, however, suggests PE over successive longitudinal measurements may differentially predict cognitive status and risk for progressive decline associated with aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. Thus, when viewed as a reflection of neurocognitive plasticity, PE may reveal residual abilities that can add to our understanding of age- and disease-related changes in learning and memory. The present study sought to evaluate differences in PE and verbal recall in a clinically characterized aging cohort assessed on multiple occasions over 3 years. Participants included 256 older adults recently diagnosed as cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 126), or with MCI of amnestic (n = 65) or non-amnestic MCI (n = 2085), and multi-domain amnestic dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT; n = 45). We applied a continuous time structural equation modeling (ctsem) approach to verbal recall performance on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test in order to distinguish PE from individual occasion performance, coupled random changes, age trends, and differing measurement quality. Diagnoses of MCI and dementia were associated with lower recall performance on all trials, reduced PE gain per occasion, and differences in non-linear dynamic parameters. Practice self-feedback is a dynamic measure of the decay or acceleration in PE process changes over longitudinal occasions. As with PE and mean recall, estimated practice self-feedback followed a gradient from positive in CU participants to null in participants with diagnosed MCI and negative for those with dementia diagnoses. Evaluation of sensitivity models showed this pattern of variation in PE was largely unmodified by differences in age, sex, or educational attainment. These results show dynamic modeling of PE from longitudinal performance on standardized learning and memory tests can capture multiple aspects of behavioral changes in MCI and dementia. The present study provides a new perspective for modeling longitudinal change in verbal learning in clinical and cognitive aging research.",,421
2293,35967138,Linear Growth Impairment in Patients With Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Introduction Linear growth impairment (LGI) is one of the complications of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to assess the linear growth of patients with pediatric IBD and to detect the frequency and the possible risk factors of LGI. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional review of medical records of patients with pediatric IBD was conducted in the pediatrics department, Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain, from 1984 to 2019. Demographic and anthropometric data were gathered. World Health Organization (WHO) standards and references were used to define LGI. According to WHO, stunting and severe stunting were defined as length/height for age of <-2 standard deviations and <-3 standard deviations from age and sex-specific reference means, respectively. To determine the possible risk factors for LGI, stunted patients were compared with normal height patients in regard to demographic data, clinical presentations, and treatment used. Results Out of 130 patients with pediatric IBD, 88 (67.7%) had anthropometric data available. Fifty-five (62.5%) were males. Forty-seven (53.4%) had Crohn's disease and 41 (46.6%) had ulcerative colitis. The mean age at presentation was 10.7±3.8 years. The median age at the time of growth measurement was 14.2 (interquartile range=12.1-24.4) years. Fifteen (17%) patients were stunted, and seven (46.7%) of those stunted patients were severely stunted. Weight at presentation was lower in stunted patients (21.6±5.9 kilograms) compared to normal height patients (31±13.4 kilogram) (p=0.048). Sex, delivery type, birth weight, height at presentation, age at presentation, age at growth measurements, IBD type, disease duration, presence of extraintestinal manifestations, and prednisolone and biologic therapy use were not significant factors of stunting. Conclusion Patients with pediatric IBD have a high prevalence of LGI compared to the general population. Low weight at disease presentation is the only significant risk factor for LGI. This might indicate that IBD as a disease by itself is having the main negative impact on linear growth.",,422
356,35979318,Multimodal imaging study of lipemia retinalis with diabetic retinopathy: A case report.,"Lipemia retinalis (LR) is a rare disease related to hypertriglyceridemia. However, the symptoms of hypertriglyceridemia are insidious and difficult to detect without blood tests. The fundus is the only site where blood vessels can be observed directly. Understanding the specific performance of LR in multimodal imaging fundus examinations can help diagnose more patients with abnormal hyperlipidemia. A 29-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes presented to our clinic complaining of a six-day loss of visual acuity in the left eye. The fundus color images showed typical LR: Arteries and veins were the same pink-white color. Infrared images showed hyperinfrared reflections of the arteries and veins. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed numerous high point-like reflections in the retinal section, corresponding to different calibers of blood vessel sections. Medium reflections were seen in the big vessels of the choroid. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) showed no significant changes. Laboratory examination found a total cholesterol level of 13.98 mmol/L, triglyceride 20.55 mmol/L, which confirmed the diagnosis of LR. After treatment to lower blood lipids and control blood glucose, the fundus imaging showed that the blood lipids in the patient had returned to normal. LR shows specific changes in fundus color photography, infrared photography, and OCT. FFA and OCTA were not sensitive to LR changes.",,423
1996,35967608,Is conduct after capture training sufficiently stressful?,"Conduct after capture (CAC) training is for personnel at risk of being captured. To be effective, it needs to be stressful. But how do we know if it is stressful enough? This study uses biomarkers and cognitive measures to evaluate CAC. Soldiers undergoing CAC were measured by the stress hormone cortisol from saliva samples at baseline and during training. The training consisted of being taken capture and put through a number of realistic and threatening scenarios, targeting survival strategies taught in the preceding week. Between scenarios, the trainees were held in a holding cell where they were monitored by a guard. The saliva samples were taken in conjunction with the scenarios. The whole training took place over a period of ~24 h. Cognitive performance was measured at baseline and after training. Three groups took part Group A (n = 20) was taken after 48 h of intense tasks leaving them in a poor resting state. Group B (n = 23) was well rested at CAC onset. Group C (n = 10) was part of a survival, evasion, resistance, and escape (SERE) instructor course. The CAC training was the same for all groups. Group A exhibited a high increase in cortisol during CAC, compared to baseline levels were multiple times as high as expected values. Group B exhibited elevated levels slightly lower than those of group A, they also dropped to normal levels during the latter part of the exercise. Group C displayed the least increase with only slightly elevated levels. CAC training is stressful and cortisol levels were elevated enough to satisfy the prerequisite for effective stress inoculation. No cognitive performance drop could be identified; however, several participants froze during the exercise due to intensive stress.",,424
1490,35968398,The optimal oral body temperature cutoff and other factors predictive of sepsis diagnosis in elderly patients.,"The aim of this study was to identify the optimal oral temperature cut-off value and other factors predictive of sepsis in elderly patients presenting to emergency department. A hospital-based retrospective study was performed on all elderly patients who presented to the Adult Emergency Department at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh (January to December 31, 2018). Of total of 13,856 patients, 2170 (15.7%) were diagnosed with sepsis. The associated area under the curve estimate was 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.74. Body temperature ≥37.3 was found as optimal cut-point with sensitivity = 50.97% and specificity = 87.22% and 82.39% of patients with sepsis will be correctly classified using this cut-off. An increase of 1° in body temperature was associated with an odds ratio of 9.95 (95% CI 8.95-11.06, P < 0.0001). Those aged ≥100 years having 11.12 (95% CI 2.29-20.88, P < 0.0001) times the likelihood for sepsis diagnosis compared with those aged 60-69 years. People admitted in weather such as winter, spring, or autumn were more likely to develop sepsis than people admitted in summer. The risk factors of sepsis such as age, temperature, and seasonal variation inform important evidence-based decisions. The hospitals dealing with sepsis patients should assess older patients for other severe illnesses or co-morbid that might lead to sepsis if left untreated. Therefore, older patients need to be prioritized over younger patients. The body temperature of patients admitted to hospitals needs to be monitored critically and it is important to consider seasonal fluctuations while managing cases of sepsis and allocating resources. Our findings suggest that clinicians should explore the possibility of sepsis in elderly patients admitted to emergency units with oral temperature ≥37.3°C. Risk factors for sepsis reported in this study could inform evidence-based decisions.",,425

1893,35967717,"Entropy, Amnesia, and Abnormal Déjà Experiences.","Previous research has contrasted fleeting erroneous experiences of familiarity with equally convincing, and often more stubborn erroneous experiences of remembering. While a subset of the former category may present as nonpathological déjà vu, the latter, termed déjà vécu can categorize a delusion-like confabulatory phenomenon first described in elderly dementia patients. Leading explanations for this experience include the dual process view, in which erroneous familiarity and erroneous recollection are elicited by inappropriate activation of the parahippocampal cortex and the hippocampus, respectively, and the more popular encoding-as-retrieval explanation in which normal memory encoding processes are falsely flagged and interpreted as memory retrieval. This paper presents a novel understanding of this recollective confabulation that builds on the encoding-as-retrieval hypothesis but more adequately accounts for the co-occurrence of persistent déjà vécu with both perceptual novelty and memory impairment, the latter of which occurs not only in progressive dementia but also in transient epileptic amnesia (TEA) and psychosis. It makes use of the growing interdisciplinary understanding of the fluidity of time and posits that the functioning of memory and the perception of novelty, long known to influence the subjective experience of time, may have a more fundamental effect on the flow of time.",,427
2316,35967062,Study on Microscopic Distribution Characteristics of the Remaining Oil in Polymer-Flooded Reservoirs.,"Polymer flooding is an effective enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology used in Daqing Oilfield. Microscopic distribution of remaining oil in polymer-flooded reservoirs is more complicated in comparison with waterflooded reservoirs. In this paper, UV excitation, frozen section-laser confocal technology, and three-dimensional reconstruction technology were employed to investigate the distribution law and occurrence state of the microscopic remaining oil in polymer-flooded Daqing Oilfield. With these methods, the occurrence states of the microscopic remaining oil distribution in different washing degrees and displacement locations were analyzed, and the remaining oil distribution before and after polymer flooding was compared quantitatively. The changes and microscopic distribution characteristics of crude oil components in the process of polymer flooding were clarified, and the relationship between clay minerals and the microscopic remaining oil distribution was discussed. Based on the statistical analysis of experimental results, the remaining oil of the free state decreases gradually, while the remaining oil of the bound state increases as the washing degree increases. In addition, the remaining oil in the distributary line is more enriched than the mainstream line after polymer flooding. Compared with waterflooding, the remaining oil of the free state becomes more, while the remaining oil of the bound state becomes less after polymer flooding. The frozen section-laser confocal experimental results also indicate that the proportion and distribution characteristics of the remaining oil components have been changed, and heavy components increase while light components decrease in the polymer-flooded stage. This research performs the quantized characterization and detailed analysis of remaining oil systematically and lays the foundation for remaining oil prediction and potential tapping in polymer-flooded reservoirs.",,428
791,35975046,Zinc binding strength of proteins dominants zinc uptake in Caco-2 cells.,"Zinc plays a vital role in structural, catalysis, and signal regulation in the human body. Zinc deficiency leads to the dysfunction of many organs and immunity systems. Diet proteins have distinct effects on zinc uptake. However, the mechanisms are uncovered. Here we select three principal components from whey protein: alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, and bovine serum albumin, which bind with zinc at different affinities, to evaluate the relationship between their potential zinc uptake and protein binding. The experimental data shows that beta-lactoglobulin could promote zinc uptake, alpha-lactalbumin has minor effects, whereas bovine serum albumin reduced zinc uptake in Caco-2 cell lines. Zinc binding effects on protein structure were thoroughly inspected through fluorescent spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that three proteins have different binding affinities toward zinc ions. We speculate that protein binding eliminates toxic effects from free zinc, and the binding strength dominates zinc uptake.",,429
1357,35969108,Live Imaging of Microtubule Dynamics in Glioblastoma Cells Invading the Zebrafish Brain.,"With a dismal median survival time in real populations-between 6 to 15 months-glioblastoma (GBM) is the most devastating malignant brain tumor. Treatment failure is mainly due to the invasiveness of GBM cells, which speaks for the need for a better understanding of GBM motile properties. To investigate the molecular mechanism supporting GBM invasion, new physiological models enabling in-depth characterization of protein dynamics during invasion are required. These observations would pave the way to the discovery of novel targets to block tumor infiltration and improve patient outcomes. This paper reports how an orthotopic xenograft of GBM cells in the zebrafish brain permits subcellular intravital live imaging. Focusing on microtubules (MTs), we describe a procedure for MT labeling in GBM cells, microinjecting GBM cells in the transparent brain of 3 days post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae, intravital imaging of MTs in the disseminating xenografts, altering MT dynamics to assess their role during GBM invasion, and analyzing the acquired data.",,430
243,35982659,Immune Heterogeneity and Epistasis Explain Punctuated Evolution of SARS-CoV-2.,"Identifying drivers of viral diversity is key to understanding the evolutionary as well as epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using rich viral genomic data sets, we show that periods of steadily rising diversity have been punctuated by sudden, enormous increases followed by similarly abrupt collapses of diversity. We introduce a mechanistic model of saltational evolution with epistasis and demonstrate that these features parsimoniously account for the observed temporal dynamics of inter-genomic diversity. Our results provide support for recent proposals that saltational evolution may be a signature feature of SARS-CoV-2, allowing the pathogen to more readily evolve highly transmissible variants. These findings lend theoretical support to a heightened awareness of biological contexts where increased diversification may occur. They also underline the power of pathogen genomics and other surveillance streams in clarifying the phylodynamics of emerging and endemic infections. In public health terms, our results further underline the importance of equitable distribution of up-to-date vaccines.",,431
2296,35967135,Comparison of Dosimetric Parameters in Dysphagia Aspiration-Related Structures and Clinical Correlation in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Treated With Radiotherapy.,"Introduction Chemoradiotherapy plays a major role in the treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC). Persistent dysphagia following primary chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancers can have a devastating effect on a patient's quality of life. Many studies have shown that the dosimetric sparing of critical structures which were included in swallowing such as the pharyngeal constrictor muscle and larynx can provide improved functional outcomes and better quality of life. However, there are no current randomized studies confirming the benefits of such swallowing-sparing strategies. The aim is to evaluate late dysphagia after chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer and to examine its correlation with clinical and dosimetric parameters. Materials and methods The period of this prospective study was from November 2018 to March 2020. Patients were divided randomly in 1:1 ratio into two groups, group 1 and group 2, each with 25 patients. Group 1 was planned by three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) technique and group 2 was planned by intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique (IMRT) technique. Treatment was delivered after approval of radiotherapy plan. To evaluate the dose to dysphagia aspiration-related structures (DARS), these structures were contoured and dose-volume histograms were generated. Various dosimetric parameters of DARS were evaluated. Swallowing status was clinically evaluated based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5. Results A significant advantage was seen with intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique (IMRT) in comparison to three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in terms of mean dose delivered to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles (66.03 Gy vs 68.77 Gy, p=0.003). The mean dose delivered to the combined dysphagia/aspiration-related structures (DARS) was statistically significantly lower in IMRT compared to 3D-CRT (66.15 Gy vs. 70.09 Gy, p<0.001). Other dose-volumes were also reduced in IMRT group (V30: {98.64% vs. 99.88%, p=0.05}; V50: {90.49% vs. 99.02%, p=0.0002}; V60: {83.92% vs. 95.04, p=0.0002}; D50: {70 Gy vs. 71.16 Gy, p=0.001); and D80: {61.18 Gy vs. 67.39 Gy, p=0.01}. Futhermore, the clinical worsening of dysphagia was less common in IMRT group (48% vs. 80%, p=0.039). Conclusion IMRT can reduce the high-dose volumes received by the DARS receiving high doses by sparing these structures through optimization. This may provide a significant additional benefit that could improve dysphagia and hence the quality of life of patients with head and neck cancer.",,432
2370,35967004,"Psychological well-being and cognitive aging in Black, Native American, and White Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participants.","Psychological well-being is associated with cognition in later life but has not been examined across diverse populations-including minoritized communities at disproportionately high risk of dementia. Further, most previous work has not been able to examine links between specific facets of psychological well-being and performance within distinct cognitive domains that can capture subclinical impairment. Using a well-characterized sample followed through enrollment in an NIH-funded Alzheimer's Disease Center, we sought to test these associations within three racial groups at baseline. Participants were N = 529 cognitively unimpaired Black, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), and white middle-aged and older adults (mean age = 63.6, SD = 8.1, range = 45-88 years) enrolled in the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center's Clinical Core. Predictors included validated NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery scales assessing positive affect, general life satisfaction, and meaning and purpose. Outcomes included performance on widely used tests of executive functioning and episodic memory. We conducted race-stratified regression models to assess within-group relationships. Black and AI/AN participants reported lower life satisfaction than white participants. Racial disparities were not observed for positive affect or meaning and purpose scores. Across groups, life satisfaction predicted better executive functioning. Similar associations were observed for positive affect in Black and AI/AN samples but not among whites. In general, well-being measures were not related to performance on tests of episodic memory. Our results highlight well-being as a potentially important determinant of late-life cognitive health, particularly executive functioning, that is modifiable if older adults are connected with appropriate resources and supports. Further, psychological well-being may represent a potent target for brain health interventions tailored for Black and Native communities.",,433
447,35978944,Prenatal Exposure to Air Pollution and Early-Life Stress Effects on Hippocampal Subregional Volumes and Associations With Visuospatial Reasoning.,"Children from economically distressed families and neighborhoods are at risk for stress and pollution exposure and potential neurotoxic sequelae. We examine dimensions of early-life stress affecting hippocampal volumes, how prenatal exposure to air pollution might magnify these effects, and associations between hippocampal volumes and visuospatial reasoning. Fifty-three Hispanic/Latinx and/or Black children of ages 7 to 9 years were recruited from a longitudinal birth cohort for magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive assessment. Exposure to airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was measured during the third trimester of pregnancy. Maternal report of psychosocial stress was collected at child age 5 and served as measures of early-life stress. Whole hippocampus and subfield volumes were extracted using FreeSurfer. Wechsler performance IQ measured visuospatial reasoning. Maternal perceived stress associated with smaller right hippocampal volume among their children (B = -0.57, t 34 = -3.05, 95% CI, -0.95 to -0.19). Prenatal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon moderated the association between maternal perceived stress and right CA1, CA3, and CA4/dentate gyrus volumes (B ≥ 0.68, t 33 ≥ 2.17) such that higher prenatal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure magnified negative associations between stress and volume, whereas this was buffered at lower exposure. Right CA3 and CA4/dentate gyrus volumes (B ≥ 0.35, t 33 > 2.16) were associated with greater performance IQ. Prenatal and early-life exposures to chemical and social stressors are likely compounding. Socioeconomic deprivation and disparities increase risk of these exposures that exert critical neurobiological effects. Developing deeper understandings of these complex interactions will facilitate more focused public health strategies to protect and foster the development of children at greatest risk of mental and physical effects associated with poverty.",,434
2419,35966877,Decreased plasma fetuin-A level as a novel bioindicator of poor prognosis in community-acquired pneumonia: A multi-center cohort study.,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a respiratory disease that frequently requires hospital admission, and is a significant cause of death worldwide. Plasma fetuin-A levels were significantly lower in patients with sepsis, but data regarding CAP are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of fetuin-A as a prognostic biomarker of CAP. A multicenter cohort study on CAP was conducted between January 2017 and December 2018. Demographic and clinical data were recorded for all enrolled patients. Plasma fetuin-A levels were determined using a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to analyse the effect of variables on 30-day mortality. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors associated with severe CAP (SCAP) and 30-day mortality. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to verify the association between variables and CAP prognosis. Correlations were assessed using Spearman's test. Survival curves were constructed and compared using the log-rank test. A total of 283 patients with CAP were enrolled in this study. Fetuin-A levels were decreased in patients with CAP, especially in SCAP and non-survivors. A cox regression analysis showed that CURB-65 and fetuin-A levels were independent prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality. Via a multiple logistic regression analysis, plasma level of fetuin-A (<202.86 mg/L) was determined to be the strongest independent predictor of 30-day mortality considered (odds ratio, 57.365), and also was also determined to be an independent predictor of SCAP. The area under the curve (AUC) of fetuin-A for predicting 30-day mortality was 0.871, and accuracy was high (P < 0.05). Plasma fetuin-A levels were negatively correlated with WBC, NE%, Glu, CRP, PCT, CURB-65, and pneumonia severity index scores and positively correlated with albumin level. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that lower plasma levels of fetuin-A levels were associated with increased 30-day mortality levels (P < 0.0001). Plasma fetuin-A levels were decreased in patients with CAP. Fetuin-A can reliably predict mortality in patients with CAP, and is a useful diagnostic indicator of SCAP.",,435
1186,35973166,"A Novel Convolutional Neural Network Model as an Alternative Approach to Bowel Preparation Evaluation Before Colonoscopy in the COVID-19 Era: A Multicenter, Single-Blinded, Randomized Study.","Adequate bowel preparation is key to a successful colonoscopy, which is necessary for detecting adenomas and preventing colorectal cancer. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) platform using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model (AI-CNN model) to evaluate the quality of bowel preparation before colonoscopy. This was a colonoscopist-blinded, randomized study. Enrolled patients were randomized into an experimental group, in which our AI-CNN model was used to evaluate the quality of bowel preparation (AI-CNN group), or a control group, which performed self-evaluation per routine practice (Control group). The primary outcome was the consistency (homogeneity) between the results of the two methods. The secondary outcomes included the quality of bowel preparation according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), the polyp detection rate (PDR), and the adenoma detection rate (ADR). A total of 1,434 patients were enrolled (AI-CNN, n = 730; Control, n = 704). No significant difference was observed between the evaluation results (pass or not pass) of the groups in terms of the adequacy of bowel preparation as represented by BBPS scores. The mean BBPS scores, PDRs, and ADRs were similar between the groups. These results indicated that the AI-CNN model and routine practice were generally consistent in the evaluation of bowel preparation quality. However, the mean BBPS score of patients with pass results were signiﬁcantly higher in the AI-CNN group than in the Control group, indicating that the AI-CNN model may further improve the quality of bowel preparation in patients exhibiting adequate bowel preparation. The novel AI-CNN model, which demonstrated comparable outcomes to the routine practice, may serve as an alternative approach for evaluating bowel preparation quality before colonoscopy.",,436
1332,35969943,The resurgence of phage-based therapy in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance: From research progress to challenges and prospects.,"Phage therapy was implemented almost a century ago but was subsequently abandoned when antibiotics emerged. However, the rapid emergence of drug-resistant, which has brought to the limelight situation reminiscent of the pre-antibiotic era, coupled with the unavailability of new drugs, has triggered the quest for an alternative therapeutic approach, and this has led to the rebirth of phage-derived therapy. Phages are viruses that infect and replicate in bacterial cells. Phage therapy, especially phage-derived proteins, is being given considerable attention among scientists as an antimicrobial agent. They are used alone or in combination with other biomaterials for improved biological activity. Over the years, much has been learned about the genetics and diversity of bacteriophages. Phage cocktails are currently being exploited for treating several infectious diseases as preliminary studies involving animal models and clinical trials show promising therapeutic efficacy. However, despite its numerous advantages, this approach has several challenges and unaddressed limitations. Addressing these issues requires lots of creativity and innovative ideas from interdisciplinary fields. However, with all available indications, phage therapy could hold the solution in this era of increasing antibiotic resistance. This review discussed the potential use of phages and phage-derived proteins in treating drug-resistant bacterial infections. Finally, we highlight the progress, challenges, and knowledge gaps and evaluate key questions requiring prompt attention for the full clinical application of phage therapy.",,437
1974,35967633,A trio of biological rhythms and their relevance in rhythmic mechanical stimulation of cell cultures.,"The primary aim of this article is to provide a biological rhythm model based on previous theoretical and experimental findings to promote more comprehensive studies of rhythmic mechanical stimulation of cell cultures, which relates to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine fields. Through an interdisciplinary approach where different standpoints from biology and musicology are combined, we explore some of the core rhythmic features of biological and cellular rhythmic processes and present them as a trio model that aims to afford a basic but fundamental understanding of the connections between various biological rhythms. It is vital to highlight such links since rhythmic mechanical stimulation and its effect on cell cultures are vastly underexplored even though the cellular response to mechanical stimuli (mechanotransduction) has been studied widely and relevant experimental evidence suggests mechanotransduction processes are rhythmic.",,438
799,35975038,Reusable alcohol oxidase-nPtCu/alginate beads for highly sensitive ethanol assay in beverages.,"Nanozymes (NZs) are nanoparticles that mimic the catalytic properties of natural enzymes. The present work aimed to obtain effective peroxidase mimetics (PO-like NZs), to characterize their morphological properties, estimate the kinetic parameters of NZs and evaluate the prospects of their application in analysis of ethanol. Herein, we have proposed a convenient spectrophotometric method for ethanol assay using reusable alginate beads enriched with alcohol oxidase (AO) and nanoparticles of PtCu (nPtCu) as PO-like NZs, and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a chromogen. The linear range for the proposed nPtCu-AO/alginate beads/TMB-based method is from 0.01 mM to 0.15 mM with a limit of detection of 3.3 μM ethanol. The method is used for the quantitative determination of ethanol in alcoholic beverages. The obtained results proved to be in a good correlation with the enzymatic reference method. These results highlight the potential of the nPtCu with PO-like activity in bioanalytical applications. The proposed method, being sensitive, economical and suitable for routine and micro-volume formats, can be used in clinical diagnostics for the detection of ethanol.",,439

223,35982797,Dual pancreatic adrenergic and dopaminergic signaling as a therapeutic target of bromocriptine.,"Bromocriptine is approved as a diabetes therapy, yet its therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. Though bromocriptine's actions have been mainly attributed to the stimulation of brain dopamine D2 receptors (D2R), bromocriptine also targets the pancreas. Here, we employ bromocriptine as a tool to elucidate the roles of catecholamine signaling in regulating pancreatic hormone secretion. In β-cells, bromocriptine acts on D2R and α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2A-AR) to reduce glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Moreover, in α-cells, bromocriptine acts via D2R to reduce glucagon secretion. α2A-AR activation by bromocriptine recruits an ensemble of G proteins with no β-arrestin2 recruitment. In contrast, D2R recruits G proteins and β-arrestin2 upon bromocriptine stimulation, demonstrating receptor-specific signaling. Docking studies reveal distinct bromocriptine binding to α2A-AR versus D2R, providing a structural basis for bromocriptine's dual actions on β-cell α2A-AR and D2R. Together, joint dopaminergic and adrenergic receptor actions on α-cell and β-cell hormone release provide a new therapeutic mechanism to improve dysglycemia.",,441
1730,35968012,Tandem mass tag labeled quantitative proteomic analysis of differential protein expression on total alkaloid of Aconitum flavum Hand.-Mazz. against melophagus ovinus.,"Melophagus ovinus disease is a common ectoparasitosis, which can lead to a decrease in animal production performance, product quality, and even death. Aconitum flavum Hand.-Mazz. has many pharmacological activities including insecticidal, heat-clearing, analgesic, and dehumidifying. However, there are few researches focused on the effects and related mechanism of Aconitum flavum Hand.-Mazz. in killing Melophagus ovinus. In this study, 11 alkaloids of Aconitum flavum Hand.-Mazz. were detected, and its total alkaloid activity was determined. The results showed when the total alkaloid concentration was 64 mg/ml and the treatment time was 16 h, the killing rate of Melophagus ovinus reached 100%. Through the observation of the differences in the surface of Melophagus ovinus in each experimental group, it was found that the morphology of the posterior end of the female Melophagus ovinus in the alkaloid treatment group was significantly different from that of the blank and positive control groups, and most of the epidermal tissue was obsessive and missing. Moreover, the enzyme activity determination results of 64 mg/ml group were significantly different when compared with the normal control group, while there was no significant difference in other groups. Then, the Melophagus ovinus gene library was established by the unreferenced genome transcriptome sequencing, the proteomic comparison was performed using tandem mass tag labeled protein detection technology, and finally, the samples were quantitatively analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry tandem and bioinformatics methods. Based on the above experimental results, it was speculated that Aconitum flavum Hand.-Mazz. total alkaloids may cause the imbalance of protein disulfide isomerase expressions by affecting the regulation of Hsp40 cellular protein homeostasis and the oxidation of protein disulfide isomerase and related proteins. This would affect the selective recognition of signal sequence, the targeted transport of Sec 61, and the correct folding of the three-dimensional structure of amino acid chain, weakening the clearance of amino acid chains that cannot be correctly folded and eventually resulting in the killing of Melophagus ovinus. This study preliminarily revealed the mechanism of Aconitum flavum Hand.-Mazz. total alkaloids against Melophagus ovinus and provided a theoretical basis for the screening of Melophagus ovinus action targets and the development of new veterinary drugs.",,442
2372,35967002,An informal logic of feedback-based temporal control.,"A conceptual framework and mathematical model of the control of articulatory timing are presented, in which feedback systems play a fundamental role. The model applies both to relatively small timescales, such as within syllables, and to relatively large timescales, such as multi-phrase utterances. A crucial distinction is drawn between internal/predictive feedback and external/sensory feedback. It is argued that speakers modulate attention to feedback to speed up and slow down speech. A number of theoretical implications of the framework are discussed, including consequences for the understanding of syllable structure and prosodic phrase organization.",,443
1892,35967718,Multiple latent variables but functionally dependent output mappings underlying the recognition of own- and other-race faces for Chinese individuals: Evidence from state-trace analysis.,"To explore the number of latent variables underlying recognition of own- and other-race faces for Chinese observers, we conducted a study-recognition task where orientation, stimuli type, and duration were manipulated in the study phase and applied state trace analysis as a statistic method. Results showed that each state trace plot on each pair of stimuli types matched a single monotonic curve when stimuli type was set to state factor, but separate curves between face and non-face showed up when the state factor was orientation. The results implied that at least two latent variables affected recognition performance in the inversion paradigm. Besides, the unidimensional structure between own- and other-race faces regardless of the state factor suggested that Chinese participants used the same recognition mechanism for unfamiliar own- and other-race faces in the inversion paradigm.",,444
1096,35974523,Regulating dynamics through intermittent interactions.,"In this article we experimentally demonstrate an efficient scheme to regulate the behavior of coupled nonlinear oscillators through dynamic control of their interaction. It is observed that introducing intermittency in the interaction term as a function of time or the system state predictably alters the dynamics of the constituent oscillators. Choosing the nature of the interaction, attractive or repulsive, allows for either suppression of oscillations or stimulation of activity. Two parameters Δ and τ, that reign the extent of interaction among subsystems, are introduced. They serve as a harness to access the entire range of possible behaviors from fixed points to chaos. For fixed values of system parameters and coupling strength, changing Δ and τ offers fine control over the dynamics of coupled subsystems. We show this experimentally using coupled Chua's circuits and elucidate their behavior for a range of coupling parameters through detailed numerical simulations.",,445
743,35975107,A purinergic call to arms from dying brown adipocytes.,"Brown adipocytes react to temperature and nutritional challenges by ramping up their metabolism and generating heat. This adaptation to changes in the environment is crucial for defending organismal homeostasis, but is impaired in obesity and during aging. Writing in Nature, Niemann et al. show that brown adipocytes become apoptotic under thermoneutral conditions and release ATP, which in turn is converted extracellularly into inosine. They further present evidence that pharmacological and genetic manipulations that enhance signalling of this purine metabolite stimulates thermogenesis in brown adipocytes and promotes metabolic health.",,446
124,35983283,MMP-1 and ADAM10 as Targets for Therapeutic Intervention in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a fatal disease characterized by excessive matrix degradation and fibrosis, destroys the lung architecture and results in the inability of the lungs to absorb oxygen. The cause(s) of IPF is unknown and current treatments are palliative. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinases (ADAMs) likely play roles in IPF progression. However, specific MMPs and ADAMs in IPF have not been identified due to challenges in MMP/ADAM profiling. We employed a designer affinity resin that binds exclusively to the active forms of MMPs and ADAMs and found by mass spectrometry higher levels of active MMP-1, ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17 in lung tissues of IPF patients. Inhibition of MMP-1 and ADAM10 with the small-molecule inhibitor GI254023X in an in vitro lung fibrosis assay decreased the profibrotic protein α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Our results indicate that inhibition of MMP-1 and ADAM10 may hold promise in treatment of IPF.",,447
2062,35967463,Osteoradionecrosis of the jaw: A mini review.,"Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaw is one of the most dreaded complications of head and neck radiation therapy. Despite the evolution of radiation treatment modalities, ORN continues to remain a therapeutic challenge and its etiopathogenesis still remains unclear. It is clinically characterized by exposed necrotic bone within the head and neck radiation field. Over the past years, several studies have reported on the definition, staging, incidence, etiology, and management of this oral complication. In this review, we summarize the literature on ORN and discuss our institutional experience and management strategies that aim to predict and mitigate risk for ORN.",,448
976,35974643,"Transient electrohydrodynamics of a liquid drop: The interplay of fluid flow evolution and dynamic response, and the density ratio effects.","Computer simulations are performed to study some of the less explored aspects of the transient electrohydrodynamics of a liquid drop in uniform DC electric fields. The governing equations of the problem are solved using a parallelized front tracking/finite difference method in the framework of Taylor-Melcher's leaky dielectric theory. For density- and viscosity-matched fluid systems, the evolution of the flow field at a high Ohnesorge-squared number Oh^{2}=μ^{2}/γρa is studied. It is shown that the instantaneous flow pattern is the result of superposition of deformation- and hydrodynamic shear-driven vortices, and that depending on the placement of the fluid systems on the deformation-circulation map, there exists two different paths for the development of the velocity field toward steady state. Examination of the steady-state flow patterns shows that the location of the maximum velocity can shift from the (classically known) drop surface to inside the drop along the poles. The effect of Oh^{2} on the dynamic response of the drop and the kinetic energy of the fluid is studied. For high Oh^{2} number flows, the dynamic response is monotonic while the kinetic energy evolves in a nonmonotonic way, achieving a distinct peak before settling to steady state. However, for low Oh^{2} number flows, both the dynamic response and kinetic energy are oscillatory. Inspection of the results show a two-way coupling between the deformation rate and the fluid flow. The effect of the density ratio ρ[over ̃]=ρ_{i}/ρ_{o} (drop to ambient) on the dynamic response and fluid flow strength shows that for high Oh^{2} number flows both parameters remain essentially intact at steady state, while their evolution modes transition from a monotonic response to an oscillatory one at high density ratio. However, for low Oh^{2} number flows, with an increase in ρ[over ̃], the oscillation frequency of both parameters remain intact, while their oscillation amplitudes increase.",,449
449,35978941,Pharmacological profiles and therapeutic applications of pachymic acid (Review).,"Poria cocos is a saprophytic fungus that grows in diverse species of Pinus. Its sclerotium, called fu-ling or hoelen, has been used in various traditional Chinese medicines and health foods for thousands of years, and in several modern proprietary traditional Chinese medicinal products. It has extensive clinical indications, including sedative, diuretic, and tonic effects. Pachymic acid (PA) is the main lanostane-type triterpenoid in Poria cocos. Evidence suggests that PA has various biological properties such as cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycemic, antiviral, antibacterial, sedative-hypnotic, and anti-ischemia/reperfusion activities. Although considerable advancements have been made, some fundamental and intricate issues remain unclear, such as the underlying mechanisms of PA. The present study aimed to summarize the biological properties and therapeutic potential of PA. The biosynthetic, pharmacokinetic, and metabolic pathways of PA, and its underlying mechanisms were also comprehensively summarized.",,450
1339,35969712,Selection of appropriate biomatrices for studies of chronic stress in animals: a review.,"Cortisol and corticosterone, hormones traditionally considered biomarkers of stress, can be measured in fluid biomatrices (e.g., blood, saliva) from live animals to evaluate conditions at sampling time, or in solid biomatrices (e.g., hair, feather) from live or dead animals to obtain information regarding long-term changes. Using these biomarkers to evaluate physiological stress responses in domestic animals may be challenging due to the diverse characteristics of biomatrices for potential measurement. Ideally, a single measurement from the biomatrix should be sufficient for evaluating chronic stress. The availability of appropriate and cost-effective immunoassay methods for detecting the biomarkers should also be considered. This review discusses the strengths and limitations of different biomatrices with regard to ensuring the highest possible reliability for chronic stress evaluation. Overall, solid biomatrices require less frequent sampling than other biomatrices, resulting in greater time- and cost-effectiveness, greater ease of use, and fewer errors. The multiplex immunoassay can be used to analyze interactions and correlations between cortisol and other stress biomarkers in the same biomatrix. In light of the lack of information regarding appropriate biomatrices for measuring chronic stress, this review may help investigators set experimental conditions or design biological research.",,451
2415,35966881,Precision medicine based on the phenotypic differences in peripheral T helper cells in patients with psoriatic arthritis: One year follow-up outcomes.,"We validated the one-year effectiveness of strategic treatment with biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) based on peripheral T-lymphocytic phenotyping and explored the impact of treatment on T helper lymphocytic phenotypes. Ninety-seven patients were registered in this study. One-year treatment response was compared between the two groups: the strategic bDMARDs treatment group (n = 41), in which bDMARDs were selected based on peripheral blood lymphocyte analysis, and the standard bDMARDs treatment group (n = 56), in which the patients underwent no strategic selection of bDMARDs and phenotyping. Changes in helper T lymphocytic phenotypes were evaluated after 1-year post-treatment. In the standard bDMARDs treatment group, 23 patients (42.6%) achieved disease activity in psoriatic arthritis (DAPSA)-remission (REM), and 23 of 46 (50.0%) achieved PASI 90. In the strategic bDMARDs treatment group, 22 (53.7%) achieved DAPSA-REM, and 26 of 35 (74.2%) achieved PASI90. The rate of achieving minimal disease activity (MDA) and DAPSA-REM at month 6, DAPSA-low disease activity (LDA) at months 6 and 12, and PASI 90 at month 12 were significantly higher in the strategic bDMARDs treatment group. After treatment with ustekinumab, the proportion of aTh1/CD4 (%) significantly decreased. The percent reduction in activated Th17 cells was significantly higher in IL-17-i cells than in UST/TNF-i cells. The results of this study demonstrate the 1-year effectiveness of precision medicine based on peripheral T-lymphocytic phenotyping in terms of DAPSA and MDA. Analysis of data from real-world clinical practice showed that the impact on the immune system varied among bDMARDs. However, because psoriatic arthritis has very high heterogeneity, it may be necessary to conduct studies with a larger sample size, perhaps drawing samples from multiple institutions.",,452
2306,35967074,Incorporation of Indoylated Phenylalanine Yields a Sub-Micromolar Selective Melanocortin-4 Receptor Antagonist Tetrapeptide.,"The melanocortin family is involved in many physiological functions, including pigmentation, steroidogenesis, and appetite. The centrally expressed melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC3R and MC4R) possess overlapping but distinct roles in energy homeostasis. Herein, the third and fourth positions of a tetrapeptide lead compound [Ac-Arg-Arg-(pI)DPhe-Tic-NH2], previously reported to possess MC3R agonist and MC4R antagonist activities, were substituted with indoylated phenylalanine (Wsf/Wrf) residues in an attempt to generate receptor subtype selective compounds. At the third position, d-amino acids were required for melanocortin agonist activity, while both l- and d-residues resulted in MC4R antagonist activity. These results indicate that l-indoylated phenylalanine residues at the third position of the scaffold can generate MC4R over MC3R selective antagonist ligands, resulting in a substitution pattern that may be exploited for novel MC4R ligands that can be used to probe the in vivo activity of the MC4R without involvement of the MC3R.",,453
1798,35967857,Development of an artificial synovial fluid useful for studying Staphylococcus epidermidis joint infections.,"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a major causative agent of prosthetic joint infections (PJI). The ability to form biofilms supports this highly selective pathogenic potential. In vitro studies essentially relying on phenotypic assays and genetic approaches have provided a detailed picture of the molecular events contributing to biofilm assembly. A major limitation in these studies is the use of synthetic growth media, which significantly differs from the environmental conditions S. epidermidis encounters during host invasion. Building on evidence showing that growth in serum substantially affects S. epidermidis gene expression profiles and phenotypes, the major aim of this study was to develop and characterize a growth medium mimicking synovial fluid, thereby facilitating research addressing specific aspects related to PJI. Using fresh human plasma, a protocol was established allowing for the large-scale production of a medium that by biochemical analysis matches key characteristics of synovial fluid and therefore is referred to as artificial synovial fluid (ASF). By analysis of biofilm-positive, polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA)-producing S. epidermidis 1457 and its isogenic, PIA- and biofilm-negative mutant 1457-M10, evidence is provided that the presence of ASF induces cluster formation in S. epidermidis 1457 and mutant 1457-M10. Consistent with the aggregative properties, both strains formed multilayered biofilms when analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. In parallel to the phenotypic findings, expression analysis after growth in ASF found upregulation of genes encoding for intercellular adhesins (icaA, aap, and embp) as well as atlE, encoding for the major cell wall autolysin being responsible for eDNA release. In contrast, growth in ASF was associated with reduced expression of the master regulator agr. Collectively, these results indicate that ASF induces expression profiles that are able to support intercellular adhesion in both PIA-positive and PIA-negative S. epidermidis. Given the observation that ASF overall induced biofilm formation in a collection of S. epidermidis isolates from PJI, the results strongly support the idea of using growth media mimicking host environments. ASF may play an important role in future studies related to the pathogenesis of S. epidermidis PJI.",,454
843,35974928,Ophthalmological aspects of mustard gas poisoning (focus on management).,"Amongst the chemical warfare agents, blistering (vesicant) agents can be significant materials. The most important agent in this group is sulfur mustard (mustard gas) which is known as King of chemical warfare (CW) agents . Exposure to this agent, seriously causes damages in several organs, such as the eyes. This article reviews the ophthalmological aspects of sulfur mustard with reference of its management. A wide-ranging search in PubMed databases, Thomson Reuters and Scopus was done and different aspects of chemical properties of sulfur mustard, its mechanism of action and effects on eyes, clinical finding, diagnostic evaluation, initiate actions, pharmaceutical and surgical interventions was reported. Sulfur mustard can alkylate DNA and RNA strands and break down structures of protein and lipid of cell membrane. This may impair cell energy production, and leads to cell death. Exposure to sulfur mustard, therefore, causes such problems for organs, including irreversible damage to the eyes. Understanding the mechanism of the sulfur mustard effect and the early training in prevention injuries will cause fewer complications and damage to organs, including the eyes. Washing the eyes with tap water or eyewash solutions, using mydriatic drops, anti- inflammatory drugs, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and antibiotics may help to the management of poisoning. Surgical interventions including tarsorrhaphy, amniotic membrane transplantation, stem cell transplantation and corneal transplantation could reduce the harm to the victims.",,455
1942,35967667,Familiarity with words modulates interhemispheric interactions in visual word recognition.,"Bilateral redundancy gain (BRG) indicates superior performance in bilaterally presented word recognition in the left and right visual fields (RVFs) relative to word recognition given in either the left or the RVF. The BRG may be modulated by participants' subjective familiarity with words as previous studies found smaller regional activations in the brain as they become proficient. It can be assumed that visual recognition of words with high subjective familiarity indicates skilled performance in visual recognition. Thus, this study examined the subjective familiarity effect of visual words on the BRG during lateralized lexical decision performances. It showed that the significant BRG of response times was only observed in the most familiar word condition (F4 level); on the other hand, accuracy results revealed the significant BRGs in all the subjective familiarity levels (F1, F2, F3, and F4 levels). These results suggest that the bilateral presentation of identical words with higher subjective familiarity facilitates the recognition led by cooperative interactions between cerebral hemispheres. Therefore, the subjective familiarity with visual words modulates the efficiency of hemispheric interactions in visual word recognition.",,456
1789,35967866,Biofilm formation and antibiotic sensitivity in Elizabethkingia anophelis.,"Elizabethkingia anophelis has recently gained global attention and is emerging as a cause of life-threatening nosocomial infections. The present study aimed to investigate the association between antimicrobial resistance and the ability to form biofilm among E. anophelis isolated from hospitalized patients in China. Over 10 years, a total of 197 non-duplicate E. anophelis strains were collected. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the standard agar dilution method as a reference assay according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The biofilm formation ability was assessed using a culture microtiter plate method, which was determined using a crystal violet assay. Culture plate results were cross-checked by scanning electron microscopy imaging analysis. Among the 197 isolates, all were multidrug-resistant, and 20 were extensively drug-resistant. Clinical E. anophelis showed high resistance to current antibiotics, and 99% of the isolates were resistant to at least seven antibiotics. The resistance rate for aztreonam, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefepime, and tetracycline was high as 100%, 99%, 99%, 99%, 99%, 95%, and 90%, respectively. However, the isolates exhibited the highest susceptibility to minocycline (100%), doxycycline (96%), and rifampin (94%). The biofilm formation results revealed that all strains could form biofilm. Among them, the proportions of strong, medium, and weak biofilm-forming strains were 41%, 42%, and 17%, respectively. Furthermore, the strains forming strong or moderate biofilm presented a statistically significant higher resistance than the weak formers (p < 0.05), especially for piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Although E. anophelis was notoriously resistant to large antibiotics, minocycline, doxycycline, and rifampin showed potent activity against this pathogen. The data in the present report revealed a positive association between biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance, which will provide a foundation for improved therapeutic strategies against E. anophelis infections in the future.",,457
498,35978761,Acute Blindness in the Elderly With Craniopharyngioma.,"The afferent visual system is one of the most common structures involved in patients with craniopharyngioma, and the manifestations include deficits in visual acuity, color vision, and visual fields. Here, we report a case of craniopharyngioma that presented with acute blindness in an elderly man. A healthy 54-year-old man presented with an acute progressive blurring of vision and became blind in six weeks. He developed symptoms of increased intracranial pressure only a week after becoming blind. On examination, visual acuity in both eyes was no perception of light (NPL). He also had left esotropia with restriction of left eye abduction. Both pupils were not responsive to light. The anterior segment was normal in both eyes. Fundoscopy showed bilateral pale optic discs. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a suprasellar mass consistent with craniopharyngioma that compressed the optic chiasma and adjacent brain structures with the presence of hydrocephalus. He underwent uneventful tumor debulking surgery. However, his vision remained NPL postoperatively. Ocular manifestations could be the only symptoms in craniopharyngioma. The delayed presentation may lead to a guarded prognosis.",,458
729,35975151,An induced-fit model for asymmetric organocatalytic reactions: a case study of the activation of olefins via chiral Brønsted acid catalysts.,"We elucidate the stereo-controlling factors of the asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of terminal olefins catalyzed by bulky Brønsted acids [Science 2018, 359 (6383), 1501-1505] using high-level electronic structure methods. The catalyst-substrate interaction is described using a dispersion-driven induced-fit model, in which the conformational changes of the catalyst and of the substrate in the transition states are governed to a large extent by London dispersion forces. The distortion energy of the catalyst is dominated by the change in the intramolecular dispersion interactions, while intermolecular catalyst-substrate dispersion interactions are the major stabilizing contribution in the transition state. This model provides a new general framework in which to discuss the stereoselectivity of transformations catalyzed by such confined organocatalysts.",,459
37,35984653,Association Between Operating Room Noise and Team Cognitive Workload in Cardiac Surgery.,"Excessive intra-operative noise in cardiac surgery has the potential to serve as source of distraction and additional cognitive workload for the surgical team, and may interfere with optimal performance. The separation from bypass phase is a technically complex phase of surgery, making it highly susceptible to communication breakdowns due to high cognitive demands and requiring tightly coupled team coordination. The objective of this study was to investigate team cognitive workload levels and communication in relation to intra-operative time periods representative of infrequent vs. frequent peaks in ambient noise. Compared to 5-minute segments with no peaks in noise at all, segments with the highest percentage of noise peaks (≥10%) were significantly associated with higher team members' heart rate before, during, and after noise segments analyzed. These noisier segments were also associated with a significantly higher level of case-irrelevant communication events. These data suggest that case-irrelevant conversations associated with a greater degree of excessive peaks in noise may be associated with team workload levels, warranting further investigation into efforts to standardize communication during critical surgical phases.",,460
15,35985189,Transcriptome sequencing reveals improved ammonia nitrogen tolerance in Zebra II strain of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum.,"In this research, we identified genes associated with ammonia nitrogen (TAN) stress response and resistance in juveniles of the Zebra II strain and a wild population of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. Both groups were subjected to a 96 h acute toxicity test using TAN concentrations of 17.617 ± 0.634 and 16.670 ± 0.7 mg/l, respectively. We then collected samples, conducted transcriptome sequencing and screened the sequences for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to TAN stress response. We identified 2908 and 2861 DEGs in the Zebra II and wild clam groups, respectively, and the two groups had 626 DEGs in common. The verified DEGs had less of a detoxification effect in the wild population than that in the Zebra II group. Gene Ontology database analysis showed that Zebra II juveniles were mainly enriched in protein phosphorylation, purine nucleoside binding, and kinase activity, whereas the wild population juveniles were primarily enriched in oxidases activity, organic acid metabolic processes, and extracellular regions. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis mainly highlighted aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis in Zebra II juveniles and sphingolipid metabolism, FOXO signaling, biosynthesis of aminoacyl tRNA, and other pathways in the wild population. These results show that the toxic effect of TAN on the Manila clam is related to a variety of pathways, which are mainly related to immune response, inflammatory response, metabolic pathways, and nerve conduction. This study provides basic data and theoretical reference for revealing the molecular regulation mechanism of the improved TAN tolerance of Zebra II strain as compared with the wild population of Ruditapes philippinarum.",,461
1204,35971615,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children: A Year in Review.,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a case definition for the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in May 2020 when reports started pouring in about a clinical syndrome in children which was temporally associated with coronavirus disease 2019 infection. It has also been referred to as pediatric inflammatory multisystemic syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Most of these patients test positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serology or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, although a small number of patients could test negative which would require an epidemiological link to the coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The initial clinical presentation could overlap with Kawasaki disease, severe coronavirus disease 2019 infection, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome. While multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is characterized by multisystem involvement with hyper inflammation and severe clinical presentation initially, the prognosis is generally good. Since it was first described, there have been multiple studies describing the demographic characteristics, laboratory features, and treatment paradigm.",,462
1848,35967792,Longitudinal changes of lactopontin (milk osteopontin) in term and preterm human milk.,"Lactopontin (LPN) in breast milk, also known as milk osteopontin is thought to play a myriad of important roles in infants when they are immature. The purpose of the present study was to examine the longitudinal changes in LPN concentrations in term and preterm milk, and elucidate the links between maternal characteristics, LPN levels, and child growth in a birth cohort. 131 mothers who delivered term, moderate-late preterm (MPT), very preterm (VPT), and extremely preterm (EPT) infants were included, milk samples were collected at 7, 14, 28, and 120 days postpartum. LPN concentration was determined by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Our results indicated that LPN change over time of VPT (P = 0.024) and EPT (P = 0.003) were significantly different from term milk, although they all gradually decreased with lactation. In terms of LPN-related factors, maternal age was a significant contributor in late mature milk and pre-pregnancy BMI a significant contributor to colostrum and transitional milk. We further investigated relationships between LPN levels and infant weight and our results suggested that high levels of LPN in breast milk might be useful for the catch-up growth of infants. LPN levels in breast milk are related to maternal factors, and differences in LPN levels may affect the growth of infants. As milk is a critical part in the mother-breastmilk-infant triad, the association between maternal-infant factors and milk LPN levels warrants further study.",,463
1518,35968368,Electroretinographic responses to luminance and cone-isolating white noise stimuli in macaques.,"Electroretinograms (ERGs) are mass potentials with a retinal origin that can be measured non-invasively. They can provide information about the physiology of the retina. Often, ERGs are measured to flashes that are highly unnatural stimuli. To obtain more information about the physiology of the retina, we measured ERGs with temporal white noise (TWN) stimuli that are more natural and keep the retina in a normal range of operation. The stimuli can be combined with the silent substitution stimulation technique with which the responses of single photoreceptor types can be isolated. We characterized electroretinogram (ERG) responses driven by luminance activity or by the L- or the M-cones. The ERGs were measured from five anesthetized macaques (two females) to luminance, to L-cone isolating and to M-cone isolating stimuli in which luminance or cone excitation were modulated with a TWN profile. The responses from different recordings were correlated with each other to study reproducibility and inter-individual variability. Impulse response functions (IRFs) were derived by cross-correlating the response with the stimulus. Modulation transfer functions (MTFs) were the IRFs in the frequency domain. The responses to luminance and L-cone isolating stimuli showed the largest reproducibility. The M-cone driven responses showed the smallest inter-individual variability. The IRFs and MTFs showed early (high frequency) components that were dominated by L-cone driven signals. A late component was equally driven by L- and M-cone activity. The IRFs showed characteristic similarities and differences relative to flash ERGs. The responses to TWN stimuli can be used to characterize the involvement of retinal cells and pathways to the ERG response. It can also be used to identify linear and non-linear processes.",,464
993,35974626,"Bound on hot-spot mix in high-velocity, high-adiabat direct-drive cryogenic implosions based on comparison of absolute x-ray and neutron yields.","In laser-driven implosions for laboratory fusion, the comparison of hot-spot x-ray yield to neutron production can serve to infer hot-spot mix. For high-performance direct-drive implosions, this ratio depends sensitively on the degree of equilibration between the ion and electron fluids. A scaling for x-ray yield as a function of neutron yield and characteristic ion and electron hot-spot temperatures is developed on the basis of simulations with varying degrees of equilibration. We apply this model to hot-spot x-ray measurements of direct-drive cryogenic implosions typical of the direct-drive designs with best ignition metrics. The comparison of the measured x-ray and neutron yields indicates that hot-spot mix, if present, is below a sensitivity estimated as ∼2% by-atom mix of ablator plastic into the hot spot.",,465
1103,35974516,Phase-field numerical study on the dynamic process of thermocapillary patterning.,"It is well known that surface tension is dependent on temperature, and thus a nonuniform temperature may cause thermocapillary flow which is referred to as the Marangoni effect. For a thin liquid-air film confined between a flat hot plate and a topographical cold template, it undergoes deformation due to thermocapillary flow. This phenomenon is termed as thermocapillary patterning, and has been used to fabricate micro- and nanostructure in polymer films. In most cases, the obtained structure conforms to the template; i.e., it can be considered as a replication technique. In this paper, we developed a two-phase flow numerical model based on the phase field to study the dynamic process of thermocapillary patterning. As a remeshing-free method, the phase field enables the incorporation of thermal field and multiphase flow with free surface deformation. The numerical model was employed to study the dynamic process of thermocapillary patterning. Meanwhile, the effects of some parameters, e.g., temperature, geometry parameters, and contact angle, were also investigated.",,466
717,35975168,Maternal blood metal concentrations are associated with C-reactive protein and cell adhesion molecules among pregnant women in Puerto Rico.,"Studies have revealed a link between aberrant levels of maternal C-reactive protein (CRP) and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) with adverse birth outcomes. Some epidemiologic studies have indicated that long-term metal exposures can modulate the levels of CRP and CAMs, but the associations between prenatal metal exposures and the levels of CRP and CAMs have yet to be studied more extensively. In this study, we assessed associations between maternal blood metal levels and CRP/CAMs among 617 pregnant women in the Puerto Rico PROTECT birth cohort. Blood samples were collected from participants at 16-20 (visit 1) and 24-28 (visit 3) weeks gestation. We measured concentrations of 11 metals using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). From the blood samples, CRP and CAMs intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) were also quantified using a customized Luminex assay. Linear-mixed effects models (LMEs) were used to regress CRP and CAMs on metals and included random intercepts for study participants to account for correlated repeated outcome measures. Fetal sex and visit effects were estimated using interaction terms between metal exposure variables and fetal sex, as well as visit indicators, respectively. We observed significant positive associations between nickel and CRP (Δ: 7.04, 95% CI = 0.75, 13.73) and between lead and VCAM (Δ: 4.57, 95% CI = 1.36, 7.89). The positive associations were mainly driven by mothers carrying male fetuses. We also observed various visit-specific associations. The significant associations between metals and CRP were predominantly driven by visit 3; however, the significant associations between metals and VCAM were mainly driven by visit 1. Certain maternal blood metal levels were significantly associated with CRP and CAMs and most of these associations were differentially driven by fetal sex, as well as by timing in pregnancy. Future studies should further explore metal-CRP/CAMs associations for a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of metal-induced adverse birth outcomes.",,467
998,35974621,Force density functional theory in- and out-of-equilibrium.,"When a fluid is subject to an external field, as is the case near an interface or under spatial confinement, then the density becomes spatially inhomogeneous. Although the one-body density provides much useful information, a higher level of resolution is provided by the two-body correlations. These give a statistical description of the internal microstructure of the fluid and enable calculation of the average interparticle force, which plays an essential role in determining both the equilibrium and dynamic properties of interacting fluids. We present a theoretical framework for the description of inhomogeneous (classical) many-body systems, based explicitly on the two-body correlation functions. By consideration of local Noether-invariance against spatial distortion of the system we demonstrate the fundamental status of the Yvon-Born-Green (YBG) equation as a local force-balance within the fluid. Using the inhomogeneous Ornstein-Zernike equation we show that the two-body correlations are density functionals and, thus, that the average interparticle force entering the YBG equation is also a functional of the one-body density. The force-based theory we develop provides an alternative to standard density functional theory for the study of inhomogeneous systems both in- and out-of-equilibrium. We compare force-based density profiles to the results of the standard potential-based (dynamical) density functional theory. In-equilibrium, we confirm both analytically and numerically that the standard approach yields profiles that are consistent with the compressibility pressure, whereas the force-density functional gives profiles consistent with the virial pressure. For both approaches we explicitly prove the hard-wall contact theorem that connects the value of the density profile at the hard-wall with the bulk pressure. The structure of the theory offers deep insights into the nature of correlation in dense and inhomogeneous systems.",,468
1301,35970646,A comparison of outcomes after lung transplantation between European and North American centers.,"With advancements in basic science and clinical medicine, lung transplantation (LT) has evolved rapidly over the last three decades. However, it is unclear if significant regional variations exist in long-term outcomes after LT. To investigate potential differences, we performed a retrospective, comparative cohort analysis of adult patients undergoing deceased donor single or double LT in North America (NA) or Europe between January 2006 and December 2016. Data up to April 2019 were abstracted from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Thoracic Organ Registry. We compared overall survival (OS) between North American and European LT centers in a propensity score matched analysis. In 3,115 well-matched pairs, though 30-day survival was similar between groups (NA 96.2% vs Europe 95.4%, p = 0.116), 5-year survival was significantly higher in European patients (NA 60.1% vs Europe 70.3%, p < 0.001). This survival difference persisted in a sensitivity analysis excluding Canadian patients. Prior observations suggest that these disparities are at least partly related to better access to care via universal healthcare models prevalent in Europe. Future studies are warranted to confirm our findings and explore other causal mechanisms. It is likely that potential solutions will require concerted efforts from healthcare providers and policymakers.",,469
2172,35967346,nCD64 index as a novel inflammatory indicator for the early prediction of prognosis in infectious and non-infectious inflammatory diseases: An observational study of febrile patients.,"Generally, febrile patients admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Fudan University Affiliated Huashan Hospital, China may eventually be diagnosed as infectious (ID) or non-infectious inflammatory diseases (NIID). Furthermore, mortality from sepsis remains incredibly high. Thus, early diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of sepsis is necessary. Here, we investigated neutrophil (n)CD64 index profile in a cohort of febrile patients and explored its diagnostic and prognostic value in ID and NIID. This observational cohort study enrolled 348 febrile patients from the Emergency Department and Department of Infectious Diseases. nCD64 index were detected using flow cytometry, and dynamically measured at different timepoints during follow-up. Procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin levels were measured routinely. Finally, the diagnostic and prognostic value of nCD64 index were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Kaplan-Meier curve analysis. Of included 348 febrile patients, 238, 81, and 29 were categorized into ID, NIID, and lymphoma groups, respectively. In ID patients, both SOFA score and infection site had impact on nCD64 index expression. In NIID patients, adult-onset Still's disease patients had the highest nCD64 index value, however, nCD64 index couldn't distinguish between ID and NIID. Regardless of the site of infection, nCD64 index was significantly higher in bacterial and viral infections than in fungal infections, but it could not discriminate between bacterial and viral infections. In bloodstream infections, gram-negative (G-) bacterial infections showed an obvious increase in nCD64 index compared to that of gram-positive (G+) bacterial infections. nCD64 index has the potential to be a biomarker for distinguishing between DNA and RNA virus infections. The routine measurement of nCD64 index can facilitate septic shock diagnosis and predict 28-day hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. Serial monitoring of nCD64 index in patients with sepsis is helpful for evaluating prognosis and treatment efficacy. Notably, nCD64 index is more sensitive to predict disease progression and monitor glucocorticoid treatment in patients with NIID. nCD64 index can be used to predict 28-day hospital mortality in patients with sepsis and to evaluate the prognosis. Serial determinations of nCD64 index can be used to predict and monitor disease progression in patients with NIID.",,470
1545,35968341,Constructing novel molecular subtypes and an 11-gene signature based on pyroptosis signaling for lung adenocarcinoma.,"Pyroptosis plays important roles in various cancers. In this study, we focused on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and aimed to develop new molecular subtypes based on pyroptosis signaling. Pyroptosis-related genes were used as a basis to classify molecular subtypes through unsupervised consensus clustering. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to characterize tumor microenvironment (TME) and functional pathways. Univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis were conducted to identify prognostic genes for establishing a prognostic model. Three molecular subtypes were established with distinct overall survival, TME and enriched pathways. C3 subtype had the longest survival and the highest immune infiltration. 11 prognostic genes were screened to build a prognostic signature for predicting LUAD prognosis. This study emphasized the important role of pyroptosis in LUAD development. Pyroptosis was considered to play critical roles in regulating TME. Moreover, the 11-gene signature could serve as an indicator for predicting LUAD prognosis, and was potential targets for developing targeted drugs.",,471
508,35978751,Heart Failure: From Typical Clinical Manifestations to the Surprising Final Diagnosis.,"The authors report a case of an 80-year-old woman with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, with exuberant acute congestive heart failure at admission. Fever, anemia, and an increase in inflammatory parameters were present, with imaging suggesting a respiratory infection as the main reason for decompensation. Empirical antibiotic therapy was instituted, with no clinical improvement even after escalation to broad-spectrum antibiotics and non-invasive ventilation with high support pressures, with no possibility of weaning. Due to maintenance of symptoms, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, revealing a large left atrial myxoma, obstructing the mitral valve in diastole. This case illustrates the potential severity of these benign tumors and their ability to mimic symptoms that are often evaluated in the daily life of an internist. The high clinical suspicion led to a diagnosis that was surprising due to its rarity and severity, with the patient being urgently referred for cardiac surgery.",,472
1336,35969922,Time course of optic nerve sheath dilation: In vitro response characteristics to controlled pressure elevations.,"Optic nerve sheath (ONS) dilation indicates intracranial pressure elevation under clinical conditions but limited data exist with regard to the dynamics of sheath expansion. To assess the time course of ONS widening and its stability under controlled pressure conditions in vitro. Pre-defined pressure steps up to 65 mmHg were applied to the perineural space of ex-vivo human optic nerves (n = 16). Using ultrasound, the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) was monitored over 500 s. Re-tests at low-pressure levels concluded each experimental series. In most cases, 50% of the total diameter-change were achieved within 50 s after pressure onset and 95% of the maximal diameter after 200 s. The diametric gains in each experiment were strongly correlated with the applied pressure levels (coefficient of variance 0,96) within preparations with variability of the transfer function across preparations. The time course of the dilation was found to follow an approximate natural logarithmic function (R2 = 0.93-0.99). The re-test condition revealed unchanged time course properties (5% significance level) despite starting regularly from a higher baseline-diameter after preceding exposures. ONS dilation commences rapidly after pressure exposure with a predictable time course over 3-4 min. Elasticity changes presumably affecting trabecular structures cause upward shifts of the optic nerve sheath pressure response. Clinically, ONSD shifts should be considered in serial measurements for increasing intracranial pressure monitoring, but relevant response delays are absent for lower or higher changes of intracranial pressure.",,473
282,35981838,Study Evaluating the Use of RenalGuard to Protect Patients at High Risk of AKI.,"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) can occur after cardiovascular procedures using contrast media, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. RenalGuard is a closed-loop system designed to match intravenous hydration with diuretic-induced diuresis that has shown mixed results in the prevention of CIN in previous randomized controlled trials. The STRENGTH (Study Evaluating the Use of RenalGuard to Protect Patients at High Risk of AKI) study assessed whether RenalGuard (PLC Medical Systems) is superior to standard intravenous hydration for CIN prevention in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing complex cardiovascular procedures. STRENGTH is a multicenter, international, open-label, postmarket, prospective, randomized (1:1) study monitored by the Cardiovascular European Research Center (Massy, France) that included a total of 259 patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration 15-40 mL/min/m2) requiring a complex coronary, structural, or peripheral procedure with an expected contrast injection of at least 3 times the estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients were randomized to either RenalGuard or intravenous saline hydration according to current guidelines. The primary endpoint, the incidence of CIN at day 3 after the procedure, was similar between the 2 groups (17/107 [15.9%] in the RG group vs 15/110 [13.9%] in the control group; P = 0.62). In addition, none of the secondary endpoints differed between the 2 groups. In high-risk patients undergoing complex cardiovascular interventions in experienced centers, furosemide-induced high urine output with matched hydration using the RenalGuard system did not reduce the risk of CIN and adverse outcomes at 12 months compared with conventional intravenous hydration.",,474
171,35983028,"A scoping review of complication prediction models in spinal surgery: An analysis of model development, validation and impact.","Predictive analytics are being used increasingly in the field of spinal surgery with the development of models to predict post-surgical complications. Predictive models should be valid, generalizable, and clinically useful. The purpose of this review was to identify existing post-surgical complication prediction models for spinal surgery and to determine if these models are being adequately investigated with internal/external validation, model updating and model impact studies. This was a scoping review of studies pertaining to models for the prediction of post-surgical complication after spinal surgery published over 10 years (2010-2020). Qualitative data was extracted from the studies to include study classification, adherence to Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines and risk of bias (ROB) assessment using the Prediction model study Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Model evaluation was determined using area under the curve (AUC) when available. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement was used as a basis for the search methodology in four different databases. Thirty studies were included in the scoping review and 80% (24/30) included model development with or without internal validation. Twenty percent (6/30) were exclusively external validation studies and only one study included an impact analysis in addition to model development and internal validation. Two studies referenced the TRIPOD guidelines and there was a high ROB in 100% of the studies using the PROBAST tool. The majority of post-surgical complication prediction models in spinal surgery have not undergone standardized model development and internal validation or adequate external validation and impact evaluation. As such there is uncertainty as to their validity, generalizability, and clinical utility. Future efforts should be made to use existing tools to ensure standardization in development and rigorous evaluation of prediction models in spinal surgery.",,475
1726,35968017,A framework for non-preserved consensus gene module detection in Johne's disease.,"Johne's disease caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is a major concern in dairy industry. Since, the pathogenesis of the disease is not clearly known, it is necessary to develop an approach to discover molecular mechanisms behind this disease with high confidence. Biological studies often suffer from issues with reproducibility. Lack of a method to find stable modules in co-expression networks from different datasets related to Johne's disease motivated us to present a computational pipeline to identify non-preserved consensus modules. Two RNA-Seq datasets related to MAP infection were analyzed, and consensus modules were detected and were subjected to the preservation analysis. The non-preserved consensus modules in both datasets were determined as they are modules whose connectivity and density are affected by the disease. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and TF genes in the non-preserved consensus modules were identified to construct integrated networks of lncRNA-mRNA-TF. These networks were confirmed by protein-protein interactions (PPIs) networks. Also, the overlapped hub genes between two datasets were considered hub genes of the consensus modules. Out of 66 consensus modules, 21 modules were non-preserved consensus modules, which were common in both datasets and 619 hub genes were members of these modules. Moreover, 34 lncRNA and 152 TF genes were identified in 12 and 19 non-preserved consensus modules, respectively. The predicted PPIs in 17 non-preserved consensus modules were significant, and 283 hub genes were commonly identified in both co-expression and PPIs networks. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that eight out of 21 modules were significantly enriched for biological processes associated with Johne's disease including inflammatory response, interleukin-1-mediated signaling pathway, type I interferon signaling pathway, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, regulation of interferon-beta production, and response to interferon-gamma. Moreover, some genes (hub mRNA, TF, and lncRNA) were introduced as potential candidates for Johne's disease pathogenesis such as TLR2, NFKB1, IRF1, ATF3, TREM1, CDH26, HMGB1, STAT1, ISG15, CASP3. This study expanded our knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in Johne's disease, and the presented pipeline enabled us to achieve more valid results.",,476
1813,35967842,Broadening the spectrum of ivermectin: Its effect on Trypanosoma cruzi and related trypanosomatids.,"Chagas disease is an endemic American parasitosis, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. The current therapies, benznidazole (BZN) and nifurtimox (NFX), show limited efficacy and multiple side effects. Thus, there is a need to develop new trypanocidal strategies. Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug with low human and veterinary toxicity with effects against T. brucei and Leishmania spp. Considering this and its relatively low cost, we evaluate IVM as a potential repurposed trypanocidal drug on T. cruzi and other trypanosomatids. We found that IVM affected, in a dose-dependent manner, the proliferation of T. cruzi epimastigotes as well as the amastigotes and trypomastigotes survival. The Selectivity Index for the amastigote stage with respect to Vero cells was 12. The IVM effect was also observed in Phytomonas jma 066 and Leishmania mexicana proliferation but not in Crithidia fasciculata. On the epimastigote stage, the IVM effect was trypanostatic at 50 μM but trypanocidal at 100 μM. The assays of the drug combinations of IVM with BNZ or NFX showed mainly additive effects among combinations. In silico studies showed that classical structures belonging to glutamate-gated Cl channels, the most common IVM target, are absent in kinetoplastids. However, we found in the studied trypanosomatid genomes one copy for putative IMPα and IMPβ, potential targets for IVM. The putative IMPα genes (with 76% similarity) showed conserved Armadillo domains but lacked the canonical IMPβ binding sequence. These results allowed us to propose a novel molecular target in T. cruzi and suggest IVM as a good candidate for drug repurposing in the Chagas disease context.",,477
1871,35967768,Association between metabolic body composition status and vitamin D deficiency: A cross-sectional study.,"This study aimed to investigate the risk of vitamin D deficiency in a relatively healthy Asian population, with (i) metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW) (homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] < 2. 5 without metabolic syndrome [MS], body mass index [BMI] < 25), (ii) metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) (HOMA-IR < 2.5, without MS, BMI ≥ 25), (iii) metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW) (HOMA-IR ≥ 2.5, or with MS, BMI < 25), and (iv) metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) (HOMA-IR ≥ 2.5, or with MS, BMI ≥ 25) stratified by age and sex. This cross-sectional study involved 6,655 participants aged ≥ 18 years who underwent health checkups between 2013 and 2016 at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers including anthropometric variables, glycemic indices, lipid profiles, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels, were retrospectively investigated. Compared to the MHNW group, the MHO group showed a higher odds ratio (OR) [1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.73] for vitamin D deficiency in men aged < 50 years. By contrast, in men aged > 50 years, the risk of vitamin D deficiency was higher in the MUO group (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.05-1.97). Among women aged < and ≥ 50 years, the MUO group demonstrated the highest risk for vitamin D deficiency, OR 2.33 vs. 1.54, respectively. Our study revealed that in women of all ages and men aged > 50 years, MUO is associated with vitamin D deficiency and elevated levels of metabolic biomarkers. Among men aged < 50 years, MHO had the highest OR for vitamin D deficiency.",,478

1872,35967766,Comparison of two distinct arrival and treatment programs for bovine respiratory disease in high-risk feeder cattle entering a feedlot.,"Antimicrobial metaphylaxis of high-risk cattle entering the feedlot is a common management strategy implemented against bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Typically, following a prescribed postmetaphylactic interval (PMI), animals displaying clinical signs of BRD are pulled from the feedlot pen and treated with antimicrobials when treatment criteria are met. The objective of this study was to compare 2 distinct sequential BRD treatment protocols each consisting of a metaphylactic antimicrobial plus 2 potential subsequent as-needed treatment antimicrobials. Heifers at high-risk for BRD (n = 1000; initial BW = 229 kg ± 1.6) purchased from sale barns in the southeastern U.S. were transported to a contract research feedlot in Nebraska and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental groups (10 blocks of 100 animals each; 50 per treatment group). Experimental groups consisted of: (1) tulathromycin metaphylaxis (2.5 mg/kg) followed by ceftiofur crystalline free acid (6.6 mg/kg) and danofloxacin (8 mg/kg) for subsequent first and second as-needed BRD treatment, respectively (TCD) or (2) tildipirosin metaphylaxis (4 mg/kg) followed by florfenicol-flunixin meglumine (40 mg/kg florfenicol; 2.2 mg/kg flunixin meglumine) and enrofloxacin (12.5 mg/kg) for subsequent first and second as-needed BRD treatment, respectively (TFFE). Following expiration of the 7-d PMI, calves that showed signs of clinical BRD were pulled and examined to determine if treatment was necessary based on a clinical attitude score (CAS). Heifers with a CAS of 1 accompanied by ≥40°C rectal temperature, and all heifers with a CAS ≥ 2 regardless of rectal temperature, received the appropriate first-treatment antimicrobial. Upon relapse, following expiration of the post-treatment interval (PTI), heifers received the appropriate second-treatment antimicrobial. In the first 90 d, calves in the TFFE experimental group received more first-treatments than calves in the TCD experimental group (P = 0.054) and resulted in 50% greater mortality (P < 0.043) relative to the TCD heifers. From d 0 to closeout, first-treatment morbidity as well as mortality were greater in TFFE relative to TCD (P ≤ 0.032). Growth performance did not differ between treatments in the first 90 d; however, ADG was greater (P = 0.033) and G:F improved (P = 0.014) at closeout in TCD versus TFFE on a deads-in basis. Closeout economics revealed a $50.78/animal greater profit in the TCD experimental group relative to TFFE.",,480
333,35979525,Comparison of the Objective Severity and the Esthetic Perception of Nail Symptoms in Psoriasis.,"Nail changes are frequent in psoriasis, and the negative impact of nail psoriasis on patients' quality of life is well known. No data are available however about the association of the objective severity of nail psoriasis and the subjective perception of these symptoms. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between the severity of psoriatic nail changes (as determined by the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index [NAPSI]) and the esthetic assessment of nail psoriasis. Participants (general population and psoriasis patients) were asked to rate 19 nail images (including psoriatic and healthy nails) on a 0-10 scale, based on how disturbing they considered them esthetically. Objective severity (NAPSI) scores of nails were compared to the subjective evaluation values. Nail symptom severity correlated well with the subjective scores. However, while nails with low (0) and high (6-8) NAPSI values received consistent subjective scores, the esthetic perception of nails with moderate NAPSI scores was rather heterogeneous. The age of the respondents showed robust positive correlation with the subjective assessment of nail symptoms both within the psoriatic and the general population.

An 8-year-old female spayed golden retriever with chronic vomiting was found to have a cluster of multiple, round, well-defined, hypoechoic foci of varying sizes surrounded by gas within the lumen of the stomach on ultrasonographic examination. Further endoscopic examination revealed multiple raised mass-like lesions in the fundus on endoscopic examination. Histopathological findings were consistent with Helicobacter spp. infection. The dog was treated with both amoxicillin 400 mg and clarithromycin 180 mg BID for 21 days and omeprazole 20 mg SID for 34 days. After the treatment, the vomiting and fundic lesions were resolved on ultrasonographic examination. This case represents a novel gross morphologic presentation for Helicobacter spp. gastritis that responded to appropriate therapy and highlights how early intervention with advanced imaging can aid in diagnosis and treatment.",,482
647,35976570,Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of the Dipeptidyl Peptidase 1 Inhibitor Brensocatib for Non-cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis.,"Brensocatib is an investigational, first-in-class, selective, and reversible dipeptidyl peptidase 1 inhibitor that blocks activation of neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs). The NSPs neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3 are believed to be central to the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases, including bronchiectasis. In a phase II study, oral brensocatib 10 mg and 25 mg reduced sputum neutrophil elastase activity and prolonged the time to pulmonary exacerbation in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE). A population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model was developed to characterize brensocatib exposure, determine potential relationships between brensocatib exposure and efficacy and safety measures, and inform dose selection in clinical studies. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data pooled from a phase I study of once-daily brensocatib (10, 25, and 40 mg) in healthy adults and a phase II study of once-daily brensocatib (10 mg and 25 mg) in adults with NCFBE were used to develop a PPK model and to evaluate potential covariate effects on brensocatib pharmacokinetics. PK-efficacy relationships for sputum neutrophil elastase below the level of quantification (BLQ) and reduction in pulmonary exacerbation and PK-safety relationships for adverse events of special interest (AESIs; periodontal disease, hyperkeratosis, and infections other than pulmonary infections) were evaluated based on model-predicted brensocatib exposure. A total of 1284 steady-state brensocatib concentrations from 225 individuals were included in the PPK data set; 241 patients with NCFBE from the phase II study were included in the pharmacodynamic (PD) population for the PK/PD analyses. The PPK model that best described the observed data consisted of two distributional compartments and linear clearance. Two significant covariates were found: age on volume of distribution and renal function on apparent oral clearance. PK-efficacy analysis revealed a threshold brensocatib exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) effect for attaining sputum neutrophil elastase BLQ and a strong relationship between sputum neutrophil elastase BLQ and reduction in pulmonary exacerbations. A PK-safety evaluation showed no noticeable trends between brensocatib exposure and the incidence of AESIs. Based on the predicted likelihood of clinical outcomes for sputum neutrophil elastase BLQ and pulmonary exacerbations, brensocatib doses of 10 mg and 25 mg once daily were selected for a phase III clinical trial in patients with NCFBE (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04594369). PPK results revealed that age and renal function have a moderate effect on brensocatib exposure. However, this finding does not warrant dose adjustments based on age or in those with mild or moderate renal impairment. The PK/PD evaluation demonstrated the clinically meaningful relationship between suppression of neutrophil elastase activity and reduction in exacerbations in brensocatib-treated patients with NCFBE, supporting further development of brensocatib for bronchiectasis.",,483
767,35975070,Vanillin-crosslinked chitosan/ZnO nanocomposites as a drug delivery system for 5-fluorouracil: study on the release behavior via mesoporous ZrO2-Co3O4 nanoparticles modified sensor and antitumor activity.,"Herein, a series of vanillin-crosslinked chitosan (Vn-CS) nanocomposites (NCs) containing various contents of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) was prepared and characterized via FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, TGA, SEM and TEM. Changing the weight% of ZnO NPs in the prepared NCs resulted in an improvement in their antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains compared with the unmodified CS, and the encapsulation efficiency of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was found to be in the range of 61.4-69.2%. Subsequently, the release of 5-FU was monitored utilizing the mesoporous ZrO2-Co3O4 NPs modified carbon paste sensor via the square-wave adsorptive anodic stripping voltammetry (SW-AdASV) technique. Also, the release mechanism of 5-FU from each NC was studied by applying the zero-order, first-order, Hixson-Crowell and Higuchi models to the experimental results. The cytotoxicity of prepared NCs and 5-FU-encapsulated NCs was evaluated against the HePG-2, MCF-7 and HCT-116 cancer cell lines, in addition to the WI-38 and WISH normal cell lines using the MTT assay. Notably, 5-FU/CV10 NC exhibited the highest antitumor activity towards all tested cancer cell lines and a moderate activity against WI-38 and WISH normal cell lines with IC50 values of 28.02 ± 2.5 and 31.65 ± 2.7 μg mL-1, respectively. The obtained nanocomposites exhibited suitable selectivity with minimum toxicity against normal cells.",,484
488,35978867,Incretin based therapy and pancreatic cancer: Realising the reality.,"Incretin-based therapies like glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors help maintain the glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with additional systemic benefits and little risk of hypoglycaemia. These medications are associated with low-grade chronic pancreatitis in animal models inconsistently. The incidence of acute pancreatitis was also reported in some human studies. This inflammation provides fertile ground for developing pancreatic carcinoma (PC). Although the data from clinical trials and population-based studies have established safety regarding PC, the pathophysiological possibility that low-grade chronic pancreatitis leads to PC remains. We review the existing literature and describe the relationship between incretin-based therapies and PC.",,485
560,35978574,Purification and Immunostaining of Mouse Ependymal Ciliary Shafts.,"Cilia and flagella are microtubule-based hair-like organelles protruding from the surface of most eukaryotic cells, and play essential roles in cell locomotion, left-right asymmetry, embryo development, and tissue homeostasis. With isolated cilia and flagella, great progress has been made in understanding the composition, structure, and function of cilia. However, the current cilia/flagella isolation methods are deficient in the integrity or productivity of purified cilia when applied to mammalian motile cilia. Here, we describe a new protocol that isolates cilia shafts from mouse ependymal cells, by horizontal shear force and mild detergent. This method enables the production of virtually integral cilia with high yields and less cell body contamination. It is suitable for immunostaining, puromycin labeling assay, and proximity ligation assay of mammalian motile cilia. Graphical abstract.",,486

Yet a previously underexplored component of the immune system - natural killer (NK) cell, is coming to the forefront of immunotherapeutic attempts. In this review, we discuss the contributions of NK cells in the success of current immunotherapies, provide an overview of the current preclinical and clinical strategies at harnessing NK cells for cancer treatment, and highlight that NK cell-mediated therapies emerge as a major target in the next wave of cancer immunotherapy.",,487
1393,35968688,Decreased sympathetic cardiovascular influences and hormone-physiological changes in response to Covid-19-related adaptations under different learning environments.,"To examine the implications of the transition from face-to-face to online learning from a psychobiological perspective, this study investigated potential differences in physiological stress parameters of students engaged in online or face-to-face learning and determined whether these can be identified as possible mediators between learning experience and achievement emotions. In a randomized experimental field study, medical students (n = 82) attended either regular face-to-face classes of the microscopic anatomy course or the same practical course online using Zoom videoconferencing platform. The present study investigated Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and salivary cortisol concentration as stress correlates, within the contexts of online and face-to-face learning and compared these parameters with a control group that was measured at rest. Additionally, participants completed a standardized questionnaire about their experienced emotions in relation to task achievement and subjective stress levels. A significant reduction in HRV was found in face-to-face learning, suggesting stronger stress responses in the face-to-face learning environment (η2  = 0.421, p < 0.001). Furthermore, participants engaged in face-to-face learning showed significantly higher cortisol concentrations (η2  = 0.115, p = 0.032). Additionally, increased sympathetic activation correlated with the discrete positive emotion of enjoyment exclusively within the face-to-face condition (r = 0.365, p = 0.043). These results indicate that the transfer of a face-to-face practical course in microscopic anatomy to an online learning environment is associated with decreased sympathetic and enhanced vagal cardiovascular influences, together with lower cortisol concentrations in healthy medical students.",,488
2324,35967054,Exploring the Effect of Glycerol and Hydrochloric Acid on Mesoporous Silica Synthesis: Application in Insulin Loading.,"Mesoporous silica (MPS), a carrier for active pharmaceutical ingredients, has a wide range of particle and pore morphology. A thorough understanding of ingredients used in MPS synthesis is an important prerequisite for optimizing its physicochemical characteristics. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of glycerol and hydrochloric acid on the characteristics of synthesized MPS. Ordered MPS materials were synthesized using the pluronic P123 template and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) precursor. A three-level factorial design was employed to study the interaction between glycerol and hydrochloric acid. The optimized MPS particles were reasonably uniform in shape (short and rod-shaped) and < 1 μm in size with a smooth surface morphology. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis revealed that the uniform cylindrical pores of the prepared MPS had a diameter > 5 nm and a total surface area > 500 m2/g. With increasing acid and glycerol concentrations, the particle size of MPS decreased. However, while the glycerol increased the heterogeneity of the synthesized particles, the acid decreased it. The developed MPS was successfully loaded with a biological drug (insulin) with a 21.94% encapsulation efficiency. The MPS prepared in this study exhibits potential applications as a drug delivery carrier for drugs with a large molecular weight.",,489
826,35974945,Association between antihypertensive drugs and the elderly's oral health- related quality of life: Results of Amirkola cohort study.,"Hypertension is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world. The prevalence of hypertension in the elderly is increasing. Patients with high blood pressure have to take medication throughout their lives. In this study, the relationship between antihypertensive drugs and oral health-related quality of life in the elderly was evaluated. This modified cross-sectional study, which is the part of the second phase of the Amirkola Health and Ageing Project (AHAP), was performed on 900 elderly people. Participants included 300 people with hypertension under medical treatment, 300 people with hypertension without medication and 300 people with normal blood pressure. All patients' blood pressure was recorded, and the standard xerostomia questionnaire and GOHAI questionnaire (Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index) was completed for all participants. Then, the obtained data were analyzed by SPSS 17, whereby student's t-test, ANOVA and chi square, Pearson correlation coefficient and logistic regression model were used. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The mean GOHAI score in the three studied groups: hypertensive under medication treatment, hypertensive without medication treatment and normal blood pressure (51.1±7.4, 51.7±7.3, 51.1±7.5, respectively) did not differ significantly (P=0.533).The frequency of xerostomia was significantly different in the three groups (P=0.008). Among the antihypertensive drugs, the highest rate of xerostomia was due to the use of calcium channel blockers (31.1%) and diuretics (26.8%). In our study, although antihypertensive medications were associated with xerostomia, they did not decrease the oral health-related quality of life.",,490
1082,35974537,Memory in quantum dot blinking.,"The photoluminescence intermittency (blinking) of quantum dots is interesting because it is an easily measured quantum process whose transition statistics cannot be explained by Fermi's golden rule. Commonly, the transition statistics are power-law distributed, implying that quantum dots possess at least trivial memories. By investigating the temporal correlations in the blinking data, we demonstrate with high statistical confidence that there is nontrivial memory between the on and off brightness duration data of blinking quantum dots. We define nontrivial memory to be statistical complexity greater than one. We show that this memory cannot be discovered using the transition distribution. We show by simulation that this memory does not arise from standard data manipulations. Finally, we conclude that at least three physical mechanisms can explain the measured nontrivial memory: (1) storage of state information in the chemical structure of a quantum dot; (2) the existence of more than two intensity levels in a quantum dot; and (3) the overlap in the intensity distributions of the quantum dot states, which arises from fundamental photon statistics.",,491
881,35974842,Tumor-Like Brain Lesions Associated With Variants of Uncertain Significance Compared to Previous Studies: A Case Report.,"TREX1 is a gene that encodes an exonuclease on the C-terminal strand at the 3 ́ end for DNA repair. Multiple syndromes associated with the alteration of this gene have been described, focusing in this case on retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL).

At the time of diagnosis, the patient presented weakness in the lower limbs and dysesthesias of the right body at the beginning of the clinical picture, without visual alterations or retinal changes at fundus examination. A cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study showed a pseudotumoral lesion at the inferior frontal gyrus with a report of a choline peak in spectroscopy, ring enhancement in contrasted T1 sequence, and apparent central necrosis.

176,35982929,Histological and hemodynamic characterization of corpus luteum throughout the luteal phase in pregnant and non-pregnant buffalos in relation to nitric oxide levels based on its anatomical determination.,"This study aims to compare the complete growth and development of corpus luteum (CL) in domestic buffalos from day 5 until day 40 after ovulation either in pregnant or non-pregnant animals and whether luteal vascularity (LV) with progesterone (P4) and nitric oxide (NO) could determine luteal functionality or not. Pluriparous buffalos (Bubalus bubalis) were categorized as pregnant (n = 6) or non-pregnant (n = 9) after pregnancy check at day 25. Animals were subjected to ultrasound analysis to determine the CL area (cm2) and LV. Blood sampling was performed following the Doppler examination. Ovarian tissue samples from non-pregnant buffalo genitalia (n = 18) and early pregnant buffalo genitalia (n = 3) were collected from great abattoirs. Luteal Doppler indices were lower in the pregnant group, while peak systolic velocity (PSV) was increased (p < 0.05) in the same pregnant females. Both P4 and NOMs were elevated (p < 0.05) in the pregnant group. There was a positive correlation (p < 0.01) between P4 and CL PSV. Based on our macroscopical examination, the CL of non-pregnant buffalos was classified into four stages. Histologically, stage I showed that CL was covered by a highly vascularized connective tissue (CT) capsule. It consisted of small and large lutein cells, whereas stage II was similar to stage I except for the presence of numerous fibroblast cells and vacuolated cells. Stage III was characterized by increasing the number of collagen fibers and the thickness of the blood vessels. Stage IV revealed thickening of the CT capsule and septae, regressed capillaries and arterioles, in addition to shrunken degenerated lutein cells. CL of pregnant buffalos revealed the same structure as CL at stage II. CL area was increased in the pregnant group. The collective data suggested that evaluation of the luteal artery could be extremely helpful to determine the potential benefits of colored and pulsed Doppler in CL vascularization assessment in both luteal and early pregnancy phases.",,494
1929,35967680,Episodic memory training in elderly: A systematic review.,"Episodic memory is a cognitive process that allows the recall of experiences, learning, and the pursuit of future goals. During the aging process, episodic memory declines negatively, impacting social and psychological aspects in the elderly. Such intervention strategies as cognitive training are non-pharmacological ways of reducing these losses. We systematically reviewed studies of the cognitive training of episodic memory in healthy elderly individuals and elderly individuals with clinical conditions. We systematically searched the PubMed, PsycNET, Web of Science, and SciELO databases using the descriptors Episodic Memory AND Training AND Elderly OR Aging OR Dementia in English and translated into Portuguese. Of the 572 articles that were identified by the search, 23 were included in the final analysis. The main variables that comprised the intervention protocols (i.e., characteristics of the sample, type of control group, mode of episodic memory training, and duration of training) were investigated, as well as the outcome variables, efficacy, and risk of bias. The main results indicated effectiveness with regard to different forms of the cognitive training of episodic memory. Episodic memory training among the elderly can mitigate the negative effects of cognitive decline in dementia and healthy subjects promoting impacts at social, psychological, and economic levels. Although it is a widely studied topic, further empirical studies on the utility of episodic memory training in healthy elderly individuals and elderly individuals with clinical conditions are still needed.",,495
555,35978579,"Genome-assisted Identification, Purification, and Characterization of Bacteriocins.","Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides with activity against antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens. Here, we describe a set of methods aimed at purifying, identifying, and characterizing new bacteriocins. The purification consists of ammonium sulphate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, and reversed-phase chromatography. The yield of the bacteriocin is quantified by bacteriocin antimicrobial activity in a microtiter plate assay after each purification step. The mass of the purified bacteriocin is assessed by MALDI TOF MS analysis of the active fractions after reversed-phase chromatography. The mass is compared with the theoretical mass based on genetic information from the whole genome sequencing of the bacteriocin producer strain. Physicochemical characterization is performed by assessing antimicrobial activity following heat and protease treatments. Fluorescent techniques are used to examine the capacity of the bacteriocin to disrupt membrane integrity. Herein a set of protocols for purification and characterization of the bacteriocin nisin Z is used as a typical example in this paper.",,496
2377,35966996,A data-driven machine learning approach for brain-computer interfaces targeting lower limb neuroprosthetics.,"Prosthetic devices that replace a lost limb have become increasingly performant in recent years. Recent advances in both software and hardware allow for the decoding of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to improve the control of active prostheses with brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Most BCI research is focused on the upper body. Although BCI research for the lower extremities has increased in recent years, there are still gaps in our knowledge of the neural patterns associated with lower limb movement. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to show the feasibility of decoding lower limb movements from EEG data recordings. The second aim is to investigate whether well-known neuroplastic adaptations in individuals with an amputation have an influence on decoding performance. To address this, we collected data from multiple individuals with lower limb amputation and a matched able-bodied control group. Using these data, we trained and evaluated common BCI methods that have already been proven effective for upper limb BCI. With an average test decoding accuracy of 84% for both groups, our results show that it is possible to discriminate different lower extremity movements using EEG data with good accuracy. There are no significant differences (p = 0.99) in the decoding performance of these movements between healthy subjects and subjects with lower extremity amputation. These results show the feasibility of using BCI for lower limb prosthesis control and indicate that decoding performance is not influenced by neuroplasticity-induced differences between the two groups.",,497
2163,35967355,Involvement of B cells in the development of systemic sclerosis.,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare intractable systemic disease that causes fibrosis and vasculopathy against a background of autoimmune abnormalities. Although the etiology is not yet fully understood, the type of autoantibodies detected in SSc is closely associated with disease severity and prognosis, supporting that those autoimmune abnormalities play an important role in the pathogenesis of SSc. Although the direct pathogenicity of autoantibodies found in SSc is unknown, many previous studies have shown that B cells are involved in the development of SSc through a variety of functions. Furthermore, a number of clinical studies have been conducted in which B-cell depletion therapy has been tried for SSc, and many of these studies have found B-cell depletion therapy to be effective for SSc. However, the involvement of B cells in pathogenesis is complex, as they not only promote inflammation but also play an inhibitory role. This article outlines the role of B cells in the development of SSc, including the latest research.",,498
1314,35970067,The African swine fever modelling challenge: Model comparison and lessons learnt.,"Robust epidemiological knowledge and predictive modelling tools are needed to address challenging objectives, such as: understanding epidemic drivers; forecasting epidemics; and prioritising control measures. Often, multiple modelling approaches can be used during an epidemic to support effective decision making in a timely manner. Modelling challenges contribute to understanding the pros and cons of different approaches and to fostering technical dialogue between modellers. In this paper, we present the results of the first modelling challenge in animal health - the ASF Challenge - which focused on a synthetic epidemic of African swine fever (ASF) on an island. The modelling approaches proposed by five independent international teams were compared. We assessed their ability to predict temporal and spatial epidemic expansion at the interface between domestic pigs and wild boar, and to prioritise a limited number of alternative interventions. We also compared their qualitative and quantitative spatio-temporal predictions over the first two one-month projection phases of the challenge. Top-performing models in predicting the ASF epidemic differed according to the challenge phase, host species, and in predicting spatial or temporal dynamics. Ensemble models built using all team-predictions outperformed any individual model in at least one phase. The ASF Challenge demonstrated that accounting for the interface between livestock and wildlife is key to increasing our effectiveness in controlling emerging animal diseases, and contributed to improving the readiness of the scientific community to face future ASF epidemics. Finally, we discuss the lessons learnt from model comparison to guide decision making.",,499
2013,35967574,Respiratory distress syndrome management in resource limited settings-Current evidence and opportunities in 2022.,"The complications of prematurity are the leading cause of neonatal mortality worldwide, with the highest burden in the low- and middle-income countries of South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. A major driver of this prematurity-related neonatal mortality is respiratory distress syndrome due to immature lungs and surfactant deficiency. The World Health Organization's Every Newborn Action Plan target is for 80% of districts to have resources available to care for small and sick newborns, including premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome. Evidence-based interventions for respiratory distress syndrome management exist for the peripartum, delivery and neonatal intensive care period- however, cost, resources, and infrastructure limit their availability in low- and middle-income countries. Existing research and implementation gaps include the safe use of antenatal corticosteroid in non-tertiary settings, establishing emergency transportation services from low to high level care facilities, optimized delivery room resuscitation, provision of affordable caffeine and surfactant as well as implementing non-traditional methods of surfactant administration. There is also a need to optimize affordable continuous positive airway pressure devices able to blend oxygen, provide humidity and deliver reliable pressure. If the high prematurity-related neonatal mortality experienced in low- and middle-income countries is to be mitigated, a concerted effort by researchers, implementers and policy developers is required to address these key modalities.",,500
874,35974849,Monitoring Endocrine Complications of Immunotherapy: A Screening Tool.,"Introduction The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer therapy in recent years. Immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies against checkpoint molecules, including programmed death (PD)-1, PD ligand (PD-L)1, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA)-4, has become a cornerstone in cancer therapy. However, due to the physiologic role of checkpoint molecules in preventing autoimmunity, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have emerged as frequent complications. As the use of immunotherapy increases, a better understanding of irAEs and screening tools for timely diagnosis and management are needed. Materials and methods We surveyed oncology providers at our institution with 10 questions assessing their knowledge, and comfort levels in diagnosing and managing endocrine irAEs. We created an endocrine clinic referral order specifically for oncology-related endocrinopathies and created a screening tool for diagnosing these endocrinopathies. We met with our oncology providers in three different hour-long sessions. A post-intervention survey was sent out six months after our initial meeting to assess changes in the participants' knowledge and comfort levels. We also reviewed the electronic medical records system for the number of new referrals to endocrinology clinic. Results A total of 27 (N) participants responded to the initial survey and 14 (n) responded to the subsequent survey six months later. Based on the initial survey, only a minority (26%) of respondents were comfortable diagnosing and managing (15%) immunotherapy-related adrenal dysfunction whereas more respondents were comfortable diagnosing (55%) and managing (56%) thyroid dysfunction. The majority (67%) of the respondents knew which immunotherapies commonly are implicated in hypophysitis but only 42% of them were aware of the next steps of its management. We noted a significant increase in self-reported comfort levels in diagnosing (p < 0.05) and managing (p < 0.05) adrenal disorders post-intervention. There was also a trend of improvement in participants' comfort levels regarding diagnosing and managing thyroid dysfunction, management of hypophysitis, and immunotherapies implicated in thyroid dysfunction but the changes did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant change in their knowledge regarding immunotherapies implicated in hypophysitis and natural history of thyroid dysfunction in this setting. In the six months following our intervention, 30% (n=21) of the patients referred to the endocrine clinic were for immune-related endocrinopathies compared to 19% (n=7) of patients over a similar duration before the intervention. Data on the time between referral and endocrinology appointment was available for 16 out of the 21 patients and the mean (±SD) time to endocrine clinic appointment was 2.66 (±1.95) weeks. Nine (43%) of the 21 referred patients were seen in endocrinology clinic within two weeks. Conclusions Although immune-related endocrinopathies are rarely fatal, they have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Endocrinopathies are typically manageable with prompt recognition and treatment. But the subtle and non-specific manifestations make the diagnostic process a challenge. Standardized and practical screening tools can help in diagnosing these adverse events promptly, seeking specialized care if needed and may also aid in reducing healthcare-related costs.",,501
196,35982840,CFD simulations of respiratory airflow in human upper airways response to walking and running for oral breathing condition.,"Walking and running are common types of physical activities that people do in day to day living, to improve health and physical fitness or for recreation. During a physical activity, rate and depth of breathing increase because working muscles need extra oxygen in order to produce energy. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to investigate respiratory airflow dynamics in human upper airways response to walking and running for oral breathing. The numerical simulations were done in a realistic CT-scan airway model using ANAYS Fluent 19.0 software. Flow fields were analysed numerically and flow patterns were investigated in the airway model during inspiration and expiration response to walking and running. The axial velocity distributions and secondary flow patterns for the two respiratory phases were analysed response to the two physical activities at different cross-sections of the airway model. The maximum velocity, wall pressure and wall shear stress values for running were respectively 3.2, 9.4 and 5.9 times higher than that of walking during inspiration. The mixing of flow streamlines was observed to be higher during running than walking because of more significant turbulence. More skewed flows at airway curvatures were observed at inspiration than expiration. The results of this study supported the fact that running is a more intense activity than walking from a respiratory dynamics point of view.",,502
981,35974638,Evidence for additional third-order transitions in the two-dimensional Ising model.,"We employ the microcanonical inflection-point analysis method, developed for the systematic identification and classification of phase transitions in systems of any size, to study the two-dimensional Ising model at various lattice sizes and in the thermodynamic limit. Exact results for the density of states, which were obtained by exact algorithmic computation, provide evidence for higher-order transitions in addition to the well-studied second-order ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition. An independent third-order phase transition is identified in the ferromagnetic phase, whereas another third-order transition resides in the paramagnetic phase. The latter is a dependent transition, i.e., it is inevitably associated with the critical transition, but it remains separate from the critical point in the thermodynamic limit. For a deeper insight into the nature of these additional transitions, a detailed analysis of spin clusters is performed.",,503
398,35979276,Choroidal thickening with serous retinal detachment in BRAF/MEK inhibitor-induced uveitis: A case report.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of patients with unresectable metastatic malignant melanoma. In addition to systemic side effects, several usually mild ocular adverse effects have been reported. We report a case of rarely reported vision-threatening bilateral panuveitis with serous retinal detachment, thickened choroid, and chorioretinal folds associated with dabrafenib and trametinib targeted therapy for B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutant metastatic cutaneous melanoma. A 59-year-old female patient with metastatic melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib presented with blurry vision and central scotoma lasting for 3 d in both eyes. Clinical examination and multimodal imaging revealed inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber, mild vitritis, bullous multiple serous retinal detachments, and chorioretinal folds in both eyes. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was suspended, and the patient was treated with topical and intravenous corticosteroids followed by oral corticosteroid treatment with a tapering schedule. One and a half months after the disease onset, ocular morphological and functional improvement was noted. Due to the metastatic melanoma dissemination, BRAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors were reintroduced and some mild ocular adverse effects reappeared, which later subsided after receiving oral corticosteroids. Patients on combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib may rarely develop severe bilateral panuveitis with a good prognosis. Further studies have to establish potential usefulness of ophthalmological examination for asymptomatic patients. Furthermore, appropriate guidelines for managing panuveitis associated with dabrafenib and trametinib should be established.",,504
719,35975166,Associations between PFAS occurrence and multimorbidity as observed in an electronic health record cohort.,"Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are associated with health outcomes ranging from cancer to high cholesterol. However, there has been little examination of how PFAS exposure might impact the development of multiple chronic diseases, known as multimorbidity. Here, we associated the presence of one or more PFAS in water systems serving the zip code of residence with chronic disease and multimorbidity. We used data from the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule 3 to estimate exposure to PFAS for a random sample of 10,168 patients from the University of North Carolina Healthcare System. The presence of 16 chronic diseases was determined via. their electronic health records. We used a logistic regression model in a cross-sectional study design to associate the presence of one or more PFAS with multimorbidity. Models were adjusted for age, race, sex, smoking status, socioeconomic status, and 20 county-level confounders. There were four PFAS found in water systems that served at least one zip code represented in our patient data: PFOA, PFHpA, PFOS, and PFHxS. Exposure to any PFAS was associated with a odds ratio of 1.25 for multimorbidity (95% confidence interval = 1.09, 1.45). Among the chronic diseases with at least 300 cases, we observed associations with dyslipidemia, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and osteoporosis. Exposure to PFAS is associated with a range of chronic diseases as well as multimorbidity. Accounting for the joint impacts of PFAS on multiple chronic conditions may give an increasingly clear picture of the public health impacts of PFAS.",,505
1665,35968109,Grain-filling characteristics and yield formation of wheat in two different soil fertility fields in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain.,"Clarifying factors that underpinning the variation in wheat yield components between high and middle soil fertility fields is critical to increase grain production and narrow yield gap for smallholder farming systems in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain (3HP), which characterized by a large variation in soil fertility. Two-year field experiments were conducted to investigate wheat tillering, leaf photosynthesis, and grain filling characteristics in different soil fertility fields: high soil fertility field (HF) and middle soil fertility field (MF). Results showed that the spike formation rate in HF was 12.7%-13.0% higher than that in MF, leading to an 18.0%-19.8% increase in spike number. In addition, HF improved canopy light interception and leaf photosynthesis characteristics after anthesis and delayed leaf senescence, contributing to the increase in both the active grain filling period and grain filling rate. This resulted in a higher 1,000 grain weight in HF, which was 8.2%-8.3% higher than that in MF. Compared to MF, HF obtained higher yields at 9,840 kg ha-1 in 2017/18 and 11,462 kg ha-1 in 2018/19, respectively. In summary, higher spike number and 1,000-grain weight, which were mediated by spike-formation rate, maximization of light interception and improved leaf photosynthesis. These results would have important implications for narrowing yield gap between MF and HF in the 3HP.",,506
2041,35967538,Straight versus Coiled Catheters in Peritoneal Dialysis in a Tertiary Care Center in Malaysia.,"Despite improvements in insertion techniques and catheter designs, catheter malfunction and infection pose a great source of morbidity and limitation to adequate dialysis. The two most used peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters are the coiled and straight PD catheters. Existing studies show conflicting results. This study aims to look at the clinical outcomes and mortality between the two catheter types. This study was designed as an ambidirectional cohort study. A total of 126 patients undergoing PD, with 75 receiving the straight PD catheter and 51 receiving the coiled PD catheter, participated in the study. The primary outcome was catheter survival, and the secondary outcomes included PD failure, catheter-related infections, and all-cause mortality. In the coiled catheter group, 30 (40%) patients had catheter malfunction, whereas the straight catheter group had 15 (29.4%) patients catheter malfunction. However, the survival functions represented by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve did not show any statistical significance (P = 0.659). In the coiled PD catheter group, 13 (17.3%) had PD failure, which was comparable with the straight PD catheter group of nine (17.6%) cases (P = 1.000). The catheter-related infections are similar in both groups. The mortality between two groups was also similar (P = 0.777). There is no difference in outcomes between the coiled and straight PD catheters.",,507
911,35974810,Up-regulation of Osh6 boosts an anti-aging membrane trafficking pathway toward vacuoles.,"Members of the family of oxysterol-binding proteins mediate non-vesicular lipid transport between membranes and contribute to longevity in different manners. We previously found that a 2-fold up-regulation of Osh6, one of seven yeast oxysterol-binding proteins, remedies vacuolar morphology defects in mid-aged cells, partly down-regulates the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), and increases the replicative lifespan. At the molecular level, Osh6 transports phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM). To decipher how an ER-PM working protein controls vacuolar morphology, we tested genetic interactions between OSH6 and DRS2, whose protein flips PS from the lumen to the cytosolic side of the Golgi, the organelle between ER and vacuoles in many pathways. Up-regulated OSH6 complemented vacuolar morphology of drs2Δ and enriched PI4P on the Golgi, indicating that Osh6 also works on the Golgi. This altered PI4P-enrichment led to a delay in the secretion of the proton ATPase Pma1 to the PM and a rerouting of Pma1 to vacuoles in a manner dependent on the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to late endosome (LE) trafficking pathway. Since the TGN-LE pathway controls endosomal and vacuolar TORC1, it may be the anti-aging pathway boosted by up-regulated Osh6.",,508
2077,35967441,Emerging concepts regarding pro- and anti tumor properties of B cells in tumor immunity.,"Controversial views regarding the roles of B cells in tumor immunity have existed for several decades. However, more recent studies have focused on its positive properties in antitumor immunity. Many studies have demonstrated a close association of the higher density of intratumoral B cells with favorable outcomes in cancer patients. B cells can interact with T cells as well as follicular dendritic cells within tertiary lymphoid structures, where they undergo a series of biological events, including clonal expansion, somatic hypermutation, class switching, and tumor-specific antibody production, which may trigger antitumor humoral responses. After activation, B cells can function as effector cells via direct tumor-killing, antigen-presenting activity, and production of tumor-specific antibodies. At the other extreme, B cells can obtain inhibitory functions by relevant stimuli, converting to regulatory B cells, which serve as an immunosuppressive arm to tumor immunity. Here we summarize our current understanding of the bipolar properties of B cells within the tumor immune microenvironment and propose potential B cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies, which may help promote cancer immunotherapy.",,509
2235,35967256,Ontogenetic trait variation and metacommunity effects influence species relative abundances during tree community assembly.,"Predicting species abundance is one of the most fundamental pursuits of ecology. Combining the information encoded in functional traits and metacommunities provides a new perspective to predict the abundance of species in communities. We applied a community assembly via trait selection model to predict quadrat-scale species abundances using functional trait variation on ontogenetic stages and metacommunity information for over 490 plant species in a subtropical forest and a lowland tropical forest in Yunnan, China. The relative importance of trait-based selection, mass effects, and stochasticity in shaping local species abundances is evaluated using different null models. We found both mass effects and trait selection contribute to local abundance patterns. Trait selection was detectable at all studied spatial scales (0.04-1 ha), with its strength stronger at larger scales and in the subtropical forest. In contrast, the importance of stochasticity decreased with spatial scale. A significant mass effect of the metacommunity was observed at small spatial scales. Our results indicate that tree community assembly is primarily driven by ontogenetic traits and metacommunity effects. Our findings also demonstrate that including ontogenetic trait variation into predictive frameworks allows ecologists to infer ecological mechanisms operating in community assembly at the individual level.",,510
1540,35968346,Research progress in breast cancer stem cells: characterization and future perspectives.,"More and more studies have proved that there are a small number of cells with self-renewal and differentiation ability in breast tumors, namely breast cancer stem cells. Such cells play a key role in the initiation, development and migration of breast tumors. The properties of breast tumor stem cells are regulated by a range of intracellular and extracellular factors, including important signaling pathways, transcription factors, non-coding RNAs, and cytokines such as Hedgehog, Wnt, Notch, microRNA93, microRNA100, and IL-6. Tumor microenvironment (such as mesenchymal stem cells, macrophages and cytokines) plays an important role in the regulation of breast tumor stem cells. Using the keywords including breast cancer stem cells, signal pathway, chemotherapy tolerance, and non-coding RNA, triple negative breast cancer, inhibitors, this study retrieved the original articles and reviews published before October 3, 2021, from PubMed and WEB OF SCI database and this study performed a comprehensive review of them. After treatment, there is a correlation between the metastasis-prone nature and recurrence with breast cancer stem cells. The signaling pathway of breast cancer stem cells plays a significant role in activating the function of breast cancer cells, regulating the differentiation of breast cancer cells and controlling the division of breast cancer cells. This imbalance leads to the uncontrolled growth and development of breast cancer cells. Targeted therapy that blocks the corresponding pathway may become a new perspective for breast cancer treatment. In addition, corresponding therapeutic strategies can be used according to the expression characteristics of different molecular types of breast cancer stem cells. For ER-positive breast cancer, simultaneous endocrine therapy and targeted therapy of tumor stem cells may improve the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Trastuzumab therapy significantly reduces the risk of recurrence of HER2-positive breast cancer. For drug-resistant patients, combination therapy is required due to the different phenotypes of epithelial-mesenchymal transforming tumor stem cells. This study briefly reviews the research progress of breast cancer stem cell-related signaling pathways and their inhibitors, in order to provide a reference for breast cancer patients to obtain more effective clinical treatment.",,511
1316,35970056,FDG-PET combined with learning vector quantization allows classification of neurodegenerative diseases and reveals the trajectory of idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder.,"18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) combined with principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to identify disease-related brain patterns in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These patterns are used to quantify functional brain changes at the single subject level. This is especially relevant in determining disease progression in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), a prodromal stage of PD and DLB. However, the PCA method is limited in discriminating between neurodegenerative conditions. More advanced machine learning algorithms may provide a solution. In this study, we apply Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ) to FDG-PET scans of healthy controls, and patients with AD, PD and DLB. Scans of iRBD patients, scanned twice with an approximate 4 year interval, were projected into GMLVQ space to visualize their trajectory. We applied a combination of SSM/PCA and GMLVQ as a classifier on FDG-PET data of healthy controls, AD, DLB, and PD patients. We determined the diagnostic performance by performing a ten times repeated ten fold cross validation. We analyzed the validity of the classification system by inspecting the GMLVQ space. First by the projection of the patients into this space. Second by representing the axis, that span this decision space, into a voxel map. Furthermore, we projected a cohort of RBD patients, whom have been scanned twice (approximately 4 years apart), into the same decision space and visualized their trajectories. The GMLVQ prototypes, relevance diagonal, and decision space voxel maps showed metabolic patterns that agree with previously identified disease-related brain patterns. The GMLVQ decision space showed a plausible quantification of FDG-PET data. Distance traveled by iRBD subjects through GMLVQ space per year (i.e. velocity) was correlated with the change in motor symptoms per year (Spearman's rho =0.62, P=0.004). In this proof-of-concept study, we show that GMLVQ provides a classification of patients with neurodegenerative disorders, and may be useful in future studies investigating speed of progression in prodromal disease stages.",,512
1661,35968113,Comprehensive evaluation of the response to aluminum stress in olive tree (Olea europaea L.).,"Olive (Olea europaea L.) is an ancient tree species in the Mediterranean, but the lack of knowledge about aluminum-resistant varieties limits its introduction to acidic soil. The objective of this study was to have a comprehensive evaluation of the response to aluminum stress in olive tree at germplasm, metabolome, and transcriptome levels. In this experiment, seedlings of 97 olive germplasm with 1.0-3.0 cm roots and two leaves were treated with 50 μM Al3+ (pH = 5.0). By factor analysis of the traits of defoliation rate, rooting rate, length of extended root, and length of new root, 97 germplasm were classified into five different groups according to their diverse responses to aluminum stress: 5 highly resistant (5.15%), 30 moderately resistant (30.93%), 31 general (31.96%), 23 moderately sensitive (23.71%), and 8 highly sensitive (8.25%) germplasm. The three most sensitive and three most resistant germplasm were further used for metabolome and transcriptome analysis. Exposed to aluminum stress, 96 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs)/4,845 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 66 DAMs/2,752 DEGs were identified in highly sensitive and resistant germplasm, respectively. Using multi-omics technology, the pathways and related DAMs/DEGs involved in cell wall/cytoplasm receptors, reactive oxygen species balance, hormone induction, synthesis of organic acids, Al3+ transport, and synthesis of metabolites were identified to mainly regulate the response to aluminum stress in olive. This study provides a theoretical guide and prior germplasm and genes for further genetic improvement of aluminum tolerance in the olive tree.",,513
502,35978757,Outcomes in Bone Giant Cell Tumors Treated With Surgical Resection With and Without Denosumab Injection: A Single-Institution Retrospective Study.,"Giant cell tumors of the bone (GCTB) are rare, benign, aggressive, recurrent tumors that are most often found at the ends of long bones. They account for 5% of all primary bone tumors and 20% of all benign bone tumors. The clinical features of GCTB include local swelling, pain, and limitations in joint movement. Approximately half of GCTB arise around the knee joint, affecting either the distal femur or proximal tibia. Tissue biopsy reveals an excess of multinucleated giant cells on a stromal cell background, indicating a diagnosis. Intralesional curettage is used to treat GCTB and is associated with minimal disability; however, local recurrence may occur in many patients. Resection and endoprosthetic repair or bone graft reconstruction are often used to treat GCTB near the joint. To our knowledge, there are currently no studies on this topic in the city of Jeddah, where we conducted our study. Our aim was to evaluate the outcome of surgical resection accompanied by denosumab injection compared to that of surgery alone in treating GCTB. All cases of GCTB at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, between January 2008 and December 2018, that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. All cases of GCTB in the pre-specified period were classified as surgical resection with denosumab injection or surgical resection alone. The outcomes of the two modalities were compared. Recurrence was investigated in patients belonging to both the groups. Twenty-six cases that met the inclusion criteria were included in the study and the data were analyzed. The subjects were divided into two groups: denosumab and surgery (n = 7) and surgery alone (n = 19). Patients treated with denosumab and surgery had a higher recurrence rate (57%); however, the difference was not significant (p = 0.407). Our study showed that when comparing local recurrence after curettage in patients treated with denosumab and patients who did not receive it, preoperative denosumab therapy was associated with an increased incidence of local recurrence. We recommend a systematic review that can include more studies in this field to acquire more definitive results regarding this topic.",,514
1100,35974519,Multiscale analysis of the particles on demand kinetic model.,"We present a thorough investigation of the particles on demand kinetic model. After a brief introduction of the method, an appropriate multiscale analysis is carried out to derive the hydrodynamic limit of the model. In this analysis, the effect of the time-space dependent comoving reference frames are taken into account. This could be regarded as a generalization of the conventional Chapman-Enskog analysis applied to the lattice Boltzmann models which feature global constant reference frames. Further simulations of target benchmarks provide numerical evidence confirming the theoretical predictions.",,515
1555,35968331,CDC20 is a novel biomarker for improved clinical predictions in epithelial ovarian cancer.,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), a common tumor of the female reproductive system, ranks first in fatalities among gynecological malignancies. Most patients find tumors at late stage and have extremely poor prognoses, which necessitates improvements in early detection. This study applied bioinformatic methods to identify potential biomarkers of EOC. First, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and hub genes, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The network of hub genes was analyzed using GeneMANIA, and an analysis of biological processes was constructed with BINGO. Lastly, hub genes were analyzed for EOC-related oncology using the Oncomine and TCGA databases, and the cBioPortal online platform. Overall, cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) was identified as a key gene in EOC. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to silence CDC20 to explore its effects on EOC cell proliferation, apoptosis and SRY-related HMG-box 2 (SOX2) expression. DEGs were enriched in pathways related to cell cycle signaling, cancer, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, Wnt signaling and P53 signaling. Analysis revealed high expression of CDC20 in EOC tissues and a correlation with histology and tumor grade. CDC20 levels are highest in serous adenocarcinoma, when compared to ovarian clear cell carcinoma, ovarian endometrioid carcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma. High CDC20 expression within the tumor is associated with poor EOC prognosis. After silencing CDC20, EOC cell proliferation and migration decreased, apoptosis increased, and SOX2 expression decreased. In conclusion, CDC20 is likely a key biomarker of EOC and may act as an upstream regulator of SOX2 to mediate the SOX2 signaling in the progression of EOC. Future application of CDC20 analysis to early detection may improve prognosis, and it has the potential to be a therapeutic target.",,516
2074,35967444,Effects of helicobacter pylori on tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy responses.,"Helicobacter pylori is closely associated with gastric cancer. During persistent infection, Helicobacter pylori can form a microenvironment in gastric mucosa which facilitates the survival and colony formation of Helicobacter pylori. Tumor stromal cells are involved in this process, including tumor-associated macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and so on. The immune checkpoints are also regulated by Helicobacter pylori infection. Helicobacter pylori virulence factors can also act as immunogens or adjuvants to elicit or enhance immune responses, indicating their potential applications in vaccine development and tumor immunotherapy. This review highlights the effects of Helicobacter pylori on the immune microenvironment and its potential roles in tumor immunotherapy responses.",,517
1385,35969054,Experimental Viral Infection in Adult Mosquitoes by Oral Feeding and Microinjection.,"Mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs), which are infectious pathogens to vertebrates, are spread by many mosquito species, posing a severe threat to public health. Once ingested, the viruses must overcome the mosquito midgut barrier to reach the hemolymph, from where they might potentially spread to the salivary glands. When a mosquito bites, these viruses are spread to new vertebrate hosts. Similarly, the mosquito may pick up different viruses. In general, only a tiny portion of viruses may enter the salivary glands via the gut. The transmission efficiency of these viruses to the glands is be affected by the two physical barriers found in different mosquito species: midgut barriers and salivary glands barriers. This protocol presents a method for virus detection in salivary glands of Aedes aegypti's following oral feeding and intrathoracic injection infection. Furthermore, determining whether the guts and/or salivary glands hinder viral spread can aid in the risk assessments of MBVs transmitted by Aedes aegypti.",,518
2393,35966979,Mapping the Mesentery Using ICG.,"Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent imaging has been used in colorectal surgery to assess intraoperative blood flow to the colon. However, its use has expanded to allow imaging of the lymphatic drainage within the mesentery in cancer resections. This technique can been used for real-time visualization of lymph nodes, and the detection of sentinel lymph nodes, lateral sidewall nodes, metastatic lymph nodes, and peritoneal metastases. Ultimately, this provides a more informative map of the mesentery displaying lymphatics and blood flow. The technique is economical and easy to use by the surgeon intraoperatively. ICG lymphangiography has the potential to aid the surgeon to ensure complete lymphadenectomy is performed in cancer resections.",,519
506,35978753,Hepatic Abscess Following Acute Appendicitis.,"The authors present the case of a 29-year-old female diagnosed with acute appendicitis who underwent an uneventful laparoscopic appendectomy. Three weeks later, she returned to the emergency department with fevers, abdominal pain, chills, and nausea. Laboratory analysis revealed elevated liver enzymes and leukocytosis, and a computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed a liver abscess. Interventional radiology placed an 8 French drainage catheter in the hepatic abscess and drained 40cc of purulent fluid. A culture of the abscess fluid revealed Streptococcus constellatus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Bacteroides ovatus. We believe appendicitis causes hematogenous spreading of bowel organisms along the portal vein, which is seeded to the liver.",,520
2495,35966715,Molecular and biological characterization of hepatitis B virus subgenotype F1b clusters: Unraveling its role in hepatocarcinogenesis.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotype F1b infection has been associated with the early occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronically infected patients from Alaska and Peru. In Argentina, however, despite the high prevalence of subgenotype F1b infection, this relationship has not been described. To unravel the observed differences in the progression of the infection, an in-depth molecular and biological characterization of the subgenotype F1b was performed. Phylogenetic analysis of subgenotype F1b full-length genomes revealed the existence of two highly supported clusters. One of the clusters, designated as gtF1b Basal included sequences mostly from Alaska, Peru and Chile, while the other, called gtF1b Cosmopolitan, contained samples mainly from Argentina and Chile. The clusters were characterized by a differential signature pattern of eight nucleotides distributed throughout the genome. In vitro characterization of representative clones from each cluster revealed major differences in viral RNA levels, virion secretion, antigen expression levels, as well as in the localization of the antigens. Interestingly, a differential regulation in the expression of genes associated with tumorigenesis was also identified. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the molecular and biological characteristics of the subgenotype F1b clusters and contributes to unravel the different clinical outcomes of subgenotype F1b chronic infections.",,521
2426,35966870,Effect of Prophylactic Intrathecal Pethidine on the Incidence of Shivering on Mothers Undergoing Cesarean Section Under Spinal Anesthesia: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Shivering is the most common and unpleasant complication of anesthesia with an incidence of 70.7% in cesarean section done under spinal anesthesia which is associated with cardiovascular and respiratory complications. Even though it causes such devastating complications; the prevention of shivering is not well investigated. This study aimed to assess the effect of intrathecal pethidine on the incidence and severity of shivering in patients undergoing cesarean section under Spinal anesthesia. After obtaining ethical clearance double-blinded single centered a randomized controlled trial was conducted in a total of 86 pregnant mothers who were randomly allocated into two groups by computer-generated random number. Approximately 1 ml of 10 mg preservative-free pethidine was added to 12.5 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia in the treatment group and 12.5 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine alone was given in the control group. Incidence and severity of shivering, as well as adverse effect was recorded intraoperatively, in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and ward. Independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square were used for analysis. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Shivering was observed in 53.5 and 20.9% in the control and treatment groups, respectively, which was statistically significant with p = 0.002. The risk of developing shivering was reduced by 61% in the treatment group with (RR = 0.39 and CI of 0.205-0.745); the intensity of shivering was also higher in the control group than in the treatment group with p = 0.004. Considering an adverse effect, the incidence of PONV was not significantly different between with p > 0.05 while the incidence of pruritus was higher in the treatment group than the control group with p = 0.003. Adding 10 mg of preservative free pethidine intrathecally during spinal anesthesia is effective in reducing incidence and severity of shivering, without causing significant adverse effects on mother.",,522
1202,35971768,Nitrogen fertilization weakens the linkage between soil carbon and microbial diversity: A global meta-analysis.,"Soil microbes make up a significant portion of the genetic diversity and play a critical role in belowground carbon (C) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Soil microbial diversity and organic C are often tightly coupled in C cycling processes; however, this coupling can be weakened or broken by rapid global change. A global meta-analysis was performed with 1148 paired comparisons extracted from 229 articles published between January 1998 and December 2021 to determine how nitrogen (N) fertilization affects the relationship between soil C content and microbial diversity in terrestrial ecosystems. We found that N fertilization decreased soil bacterial (-11%) and fungal diversity (-17%), but increased soil organic C (SOC) (+19%), microbial biomass C (MBC) (+17%), and dissolved organic C (DOC) (+25%) across different ecosystems. Organic N (urea) fertilization had a greater effect on SOC, MBC, DOC, and bacterial and fungal diversity than inorganic N fertilization. Most importantly, soil microbial diversity decreased with increasing SOC, MBC, and DOC, and the absolute values of the correlation coefficients decreased with increasing N fertilization rate and duration, suggesting that N fertilization weakened the linkage between soil C and microbial diversity. The weakened linkage might negatively impact essential ecosystem services under high rates of N fertilization; this understanding is important for mitigating the negative impact of global N enrichment on soil C cycling.",,523
949,35974732,Magnetic nanoprecipitates and interfacial spin disorder in zero-field-annealed Ni50Mn45In5 Heusler alloys as seen by magnetic small-angle neutron scattering.,"Shell ferromagnetism is a new functional property of certain off-stoichiometric Ni-Mn-In Heusler alloys, with a potential application in non-volatile magnetic memories and recording media. One key challenge in this field remains the determination of the structural and magnetic properties of the nanoprecipitates that are the result of an annealing-induced segregation process. Thanks to its unique mesoscopic length scale sensitivity, magnetic small-angle neutron scattering appears to be a powerful technique to disclose the microstructure of such annealing-induced nanoprecipitates. In this study, the microstructure of a zero-field-annealed off-stoichiometric Ni50Mn45In5 Heusler alloy is investigated by unpolarized magnetic small-angle neutron scattering. The neutron data analysis reveals a significant spin-misalignment scattering, which is mainly related to the formation of annealing-induced ferromagnetic nanoprecipitates in an antiferromagnetic matrix. These particles represent a source of perturbation which, due to dipolar stray fields, gives rise to canted spin moments in the surroundings of the particle-matrix interface. The presence of anticorrelations in the computed magnetic correlation function reflects the spatial perturbation of the magnetization vector around the nanoprecipitates. The magnetic field dependence of the zero crossing and the minima of the magnetic correlation function are qualitatively explained using the law of approach to ferromagnetic saturation for inhomogeneous spin states. More specifically, at remanence, the nanoprecipitates act magnetically as one superdefect with a correlation length that lies outside the experimental q range, whereas near saturation the magnetization distribution follows each individual nanoprecipitate. Analysis of the neutron data yields an estimated size of 30 nm for the spin-canted region and a value of about 75 nm for the magnetic core of the individual nanoprecipitates.",,524
293,35981448,An electrochemical system for the rapid and accurate quantitation of microbial exoelectrogenic ability.,"Microbial extracellular electron transfer (EET) plays a vital role in globally important environmental phenomena, including bioremediation, bioenergy generation, and biofuel production. The quantitation of microbial exoelectrogenic ability is fundamental to studying the process of EET. However, there is no accurate and time-saving protocol to directly evaluate EET ability, hindering our understanding and application of EET. In this work, we proposed an accurate and rapid quantitation system for measuring EET ability using a gold-coated membrane filter as a working electrode. The quantitation signals could be recorded within 1 h and accurately normalized by the number of cells with outstanding repeatability and reproducibility. Further, this method could be distinguished microbial direct EET performances of different growth stages, and the results showed the middle logarithmic growth stage of Shewanella onedensis MR-1 had the best electrochemical activity. This method can be widely used for different types of electroactive microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and fungi. Due to its time savings, accurate quantification and easy operation, this method provides a standard way to assess the role of EET ability.",,525
2182,35967336,Evaluation of the immune feature of ACPA-negative rheumatoid arthritis and the clinical value of matrix metalloproteinase-3.,"Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) are highly specific for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, about one-third of RA patients are negative for ACPAs, which presents a challenge to the early diagnosis of RA. The purpose of this study was to analyze differences in lymphocyte subsets and CD4+ T cell subsets between ACPA+ and ACPA- RA patients, and to evaluate the value of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) as a diagnostic and monitoring marker in ACA- RA patients. A total of 145 ACPA+ RA patients, 145 ACPA- RA patients, and 38 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. Peripheral lymphocyte subsets were detected using flow cytometry, and serum MMP-3 was detected using chemiluminescence. Information about joint symptoms, other organ involvement, and related inflammatory markers was also collected. The results showed that, compared to ACPA- RA patients, ACPA+ cases had greater imbalances between peripheral CD4+ T cell subsets, mainly manifested as an increase in T-helper 1 (Th1) cells (p < 0.001) and decrease in regulatory T (Treg) cells (p = 0.029). This makes these patients more prone to inflammatory reactions and joint erosion. MMP-3 levels in ACPA+ and ACPA- RA patients were significantly higher than in HCs (p < 0.001), and MMP-3 could effectively distinguish between ACPA- RA patients and HCs (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.930, sensitivity 84.14%, specificity 92.11%). MMP-3 was also a serum marker for distinguishing between RA patients with low and high disease activities. Further analysis showed that MMP-3 was positively correlated with the levels of inflammatory markers and disease activity, and negatively correlated with the levels of lymphocyte subsets. In addition, with improvements in the disease, MMP-3 levels decreased, and further increased as the patients started to deteriorate. In summary, our research showed that there was a mild imbalance between peripheral CD4+ T cell subsets in ACPA- RA patients. MMP-3 may be used as a potential marker for early diagnosis of ACPA- RA. MMP-3 was an important index for RA disease evaluation, disease activity stratification, and prognosis.",,526
1531,35968355,PI3K inhibitors in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer cells with PI3K pathway alterations.,"The activation of the PI3K signaling pathway resulting from genetic alterations induces carcinogenesis and resistance to anticancer therapies. Breast cancer is a major malignancy that is associated with dysregulation of the PI3K signaling pathway. PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss occur in every subtype of breast cancer. PI3K inhibitors are being evaluated in breast cancer after the success of an alpha isoform-specific PI3K inhibitor in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Some preclinical data indicate the potential for PI3K/mTOR targeting in combination with trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer with or without expression of the estrogen receptor. However, the role of this therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer with PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss remains unclear. We examined three HER2-positive, ER-negative breast cancer cell lines to determine the efficacy of a novel alpha isoform-specific PI3K inhibitor in combination with trastuzumab. The results indicated that this combination was effective in PIK3CA-mutant or PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of downstream proteins. PTEN loss by siRNA modulation in parental HER2-positive cancer cells with PI3K signaling pathway alterations could not confer resistance to alpelisib or GDC-0077 plus trastuzumab. We selected the CK-MB-1 cell line without alterations in the PI3K pathway to demonstrate that PI3K inhibitors plus trastuzumab represented a biomarker-specific treatment. In vivo effects of alpelisib plus trastuzumab were tested and confirmed in a mouse model, showing the combination strategy offered the best opportunity to achieve tumor volume reduction. With known safety profiles, this cytotoxic chemotherapy-free regimen warrants further attention as a biomarker-driven strategy for treating HER2-positive breast cancer.",,527
1124,35974495,Estimating asymptotic phase and amplitude functions of limit-cycle oscillators from time series data.,"We propose a method for estimating the asymptotic phase and amplitude functions of limit-cycle oscillators using observed time series data without prior knowledge of their dynamical equations. The estimation is performed by polynomial regression and can be solved as a convex optimization problem. The validity of the proposed method is numerically illustrated by using two-dimensional limit-cycle oscillators as examples. As an application, we demonstrate data-driven fast entrainment with amplitude suppression using the optimal periodic input derived from the estimated phase and amplitude functions.",,528
748,35975089,A stretchable and healable elastomer with shape memory capability based on multiple hydrogen bonds.,"Although a wide range of self-healing materials have been reported by researchers, it is still a challenge to endow exceptional mechanical properties and shape memory characteristics simultaneously in a single material. Inspired by the structure of natural silk, herein, we have adopted a simple synthetic method to prepare a kind of elastomer (HM-PUs) with stiff, healable and shape memory capabilities assisted by multiple hydrogen bonds. The self-healing elastomer exhibits a maximum tensile strength of 39 MPa, toughness of 111.65 MJ m-3 and self-healing efficiency of 96%. Moreover, the recuperative efficiency of shape memory could reach 100%. The fundamental study of HM-PUs will facilitate the development of flexible electronics and medical materials.",,529
2474,35966784,Effects of sulforaphane intake on processing speed and negative moods in healthy older adults: Evidence from a randomized controlled trial.,"Recent studies have reported that sulforaphane (SFN) intake with cognitive training had positive effects on cognitive functions. However, it is still unknown whether SFN intake alone has beneficial effects on cognition as well as mood. We investigated whether a SFN intake intervention improved cognitive performance and mood states in healthy older adults. In a 12-week, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT), we randomly assigned 144 older adults to a SFN group or a placebo group. We asked the participants to take a supplement (SFN or placebo) for 12 weeks. We measured several cognitive functions, mood states, and biomarkers before and after the intervention period. The SFN group showed improvement in processing speed and a decrease in negative mood compared to the placebo group. In addition, the SFN group exhibited a higher SFN-N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) level compared to the placebo group. However, there were no significant results in other biomarkers of oxidant stress, inflammation, or neural plasticity. These results indicate that nutrition interventions using SFN can have positive effects on cognitive functioning and mood in healthy older adults.",,530
2021,35967565,Stability of novel urinary biomarkers used for lupus nephritis.,"The Renal Activity Index for Lupus (RAIL) is a composite score of six urinary biomarkers (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), ceruloplasmin, adiponectin, and hemopexin) used to monitor lupus nephritis activity in children. We tested stability of RAIL biomarkers prior to meaningful clinical use. Urine samples were tested by ELISA under shipping conditions, freeze/thaw, ambient and longer-term storage. Statistical analysis was performed via Deming Regression, Bland-Altman and Spearman Correlation Coefficient. Biomarker concentration were comparable to freshly collected urine following storage at -80 °C for up to 3 months, and at 4 or 25 °C up to 48 h followed by -80 °C. Neither shipping on dry or wet ice exposure nor addition of two freeze-thaw cycles led to loss of signal, with excellent Spearman Correlation coefficients under all conditions. RAIL biomarkers are stable following short-term storage at clinically relevant conditions.",,531
789,35975048,"Synthesis, antitumor activity, 3D-QSAR and molecular docking studies of new iodinated 4-(3H)-quinazolinones 3N-substituted.","A novel series of 6-iodo-2-methylquinazolin-4-(3H)-one derivatives, 3a-n, were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic activity. Compounds 3a, 3b, 3d, 3e, and 3h showed remarkable cytotoxic activity on specific human cancer cell lines when compared to the anti-cancer drug, paclitaxel. Compound 3a was found to be particularly effective on promyelocytic leukaemia HL60 and non-Hodgkin lymphoma U937, with IC50 values of 21 and 30 μM, respectively. Compound 3d showed significant activity against cervical cancer HeLa (IC50 = 10 μM). The compounds 3e and 3h were strongly active against glioblastoma multiform tumour T98G, with IC50 values of 12 and 22 μM, respectively. These five compounds showed an interesting cytotoxic activity on four human cancer cell types of high incidence. The molecular docking results reveal a good correlation between experimental activity and calculated binding affinity on dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Docking studies proved 3d as the most potent compound. In addition, the three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) analysis exhibited activities that may indicate the existence of electron-withdrawing and lipophilic groups at the para-position of the phenyl ring and hydrophobic interactions of the quinazolinic ring in the DHFR active site.",,532
1510,35968377,Combining electro- and magnetoencephalography data using directional archetypal analysis.,"Metastable microstates in electro- and magnetoencephalographic (EEG and MEG) measurements are usually determined using modified k-means accounting for polarity invariant states. However, hard state assignment approaches assume that the brain traverses microstates in a discrete rather than continuous fashion. We present multimodal, multisubject directional archetypal analysis as a scale and polarity invariant extension to archetypal analysis using a loss function based on the Watson distribution. With this method, EEG/MEG microstates are modeled using subject- and modality-specific archetypes that are representative, distinct topographic maps between which the brain continuously traverses. Archetypes are specified as convex combinations of unit norm input data based on a shared generator matrix, thus assuming that the timing of neural responses to stimuli is consistent across subjects and modalities. The input data is reconstructed as convex combinations of archetypes using a subject- and modality-specific continuous archetypal mixing matrix. We showcase the model on synthetic data and an openly available face perception event-related potential data set with concurrently recorded EEG and MEG. In synthetic and unimodal experiments, we compare our model to conventional Euclidean multisubject archetypal analysis. We also contrast our model to a directional clustering model with discrete state assignments to highlight the advantages of modeling state trajectories rather than hard assignments. We find that our approach successfully models scale and polarity invariant data, such as microstates, accounting for intersubject and intermodal variability. The model is readily extendable to other modalities ensuring component correspondence while elucidating spatiotemporal signal variability.",,533
671,35975541,Prognosis and Overall Survival of Thalassemia Patients using Semi-Parametric Mixture Cure-Rate Model: a 30-Year Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Understanding the determinants of long-term overall survival (OS) of thalassemia patients (TPs) is the mainstay of care. As a retrospective survey, we assessed the data of 769 TPs who had regular follow-up and blood transfusion for at least 30 years from 1990 - 2019. We utilized semi-parametric proportional hazards mixture cure-rate regression to discover the factors with a significant effect on short- and long-term OS separately. The 25- and 30-year OS for the TPs were calculated to be 98.7% and 90.4%, respectively. Each five-year age escalation was associated with a 30% decrease in the probability of being short-term survivors (HR = 1.06, p = 0.047). Parental family relationship influenced both cured (OR = 3.00, p = 0.017) and uncured (HR = 0.50, p = 0.046) TPs. Moreover, the type of iron chelation drug, liver iron concentration, and normal EF results had a significant effect on long-term OS. Aging, parental consanguinity, liver and cardiac siderosis, higher ferritin levels, and low hemoglobin level were associated with poorer prognosis in TPs. However, deferoxamine followed by multiple drugs as iron chelation, severe liver siderosis, and abnormal EF declined the probability of long-term OS among TPs. This can be considered by health policy decision-makers to enforce the screening program more strictly.",,534
2266,35967165,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO): What We Need to Know.,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of circulatory support used in patients with refractory cardiac and/or respiratory failure. The main role of such support is to allow the lungs and heart to rest and heal while providing adequate oxygenation to vital organs. During extracorporeal support, the venous blood removed is decarboxylated, oxygenated, warmed, and infused back into the circulation. Physicians and nursing staff should be familiar with ECMO in order to provide the best care for critically ill patients. The aim of this paper is to review the technical aspects, indications, contraindications, complications, and management of both veno-venous (VV) and veno-arterial (VA) ECMO.",,535
1715,35968038,The outcome of conventional open reduction approach vs endoscopic approach for orbital floor repair.,"Blunt trauma to the orbital rim is a frequent cause of both orbital fractures and damage to the surrounding facial bones and soft tissues. The inception of endoscopy and minimal invasive intervention has revolutionized the surgical treatment of blow out fracture of orbital walls. Thus, the present study was conducted to compare the outcome of conventional open reduction approach with endoscopic approach for orbital floor repair. The study included 10 patients with clinical and radiographic evidence of orbital floor fracture, divided randomly into two groups: Group I-operated using endoscopic approach; and Group II- operated using conventional external approach. All the patients were evaluated clinically preoperatively, immediate post-operative and after 1 month for Diplopia, Extrinsic ocular motility, Enophthalmos and Hypoglobus. The study consisted of 40% females and 60% males, with mean age of Endoscopic and Conventional group being 27.20 ± 6.14 years and 27.60 ± 7.23 years respectively. In relation to diplopia, an insignificant difference was observed statistically. The mean change in enophthalmos and hypoglobus in endoscopic and conventional group showed a significant difference statistically (p < 0.001). Unrestricted ocular motility was present only in one case of each group and significantly increased to 5 cases in both the groups (p = 0.048). The mean duration of surgery in endoscopic and conventional group showed a significant difference statistically. Diplopia, hypoglobus and Enophthalmos correction was better achieved in endoscopic group as compared to conventional group. But duration of surgery was more in endoscopic group as compared to conventional group.",,536
666,35975589,Optimization of the Beijing Economy-Energy-Emissions System 2021-2035: A Scenario Simulation Analysis Based on a System Dynamics Model.,"This paper constructs an Economy-Energy-Emissions (3E) System Dynamics Model using the megacity of Beijing, China, as an example, to estimate the effects of different policy scenarios (including three single-policy scenarios and four combined-policy scenarios) on the core variables of Beijing's 3E system from 2021 to 2035. The results suggest two main points. (1) Following the current development trend, the proportion of the GDP represented by the added value of advanced high-precision industries (Gao Jing Jian in Chinese) will only be 43% in 2035, implying a limited role in promoting economic growth. Despite effective control of total energy consumption, fossil energy's share of total consumption will reach 57% by 2035, hindering the process of making the energy consumption structure cleaner and leading to failure to achieve the targeted inflection point in CO2 emissions by 2025. PM2.5 control shows some successful results and will decrease to 19 μg/m3 in 2035. However, a gap compared to other world-class cities remains. (2) The implementation of a single policy for either industrial structure optimization, energy structure transformation, or emissions control cannot simultaneously meet the goal of high-quality coordinated development of Beijing's 3E system, whereas the comprehensive implementation of policies in all three dimensions is demonstrably effective.",,537
1429,35968470,Development and validation of the care challenge scale in family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and debilitating disorder that strongly affects people with AD and their families. The changes in signs of the disease and its treatment lead to many challenges in people with AD that affect the performance and the ability of caregivers, their social life, and physical, emotional, and psychological aspects of caregivers' health. Therefore, this study was designed to develop and validate the Care Challenge Scale (CCS) for family caregivers of people with AD in the care context of Iran. This is a cross-sectional study, and the primary scale was based on 14 semi-structured interviews with family caregivers of Iranian people with AD. In the next phase, the psychometric features were assessed, including the face validity (qualitative and quantitative), content validity (qualitative and quantitative), item analysis, structural validity (exploratory and confirmatory factors), and construct validity (convergent and discriminant validity). Finally, the reliability was assessed using internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, McDonald's omega coefficient, and the average inter-item correlation), stability (intraclass correlation coefficient), and absolute reliability. Totally, 435 Iranian family caregivers filled out online questionnaires, with a mean age of 50.26(±13.24) years. Based on the results of the qualitative phase, an item pool was generated with 389 items, and after deleting overlapping and unrelated items, the CCS with 14 items was created. The results of the quantitative phase showed that the CCS consists of two factors with 10 items each, which are named effective role-play challenge and lack of social-financial support, and they explained 42.23% of the total variance. Furthermore, the results of confirmatory factor analysis showed a good fitness of the scale structure model, and it had convergent and discriminant validity. The reliability indexes showed this scale has internal consistency and stability. The most care challenge among Iranian family caregivers of people with AD is effective role-play challenges and lack of social-financial support. The scale as designed has good validity, internal consistency, and stability that can be used by therapists, nurses, and researchers for the assessment of the challenges of this population.",,538
247,35982600,Unsupervised Machine Learning to Identify Depressive Subtypes.,"This study evaluated an unsupervised machine learning method, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), as a method for identifying subtypes of depression within symptom data. Data from 18,314 depressed patients were used to create LDA models. The outcomes included future emergency presentations, crisis events, and behavioral problems. One model was chosen for further analysis based upon its potential as a clinically meaningful construct. The associations between patient groups created with the final LDA model and outcomes were tested. These steps were repeated with a commonly-used latent variable model to provide additional context to the LDA results. Five subtypes were identified using the final LDA model. Prior to the outcome analysis, the subtypes were labeled based upon the symptom distributions they produced: psychotic, severe, mild, agitated, and anergic-apathetic. The patient groups largely aligned with the outcome data. For example, the psychotic and severe subgroups were more likely to have emergency presentations (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.43 and OR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.29, respectively), whereas these outcomes were less likely in the mild subgroup (OR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.94). We found that the LDA subtypes were characterized by clusters of unique symptoms. This contrasted with the latent variable model subtypes, which were largely stratified by severity. This study suggests that LDA can surface clinically meaningful, qualitative subtypes. Future work could be incorporated into studies concerning the biological bases of depression, thereby contributing to the development of new psychiatric therapeutics.",,539
690,35975518,Reference Intervals of Serum TSH from Mixed Distributions Using Truncation Points and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distance.,"Serum TSH reference intervals (RIs) are methodology, population, and age specific. However, the ethical and practical challenges restrict the establishment of pediatric RIs using conventional approaches and advocates the use of indirect data mining-based algorithms. This study was carried out to estimate the reference interval of neonatal serum TSH in Pakistani population using an indirect approach. A data mining of serum TSH results of neonates (≤ 1 month of age) from 2013 - 2018 was done. Two subgroups on the basis of age from birth to 5 days and 6 - 30 days were assessed. The German study group's pre-validated indirect algorithm 'KOSMIC' was utilized for the statistical analysis. A total of non-duplicate 82,299 neonatal serum TSH tests were retrieved over a period of 6 years, including 88% (n = 70,788) aged 0 - 5 days and 12% (n = 11,511) ranging from 6 days to 1 month. The estimated RIs for the first age partition was 0.7 (90% CI 0.6 - 0.8) to 15.5 (90% CI 12.9 - 16.2) and for the second group 0.7 (90% CI 0.5 - 0.9) to 7.8 (90% CI 6.1 - 9.9) µIU/mL. This study revealed age related trends in serum TSH. The study advocates the need for population specific RIs owing to the significant variations noted on comparison with previously published literature. Precise RIs become vital particularly when serum TSH is undertaken as a confirmatory test for presumptive positive results on newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism.",,540
2488,35966770,Visualizing and Quantifying Longitudinal Changes in Verbal Fluency Using Recurrence Plots.,"The verbal fluency task, where participants name as many instances of a specific semantic or phonemic category as possible in a certain time limit, is widely used to probe language and memory retrieval functions in research and clinical settings. More recently, interests in using longitudinal observations in verbal fluency to examine changes over the lifespan have grown, in part due to the increasing availability of such datasets, yet quantitative methods for comparing repeated measures of verbal fluency responses remain scarce. As a result, existing studies tend to focus only on the number of unique words produced and how this metric changes over time, overlooking changes in other important features in the data, such as the identity of the words and the order in which they are produced. Here, we provide an example of how the literature of recurrence analysis, which aims to visualize and analyze non-linear time series, may present useful visualization and analytical approaches for this problem. Drawing on this literature, we introduce a novel metric (the distance from diagonal, or DfD) to quantify semantic fluency data that incorporates analysis of the sequence order and changes between two lists. As a demonstration, we apply these methods to a longitudinal dataset of semantic fluency in people with Alzheimer's disease and age-matched controls. We show that DfD differs significantly between healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, and that it complements common existing metrics in diagnostic prediction. Our visualization method also allows incorporation of other less common metrics-including the order that words are recalled, repetitions of words within a list, and out-of-category intrusions. Additionally, we show that these plots can be used to visualize and compare aggregate recall data at the group level. These methods can improve understanding of verbal fluency deficits observed in various neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.",,541
1681,35968092,The 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase-producing Streptomyces violaceoruber UAE1 can provide protection from sudden decline syndrome on date palm.,"In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), sudden decline syndrome (SDS) is one of the major fungal diseases caused by Fusarium solani affecting date palm plantations. To minimize the impact of the causal agent of SDS on date palm, native actinobacterial strains isolated from rhizosphere soils of healthy date palm plants were characterized according to their antifungal activities against F. solani DSM 106836 (Fs). Based on their in vitro abilities, two promising biocontrol agents (BCAs), namely Streptomyces tendae UAE1 (St) andStreptomyces violaceoruber UAE1 (Sv), were selected for the production of antifungal compounds and cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs), albeit their variations in synthesizing 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase (ACCD). Although both isolates showed antagonism when applied 7 days before the pathogen in the greenhouse experiments, the ACCD-producing Sv was relatively superior in its efficacy against SDS over the non-ACCD-producing St. This was evident from the symptoms of SDS in diseased date palm seedlings which were greatly reduced by Sv compared to St. On a scale of 5.0, the estimated disease severity indices in Fs-diseased seedlings were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced from 4.8 to 1.5 and 0.5 by St and Sv, respectively. Thus, the number of conidia of Fs recovered from plants pre-treated with both BCAs was comparable, but significantly (P < 0.05) reduced compared to plants without any BCA treatment. In addition, a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in ACC levels of both the root and shoot tissues was detected inSv + Fs seedlings to almost similar levels of healthy seedlings. However, in planta ACC levels highly increased in seedlings grown in soils infested with the pathogen alone or amended with St prior to F. solani infestation (St + Fs). This suggests a major role of ACCD production in relieving the stress of date palm seedlings infected with F. solani, thus supporting the integrated preventive disease management programs against this pathogen. This is the first report of effective rhizosphere actinobacterial BCAs to provide protection against SDS on date palm, and to help increase agricultural productivity in a more sustainable manner in the UAE and the other arid regions.",,542
1294,35970681,"Transdermal fentanyl patch versus standard analgesia in postoperative oral submucous fibrosis patients: a triple blinded, randomised control trial.","Severe pain experienced by patients with oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) compromises their physiotherapy and negatively affects the surgical outcome and the patient's compliance. The main aim of this study was to develop a protocol for pain control in the management of OSMF postoperatively. This was a prospective, parallel with active control, double-arm, triple-blinded, randomised control trial (RCT) with 48 OSMF patients, randomised into two groups - Group A (control, n = 25): received non-opioid analgesics (NSAIDs) and Group B (cases, n = 23): received transdermal fentanyl patches (TFP). Pain and interincisal opening were measured on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 15, and on the1st and 3rd postoperative months. Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed preoperatively, on the 15th day postoperatively, and 3rd month postoperatively, and compliance was documented postoperatively on the 9th day. The transdermal fentanyl patch was found to have statistically significantly more effect in controlling severe pain during active mouth opening exercises, and thus significantly increased the patients' compliance. Although there was increased mouth opening and QoL in the fentanyl group, the differences were statistically insignificant. Our study recommends the use of TFP for better pain control and compliance in postoperative OSMF patients.",,543
1731,35968011,Characterization of the Fecal Microbiome in Dogs Receiving Medical Management for Congenital Portosystemic Shunts.,"The GI microbiome has not been characterized in dogs being medically managed for congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS). To characterize the fecal microbiome in a population of dogs being medically managed for CPSS. 27 client-owned dogs. Prospective cohort study enrollment of fecal samples was performed with follow-up data collected retrospectively. The overall fecal dysbiosis index (DI) and individual bacterial abundances were determined using real-time qPCR. Medical management, clinical findings, clinicopathologic, and outcome variables were collected, and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between these variables and overall DI and bacterial abundances. Numerical variables were evaluated with general linear models for normality and equal variance using Shapiro-Wilk test and Levene's test, respectively. All dogs were administered a hepatic diet and lactulose, while antibiotics were used in 22 (81.5%) and acid suppressants in 7 (25.9%). Seventeen dogs (63.0%) had a DI >2. The median DI in this population was 3.02 (range 4.23-8.42), and the median DI in dogs receiving and not receiving antibiotics was 4.3 (range -4.23-8.42) and 1.52 (range -1.62-5.43), respectively. No significant association between any of the analyzed variables and the DI was identified. There was a significant association between the use of metronidazole and a larger abundance of E. coli (p = 0.024). Dysbiosis appears to be common in dogs that are being medically managed for CPSS, though the clinical significance remains unclear.",,544
2139,35967379,Peptide Centric Vβ Specific Germline Contacts Shape a Specialist T Cell Response.,"Certain CD8 T cell responses are particularly effective at controlling infection, as exemplified by elite control of HIV in individuals harboring HLA-B57. To understand the structural features that contribute to CD8 T cell elite control, we focused on a strongly protective CD8 T cell response directed against a parasite-derived peptide (HF10) presented by an atypical MHC-I molecule, H-2Ld. This response exhibits a focused TCR repertoire dominated by Vβ2, and a representative TCR (TG6) in complex with Ld-HF10 reveals an unusual structure in which both MHC and TCR contribute extensively to peptide specificity, along with a parallel footprint of TCR on its pMHC ligand. The parallel footprint is a common feature of Vβ2-containing TCRs and correlates with an unusual Vα-Vβ interface, CDR loop conformations, and Vβ2-specific germline contacts with peptides. Vβ2 and Ld may represent specialist components for antigen recognition that allows for particularly strong and focused T cell responses.",,545
1359,35969106,The Miniature Pig: A Large Animal Model for Cochlear Implant Research.,"Cochlear implants (CI) are the most effective method to treat people with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss. Although CIs are used worldwide, no standard model exists for investigating the electrophysiology and histopathology in patients or animal models with a CI or for evaluating new models of electrode arrays. A large animal model with cochlea characteristics similar to those of humans may provide a research and evaluation platform for advanced and modified arrays before their use in humans. To this end, we established standard CI methods with Bama mini-pigs, whose inner ear anatomy is highly similar to that of humans. Arrays designed for human use were implanted into the mini pig cochlea through a round window membrane, and a surgical approach followed that was similar to that used for human CI recipients. Array insertion was followed by evoked compound action potential (ECAP) measurements to evaluate the function of the auditory nerve. This study describes the preparation of the animal, surgical steps, array insertion, and intraoperative electrophysiological measurements. The results indicated that the same CI used for humans could be easily implanted in mini-pigs via a standardized surgical approach and yielded similar electrophysiological outcomes as measured in human CI recipients. Mini-pigs could be a valuable animal model to provide initial evidence of the safety and potential performance of novel electrode arrays and surgical approaches before applying them to human beings.",,546
750,35975087,Kinetics of the photolysis of pyridaben and its main photoproduct in aqueous environments under simulated solar irradiation.,"The photolytic fate of pyridaben and its main photolysis product was investigated in different aqueous solutions. Results showed that the photolysis of pyridaben followed pseudo first-order kinetics or the hockey-stick model. In buffer solutions, the half-life of pyridaben was the shortest at pH 4, while the degradation rate within 24 h was the highest at pH 9. Humic acids (HA) at concentrations of 1-20 mg L-1 favored the photolysis of pyridaben while fulvic acids (FA) did not have a significant effect. Nitrate at low concentrations (0.01 mM) accelerated the photolysis and Fe(iii) at high concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 mM) significantly inhibited the photolysis. The photolysis rate of pyridaben in rainwater, tap water, and river water was significantly higher than that in distilled water. The half-lives in distilled water, rainwater, tap water, river water, and pond water were 2.36, 1.36, 1.61, 1.77, and 2.68 h, respectively. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry identified M328 as a photolysis product. The degradation of M328 followed pseudo first-order kinetics in distilled water, buffer solutions and aqueous solutions fortified with HA. The half-lives of M328 were in the range of 7.07-13.95 h. These results are essential for further environmental risk assessment of pyridaben.",,547
1573,35968313,Brain Activities Responding to Acupuncture at ST36 (zusanli) in Healthy Subjects: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Task-Based fMRI Studies.,"Stomach 36 (ST36, zusanli) is one of the important acupoints in acupuncture. Despite clinical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of ST36 acupuncture, the brain activities and the neural mechanism following acupuncture at ST36 remain unclear. Literature searches were conducted on online databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, WeiPu database, and China Biology Medicine, for task-based fMRI studies of acupuncture at ST36 in healthy subjects. Brain regions activated by ST36 acupuncture were systematically evaluated and subjected to seed-based d mapping meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted on control procedures, manual acupuncture, electrical acupuncture (EA), and acupuncture-specific activations. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the effects of needle retention time on brain activities following ST36 acupuncture stimulation. The activated brain regions were further decoded and mapped on large-scale functional networks to further decipher the clinical relevance of acupuncturing at ST36. A total of sixteen studies, involving a total of 401 right-handed healthy participants, that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included in the present meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncturing on ST36 positively activates the opercular part of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG.R), left superior temporal gyrus (STG.L), and right median cingulate/paracingulate gyri (MCG.R) regions. Needle retention time in an acupuncture session positively correlates with the activation of the left olfactory cortex, as shown in meta-regression analysis. Subgroup analysis revealed that EA stimulation may be a source of heterogeneity in the pooled results. Functional network mappings showed that the activated areas were mapped to the auditory network and salience network. Further functional decoding analysis showed that acupuncture on ST36 was associated with pain, secondary somatosensory, sound and language processing, and mood regulation. Acupuncture at ST36 in healthy individuals positively activates the opercular part of IFG.R, STG.L, and MCG.R. The left olfactory cortex may exhibit positive needle retention time-dependent activities. Our findings may have clinical implications for acupuncture in analgesia, language processing, and mood disorders. https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2021-12-0035.",,548
359,35979315,Self-made wire loop snare successfully treats gastric persimmon stone under endoscopy.,"Large gastric persimmon stones are generally resistant to standard endoscopic treatments. We applied an alternative endoscopic method using a hand-made snare for the treatment of large gastric phytobezoars. To explore the clinical efficacy of a self-made wire loop snare to treat giant gastric persimmon stones. A retrospective study evaluated the clinical data of 38 patients with gastroliths admitted to Taihe Hospital in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, China, between March 2015 and October 2020. The patients were divided into observation (n = 23) and control (n = 15) groups. Patients in the observation group were treated with self-made wire loop snares for lithotripsy, and patients in the control group were treated with traditional foreign body forceps, snares, injection needles, and other tools. Successful stone removal, treatment time, and hospital stay were compared. The average operating time was significantly shorter (P < 0.001) in the observation group (53.4 min) than that in the control group (172.8 min). The average hospital stay of the observation group (5.4 d) was significantly shorter (P < 0.001) than that in the control group (10.3 d). Successful one-time treatment was significantly more frequent (P < 0.001) in the observation group (87%) than in the control group (7%). Self-made guidewire loop snares were successfully used to treat gastrolithiasis, and were significantly more effective than foreign body forceps, snares, and other traditional methods.",,549
537,35978693,Optimization of hERG and Pharmacokinetic Properties for Basic Dihydro-8H-purin-8-one Inhibitors of DNA-PK.,"The DNA-PK complex is activated by double-strand DNA breaks and regulates the non-homologous end-joining repair pathway; thus, targeting DNA-PK by inhibiting the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) is potentially a useful therapeutic approach for oncology. A previously reported series of neutral DNA-PKcs inhibitors were modified to incorporate a basic group, with the rationale that increasing the volume of distribution while maintaining good metabolic stability should increase the half-life. However, adding a basic group introduced hERG activity, and basic compounds with modest hERG activity (IC50 = 10-15 μM) prolonged QTc (time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave, corrected by heart rate) in an anaesthetized guinea pig cardiovascular model. Further optimization was necessary, including modulation of pK a, to identify compound 18, which combines low hERG activity (IC50 = 75 μM) with excellent kinome selectivity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties.",,550
2369,35967005,Cerebellar and brainstem differences in children with developmental coordination disorder: A voxel-based morphometry study.,"Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that significantly impairs a child's ability to learn motor skills and to perform everyday activities. The cause of DCD is unknown; however, evidence suggests that children with DCD have altered brain structure and function. While the cerebellum has been hypothesised to be involved in developmental coordination disorder, no studies have specifically examined cerebellar structure in this population. The purpose of our study was to examine cerebellar differences in children with DCD compared to typically-developing children. Using voxel-based morphometry, we assessed cerebellar morphology in children 8-12 years of age. Forty-six children (12 typically-developing and 34 with DCD) were investigated using high resolution T1-weighted images, which were then processed using the spatially unbiased atlas template of the cerebellum and brainstem (SUIT) toolbox for a region of interest-based examination of the cerebellum. Results revealed that children with DCD had reduced grey matter volume in several regions, namely: the brainstem, right/left crus I, right crus II, left VI, right VIIb, and right VIIIa lobules. Further, Pearson correlations revealed significant positive associations between the total motor percentile score on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 and regions that had reduced grey matter volume in our cohort (brainstem, left crus I, right VIIb, and right VIIIa). These findings indicate that reductions in cerebellar grey matter volume are associated with poorer motor skills. Given the cerebellum's involvement in internal models of movement, results of this study may help to explain why children with DCD struggle to learn motor skills.",,551
847,35974919,Microbial Journey: Mount Everest to Mars.,"A rigorous exploration of microbial diversity has revealed its presence on Earth, deep oceans, and vast space. The presence of microbial life in diverse environmental conditions, ranging from moderate to extreme temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen, radiations, and altitudes, has provided the necessary impetus to search for them by extending the limits of their habitats. Microbiology started as a distinct science in the mid-nineteenth century and has provided inputs for the betterment of mankind during the last 150 years. As beneficial microbes are assets and pathogens are detrimental, studying both have its own merits. Scientists are nowadays working on illustrating the microbial dynamics in Earth's subsurface, deep sea, and polar regions. In addition to studying the role of microbes in the environment, the microbe-host interactions in humans, animals and plants are also unearthing newer insights that can help us to improve the health of the host by modulating the microbiota. Microbes have the potential to remediate persistent organic pollutants. Antimicrobial resistance which is a serious concern can also be tackled only after monitoring the spread of resistant microbes using disciplines of genomics and metagenomics The cognizance of microbiology has reached the top of the world. Space Missions are now looking for signs of life on the planets (specifically Mars), the Moon and beyond them. Among the most potent pieces of evidence to support the existence of life is to look for microbial, plant, and animal fossils. There is also an urgent need to deliberate and communicate these findings to layman and policymakers that would help them to take an adequate decision for better health and the environment around us. Here, we present a glimpse of recent advancements by scientists from around the world, exploring and exploiting microbial diversity.",,552
2124,35967394,Tumor-associated microglia and macrophages in glioblastoma: From basic insights to therapeutic opportunities.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Currently, the standard treatment of glioblastoma includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival is only 15 months. GBM progression and therapeutic resistance are the results of the complex interactions between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment (TME). TME consists of several different cell types, such as stromal cells, endothelial cells and immune cells. Although GBM has the immunologically cold characteristic with very little lymphocyte infiltration, the TME of GBM can contain more than 30% of tumor-associated microglia and macrophages (TAMs). TAMs can release cytokines and growth factors to promote tumor proliferation, survival and metastasis progression as well as inhibit the function of immune cells. Thus, TAMs are logical therapeutic targets for GBM. In this review, we discussed the characteristics and functions of the TAMs and evaluated the state of the art of TAMs-targeting strategies in GBM. This review helps to understand how TAMs promote GBM progression and summarizes the present therapeutic interventions to target TAMs. It will possibly pave the way for new immune therapeutic avenues for GBM patients.",,553
996,35974623,Janssen effect in columns of fire ants.,"We study fire-ant columns, an active version of passive granular columns, and find that, despite the inherent activity of the ants and their natural tendency to rearrange, the ants develop force-chain structures that help support the weight of the column. Hence, the apparent mass at the bottom of the column saturates with added mass in a Janssen-like fashion, reminiscent of what is seen in passive-grain columns in wide containers. Activity-induced rearrangements within the column, however, lead to changes in the force-chain structure that slightly reduce the supportive nature of the force-chains over time and to fluctuations in the pressure at the bottom of the column that scale like the law of large numbers. We capture the experimental results in simulations that include not only friction with the walls, but also a fluctuating force that introduces activity and that effectively affects the force-chain structure of the ant collective.",,554
1539,35968347,"Exploring the anticancer activities of novel bioactive compounds derived from endophytic fungi: mechanisms of action, current challenges and future perspectives.","Cancer is the second leading cause of death all around the world. The natural compounds derived from the endophytic flora of fungi are possible solutions to cancer treatment because they are safe for health, cost-effective, biocompatible and have fewer toxicity issues. The active ingredients in endophytic fungi that are responsible for anti-cancer activities are alkaloids, terpenoids, glycosides, saponin, peptides, steroids, phenols, quinones, and flavonoids. This review highlights the anti-cancer activities of entophytic fungus against human papillary thyroid carcinoma (IHH4), human pancreatic (PANC-1), ovarian (OVCAR-3), hepatic (HepG2), lung (A-549), human lymphoma (U937), human skin carcinoma (A431), breast (MCF-7), and Kaposi's sarcoma. The emerging evidence suggested that bioactive compounds isolated from endophytic fungi showed their anti-cancer activities by revealing the disturbance of the microtubule network caused by increased levels of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins that triggers cell cycle arrest at the G2-M phase, by inhibiting the DNA replication via binding with topoisomerase II, by regulating the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and NF-kB, by evaluating the levels of p21, p27, and cyclins B/D1/E that led to cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. This review will assist readers in better comprehending bioactive chemicals and the beneficial interaction between the fungal endophytes and medicinal plants.",,555
252,35982595,Machine Learning Smart System for Parkinson Disease Classification Using the Voice as a Biomarker.,"This study presents PD Predict, a machine learning system for Parkinson disease classification using voice as a biomarker. We first created an original set of recordings from the mPower study, and then extracted several audio features, such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) components and other classical speech features, using a windowing procedure. The generated dataset was then divided into training and holdout sets. The training set was used to train two machine learning pipelines, and their performance was estimated using a nested subject-wise cross-validation approach. The holdout set was used to assess the generalizability of the pipelines for unseen data. The final pipelines were implemented in PD Predict and accessed through a prediction endpoint developed using the Django REST Framework. PD Predict is a two-component system: a desktop application that records audio recordings, extracts audio features, and makes predictions; and a server-side web application that implements the machine learning pipelines and processes incoming requests with the extracted audio features to make predictions. Our system is deployed and accessible via the following link: https://pdpredict.herokuapp.com/. Both machine learning pipelines showed moderate performance, between 65% and 75% using the nested subject-wise cross-validation approach. Furthermore, they generalized well to unseen data and they did not overfit the training set. The architecture of PD Predict is clear, and the performance of the implemented machine learning pipelines is promising and confirms the usability of smartphone microphones for capturing digital biomarkers of disease.",,556
538,35978691,SJPYT-195: A Designed Nuclear Receptor Degrader That Functions as a Molecular Glue Degrader of GSPT1.,"We previously reported a specific inverse agonist (SPA70) of the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR). However, derivatization of SPA70 yielded only agonists and neutral antagonists, suggesting that inverse agonism of PXR is difficult to achieve. Therefore, we sought to design proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) aimed at inducing PXR degradation. Conjugation of a SPA70 derivative to ligands of the E3 substrate receptor cereblon (CRBN) resulted in one molecule, SJPYT-195, that reduced PXR protein level in an optimized degradation assay described here. Further analysis revealed that SJPYT-195 was a molecular glue degrader of the translation termination factor GSPT1 and that GSPT1 degradation resulted in subsequent reduction of PXR protein. GSPT1 has recently gained interest as an anticancer target, and our results give new insights into chemical determinants of drug-induced GSPT1 degradation. Additionally, we have developed assays and cell models for PXR degrader discovery that can be applied to additional protein targets.",,557
557,35978577,Isolation and ex vivo Expansion of Limbal Mesenchymal Stromal Cells.,"Limbal mesenchymal stromal cells (LMSC), a cellular component of the limbal stem cell niche, have the capability of determining the fate of limbal epithelial progenitor cells (LEPC), which are responsible for the homeostasis of corneal epithelium. However, the isolation of these LMSC has proven to be difficult due to the small fraction of LMSC in the total limbal population, and primary cultures are always hampered by contamination with other cell types. We recently published the efficient isolation and functional characterization of LMSC from the human corneal limbus using CD90 as a selective marker. We observed that flow sorting yielded a pure population of LMSC with superior self-renewal capacity and transdifferentiation potential, and supported the maintenance of the LEPC phenotype. Here, we describe an optimized protocol for the isolation of LMSC from cadaveric corneal limbal tissue by combined collagenase digestion and flow sorting with expansion of LMSC on plastic.

1298,35970649,Frailty predicts outcomes in cystic fibrosis patients listed for lung transplantation.,"Survival predictors are not established for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients listed for lung transplantation (LT). Using the deficit accumulation approach, we developed a CF-specific frailty index (FI) to allow risk stratification for adverse waitlist and post-LT outcomes. We studied adult CF patients listed for LT in the Toronto LT Program (development cohort 2005-2015) and the Swiss LT centres (validation cohort 2008-2017). Comorbidities, treatment, laboratory results and social support at listing were utilized to develop a lung disease severity index (LI deficits, d = 18), a frailty index (FI, d = 66) and a lifestyle/social vulnerability index (LSVI, d = 10). We evaluated associations of the indices with worsening waitlist status, hospital and ICU length of stay, survival and graft failure. We studied 188 (Toronto cohort, 176 [94%] transplanted) and 94 (Swiss cohort, 89 [95%] transplanted) patients. The median waitlist times were 69 and 284 days, respectively. The median follow-up post-transplant was 5.3 and 4.7 years. At listing, 44.7% of patients were frail (FI ≥ 0.25) in the Toronto and 21.3% in the Swiss cohort. The FI was significantly associated with all studied outcomes in the Toronto cohort (FI and post-LT mortality, multivariable HR 1.74 [95%CI:1.24-2.45] per 0.1 point of the FI). In the Swiss cohort, the FI was associated with worsening waitlist status, post-LT mortality and graft failure. In CF patients listed for LT, FI risk stratification was significantly associated with waitlist and post-LT outcomes. Studying frailty in young populations with advanced disease can provide insights on how frailty and deficit accumulation impacts survival.",,559

The magnetization m as a function of the external field H is observed to have double hysteresis loops with a return point memory. We also solve the model on a Bethe lattice in the approximation that the spin relaxation dynamics is abelian and find good agreement between simulations on random regular graphs and Bethe lattice calculations for negative values of H.,,560
1016,35974603,Adversarial attacks on voter model dynamics in complex networks.,"This paper investigates adversarial attacks conducted to distort voter model dynamics in complex networks. Specifically, a simple adversarial attack method is proposed to hold the state of opinions of an individual closer to the target state in the voter model dynamics. This indicates that even when one opinion is the majority the vote outcome can be inverted (i.e., the outcome can lean toward the other opinion) by adding extremely small (hard-to-detect) perturbations strategically generated in social networks. Adversarial attacks are relatively more effective in complex (large and dense) networks. These results indicate that opinion dynamics can be unknowingly distorted.",,561
2083,35967435,Current status of xenotransplantation research and the strategies for preventing xenograft rejection.,"Transplantation is often the last resort for end-stage organ failures, e.g., kidney, liver, heart, lung, and pancreas. The shortage of donor organs is the main limiting factor for successful transplantation in humans. Except living donations, other alternatives are needed, e.g., xenotransplantation of pig organs. However, immune rejection remains the major challenge to overcome in xenotransplantation. There are three different xenogeneic types of rejections, based on the responses and mechanisms involved. It includes hyperacute rejection (HAR), delayed xenograft rejection (DXR) and chronic rejection. DXR, sometimes involves acute humoral xenograft rejection (AHR) and cellular xenograft rejection (CXR), which cannot be strictly distinguished from each other in pathological process. In this review, we comprehensively discussed the mechanism of these immunological rejections and summarized the strategies for preventing them, such as generation of gene knock out donors by different genome editing tools and the use of immunosuppressive regimens. We also addressed organ-specific barriers and challenges needed to pave the way for clinical xenotransplantation. Taken together, this information will benefit the current immunological research in the field of xenotransplantation.",,562
1268,35971347,Copper and Zinc Feud: Is This Myelodysplasia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome?,"We report a case of a 59-year-old male who developed pancytopenia and multiorgan failure attributed to copper deficiency from exogenous consumption of zinc tablets. During the six months preceding his presentation, he had experienced increasing shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia with profound anemia (hemoglobin level 2.8 g/dL) along with evidence of acute kidney injury and acute heart failure; the patient was presumed to have multiorgan failure due to profound anemia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed dyspoiesis suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). There were no cytogenetic abnormalities observed. However, the blood workup analysis found low copper and ceruloplasmin levels, whereas zinc levels were excessively elevated (257 mg/dL). Upon inquiry, the patient reported taking an over-the-counter zinc supplement of an unknown quantity for over a year. After two months of copper treatment, his blood count returned to normal. This case highlights a rare presentation of zinc-induced copper deficiency resulting in pancytopenia and severe anemia-related multiorgan failure. A growing number of hematological disorders are being linked to copper deficiency. Copper deficiency pancytopenia is a reversible condition that often goes unnoticed and can be misdiagnosed as MDS because it has similar hematological characteristics.",,563
23,35985126,Structural disconnections associated with language impairments in chronic post-stroke aphasia using disconnectome maps.,"Inconsistent findings have been reported about the impact of structural disconnections on language function in post-stroke aphasia. This study investigated patterns of structural disconnections associated with chronic language impairments using disconnectome maps. Seventy-six individuals with post-stroke aphasia underwent a battery of language assessments and a structural MRI scan. Support-vector regression disconnectome-symptom mapping analyses were performed to examine the correlations between disconnectome maps, representing the probability of disconnection at each white matter voxel and different language scores. To further understand whether significant disconnections were primarily representing focal damage or a more extended network of seemingly preserved but disconnected areas beyond the lesion site, results were qualitatively compared to support-vector regression lesion-symptom mapping analyses. Part of the left white matter perisylvian network was similarly disconnected in 90% of the individuals with aphasia. Surrounding this common left perisylvian disconnectome, specific structural disconnections in the left fronto-temporo-parietal network were significantly associated with aphasia severity and with lower performance in auditory comprehension, syntactic comprehension, syntactic production, repetition and naming tasks. Auditory comprehension, repetition and syntactic processing deficits were related to disconnections in areas that overlapped with and extended beyond lesion sites significant in SVR-LSM analyses. In contrast, overall language abilities as measured by aphasia severity and naming seemed to be mostly explained by focal damage at the level of the insular and central opercular cortices, given the high overlap between SVR-DSM and SVR-LSM results for these scores. While focal damage seems to be sufficient to explain broad measures of language performance, the structural disconnections between language areas provide additional information on the neural basis of specific and persistent language impairments at the chronic stage beyond lesion volume. Leveraging routinely available clinical data, disconnectome mapping furthers our understanding of anatomical connectivity constraints that may limit the recovery of some language abilities in chronic post-stroke aphasia.",,564
1216,35971498,Safety and efficacy of sodium cromoglycate-fluorometholone fixed combination eye drops in allergic conjunctivitis.,"This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium cromoglycate with fluorometholone in patients with allergic conjunctivitis. We conducted a single-arm phase IV open-label trial where fifty patients who received the eye drops were followed for 4 weeks. Treatment efficacy was assessed using the ocular itching score, conjunctival assessment score, total symptom and sign (TSS) score, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Patients who received sodium cromoglycate-fluorometholone eye drops experienced significant improvements in their ocular itching score (mean difference [MD]: 1.14, P < 0.001) and conjunctival redness score (MD: 1.18, P < 0.001). Statistically significant improvements in TSS and VAS were achieved in 78% of the patients reporting no conjunctivitis by the end of the study. The overall therapeutic response to the drug was as follows: 16% improved and 84% much improved. No serious adverse events were reported. Sodium cromoglycate with fluorometholone eye drops achieved 100% therapeutic response among patients with allergic conjunctivitis. The eye drops improve the ocular itching, and conjunctival irritation without serious adverse events. This combination appears effective and tolerable for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.",,565
801,35975031,Advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: how to manage EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation-positive disease.,"EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations (Ex20ins) and HER2 mutations characterize an oncogene-addicted subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) typically associated with a never or light smoking history, female sex, and adenocarcinoma histology. Nevertheless, Ex20ins-mutant and HER2-mutant advanced NSCLCs are still difficult to treat for various reasons. First, there is a need for sophisticated diagnostic tools (e.g. next-generation sequencing) that could allow the identification of these relatively rare molecular drivers. Second, highly active targeted drugs that might support a significant change in patients' prognosis when used as first-line therapy are required. In fact, although a few targeted drugs have so far demonstrated antitumour activity for these patients, mainly selective human epidermal receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as poziotinib and mobocertinib (for both molecular alterations), monoclonal antibodies such as amivantamab (for Ex20ins), and antibody-drug conjugates such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (for HER2 mutants), they are mostly confined for clinical use in pretreated patients. Finally, Ex20ins-targeted or HER2-targeted drugs might be difficult to access in different countries or regions worldwide. In the present review, we provide a concise but comprehensive summary of the challenges that lie ahead as we move towards personalized treatment of Ex20ins-mutant and HER2-mutant advanced NSCLC, also suggesting a treatment algorithm that could be followed for patients with these genetic aberrations.",,566
392,35979282,Entire process of electrocardiogram recording of Wellens syndrome: A case report.,"Wellens syndrome is an electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern seen in high-risk patients with unstable angina pectoris. It is characterized by inverted or biphasic T-waves that change into positive or pseudo-normalized waves at precordial leads when the patient experiences an angina attack; however, the mechanism for this condition remains unclear. A 47-year-old male patient experienced repeated, unprovoked episodes of chest pain for > 20 d, with worsening during the previous day. On the day of admission, he experienced episodes of paroxysmal chest pain lasting more than 30 min, in addition to radiating pain to the left arm and exertional dyspnea. The patient presented to the emergency department with no chest pain or other discomfort at that time. ECG at presentation showed sinus tachycardia and T-wave changes, which were identified as Wellens syndrome when combined with previous ECG findings. ECGs and myocardial enzymology examinations were normal when angina was present, but the ECG showed inverted or biphasic T-waves when angina was absent. After percutaneous coronary intervention, the ECGs demonstrated inverted or biphasic T-waves in the anterior precordial leads on days 0, 1, and 2, but normal T-waves on day 3. The ECGs showed no subsequent ischemic ST-T-wave changes. The Wellens syndrome pseudo-normalized T-waves likely reflect development of unstable angina pectoris into the hyperacute phase of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.",,567
1493,35968395,Fibrinolysis versus thoracoscopy: Comparison of results in empyema management in the child.,"The objective of this study is to compare the outcome of treatment with drainage and urokinase (UK) versus thoracoscopy (TS) in pleural empyema secondary to complicated pneumonia. This was a retrospective study of patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions between 2008 and 2019 treated with UK or TS. Epidemiological and evolutionary data compared days of fever, antibiotic, pre- and postprocedure stay, time to radiological resolution, and complications. The results were expressed as medians and the comparisons were made by the Mann-Whitney U-test. Of 143 patients with NC, 46 were empyemas (26 men), 25 were treated with TS, and 10 were treated with UK. The remaining 11 received combined treatment, being excluded from the study. There were no significant differences between TS versus UK in age (median 4 vs. 3 years), days of fever before the procedure (4 vs. 2) and after (2 vs. 2), days of antibiotic treatment before the procedure (4 vs. 4), overall hospital stay (15 vs. 13 days), and months until radiological normalization (2 vs. 2). The complications related to the therapy were scarce in both groups and had no impact on evolution. Patients with TS had a longer preprocedural stay (4 vs. 1; P < 0.001) and required fewer days of subsequent antibiotic after procedure (8 vs. 11; P = 0.03), and a shorter overall antibiotic treatment time (11 vs. 16; P = 0.03). They also had a shorter post-TS stay (9 vs. 12 days), although this difference did not become significant (P = 0.09). In our experience, the results obtained with both procedures are quite similar, although patients undergoing TS had a better evolution (fewer days of antibiotic and a tendency to less hospitalization), despite having been performed a priori in more evolved patients.",,568
244,35982658,"Infection- or vaccine mediated immunity reduces SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but increases competitiveness of Omicron in hamsters.","Omicron has demonstrated a competitive advantage over Delta in vaccinated people. To understand this, we designed a transmission chain experiment using naïve, intranasally (IN) or intramuscularly (IM) vaccinated, and previously infected (PI) hamsters. Vaccination and previous infection protected animals from disease and virus replication after Delta and Omicron dual challenge. A gradient in transmission blockage was observed: IM vaccination displayed moderate transmission blockage potential over three airborne chains (approx. 70%), whereas, IN vaccination and PI blocked airborne transmission in >90%. In naïve hamsters, Delta completely outcompeted Omicron within and between hosts after dual infection in onward transmission. Although Delta also outcompeted Omicron in the vaccinated and PI transmission chains, an increase in Omicron competitiveness was observed in these groups. This correlated with the increase in the strength of the humoral response against Delta, with the strongest response seen in PI animals. These data highlight the continuous need to assess the emergence and spread of novel variants in populations with pre-existing immunity and address the additional evolutionary pressure this may exert on the virus.",,569
2106,35967412,Reactive oxygen species associated immunoregulation post influenza virus infection.,"An appropriate level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is necessary for cell proliferation, signaling transduction, and apoptosis due to their highly reactive character. ROS are generated through multiple metabolic pathways under a fine-tuned control between oxidant and antioxidant signaling. A growing number of evidence has proved their highly relevant role in modulating inflammation during influenza virus infection. As a network of biological process for protecting organism from invasion of pathogens, immune system can react and fight back through either innate immune system or adaptive immune system, or both. Herein, we provide a review about the mechanisms of ROS generation when encounter influenza virus infection, and how the imbalanced level of ROS influences the replication of virus. We also summarize the pathways used by both the innate and adaptive immune system to sense and attack the invaded virus and abnormal levels of ROS. We further review the limitation of current strategies and discuss the direction of future work.",,570
1104,35974515,Numerically probing the universal operator growth hypothesis.,"Recently, a hypothesis on the complexity growth of unitarily evolving operators was presented. This hypothesis states that in generic, nonintegrable many-body systems, the so-called Lanczos coefficients associated with an autocorrelation function grow asymptotically linear, with a logarithmic correction in one-dimensional systems. In contrast, the growth is expected to be slower in integrable or free models. In this paper, we numerically test this hypothesis for a variety of exemplary systems, including one-dimensional and two-dimensional Ising models as well as one-dimensional Heisenberg models. While we find the hypothesis to be practically fulfilled for all considered Ising models, the onset of the hypothesized universal behavior could not be observed in the attainable numerical data for the Heisenberg model. The proposed linear bound on operator growth associated with the hypothesis eventually stems from geometric arguments involving the locality of the Hamiltonian as well as the lattice configuration. We derive and investigate a related geometric bound, and we find that while the bound itself is not sharply achieved for any considered model, the hypothesis is nonetheless fulfilled in most cases.",,571
2365,35967011,Formation of Novel Bimetal Oxide In2V2O7 through a Shock Compression Method.,"Bimetal oxides with a chemical formula of A2B2O7 have received much attention from plenty of research groups owing to their outstanding properties, such as electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. Among the abundant element combinations of cations A and B, some theoretically predicted compounds have not successfully been synthesized in experiments, such as In2Zr2O7, In2V2O7, etc. In this study, a novel tetragonal pyrochlore-like In2V2O7 nanopowder has been reported for the first time. In2O3 and VO2 powders mixed through ball milling were reacted to form In2V2O7 by shockwave loading. The recovered sample is investigated to be nanocrystalline In2V2O7 powder through various techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray energy spectrum analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. The formed In2V2O7 is indexed as a tetragonal cell with a = b = 0.7417 nm and c = 2.1035 nm. Moreover, the formation mechanism of In2V2O7 through a shock synthesis process is carefully analyzed based on basic laws of shockwave. The experimental results also confirm that a high shock temperature and high shock pressure are the two key factors to synthesize the In2V2O7 nanopowder. Our investigation demonstrates the high potential application of a shock-induced reaction on the synthesis of novel materials, including the preparation of new bimetal oxides.",,572
135,35983268,Applying Lessons Learned From COVID-19 Therapeutic Trials to Improve Future ALI/ARDS Trials.,"Host-directed therapeutics targeting immune dysregulation are considered the most promising approach to address the unmet clinical need for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To better understand the current clinical study landscape and gaps in treating hospitalized patients with severe or critical COVID-19, we identified COVID-19 trials developing host-directed therapies registered at ClinicalTrials.gov and discussed the factors contributing to the success vs failure of these studies. We have learned, instead of the one-size-fits-all approach, future clinical trials evaluating a targeted immunomodulatory agent in heterogeneous patients with ALI/ARDS due to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases can use immune-based biomarkers in addition to clinical and demographic characteristics to improve patient stratification and inform clinical decision-making. Identifying distinct patient subgroups based on immune profiles across the disease trajectory, regardless of the causative pathogen, may accelerate evaluating host-directed therapeutics in trials of ALI/ARDS and related conditions (eg, sepsis).",,573
529,35978725,Point-of-care ultrasound-guided pericapsular nerve group block for superior pubic ramus fracture in the emergency department: A case report.,"Pelvic fragility fractures, such as pubic ramus fractures, are a common and painful condition in the elderly population. Despite this, there are few regional anaesthesia options available to effectively relieve pain in these fracture types and avoid potential side effects from opioid administration. This case report describes an elderly patient with a superior ramus fracture, who received effective pain relief with motor sparing, using a standard-volume point-of-care ultrasound-guided pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block performed in the emergency department. The standard-volume PENG block performed by an emergency clinician appears to be a safe, effective and feasible regional anaesthesia technique for superior pubic ramus fracture, with the additional benefit of motor sparing that may potentially facilitate earlier mobilisation and discharge.",,574
1815,35967838,Incorporating causality in energy consumption forecasting using deep neural networks.,"Forecasting energy demand has been a critical process in various decision support systems regarding consumption planning, distribution strategies, and energy policies. Traditionally, forecasting energy consumption or demand methods included trend analyses, regression, and auto-regression. With advancements in machine learning methods, algorithms such as support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and random forests became prevalent. In recent times, with an unprecedented improvement in computing capabilities, deep learning algorithms are increasingly used to forecast energy consumption/demand. In this contribution, a relatively novel approach is employed to use long-term memory. Weather data was used to forecast the energy consumption from three datasets, with an additional piece of information in the deep learning architecture. This additional information carries the causal relationships between the weather indicators and energy consumption. This architecture with the causal information is termed as entangled long short term memory. The results show that the entangled long short term memory outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning architecture (bidirectional long short term memory).

The case of Madrid.,"The transport and mobility sector is experiencing profound transformations. These changes are mainly due to: environmental awareness, the increase in the population of large urban areas and the size of cities, the aging of the population and the emergence of relevant technological innovations that have changed consumption habits, such as electronic commerce or the sharing economy. The introduction of new services such as Uber or Cabify is transforming urban and metropolitan mobility, which has to adapt to this new scenario and the very concept of mobility. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether ride-hailing platforms substitute or complement public transport to reduce accident rates, considering the two basic transport zones of Madrid: The Central Almond and the periphery. The data were collected from the 21 districts of Madrid for the period 2013-2019, and they were analyzed by a Random Effects Negative Binominal model. The results obtained in this study suggest that since the arrival of Uber and Cabify to the municipality of Madrid the number of fatalities and serious injuries in traffic accidents has been reduced. Traffic accidents on weekends and holidays, with at least one serious injury or death, have also been reduced. However, the number of minor injuries has increased in the central districts of Madrid. Overall, what was found in this study supports the hypothesis that these services replace the urban buses. However, these services improve the supply to users with greater difficulties to access taxis or public transport, constituting an alternative mode of transport for high-risk drivers. Therefore, such findings may be quite useful for policy makers to better define regulatory policies for these services.",,576
2301,35967130,Azacitidine-Induced Pneumonitis in a Patient With Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Hyperleukocytosis.,"Chemotherapy-related toxicity is a complex aspect of oncologic care. Pulmonary toxicity, in particular, poses a significant challenge, as it can have diverse presentations and can closely mimic other common complications of cancer treatment, such as infections. Azacitidine is an agent widely employed in high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. We present a case of azacitidine-induced pneumonitis, a rare adverse effect, in a 70-year-old patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and hyperleukocytosis. After discontinuation of the drug and introduction of steroids, the patient had complete resolution of symptoms, highlighting the importance of identifying and addressing chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis.",,577
1673,35968100,The humidity level matters during the desiccation of Norway spruce somatic embryos.,"In Norway spruce, as in many other conifers, the germination capacity of somatic embryos is strongly influenced by the desiccation phase inserted after maturation. The intensity of drying during desiccation eminently affected the formation of emblings (i.e., seedlings developed from somatic embryos). Compared to non-desiccated embryos, the germination capacity of embryos desiccated at 100% relative humidity was about three times higher, but the reduction of relative humidity to 95 and 90% had a negative effect on the subsequent embryo development. The water loss observed in these embryos did not lead to an increase in lipid peroxidation, as shown by malondialdehyde levels. Another metabolic pathway in plants that mediates a response to abiotic stresses is directed toward the biosynthesis of polyamines (PAs). The activities of PA biosynthetic enzymes increased steadily in embryos during desiccation at 100% relative humidity, whereas they decreased at lower humidity. The total content of free PAs in the embryos gradually decreased throughout desiccation. The increase in free putrescine (Put) and perchloric acid-insoluble Put conjugates was observed in embryos desiccated at lower humidity. These changes were accompanied to some extent by the transcription of the genes for the PA biosynthesis enzymes. Desiccation at 100% relative humidity increased the activity of the cell wall-modifying enzymes β-1,3-glucanases and chitinases; the activities of these enzymes were also significantly suppressed at reduced humidity. The same pattern was observed in the transcription of some β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase genes. Desiccation treatments triggered metabolic processes that responded to water availability, suggesting an active response of the embryo to the reduction in humidity. A positive effect was demonstrated only for desiccation at high relative humidity. Some of the physiological characteristics described can be used as markers of inappropriate relative humidity during somatic embryo desiccation.",,578
989,35974630,Computational indentation in highly cross-linked polymer networks.,"Indentation is a common experimental technique to study the mechanics of polymeric materials. The main advantage of using indentation is this provides a direct correlation between the microstructure and the small-scale mechanical response, which is otherwise difficult within the standard tensile testing. The majority of studies have investigated hydrogels, microgels, elastomers, and even soft biomaterials. However, a less investigated system is the indentation in highly cross-linked polymer (HCP) networks, where the complex network structure plays a key role in dictating their physical properties. In this work, we investigate the structure-property relationship in HCP networks using the computational indentation of a generic model. We establish a correlation between the local bond breaking, network rearrangement, and small-scale mechanics. The results are compared with the elastic-plastic deformation model. HCPs harden upon indentation.",,579
550,35978598,Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan Clinical Practice Guidelines for Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.,"This paper presents the first version of clinical practice guidelines for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) established by the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan. These guidelines consist of 1 treatment algorithm, 5 background statements, 16 clinical questions, and 1 clinical topic, including etiology, staging, pathology, diagnosis, and treatments. Globally, a high incidence of ICC has been reported in East and Southeast Asian countries, and the incidence has been gradually increasing in Japan and also in Western countries. Reported risk factors for ICC include cirrhosis, hepatitis B/C, alcohol consumption, diabetes, obesity, smoking, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and liver fluke infestation, as well as biliary diseases, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatolithiasis, congenital cholangiectasis, and Caroli disease. Chemical risk factors include thorium-232, 1,2-dichloropropane, and dichloromethane. CA19-9 and CEA are recommended as tumor markers for early detection and diagnostic of ICC. Abdominal ultrasonography, CT, and MRI are effective imaging modalities for diagnosing ICC. If bile duct invasion is suspected, imaging modalities for examining the bile ducts may be useful. In unresectable cases, tumor biopsy should be considered when deemed necessary for the differential diagnosis and drug therapy selection. The mainstay of treatment for patients with Child-Pugh class A or B liver function is surgical resection and drug therapy. If the patient has no regional lymph node metastasis (LNM) and has a single tumor, resection is the treatment of choice. If both regional LNM and multiple tumors are present, drug therapy is the first treatment of choice. If the patient has either regional LNM or multiple tumors, resection or drug therapy is selected, depending on the extent of metastasis or the number of tumors. If distant metastasis is present, drug therapy is the treatment of choice. Percutaneous ablation therapy may be considered for patients who are ineligible for surgical resection or drug therapy due to decreased hepatic functional reserve or comorbidities. For unresectable ICC without extrahepatic metastasis, stereotactic radiotherapy (tumor size ≤5 cm) or particle radiotherapy (no size restriction) may be considered. ICC is generally not indicated for liver transplantation, and palliative care is recommended for patients with Child-Pugh class C liver function.",,580
1411,35968491,"Assessing volatile organic compounds exposure and prostate-specific antigen: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001-2010.","Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a large group of chemicals widely used in people's daily routines. Increasing evidence revealed the VOCs' accumulating toxicity. However, the VOCs toxicity in male prostate has not been reported previously. Thus, we comprehensively evaluated the association between VOCs and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). A total of 2016 subjects were included in our study from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with VOCs, PSA, and other variables among U.S. average population. We constructed XGBoost Algorithm Model, Regression Model, and Generalized linear Model (GAM) to analyze the potential association. Stratified analysis was used to identify high-risk populations. XGBoost Algorithm model identified blood chloroform as the most critical variable in the PSA concentration. Regression analysis suggested that blood chloroform was a positive association with PSA, which showed that environmental chloroform exposure is an independent risk factor that may cause prostate gland changes [β, (95% CI), P = 0.007, (0.003, 0.011), 0.00019]. GAM observed the linear relationship between blood chloroform and PSA concentration. Meanwhile, blood chloroform linear correlated with water chloroform in the lower dose range, indicating that the absorption of water may be the primary origin of chloroform. Stratified associations analysis identified the high-risk group on the chloroform exposures. This study revealed that blood chloroform was positively and independently associated with total PSA level, suggesting that long-term environmental chloroform exposure may cause changes in the prostate gland.",,581
1514,35968372,Identification of BAG5 as a Potential Biomarker for Parkinson's Disease Patients With R492X PINK1 Mutation.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative, progressive nervous system disorder with an unknown cause. PINK1 [phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1] causative mutations R492X may cause autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism. In this study, we utilized patient samples and cell line system to investigate roles of Bcl2-associated athanogene 5 (BAG5) in PD patients with R492X PINK1 mutation. We show that the expression levels of BAG5 in the skin tissues from PD patients with R492X PINK1 mutation are markedly lower than those from the healthy control subjects in a small cohort of patients, which has not been recognized before. In addition, we demonstrate that BAG5 physically binds to R492X mutated PINK1 protein. Furthermore, we reveal that BAG5 promotes the degradation of R492X mutated PINK1 protein via ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathway, suggesting that decreased level of BAG5 may lead to R492X mutated PINK1 protein accumulation. These findings suggest that BAG5 may serve as an early detection biomarker for PD patients with R492X PINK1 mutation and provide important new insights on how BAG5 affects R492X mutated PINK1 protein, highlighting therapeutic targets for this disease.",,582
1507,35968380,"Pharmacotherapeutic management of insomnia and effects on sleep processes, neural plasticity, and brain systems modulating stress: A narrative review.","Insomnia is a stress-related sleep disorder, may favor a state of allostatic overload impairing brain neuroplasticity, stress immune and endocrine pathways, and may contribute to mental and physical disorders. In this framework, assessing and targeting insomnia is of importance. Since maladaptive neuroplasticity and allostatic overload are hypothesized to be related to GABAergic alterations, compounds targeting GABA may play a key role. Accordingly, the aim of this review was to discuss the effect of GABA A receptor agonists, short-medium acting hypnotic benzodiazepines and the so called Z-drugs, at a molecular level. Literature searches were done according to PRISMA guidelines. Several combinations of terms were used such as hypnotic benzodiazepines or brotizolam, or lormetazepam or temazepam or triazolam or zolpidem or zopiclone or zaleplon or eszopiclone and insomnia and effects on sleep and effect on brain plasticity and effect on stress system. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of existing literature, we ended up with a narrative review. Among short-medium acting compounds, triazolam has been the most studied and may regulate the stress system at central and peripheral levels. Among Z-drugs eszopiclone may regulate the stress system. Some compounds may produce more physiological sleep such as brotizolam, triazolam, and eszopiclone and probably may not impair sleep processes and related neural plasticity. In particular, triazolam, eszopiclone, and zaleplon studied in vivo in animal models did not alter neuroplasticity. Current models of insomnia may lead us to revise the way in which we use hypnotic compounds in clinical practice. Specifically, compounds should target sleep processes, the stress system, and sustain neural plasticity. In this framework, among the short/medium acting hypnotic benzodiazepines, triazolam has been the most studied compound while among the Z-drugs eszopiclone has demonstrated interesting effects. Both offer potential new insight for treating insomnia.",,583
1049,35974570,Numerical simulation of superparamagnetic nanoparticle motion in blood vessels for magnetic drug delivery.,"A numerical model is developed for the motion of superparamagnetic nanoparticles in a non-Newtonian blood flow under the influence of a magnetic field. The rheological properties of blood are modeled by the Carreau flow and viscosity, and the stochastic effects of Brownian motion and red blood cell collisions are considered. The model is validated with existing data and good agreement with experimental results is shown. The effectiveness of magnetic drug delivery in various blood vessels is assessed and found to be most successful in arterioles and capillaries. A range of magnetic field strengths are modeled using equations for both a bar magnet and a point dipole: it is shown that the bar magnet is effective at capturing nanoparticles in limited cases, while the point dipole is highly effective across a range of conditions. A parameter study is conducted to show the effects of changing the dipole moment, the distance from the magnet to the blood vessel, and the initial release point of the nanoparticles. The distance from the magnet to the blood vessel is shown to play a significant role in determining nanoparticle capture rate. The optimal initial release position is found to be located within the tumor radius in capillaries and arterioles to prevent rapid diffusion to the edges of the blood vessel prior to arriving at the tumor and near the edge of the magnet when a bar magnet is used.",,584
2128,35967390,Impaired sweating in patients with cholinergic urticaria is linked to low expression of acetylcholine receptor CHRM3 and acetylcholine esterase in sweat glands.,"Cholinergic urticaria (CholU), a frequent form of chronic inducible urticaria, is characterized by itchy wheals and angioedema in response to sweating. As of now, the rate and pathophysiological relevance of impaired sweating in patients with CholU are ill-defined. To assess in CholU patients the rate and extent of impaired sweating and its links to clinical and pathophysiological features of CholU. We assessed sweating in patients with CholU (n = 13) subjected to pulse-controlled ergometry (PCE) provocation testing. Pre- and post-PCE biopsies of lesional (L) and non-lesional (NL) skin were analyzed for the expression of acetylcholine receptor M3 (CHRM3) and acetylcholine esterase (ACh-E) by quantitative histomorphometry and compared to those of healthy control subjects (HCs). CholU patients were assessed for disease duration and severity as well as other clinical features. Of the 13 patients with CholU, 10 showed reduced sweating in response to PCE provocation, and 3 had severely reduced sweating. Reduced sweating was linked to long disease duration and high disease severity. CholU patients with impaired sweating responses showed reduced sweat gland epithelial expression of CHRM3 and ACh-E. Reduced sweating is common in CholU patients, especially in those with long-standing and severe disease, and it can be severe. Reduced expression of CHRM3 and ACh-E may be the cause or consequence of CholU in patients with impaired sweating, and this should be explored by further studies.",,585
1713,35968044,Influences of zero hour contracts and disability - Analysis of the 1970 British Cohort study.,"In recent decades, there has been a rise of the gig-economy where workers are given non-standard work agreements, and work is completed in an ad-hoc nature. It was believed people this would create greater access to employment for people with disability as there would no longer be a need to disclose disability and could 'pick and choose' work. Although, little research has been done on the health-outcomes of working in non-standard agreements compared to traditional employment, and in particular it's impact on disability. This study examines one particular non-standard workplace agreement, working under zero hour contracts as the main source of income as a predictor for disability at age 46 and how income levels effect this, while controlling for pre-existing illness at age 34. This study used existing data made available in the 1970 British Cohort study. Age 46 and Age 34 sweeps were used, including predictors for disability such as zero hour work, sex, and income, and binary multiple logistic regression was used. This study was able to demonstrate that there is an association between working under a zero hour contract as the main source of income and disability. Further, this study shows that this association is statistically significant at low incomes but not at high incomes. The relationship between zero hour work and disability presented in this study may suggest that zero hour work will produce a burden on healthcare systems and limit further economic outputs by limiting individual's capacity for work.",,586
1004,35974615,Effect of architecture disorder on the elastic response of two-dimensional lattice materials.,"We examine how disordering joint position influences the linear elastic behavior of lattice materials via numerical simulations in two-dimensional beam networks. Three distinct initial crystalline geometries are selected as representative of mechanically isotropic materials with low connectivity, mechanically isotropic materials with high connectivity, and mechanically anisotropic materials with intermediate connectivity. Introducing disorder generates spatial fluctuations in the elasticity tensor at the local (joint) scale. Proper coarse-graining reveals a well-defined continuum-level scale elasticity tensor. Increasing disorder aids in making initially anisotropic materials more isotropic. The disorder impact on the material stiffness depends on the lattice connectivity: Increasing the disorder softens lattices with high connectivity and stiffens those with low connectivity, without modifying the scaling between elastic modulus and density (linear scaling for high connectivity and cubic scaling for low connectivity). Introducing disorder in lattices with intermediate fixed connectivity reveals both scaling: the linear scaling occurs for low density, the cubic one at high density, and the crossover density increases with disorder. Contrary to classical formulations, this work demonstrates that connectivity is not the sole parameter governing elastic modulus scaling. It offers a promising route to access novel mechanical properties in lattice materials via disordering the architectures.",,587
2414,35966882,Severity of depressive but not anxiety symptoms impacts glucose metabolism among patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care.,"Data from primary care regarding the prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety, and their effect on glycemic control among people with diabetes is lacking in Hungary. The recently introduced Patient Health Record (PHR) requires family doctors to screen for depressive symptoms. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with type 2 diabetes in the general practice, and the relationship between these affective disorders and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level. We included 338 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes from six primary care practices in this cross-sectional study. A self-administered questionnaire (patient history, anthropometric, socioeconomic, laboratory parameters), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) were used. The mean age of the sample was 64.0 ± 11.5 (years ± SD), 61% of participants were female. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 21%, mainly moderate/severe symptoms (13%). Anxiety symptoms were more common (35%). We found significant univariate association between the depressive symptoms and HbA1c (p = 0.001), suicide attempt (p < 0.001), anxiety (p < 0.001), micro- and macrovascular complication (p = 0.028 and p < 0.001), education (p = 0.001) and place of residence (p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, however, only BDI score had significant (p = 0.03191) association with glycemic control. Among primary care patients with type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of depressive symptoms was less frequent than anxiety symptoms. More severe depressive symptoms were associated with worse glycemic control.",,588
1338,35969713,Effects of various cooling methods and drinking water temperatures on reproductive performance and behavior in heat stressed sows.,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of multiple cooling systems and different drinking water temperatures (DWT) on the performance of sows and their hair cortisol levels during heat stress. In this study, the effect of four different cooling systems: air conditioner (AC), cooling pad (CP), snout cooling (SC), and mist spray (MS), and two DWT, namely low water temperature (LWT) and high water temperature (HWT) on 48 multiparous sows (Landrace × Yorkshire; 242.84 ± 2.89 kg) was tested. The experiment is based on the use of eight replicas during a 21-days test. Different behaviors were recorded under different cooling treatments in sows. As a result, behaviors such as drinking, standing, and position change were found to be lower in sows under the AC and CP treatments than in those under the SC and MS treatments. Lying behavior increased under the AC and CP systems as compared with that under the SC and MS, systems. The average daily feed intake (ADFI) in sows and weight at weaning in piglets was higher under the AC, CP, and LWT treatments than under the SC, MS and HWT treatments. Sows subjected to SC and MS treatment showed higher hair cortisol levels, rectal temperature, and respiratory rate during lactation than those under AC and CP treatments. Hair cortisol levels, rectal temperature, and respiratory rate were also higher under the HWT than under the LWT treatment. As per the results of this study, the LWT has no significant effect on any of the behavioral factors. Taken together, the use of AC and CP cooling treatment is highly recommended to improve the behavior and to reduce the stress levels in lactating sows.",,589
734,35975144,An electrochemical modification strategy to fabricate NiFeCuPt polymetallic carbon matrices on nickel foam as stable electrocatalysts for water splitting.,"Electrochemical modification is a mild and economical way to prepare electrocatalytic materials with abundant active sites and high atom efficiency. In this work, a stable NiFeCuPt carbon matrix deposited on nickel foam (NFFeCuPt) was fabricated with an extremely low Pt load (∼28 μg cm-2) using one-step electrochemical co-deposition modification, and it serves as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting and achieves 100 mA cm-2 current density at a low cell voltage of 1.54 V in acidic solution and 1.63 V in alkaline solution, respectively. In addition, a novel electrolyte was developed to stabilize the catalyst under acidic conditions, which provides inspiration for the development of highly efficient, highly stable, and cost-effective ways to synthesize electrocatalysts.",,590
1577,35968309,Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on upper-limb and finger function in stroke patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising intervention for stroke rehabilitation. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of rTMS in restoring motor function. This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the current evidence of the effect of rTMS in improving upper limb function and fine motor recovery in stroke patients. Three online databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase) were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials. A total of 45 studies (combined n = 2064) were included. Random effects model was used for meta-analysis and effect size was reported as standardized mean difference (SMD). rTMS was effective in improving fine motor function in stroke patients (SMD, 0.38; 95% CI 0.19-0.58; P = 0). On subgroup analyses, for post-stroke functional improvement of the upper extremity, bilateral hemisphere stimulation was more effective than unilateral stimulation during the acute phase of stroke, and a regimen of 20 rTMS sessions produced greater improvement than <20 sessions. In the subacute phase of stroke, affected hemispheric stimulation with a 40-session rTMS regimen was superior to unaffected hemispheric stimulation or bilateral hemispheric stimulation with <40 sessions. Unaffected site stimulation with a 10-session rTMS regimen produced significant improvement in the chronic phase compared to affected side stimulation and bilateral stimulation with >10 rTMS sessions. For the rTMS stimulation method, both TBS and rTMS were found to be significantly more effective in the acute phase of stroke, but TBS was more effective than rTMS. However, rTMS was found to be more effective than TBS stimulation in patients in the subacute and chronic phases of stroke. rTMS significantly improved upper limb and fine function in the short term (0-1-month post-intervention) and medium term (2-5 months), but not for upper limb function in the long term (6 months+). The results should be interpreted with caution due to significant heterogeneity. This updated meta-analysis provides robust evidence of the efficacy of rTMS treatment in improving upper extremity and fine function during various phases of stroke. https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2022-5-0121/, identifier: INPLASY202250121.",,591
183,35982900,The m6A-induced lncRNA CASC8 promotes proliferation and chemoresistance via upregulation of hnRNPL in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are dysregulated in many cancers. Here, we identified the molecular mechanisms of lncRNA Cancer Susceptibility Candidate 8 (CASC8) in promoting the malignancy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). CASC8 was highly overexpressed in ESCC tissues and upregulation of CASC8 predicted poor prognosis in ESCC patients. Moreover, CASC8 decreased the cisplatin sensitivity of ESCC cells and promoted ESCC tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, CASC8 interacted with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNPL) and inhibited its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thus stabilizing hnRNPL protein levels and activating the Bcl2/caspase3 pathway. Additionally, AlkB Homolog 5, RNA demethylase (ALKBH5)-mediated m6A demethylation stabilized the CASC8 transcript, resulting in CASC8 upregulation. Taken together, these findings identified an oncogenic function of CASC8 in the progression of ESCC, which suggest that CASC8 might become a potential prognostic biomarker in ESCC.",,592
1823,35967817,Effect of different packaging methods on the free amino acid profiles of the deep-water rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) during frozen storage.,"The composition of free amino acids (FAAs) in seafood products contributes to characterizing their flavor, as well as freshness and quality during storage. Deep-water rose shrimps (Parapenaues longirostris, Lucas, 1846) (DWRS) are being increasingly harvested in the Mediterranean Sea, and the captured specimens are quickly frozen onboard fishing trawlers to preserve freshness and post-harvest quality. Here, we quantified the FAA profiles of DWRS packaged using five methods: (1) 100% N2; (2) vacuum; (3) 50% N2 + 50% CO2; (4) commercial anhydrous sodium sulfite; and (5) air (control). All samples were quickly frozen at -35°C and stored for 12 months at -18°C. Arginine (661 mg/100 g), proline (538 mg/100 g), and glycine (424 mg/100 g) were the most abundant FAAs, whereas the least abundant were tyrosine (67 mg/100 g), histidine (58 mg/100 g), and aspartic acid (34 mg/100 g). FAAs in all samples gradually (and significantly) increased in the first 6 to 8 months of storage, and then significantly decreased. The sodium sulfite treatment (Method 4) kept the initial FAA contents lower than the other treatments, due to the strong antioxidant action of sulfite agents. Interestingly, similar results were obtained for vacuum packaging (Method 2). Thus, combining frozen storage with vacuum packaging represents an alternative approach to chemical additives in shrimp/prawn processing to meet the increasing demand for high-quality seafood products with long shelf-life.",,593
1578,35968307,Short Report of Longitudinal CGRP-Measurements in Migraineurs During a Hypoxic Challenge.,"Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of migraine and is therefore considered a potential biomarker for primary headache disorders. The challenge remaining is establishing standardized protocols for its assessment in various extracellular compartments and identifying pathological situations associated with an increase in CGRP. We performed longitudinal measurements of CGRP plasma levels in 30 volunteers with the diagnosis of episodic migraine with and without aura under controlled circumstances during an induced migraine attack under a hypoxic challenge. Blood samples were collected from a cubital vein and CGRP plasma levels measured using ELISA. CGRP levels varied significantly between the subjects at baseline (15.48-1,889.31 pg/ml) but were neither associated with socio-demographic data nor with headache/migraine frequency or intensity collected before hypoxic exposure. CGRP levels during hypoxia fluctuated around baseline and increased with prolonged hypoxia but did not differ significantly in subjects with migraine or headache compared to those without. However, subjects experiencing migraine without aura showed significantly higher levels than those with aura. Ictal CGRP levels were increased in females, in subjects with a negative family history regarding headaches, in those older than 30 years of age or with a recent headache attack before the experiment (p < 0.05). CGRP plasma levels seem to be highly variable even at baseline in migraine patients and increased during hypoxic challenge and migraine attacks. This is the first in human longitudinal measurement of peripheral CGRP levels during induced migraine attacks using a highly standardized protocol.",,594
2079,35967439,B cells in the balance: Offsetting self-reactivity avoidance with protection against foreign.,"Antibodies are theoretically limitless in their diversity and specificity to foreign antigens; however they are constrained by the need to avoid binding to self. Germinal centers (GC) allow diversification and maturation of the antibody response towards the foreign antigen. While self-tolerance mechanisms controlling self-reactivity during B cell maturation are well recognized, the mechanisms by which GCs balance self-tolerance and foreign binding especially in the face of cross-reactivity between self and foreign, remain much less well defined. In this review we explore the extent to which GC self-tolerance restricts affinity maturation. We present studies suggesting that the outcome is situationally dependent, affected by affinity and avidity to self-antigen, and the extent to which self-binding and foreign-binding are interdependent. While auto-reactive GC B cells can mutate away from self while maturing towards the foreign antigen, if no mutational trajectories allow for self-reactive redemption, self-tolerance prevails and GC responses to the foreign pathogen are restricted, except when self-tolerance checkpoints are relaxed. Finally, we consider whether polyreactivity is subject to the same level of restriction in GC responses, especially if polyreactivity is linked to an increase in foreign protection, as occurs in certain broadly neutralizing antibodies. Overall, the outcomes for GC B cells that bind self-antigen can range from redemption, transient relaxation in self-tolerance or restriction of the antibody response to the foreign pathogen.",,595
530,35978722,Serum IgG levels to Epstein-Barr and measles viruses in patients with multiple sclerosis during natalizumab and interferon beta treatment.,"Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) demonstrate higher seroprevalence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and increased anti-EBV IgG levels in serum compared with healthy controls. Intrathecal antibody production to measles virus (MeV) is a common finding in patients with MS. To measure serum IgG reactivity to EBV glycoprotein 350 (gp350) and MeV nucleocapsid protein (NCORE) in patients with MS and healthy controls and to determine if reactivity changed in patients during interferon beta (IFNβ) and/or natalizumab (NAT) treatment. A secondary aim was to determine the seroprevalence of EBV in patients and controls. Patients with MS (n=728) were included from the Swedish pharmacovigilance study for NAT. Paired serum samples from 714 patients drawn before and during NAT treatment and paired samples from 170 patients during prior IFNβ treatment were analysed. In total, 156 patients were included in both groups. Samples from 144 matched blood donors served as controls. Indirect ELISA was applied using recombinant EBVgp350 and MeV NCORE as antigens. EBVgp350 IgG seronegative samples were also analysed using EBV nuclear antigen 1 and viral capsid antigen (VCA). Patients with MS showed higher serum levels of anti-EBVgp350 and anti-MeV NCORE IgG compared with controls. During NAT treatment, the levels of anti-EBVgp350 and anti-MeV NCORE IgG declined, compared with the relatively stable levels noted during prior IFNβ treatment. Ten patients failed to demonstrate anti-EBVgp350 IgG but did show detectable anti-VCA IgG, indicating EBV seropositivity. In contrast, 10/144 controls were EBV seronegative. Treatment with NAT, which is considered a selective immunosuppressive agent with a compartmentalised effect on the central nervous system, appeared to be associated with a moderate decrease in circulating IgG levels to EBVgp350 and MeV NCORE. All patients with MS were EBV IgG seropositive, supporting the potential role of EBV in the pathogenesis of MS.",,596
792,35975045,Study on heterogeneous OH oxidation of 3-methyltetraol sulfate in the atmosphere under high NO conditions.,"Organosulfates (OSs), also known as organic sulfate esters, are ubiquitous in atmospheric particles and used as secondary organic aerosol (SOA) markers. However, the chemical transformation mechanism of these OSs remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the heterogeneous OH oxidation of 3-methyltetraol sulfate (3-MTS), which is one of the most abundant particulate organosulfates, by using quantum chemical and kinetic calculations. 3-MTS can easily undergo abstraction reaction with OH radicals, and the reaction rate constant is about 7.87 × 10-12 cm3 per molecule per s. The generated HCOOH, CH3COOH, HCHO, CH3CHO and 2-methyl-2,3-dihydroxypropionic acid are low-volatility species with increased water solubility, which are the main components of SOA. In addition, the OH radicals obtained from the reaction can continue to promote the oxidation reaction. The results of this study provide insights into the heterogeneous OH reactivity of other organosulfates in atmospheric aerosols, and it also provides a new understanding of the conversion of sulfur (S) between its organic and inorganic forms during the heterogeneous OH oxidation of organic sulfates.",,597
1337,35969921,Nuclease resistance and protein recognition properties of DNA and hybrid PNA-DNA four-way junctions.,"Nucleic acids possess unique biochemical features that make them ideal candidates to inhibit difficult to target proteins. The limited stability of nucleic acids in vivo presents a major obstacle to their development as drugs. Here, immobile four-way junctions (4WJs) are used to target the DNA-binding cytokine, High Mobility Group B1. Hybrid 4WJs composed of DNA and peptide nucleic acids (PNA) are investigated. PNA possess enhanced nuclease stability vs. DNA. 4WJs are incubated with Exonuclease III and DNase I. The nuclease assays show that 4WJs containing multiple PNAs possess significantly higher stability. Circular dichroism assays are used to probe the groove topology of 4WJs with the minor groove binder, DAPI. The CD data indicates that multi-PNA 4WJs possess altered minor groove dimensions that reduces DAPI binding affinity. Logic suggests that the minor groove of multi-PNA hybrids possess significant perturbations to the topology and local electrostatic environment that prevents proper binding/recognition by nucleases and thus enhances stability.",,598
2337,35967040,Green Route Synthesis and Characterization Techniques of Silver Nanoparticles and Their Biological Adeptness.,"The development of the most reliable and green techniques for nanoparticle synthesis is an emerging step in the area of green nanotechnology. Many conventional approaches used for nanoparticle (NP) synthesis are expensive, deadly, and nonenvironmental. In this new era of nanotechnology, to overcome such concerns, natural sources which work as capping and reducing agents, including bacteria, fungi, biopolymers, and plants, are suitable candidates for synthesizing AgNPs. The surface morphology and applications of AgNPs are significantly pretentious to the experimental conditions by which they are synthesized. Available scattered information on the synthesis of AgNPs comprises the influence of altered constraints and characterization methods such as FTIR, UV-vis, DLS, SEM, TEM, XRD, EDX, etc. and their properties and applications. This review focuses on all the above-mentioned natural sources that have been used for AgNP synthesis recently. The green routes to synthesize AgNPs have established effective applications in various areas, including biosensors, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cancer treatment, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), antimicrobial agents, drug delivery, gene therapy, DNA analysis, etc. The existing boundaries and prospects for metal nanoparticle synthesis by the green route are also discussed herein.",,599
2149,35967369,Mobilization of systemic CCL4 following HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis in young men in Africa.,"HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) relies on inhibition of HIV-1 replication steps. To understand how PrEP modulates the immunological environment, we derived the plasma proteomic profile of men receiving emtricitabine-tenofovir (FTC-TDF) or emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide (FTC-TAF) during the CHAPS trial in South Africa and Uganda (NCT03986970). The CHAPS trial randomized 144 participants to one control and 8 PrEP arms, differing by drug type, number of PrEP doses and timing from final PrEP dose to sampling. Blood was collected pre- and post-PrEP. The inflammatory profile of plasma samples was analyzed using Olink (N=92 proteins) and Luminex (N=33) and associated with plasma drug concentrations using mass spectrometry. The proteins whose levels changed most significantly from pre- to post-PrEP were CCL4, CCL3 and TNF-α; CCL4 was the key discriminator between pre- and post-PrEP samples. CCL4 and CCL3 levels were significantly increased in post-PrEP samples compared to control specimens. CCL4 was significantly correlated with FTC drug levels in plasma. Production of inflammatory chemokines CCL4 and CCL3 in response to short-term PrEP indicates the mobilization of ligands which potentially block virus attachment to CCR5 HIV-1 co-receptor. The significant correlation between CCL4 and FTC levels suggests that CCL4 increase is modulated as an inflammatory response to PrEP.",,600
766,35975071,Study on the growth kinetics of methane hydrate in pure water system containing ZIF-8.,"The hydrate formation rate is the key to the implementation of solid gas storage and transportation technology by the hydrate method. As a MOF material with strong hydrothermal stability, ZIF-8 has been proved to play a significant role in promoting the nucleation and growth of hydrate. However, the growth kinetics promotion mechanism and growth law of methane hydrate in the ZIF-8 promoter system have not been clarified at present. Therefore, the growth kinetics experiment of methane hydrate in the ZIF-8 promoter system was carried out in a high-pressure visualization reactor to systematically study the effects of the ZIF-8 concentration, undercooling degree, and pressure on the growth law of methane hydrate. The experimental results showed that: (1) the concentration of ZIF-8 had a significant shortening effect on the induction period of methane hydrate. With the increase in the ZIF-8 concentration, the induction time of methane hydrate was shortened from 5.85 h to 0.85 h. The methane gas consumption showed a gradually increasing trend at first, and then with the reaction going on, a dense hydrate film was formed at the gas-liquid interface, which increased the mass transfer resistance, resulting in the increase in the methane gas consumption gradually becoming stable. There were four stages in the growth process of hydrate, namely rapid formation, slow formation, secondary formation, and end formation and the optimal dosage of ZIF-8 promoter exists, and the optimal critical specific content was 0.02 mg mL-1. (2) With the increase of undercooling, the induction time of methane hydrate decreased significantly, and the increase in the methane consumption also showed an increasing trend at first and then decreased. (3) With the increase of the system pressure to 7 MPa, the induction time of methane hydrate decreased from 1.02 h at 6 MPa to 0.2 h at 7 MPa, and the decrease rate was 80.8%, which was mainly due to the presence of OPEN GATE in the ZIF-8 accelerator. With the increase of the system pressure, the pore opening of the ZIF-8 material increased, the adsorption of methane increased, and the nucleation and growth of methane hydrate were promoted.",,601
1651,35968123,Motif models proposing independent and interdependent impacts of nucleotides are related to high and low affinity transcription factor binding sites in Arabidopsis.,"Position weight matrix (PWM) is the traditional motif model representing the transcription factor (TF) binding sites. It proposes that the positions contribute independently to TFs binding affinity, although this hypothesis does not fit the data perfectly. This explains why PWM hits are missing in a substantial fraction of ChIP-seq peaks. To study various modes of the direct binding of plant TFs, we compiled the benchmark collection of 111 ChIP-seq datasets for Arabidopsis thaliana, and applied the traditional PWM, and two alternative motif models BaMM and SiteGA, proposing the dependencies of the positions. The variation in the stringency of the recognition thresholds for the models proposed that the hits of PWM, BaMM, and SiteGA models are associated with the sites of high/medium, any, and low affinity, respectively. At the medium recognition threshold, about 60% of ChIP-seq peaks contain PWM hits consisting of conserved core consensuses, while BaMM and SiteGA provide hits for an additional 15% of peaks in which a weaker core consensus is compensated through intra-motif dependencies. The presence/absence of these dependencies in the motifs of alternative/traditional models was confirmed by the dependency logo DepLogo visualizing the position-wise partitioning of the alignments of predicted sites. We exemplify the detailed analysis of ChIP-seq profiles for plant TFs CCA1, MYC2, and SEP3. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that among the three motif models, the SiteGA had the highest portions of genes with the significantly enriched GO terms among all predicted genes. We showed that both alternative motif models provide for traditional PWM greater extensions in predicted sites for TFs MYC2/SEP3 with condition/tissue specific functions, compared to those for TF CCA1 with housekeeping functions. Overall, the combined application of standard and alternative motif models is beneficial to detect various modes of the direct TF-DNA interactions in the maximal portion of ChIP-seq loci.",,602
516,35978743,Sporadic Burkitt Lymphoma of the Thoracic and Lumbar Spinal Canal in an Adult: Oncogenicity and a Literature Review.,"Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive form of lymphoma that occurs due to translocation of the c-myc proto-oncogene on chromosome 8. BL is characterized by three distinct groups: African/endemic variant, immunosuppressive variant, or sporadic variant. Most cases of the sporadic variant occur in patients less than 40 years of age with a median age of 30 at diagnosis and are primarily seen in Caucasians. An immunocompetent 69-year-old male presented with subacute onset weakness in the lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed a mass in the right paraspinal musculature with epidural extension, neural foraminal narrowing, and severe spinal canal stenosis in L2-L5. MRI of the thoracic spine revealed significant T5-T6 cord compression due to metastatic masses. Further diagnostic imaging revealed diffuse lymphadenopathy within the mediastinum and abdomen. Subsequently, the patient underwent a core needle biopsy of the left axillary lymph node, which revealed cluster of differentiation 20 and 10 (CD20 and CD10), c-myc, and B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6) positive lymphoid cells. A diagnosis of BL was made. The patient was treated with oral steroids and received one round of radiation therapy. The patient opted to forgo any antitumor treatment and was discharged to hospice. Primary lymphomas of the central nervous system (CNS) account for <5% of all CNS tumors. Approximately 5-10% of CNS lymphomas are recorded as BL, with the majority classified as high-grade B-cell lymphomas. Paraspinal involvement with BL is rare and not commonly seen in the sporadic variant.",,603
1717,35968035,Integration of machine learning with complex industrial mining systems for reduced energy consumption.,"The deep-level mining industry is experiencing narrowing profit margins due to increasing operating costs and decreasing production. The industry is known for its lack of dynamic control across complex integrated systems running deep underground, making IoT technologies difficult to implement. An important integrated system in a typical underground mine is the refrigeration-ventilation system. In practice, the two systems are still controlled independently, often due to a lack of continuous measurements. However, their integrated effects ultimately affect energy usage and production. This study develops and compares various machine learning prediction techniques to predict the integrated behavior of a key component operating on the boundary of the refrigeration-ventilation system, while also addressing the lack of continuous measurements. The component lacks sensors and the developed industrial machine learning models negate the effect thereof using integrated control. The predictive models are compared based on accuracy, prediction time, as well as the amount of data required to obtain the required level of accuracy. The Support Vector Machines method achieved the lowest average error (1.97%), but the Artificial Neural Network method is more robust (with a maximum percentage error of 12.90%). A potential energy saving of 215 kW or 2.9% of the ventilation and refrigeration system, equivalent to R1.33-million per annum ($82 900) is achievable using the Support Vector Machines method.",,604
2432,35966864,Serial negative response after standard and third (Booster) dose of COVID-19 inactivated vaccine is associated with low vitamin D levels in patients with solid cancers.,"The response is poorly understood to the third dose in patients with cancer who failed the standard dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (CoronaVac). We aim to assess the immune response to the third dose and identify whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with serial serologic failure in patients with cancer. Solid cancer patients (SCP-N) and healthy controls (HCs) who were seronegative after the standard-dose vaccines in our previous study were prospectively recruited, from October 2021 to February 2022, to receive the third dose vaccines and anti-SARS-CoV-2S antibodies were measured. SCP-N who failed the third dose (serial seronegative group, SSG) were matched by propensity scores with the historical standard-dose positive cancer patient group (robust response group, RRG). An exploratory analysis was carried out to validate the role of vitamin D on the serology response. The multi-center study recruited 97 SCP-N with 279 positive controls as RRG and 82 negative controls as HC group. The seroconversion rate after third-dose vaccination was higher in SCP-N than in HC (70.6% vs. 29.4%, p < 0.01). The matched comparison showed that patients in SSG had a significantly lower level of vitamin D and consumption rate than RRG or RRG-B (RRG with third-dose positive) (all p < 0.01). None had serious (over grade II) adverse events after the third dose. Solid cancer patients with second-dose vaccine failure may have a relatively poor humoral response to the third dose of COVID-19 vaccines as compared with the seronegative HC group. The consecutively poor humoral response could be associated with poor vitamin D levels and intake. Vitamin D status and cancer-related immune compromise may jointly affect the humoral response following booster vaccination.",,605
1463,35968435,Hepatitis C virus risk among young people who inject drugs.,"Injection drug use (IDU) is the leading risk factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission in the U.S. While the general risk factors for HCV transmission are known, there is limited work on how these factors interact and impact young people who inject drugs (YPWID). Project data were drawn from a study of 539 New York City (NYC) residents ages 18-29 who were recruited via Respondent-Driven Sampling and, reported past-month non-medical use of prescription opioids and/or heroin. Analyses are based on a subsample of 337 (62%) who reported injecting any drug in the past 12 months. All variables were assessed via self-report, except HCV status, which was established via rapid antibody testing. Integrating the observed statistical associations with extant literature on HCV risk, we also developed a qualitative system dynamics (SD) model to use as a supplemental data visualization tool to explore plausible pathways and interactions among key risk and protective factors for HCV. Results showed a 31% HCV antibody prevalence with an overall incidence of 10 per 100 person-years. HCV status was independently correlated with having shared cookers with two or more people (AOR = 2.17); injected drugs 4-6 years (AOR = 2.49) and 7 or more years (AOR = 4.95); lifetime homelessness (AOR = 2.52); and having been incarcerated two or more times (AOR = 1.99). These outcomes along with the extant literature on HCV risk were used to develop the qualitative SD model, which describes a causal hypothesis around non-linearities and feedback loop structures underlying the spread of HCV among YPWID. Despite ongoing harm reduction efforts, close to a third of YPWID in the community sample have been exposed to HCV, have risks for injection drug use, and face challenges with structural factors that may be preventing adequate intervention. The qualitative SD model explores these issues and contributes to a better understanding of how these various risk factors interact and what policies could potentially be effective in reducing HCV infections.",,606
1197,35972059,Diagnostic accuracy and validity of image-assisted versus face-to-face wound assessments for the management of chronic wounds: a systematic review protocol.,"This review aims to evaluate the accuracy and validity of diagnostic decisions derived from image-assisted wound assessments compared with face-to-face consultations for chronic wound care. Images are often used within the inpatient, outpatient, and community settings to facilitate interdisciplinary transfer of care, objective wound assessments, and accurate treatment decisions. An ever-changing and ever-improving selection of image-capturing devices have been created and studied in recent years. To improve future chronic wound care programs, there is a need to explore how accurately clinicians can diagnose specific wound characteristics using these images, especially when these devices are operated in the clinical setting. Peer-reviewed studies and unpublished/gray literature comparing image-assisted with face-to-face modalities for chronic wound care will be included. Chronic wounds include, but are not limited to, diabetic foot ulcers, ischemic lower limb ulcers, and pressure ulcers. Studies will be excluded if they examine acute wounds or if the reference standard is not face-to-face assessment. A comprehensive search of multiple databases and gray literature sources (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Health Source, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ProQuest Central) will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Literature published from 2000 onward will be retrieved. Two reviewers will independently screen and appraise the articles. Data extraction and synthesis will be performed based on the JBI methodology for the conduct of diagnostic test accuracy systematic review. PROSPERO CRD42021265679.",,607
1800,35967855,"Functional comparison of anti-restriction and anti-methylation activities of ArdA, KlcA, and KlcAHS from Klebsiella pneumoniae.","Anti-restriction proteins are typically encoded by plasmids, conjugative transposons, or phages to improve their chances of entering a new bacterial host with a type I DNA restriction and modification (RM) system. The invading DNA is normally destroyed by the RM system. The anti-restriction proteins ArdA, KlcA, and their homologues are usually encoded on plasmid of carbapenemase-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. We found that the plasmid sequence and restriction proteins affected horizontal gene transfer, and confirmed the anti-restriction and anti-methylation activities of ArdA and KlcA during transformation and transduction. Among the three anti-restriction proteins, ArdA shows stronger anti-restriction and anti-methylation effects, and KlcAHS was weaker. KlcA shows anti-methylation only during transformation. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the clinical dissemination of K. pneumoniae and other clinically resistant strains from the perspective of restrictive and anti-restrictive systems will provide basic theoretical support for the prevention and control of multidrug-resistant bacteria, and new strategies for delaying or even controlling the clinical dissemination of resistant strains in the future.",,608
951,35974730,Brittle fracture studied by ultra-high-speed synchrotron X-ray diffraction imaging.,"In situ investigations of cracks propagating at up to 2.5 km s-1 along an (001) plane of a silicon single crystal are reported, using X-ray diffraction megahertz imaging with intense and time-structured synchrotron radiation. The studied system is based on the Smart Cut process, where a buried layer in a material (typically Si) is weakened by microcracks and then used to drive a macroscopic crack (10-1 m) in a plane parallel to the surface with minimal deviation (10-9 m). A direct confirmation that the shape of the crack front is not affected by the distribution of the microcracks is provided. Instantaneous crack velocities over the centimetre-wide field of view were measured and showed an effect of local heating by the X-ray beam. The post-crack movements of the separated wafer parts could also be observed and explained using pneumatics and elasticity. A comprehensive view of controlled fracture propagation in a crystalline material is provided, paving the way for the in situ measurement of ultra-fast strain field propagation.",,609
2000,35967587,Identification of TAZ as the essential molecular switch in orchestrating SCLC phenotypic transition and metastasis.,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant cancer characterized by high metastasis. However, the exact cell type contributing to metastasis remains elusive. Using a Rb1 L/L /Trp53 L/L mouse model, we identify the NCAMhiCD44lo/- subpopulation as the SCLC metastasizing cell (SMC), which is progressively transitioned from the non-metastasizing NCAMloCD44hi cell (non-SMC). Integrative chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling studies reveal the important role of the SWI/SNF complex, and knockout of its central component, Brg1, significantly inhibits such phenotypic transition and metastasis. Mechanistically, TAZ is silenced by the SWI/SNF complex during SCLC malignant progression, and its knockdown promotes SMC transition and metastasis. Importantly, ectopic TAZ expression reversely drives SMC-to-non-SMC transition and alleviates metastasis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses identify SMC as the dominant subpopulation in human SCLC metastasis, and immunostaining data show a positive correlation between TAZ and patient prognosis. These data uncover high SCLC plasticity and identify TAZ as the key molecular switch in orchestrating SCLC phenotypic transition and metastasis.",,610
12,35985228,Two smart coumarin-based fluorescent probes with AIE effect for sensing ClO- and imaging in living cells.,"It's worth noting that detect effective methods for tracking ClO- could help us uncover the function of ClO- in living systems. Here, two coumarin-based probes, named (E)-3-(1-hydrazonoethyl)-2H-chromen-2-one (1A) and 3-((E)-1-(((E)-(2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methylene)-hydrazono)ethyl)- 2H-chromen-2-one (1B) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect in Tris-HCl (pH = 7.2) buffer solution were synthesized and used for sensing ClO- selectivity. 1A and 1B responded to ClO- through the oxidation hydrolysis effect. The mechanism was further verified by HR-MS and DFT calculation. Cell imaging indicated that 1A and 1B were good membrane permeability with low toxicity to HEK293T, and expected to be used to detect ClO- in cells.",,611
1118,35974501,Learning through atypical phase transitions in overparameterized neural networks.,"Current deep neural networks are highly overparameterized (up to billions of connection weights) and nonlinear. Yet they can fit data almost perfectly through variants of gradient descent algorithms and achieve unexpected levels of prediction accuracy without overfitting. These are formidable results that defy predictions of statistical learning and pose conceptual challenges for nonconvex optimization. In this paper, we use methods from statistical physics of disordered systems to analytically study the computational fallout of overparameterization in nonconvex binary neural network models, trained on data generated from a structurally simpler but hidden network. As the number of connection weights increases, we follow the changes of the geometrical structure of different minima of the error loss function and relate them to learning and generalization performance. A first transition happens at the so-called interpolation point, when solutions begin to exist (perfect fitting becomes possible). This transition reflects the properties of typical solutions, which however are in sharp minima and hard to sample. After a gap, a second transition occurs, with the discontinuous appearance of a different kind of atypical structures: wide regions of the weight space that are particularly solution dense and have good generalization properties. The two kinds of solutions coexist, with the typical ones being exponentially more numerous, but empirically we find that efficient algorithms sample the atypical, rare ones. This suggests that the atypical phase transition is the relevant one for learning. The results of numerical tests with realistic networks on observables suggested by the theory are consistent with this scenario.",,612

Scrambler Therapy is a superficial form of neuromodulation that replaces the pain signal with non-pain information that is approved for chronic and neuropathic pain, with few side effects. We report here two cases of paraneoplastic neuropathy, one with additional pruritis, that both responded satisfactorily to Scrambler Therapy with no side effects.",,613
2455,35966837,Deep autoencoder-powered pattern identification of sleep disturbance using multi-site cross-sectional survey data.,"Pattern identification (PI) is a diagnostic method used in Traditional East Asian medicine (TEAM) to select appropriate and personalized acupuncture points and herbal medicines for individual patients. Developing a reproducible PI model using clinical information is important as it would reflect the actual clinical setting and improve the effectiveness of TEAM treatment. In this paper, we suggest a novel deep learning-based PI model with feature extraction using a deep autoencoder and k-means clustering through a cross-sectional study of sleep disturbance patient data. The data were obtained from an anonymous electronic survey in the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) members from August 16, 2021, to September 20, 2021. The survey instrument consisted of six sections: demographics, medical history, military duty, sleep-related assessments (Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Berlin questionnaire, and sleeping environment), diet/nutrition-related assessments [dietary habit survey questionnaire and nutrition quotient (NQ)], and gastrointestinal-related assessments [gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) and Bristol stool scale]. Principal component analysis (PCA) and a deep autoencoder were used to extract features, which were then clustered using the k-means clustering method. The Calinski-Harabasz index, silhouette coefficient, and within-cluster sum of squares were used for internal cluster validation and the final PSQI, Berlin questionnaire, GSRS, and NQ scores were used for external cluster validation. One-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test and chi-squared test were used for between-cluster comparisons. Among 4,869 survey responders, 2,579 patients with sleep disturbances were obtained after filtering using a PSQI score of >5. When comparing clustering performance using raw data and extracted features by PCA and the deep autoencoder, the best feature extraction method for clustering was the deep autoencoder (16 nodes for the first and third hidden layers, and two nodes for the second hidden layer). Our model could cluster three different PI types because the optimal number of clusters was determined to be three via the elbow method. After external cluster validation, three PI types were differentiated by changes in sleep quality, dietary habits, and concomitant gastrointestinal symptoms. This model may be applied to the development of artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support systems through electronic medical records and clinical trial protocols for evaluating the effectiveness of TEAM treatment.",,614
1107,35974512,Internal-stress-induced solid-solid transition involving orientational domains of anisotropic particles.,"Colloidal particles with anisotropic interaction, such as Janus particles, are important model systems for anisotropic atoms and molecules. Janus particles in a single crystal can rotate collectively and form polycrystalline orientational domains as the temperature increases, while the lattice structure in the translational degree of freedom is preserved. Such an unusual solid-solid transition preserves the long-range translational order but loses the orientational order, and its mechanism is unclear. We find that the transition is induced by internal strains and the orientation-position coupling plays an essential role in the transition. We explain the mechanism using the anisotropic elasticity theory and derive the transition condition and the directions of the domain boundaries by analyzing the strain energy and the stress. The results of the molecular dynamics simulation are consistent with the theoretical analysis. Such a transition mechanism can exist in other anisotropic particle systems.",,615
2017,35967569,"Vitamin D Status Among Children With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: A Multicenter Prospective, Non-randomized, Comparative Study.","Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by destructive and inflammatory damage to the joints. The aim in this study was to compare vitamin D levels between children and adolescents, 1-18 years of age, with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and a health control group of peers. We considered effects of endogenous, exogenous, and genetic factors on measured differences in vitamin D levels among children with JIA. Our findings are based on a study sample of 150 patients with various variants of JIA and 277 healthy children. The blood level of vitamin D was assessed by calcidiol level. The following factors were included in our analysis: age and sex; level of insolation in three regions of country (center, south, north); assessment of dietary intake of vitamin D; effect of prophylactic doses of cholecalciferol; a relationship between the TaqI, FokI, and BsmI polymorphisms of the VDR gene and serum 25(OH)D concentration. We identified a high frequency of low vitamin D among children with JIA, prevalence of 66%, with the medial level of vitamin D being within the range of insufficient vitamin D. We also show that the dietary intake of vitamin D by children with JIA is well below expected norms, and that prophylactic doses of vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol) at a dose of 500-1,000 IU/day and 1,500-2,000 IU/day do not meet the vitamin D needs of children with JIA. Of importance, we show that vitamin D levels among children with JIA are not affected by clinical therapies to manage the disease nor by the present of VDR genetic variants. Prophylactic administration of cholecalciferol and season of year play a determining role in the development of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency.",,616

Although several articles have described the non-respiratory effects of COVID-19 in the past two years, there are few reports of COVID-19 associated with thyroiditis. We present a case of a middle-aged female patient with positive COVID-19 PCR associated with acute pulmonary embolism and thyroiditis. Three months ago, her baseline thyroid profile was normal.

992,35974627,Post-thermalization via information spreading in open quantum systems.,"Thermalization in open systems coupled to macroscopic environments is usually analyzed from the perspective of relaxation of the reduced state of the system to the equilibrium state. Less emphasis is given to the change of the state of the bath. However, as previously shown for some specific models, during the thermalization the environment may undergo a nontrivial dynamics, indicated by the the change of its von Neumann entropy, at timescales even longer than the relaxation time of the system; here such a behavior is called post-thermalization. We provide a more detailed analysis of this phenomenon by simulating the full dynamics of a variety of systems together with their environment. In particular, the post-thermalization is qualitatively explained as a result of reconversion of the initially built up correlation between the system and the bath into the correlation between the degrees of freedom in the environment. We also present exemplary systems in which such a reconversion is suppressed due to non-Markovian dynamics or the presence of interactions.",,618
2284,35967147,A Rare Case of Chest Wall Abscess by Nocardia in a Patient With Sarcoidosis.,"Nocardia is a rare gram-positive pathogen reported to cause infections in immunocompromised individuals. It usually involves the lungs but may also lead to abscess formation; cases of disseminated nocardiosis have also been reported. We are presenting a case of an Asian male who had sarcoidosis with pulmonary and skin involvement. The patient was on long-term immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids with good control of the disease. He developed a fever, weight loss, and right-sided chest pain. CT of the chest showed new nodular infiltrates. Worsening of sarcoidosis was suspected; the corticosteroid dose was increased and methotrexate was started. There was no favorable response to the increase in immunosuppressive therapy. Weight loss was followed by worsening shortness of breath and fluctuant swelling in the right lateral half of the chest. Bronchoalveolar lavage was done to rule out tuberculosis but it did not show any organism's growth. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration from the abscess was done that showed growth of Nocardia species. Therapeutic dose co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole) was started as first-line therapy after confirming the organism's drug susceptibility pattern along with needle aspiration of the collection on the chest wall. Immunosuppressive agents were stopped. There was a good response to treatment with resolution of symptoms within two months. However, complete radiological recovery took 10 months. Co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole) therapy continued for two months after radiological recovery. Physicians, therefore, should keep Nocardia as an important differential diagnosis while treating the immunosuppressed population.",,619
2028,35967558,Lung ultrasound in young children with neurological impairment: A proposed integrative clinical tool for deaeration-detection related to feeding.,"Infants and children with neurological impairment, such as cerebral palsy (CP), often experience abnormal ingestion functions, including oropharyngeal dysphagia and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which led to aspiration-related respiratory complications, morbidity, hospitalization, or death. There is a lack of evidence-based, repeatable, infant-friendly instrumental procedures to assess aspiration-risk in infants with CP or other neurological disorders, with also a lack of clinical assessment measures to support the use of more invasive diagnostic techniques. To this purpose, in the current study we explore the feasibility of lung ultrasound (LUS), to assess lung deaeration possibly related to aspiration during meal, in a cohort of 35 subjects affected by CP or other encephalopathies, and 10 controls in the same age-range. We coupled LUS procedure with meal caregiver administration for each child. Our results support the feasibility of this innovative approach in the clinical setting. Exploratory findings revealed a number of lung abnormalities likely related to abnormal ingestion function in subjects. Subgroup analyses revealed possible differences in LUS abnormalities between CP and other encephalopathies, possibly related to different mechanism of disease or dysfunction. Also, some evidences arose about the possible relationship between such LUS abnormalities and feeding and swallowing abilities in CP or other encephalopathies.

This approach demonstrated usefulness as a potential tool for improving assessment and management in complex care of infants and young children with severe neurological disorders.",,620
1006,35974613,Free-energy landscapes and insertion pathways for peptides in membrane environment.,"Free-energy landscapes for short peptides-specifically for variants of the pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP)-in the heterogeneous environment of a lipid bilayer or cell membrane are constructed, taking into account a set of dominant interactions and the conformational preferences of the peptide backbone. Our methodology interprets broken internal H-bonds along the backbone of a polypeptide as statistically interacting quasiparticles, activated from the helix reference state. The favored conformation depends on the local environment (ranging from polar to nonpolar), specifically on the availability of external H-bonds (with H_{2}O molecules or lipid headgroups) to replace internal H-bonds. The dominant side-chain contribution is accounted for by residue-specific transfer free energies between polar and nonpolar environments. The free-energy landscape is sensitive to the level of pH in the aqueous environment surrounding the membrane. For high pH, we identify pathways of descending free energy that suggest a coexistence of membrane-adsorbed peptides with peptides in solution. A drop in pH raises the degree of protonation of negatively charged residues and thus increases the hydrophobicity of peptide segments near the C terminus. For low pH, we identify insertion pathways between the membrane-adsorbed state and a stable trans-membrane state with the C terminus having crossed the membrane.",,621
1534,35968352,Different interventional time of hepatic arterial infusion with PD-1 inhibitor for advanced biliary tract cancer: a multicenter retrospective study.,"This study investigated the efficacy and safety of hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with PD-1 immunotherapy for advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) and evaluated the optimal timing of HAIC. A total of 36 unresectable BTC patients treated with HAIC and PD-1 inhibitors between September 2019 and July 2021 were included in this study. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response, and adverse events (AEs) were investigated. Overall, 52.8% patients with advanced BTC were in stage IV, 23 patients who progressed after receiving PD-1 inhibitor had undergone HAIC, and 23 patients have received 2 or more lines of therapy. The median OS was 8.8 months (range: 4.0-24.0 months), and the median PFS was 3.7 months. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 11.5% and 76.9%, respectively. In the subgroup analysis, patients who treated with HAIC early without progression after immunotherapy were associated with a trend toward better OS (median 13.0 vs. 7.6 months; P = 0.004) and PFS (median 7.9 vs. 3.6 months; P = 0.09) compared to with HAIC with progression after PD-1 treatment. No treatment-related deaths occurred. A total of 44.4% of the patients experienced grade 3 or 4 AEs. We conclude that the combination of HAIC and PD-1 inhibitors is safe and effective. Early HAIC combined with immunotherapy can effectively prolong the overall survival of patients with advanced BTC.",,622
2035,35967551,Two-Dimensional Shear Wave Elastography Evaluation of Post-transplantation Complications in Pediatric Receipt: A Retrospective Cohort.,"The 20-year survival rate in pediatric patients after liver transplantation (LT) was no more than 70%. Hepatic fibrosis is one of the principal factors affecting the long-term prognosis. Imaging evaluation was the first-line examination for pediatric liver graft assessment. However, the sensitivity and specificity were insufficient. Thus, two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) was performed to evaluate liver graft stiffness and complication in post-transplant pediatric receipt. In this retrospective cohort, 343 pediatric recipients who underwent liver graft biopsy in our tertiary LT center were recruited between June 2018 and December 2020. The 2D-SWE evaluation, laboratory examination, routine post-transplant biopsy, and hepatic pathological assessment were performed. Ninety-eight of the 343 pediatric patients were included according to the protocol. The Liver Stiffness Measurements (LSM) value of 2D-SWE was significantly elevated in post-transplant fibrosis (p < 0.0001). The LSM value of patients with post-transplant biliary complications (p < 0.0001) and biopsy-proven rejection (BPR, p = 0.0016) also rose compared to regular recovery patients. Concerning the sensitivity and specificity of 2D-SWE in diagnosing liver graft fibrosis, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 88%, and the optimal cutoff value was 10.3 kPa. Pediatric LSM by 2D-SWE was efficient. Routine 2D-SWE evaluation could be optimal to predict significant liver graft fibrosis.",,623
1704,35968066,"Active surveillance of adverse events after immunization (AEFI) from the Local Health Unitof Ferrara, Italy.","Vaccine vigilance implies the collection, evaluation, analysis and communication of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) and is a useful tool for vaccine monitoring allowing, even after approval and marketing, to check its safety/tolerability. The multiregional project Active surveillance of adverse vaccine reactions, joined by the AUSL of Ferrara, is aimed at making parents of children, who have undergone at least one vaccination provided by the regional vaccination calendar in the first 24 months of life, aware of the reporting of any AEFI via mobile phone-SMS. An analysis of the project data, collected in the period March 2018 - May 2019, was carried out, to evaluate the effectiveness of the reporting tool and the type and frequency of AEFI. Anonymized data were analyzed by number, gender, distribution by age, type of vaccine, adverse event, severity and outcome. A total of 1,494 consents and 983 SMS messages were obtained from parents. The vaccine doses carried out were 1,984 (28.3% hexavalent, 28% PCV13, 17% anti-rotavirus, 14.3% Men-B). Almost all (99.5%) AEFI were classified as not serious. Based on the Organ System Class (SOC), most reports are related to General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (52.3%), followed by Psychiatric Disorders (26.5%) and Metabolic and nutrition disorders (12.5%). The reported AEFI are in line with the ones reported in the literature. Reporting via SMS is a valid vaccine surveillance tool contributing to the qualitative and quantitative improvement of the information transmitted.",,624
1530,35968356,Breast cancer: molecular mechanisms of underlying resistance and therapeutic approaches.,"Breast cancer (BC) affects over 250,000 women in the US each year. Drug-resistant cancer cells are responsible for most breast cancer fatalities. Scientists are developing novel chemotherapeutic drugs and targeted therapy combinations to overcome cancer cell resistance. Combining drugs can reduce the chances of a tumor developing resistance to treatment. Clinical research has shown that combination chemotherapy enhances or improves survival, depending on the patient's response to treatment. Combination therapy is a highly successful supplemental cancer treatment. This review sheds light on intrinsic resistance to BC drugs and the importance of combination therapy for BC treatment. In addition to recurrence and metastasis of BC, the article discussed biomarkers for BC.",,625
1987,35967619,Does hand modulate the reshaping of the attentional system during rightward prism adaptation? An fMRI study.,"Adaptation to right-deviating prisms (R-PA), that is, learning to point with the right hand to targets perceived through prisms, has been shown to change spatial topography within the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) by increasing responses to left, central, and right targets on the left hemisphere and decreasing responses to right and central targets on the right hemisphere. As pointed out previously, this corresponds to a switch of the dominance of the ventral attentional network from the right to the left hemisphere. Since the encoding of hand movements in pointing paradigms is side-dependent, the choice of right vs. left hand for pointing during R-PA may influence the visuomotor adaptation process and hence the reshaping of the attentional system. We have tested this hypothesis in normal subjects by comparing activation patterns to visual targets in left, central, and right fields elicited before and after adaptation to rightward-deviating prisms using the right hand (RWRH) with those in two control groups. The first control group underwent adaptation to rightward-deviating prisms using the left hand, whereas the second control group underwent adaptation to leftward-deviating prisms using the right hand. The present study confirmed the previously described enhancement of left and central visual field representation within left IPL following R-PA. It further showed that the use of right vs. left hand during adaptation modulates this enhancement in some but not all parts of the left IPL. Interestingly, in some clusters identified in this study, L-PA with right hand mimics partially the effect of R-PA by enhancing activation elicited by left stimuli in the left IPL and by decreasing activation elicited by right stimuli in the right IPL. Thus, the use of right vs. left hand modulates the R-PA-induced reshaping of the ventral attentional system. Whether the choice of hand during R-PA affects also the reshaping of the dorsal attentional system remains to be determined as well as possible clinical applications of this approach. Depending on the patients' conditions, using the right or the left hand during PA might potentiate the beneficial effects of this intervention.",,626
2205,35967313,The cancer-associated fibroblast-related signature predicts prognosis and indicates immune microenvironment infiltration in gastric cancer.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers, with a wide range of symptoms and outcomes. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are newly identified in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and associated with GC progression, prognosis, and treatment response. A novel CAF-associated prognostic model is urgently needed to improve treatment strategies. The detailed data of GC samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), GSE62254, GSE26253, and GSE84437 datasets, then obtained 18 unique CAF-related genes from the research papers. Eight hundred eight individuals with GC were classified as TCGA or GSE84437 using consensus clustering by the selected CAF-related genes. The difference between the two subtypes revealed in this study was utilized to create the CAF-related signature score (CAFS-score) prognostic model and validated with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We identified two CAF subtypes characterized by high and low CAFS-score in this study. GC patients in the low CAFS-score group had a better OS than those in the high CAFS-score group, and the cancer-related malignant pathways were more active in the high CAFS-score group, compared to the low CAFS-score group. We found that there was more early TNM stage in the low CAFS-score subgroup, while there was more advanced TNM stage in the high CAFS-score subgroup. The expression of TMB was significantly higher in the low CAFS-score subgroup than in the high CAFS-score subgroup. A low CAFS-score was linked to increased microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), mutation load, and immunological activation. Furthermore, the CAFS-score was linked to the cancer stem cell (CSC) index as well as chemotherapeutic treatment sensitivity. The patients in the high CAFS-score subgroup had significantly higher proportions of monocytes, M2 macrophages, and resting mast cells, while plasma cells and follicular helper T cells were more abundant in the low-risk subgroup. The CAFS-score was also highly correlated with the sensitivity of chemotherapeutic drugs. The low CAFS-score group was more likely to have an immune response and respond to immunotherapy. We developed a nomogram to improve the CAFS-clinical score's usefulness. The CAFS-score may have a significant role in the TME, clinicopathological characteristics, prognosis, CSC, MSI, and drug sensitivity, according to our investigation of CAFs in GC. We also analyzed the value of the CAFS-score in immune response and immunotherapy. This work provides a foundation for improving prognosis and responding to immunotherapy in patients with GC.",,627
1650,35968124,CAND1 is required for pollen viability in Arabidopsis thaliana-a test of the adaptive exchange hypothesis.,"The dynamic assembly of SKP1•CUL1•F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligases is important for protein ubiquitination and degradation. This process is enabled by CAND1, which exchanges F-box proteins associated with the common CUL1 scaffold, and thereby, recycles the limited CUL1 core and allows diverse F-box proteins to assemble active SCFs. Previous human cell biological and computational studies have led to the adaptive exchange hypothesis, which suggests that the CAND1-mediated exchange confers plasticity on the SCF system, allowing cells to tolerate large variations in F-box protein expression. Here, we tested this hypothesis using Arabidopsis thaliana, a multicellular organism expressing hundreds of F-box protein genes at variable levels in different tissues. The cand1 null mutant in Arabidopsis is viable but produce almost no seeds. Bioinformatic, cell biological, and developmental analyses revealed that the low fertility in the cand1 mutant is associated with cell death in pollen, where the net expression of F-box protein genes is significantly higher than any other Arabidopsis tissue. In addition, we show that the transmission efficiency of the cand1 null allele was reduced through the male but not the female gametophyte. Our results suggest that CAND1 activity is essential in cells or tissues expressing high levels of F-box proteins. This finding is consistent with the proposed adaptive exchange hypothesis, demonstrating the necessity of the evolutionarily conserved CAND1-mediated exchange system in the development of a multicellular organism.",,628
1356,35969109,Physical Activity Measurement in Children Accepting Table Tennis Training.,"An increasing body of evidence now shows that the majority of children in China experience lower levels of physical activity (PA) than the recommended guideline. Table tennis is a compound and technically difficult game that is popular in China; undertaking table tennis training in clubs can help children to elevate their levels of PA. Given that children cannot complete self-evaluated questionnaires themselves and caregiver-based observations are not suitable for children, we hypothesized that an actigraphy-based method can be an objective method to measure PA. In the present study, we describe a procedure that can be used to evaluate PA levels using an actigraphic device and software. Furthermore, since hip-worn devices are known to reduce compliance, we attempted to assess the agreement between hip-worn and wrist-worn device data. Collectively, our results indicate that these devices are suitable for measuring PA and leisure time physical activity (LTPA) levels. Together with subjective questionnaires, both hip-worn and wrist-worn devices are highly suitable for evaluating PA in Chinese children undergoing table tennis training in clubs.",,629
1167,35973379,Myelin Content and Gait Impairment in Older Adults with Cerebral Small Vessel Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"We investigated whether myelin is associated with gait parameters in older adults with cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). Cross-sectional data from sixty-four participants with cSVD and mild cognitive impairment were analyzed. Myelin was assessed via MRI multi-echo gradient and spin echo T2 relaxation sequence, indexed as myelin water fraction (MWF). Gait was assessed using an electronic walkway. Hierarchical regression models adjusting for total intracranial volume, age, sex, Mini-Mental State Examination, and body mass index were conducted to determine associations between MWF and gait parameters. Significant models were further adjusted for white matter hyperintensities. Sixty-four participants were included (mean [SD], age = 75.2y [5.4], 62.5% female). In adjusted models, lower MWF in the cingulum (p = 0.015), superior longitudinal fasciculus (p = 0.034), posterior corona radiata (p = 0.039), and body of the corpus callosum (p = 0.040) was associated with higher cycle time variability. White matter hyperintensities weakened these associations. Lower myelin in specific white matter tracts may contribute to higher gait variability, increasing the overall risk of mobility impairment.",,630
2026,35967560,Cardiac manifestations in a Chinese cohort of fetuses from mothers with anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies.,"To analyze the clinical characteristics, echocardiographic features, and prognosis of fetuses based on three groups of cardiac manifestations associated with maternal anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies in China. This study included three groups: the isolated-arrhythmia, isolated-endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE), and mixed groups. We prospectively evaluated 36 fetuses with cardiac manifestations due to maternal anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies from our center between 2016 and 2020 in China. Clinical and echocardiographic data were collected. There were 13 patients (36%) in the isolated-arrhythmia group, eight (22%) in the isolated-EFE group, and 15 (42%) in the mixed group. All patients in the isolated-EFE group presented with mild EFE. Severe EFE was identified in four patients (27%) in the mixed group. Atrioventricular block (AVB) was more common in the isolated-arrhythmia group (13, 100%) than in the mixed group (6, 40%; p = 0.001). Moderate-severe mitral regurgitation (p = 0.006), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, p = 0.017), and low cardiovascular profile scores (p = 0.013) were more common in the mixed group than in the other two groups. Twenty-one mothers decided to terminate the pregnancy and 15 fetuses were born with regular perinatal treatment. They all survived at 1 year of age. One patient in the isolated-arrhythmia group and two in the mixed group required a pacemaker due to third-degree AVB or atrioventricular junctional rhythm. Five patients in the isolated-EFE group and five in the mixed group had no DCM or heart failure and the location of mild EFE was significantly reduced. Fetal cardiac manifestations due to maternal anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies can be divided into three groups, i.e., the isolated-arrhythmia, isolated-EFE, and mixed groups. AVB usually occurs in the isolated-arrhythmia group. Severe EFE, moderate-severe mitral regurgitation, and DCM mainly appear in the mixed group. Location of mild EFE significantly reduces after birth and the outcome of fetuses with mild EFE depends on the presence of arrhythmia and its subtypes.",,631
1638,35968138,Detection and localization of citrus fruit based on improved You Only Look Once v5s and binocular vision in the orchard.,"Intelligent detection and localization of mature citrus fruits is a critical challenge in developing an automatic harvesting robot. Variable illumination conditions and different occlusion states are some of the essential issues that must be addressed for the accurate detection and localization of citrus in the orchard environment. In this paper, a novel method for the detection and localization of mature citrus using improved You Only Look Once (YOLO) v5s with binocular vision is proposed. First, a new loss function (polarity binary cross-entropy with logit loss) for YOLO v5s is designed to calculate the loss value of class probability and objectness score, so that a large penalty for false and missing detection is applied during the training process. Second, to recover the missing depth information caused by randomly overlapping background participants, Cr-Cb chromatic mapping, the Otsu thresholding algorithm, and morphological processing are successively used to extract the complete shape of the citrus, and the kriging method is applied to obtain the best linear unbiased estimator for the missing depth value. Finally, the citrus spatial position and posture information are obtained according to the camera imaging model and the geometric features of the citrus. The experimental results show that the recall rates of citrus detection under non-uniform illumination conditions, weak illumination, and well illumination are 99.55%, 98.47%, and 98.48%, respectively, approximately 2-9% higher than those of the original YOLO v5s network. The average error of the distance between the citrus fruit and the camera is 3.98 mm, and the average errors of the citrus diameters in the 3D direction are less than 2.75 mm. The average detection time per frame is 78.96 ms. The results indicate that our method can detect and localize citrus fruits in the complex environment of orchards with high accuracy and speed. Our dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/AshesBen/citrus-detection-localization.",,632
1086,35974533,Ratchetlike motion of helical bilayers induced by boundary constraints.,"We show that application of boundary constraints generates unusual folding behaviors in responsive (swellable) helical bilayer strips. Unlike the smooth folding trajectories typical of free helical bilayers, the boundary-constrained bilayers exhibit intermittent folding behaviors characterized by rapid, steplike movements. We experimentally study bilayer strips as they swell and fold, and we propose a simple model to explain the emergence of ratchetlike behavior. Experiments and model predictions are then compared to simulations, which enable calculation of elastic energy during swelling. We investigate the dependence of this steplike behavior as a function of elastic boundary condition strength, strip length, and strip shape; interestingly, V-shape strips with the same boundary conditions fold smoothly.",,633
1494,35968393,Multitarget high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation improves response inhibition more than single-target high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation in healthy participants.,"Prior studies have focused on single-target anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) or pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) to improve response inhibition in healthy individuals. However, the results are contradictory and the effect of multitarget anodal stimulation over both brain regions has never been investigated. The present study aimed to investigate the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of different forms of anodal high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) on improving response inhibition, including HD-tDCS over the rIFG or pre-SMA and multitarget HD-tDCS over both areas. Ninety-two healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive single-session (20 min) anodal HD-tDCS over rIFG + pre-SMA, rIFG, pre-SMA, or sham stimulation. Before and immediately after tDCS intervention, participants completed a stop-signal task (SST) and a go/nogo task (GNG). Their cortical activity was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the go/nogo task. The results showed multitarget stimulation produced a significant reduction in stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) relative to baseline. The pre-to-post SSRT change was not significant for rIFG, pre-SMA, or sham stimulation. Further analyses revealed multitarget HD-tDCS significantly decreased SSRT in both the high-performance and low-performance subgroups compared with the rIFG condition which decreased SSRT only in the low-performance subgroup. Only the multitarget condition significantly improved neural efficiency as indexed by lower △oxy-Hb after stimulation. In conclusion, the present study provides important preliminary evidence that multitarget HD-tDCS is a promising avenue to improve stimulation efficacy, establishing a more effective montage to enhance response inhibition relative to the commonly used single-target stimulation.",,634
1181,35973304,Associations between early ischemic signs on non-contrast CT and time since acute ischemic stroke onset: A scoping review.,"Onset to imaging (OTI) time is a crucial factor in determining treatment eligibility for acute ischemic stroke patients, since the treatments are time-dependent. Patients with an unknown OTI time are often excluded from treatment, or advanced imaging is needed, which is not widely and readily available. As non-contrast CT (NCCT) is part of the standard stroke protocol, estimating OTI time using only NCCT would be valuable for patients with an unknown OTI time. Early ischemic signs (EISs) visible on NCCT might be fit for this purpose if an association between these signs and OTI time exists. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the literature that associated OTI time with qualitative or quantitative EISs, including the hyperdense artery sign (HAS), decrease in grey matter-white matter differentiation, hypodensity, and mass effect. The prevalence of the EISs at specific OTI times is assessed, and previously presented associations between the EISs and OTI time are reported. The EIS prevalence varied between the studies. The HAS prevalence decreased after 6 h since onset. The hypodensity prevalence increased with increasing OTI time. Studies quantifying the extent of hypodensity could distinguish patients within and beyond treatment time windows, indicating its potential to estimate OTI time. Finally, mass effect prevalence was seen more often at later OTI times. It is concluded that, despite the high prevalence variability between studies, some associations between EISs and OTI time can be observed. These are potentially valuable in estimating OTI time and supporting treatment decisions.",,635
1055,35974564,Frustration-induced complexity in order-disorder transitions of the J_{1}-J_{2}-J_{3} Ising model on the square lattice.,"We revisit the field-free Ising model on a square lattice with up to third-neighbor (NNNN) interactions, also known as the J_{1}-J_{2}-J_{3} model, in the mean-field approximation. Using a systematic enumeration procedure, we show that the region of phase space in which the high-temperature disordered phase is stable against all modes representing periodic magnetization patterns up to a given size is a convex polytope that can be obtained by solving a standard vertex enumeration problem. Each face of this polytope corresponds to a set of coupling constants for which a single set of modes, equivalent up to a symmetry of the lattice, bifurcates from the disordered solution. While the structure of this polytope is simple in the half-space J_{3}>0, where the NNNN interaction is ferromagnetic, it becomes increasingly complex in the half-space J_{3}<0, where the antiferromagnetic NNNN interaction induces strong frustration. We then pass to the limit N→∞ giving a closed-form description of the order-disorder surface in the thermodynamic limit, which shows that for J_{3}<0, the emergent ordered phases will have a devil's surface-like mode structure. Finally, using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that for small periodic systems, the mean-field analysis correctly predicts the dominant modes of the ordered phases that develop for coupling constants associated with the centroid of the faces of the disorder polytope.",,636
1516,35968370,EventHD: Robust and efficient hyperdimensional learning with neuromorphic sensor.,"Brain-inspired computing models have shown great potential to outperform today's deep learning solutions in terms of robustness and energy efficiency. Particularly, Hyper-Dimensional Computing (HDC) has shown promising results in enabling efficient and robust cognitive learning. In this study, we exploit HDC as an alternative computational model that mimics important brain functionalities toward high-efficiency and noise-tolerant neuromorphic computing. We present EventHD, an end-to-end learning framework based on HDC for robust, efficient learning from neuromorphic sensors. We first introduce a spatial and temporal encoding scheme to map event-based neuromorphic data into high-dimensional space. Then, we leverage HDC mathematics to support learning and cognitive tasks over encoded data, such as information association and memorization. EventHD also provides a notion of confidence for each prediction, thus enabling self-learning from unlabeled data. We evaluate EventHD efficiency over data collected from Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) sensors. Our results indicate that EventHD can provide online learning and cognitive support while operating over raw DVS data without using the costly preprocessing step. In terms of efficiency, EventHD provides 14.2× faster and 19.8× higher energy efficiency than state-of-the-art learning algorithms while improving the computational robustness by 5.9×.",,637
1644,35968130,"EbMYBP1, a R2R3-MYB transcription factor, promotes flavonoid biosynthesis in Erigeron breviscapus.","Erigeron breviscapus, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, is enriched in flavonoids that are beneficial to human health. While we know that R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs) are crucial to flavonoid pathway, the transcriptional regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in E. breviscapus has not been fully elucidated. Here, EbMYBP1, a R2R3-MYB transcription factor, was uncovered as a regulator involved in the regulation of flavonoid accumulation. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that a large group of genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis were significantly changed, accompanied by significantly increased concentrations of the flavonoid in EbMYBP1-OE transgenic tobacco compared with the wild-type (WT). In vitro and in vivo investigations showed that EbMYBP1 participated in flavonoid biosynthesis, acting as a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator and activating the transcription of flavonoid-associated genes like FLS, F3H, CHS, and CHI by directly binding to their promoters. Collectively, these new findings are advancing our understanding of the transcriptional regulation that modulates the flavonoid biosynthesis.",,638
1291,35970685,Elevated heart rate as sympathetic biomarker in human obesity.,"The present study was aimed at determining whether and to what extent a specific heart rate (HR) cutoff value allows to identify in obeses a more pronounced level of adrenergic overdrive. In 86 obese subjects aged 44.7 ± 0.9 (mean ± SEM) years and in 45 heathy lean controls of similar age we evaluated muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA, microneurography) and venous plasma norepinephrine (NE, HPLC assay), subdividing the subjects in 3 different groups according to their resting clinic and 24-h HR values (<70, 70-79 and 80-89 beats/minute). MSNA and plasma NE values detected in the three obese groups were almost superimposable each other, no significant difference between groups being observed. A similar behavior was observed when HR values were assessed during the 24-h Holter monitoring. In the group as a whole no significant relationship was detected between MSNA, plasma NE and clinic HR, this being the case also when 24-h HR replaced clinic HR in the correlation analysis. In contrast lean controls displayed a progressive significant increase in MSNA values form the group with clinic (and 24 Holter) values below 70 beats/minute to the ones with HR values between 70 and 79 and above 80 beats/minute. In the obese state measurement of resting HR may allow to provide some general information on the functional status of the adrenergic cardiovascular drive. When the information required, however, are more subtle the sensitivity of the approach appears to be reduced and HR cannot be regarded as a faithful sympathetic biomarker.",,639
692,35975516,A Novel Fecal Elastase Assay for the Detection of Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency.,"Fecal pancreatic elastase 1 (FPE1) is an established screening test for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI), a condition that is underdiagnosed and if not treated may cause significant morbidity. The aim of this study was to compare a new FPE1 machine based CLIA kit to an ELISA assay which is considered the de facto gold standard in our laboratory for FPE1 measurement. Levels of FPE1 from the 227 stool samples were analyzed by the ScheBo ELISA kit and the CLIA Liaison XL system simultaneously with the same cutoff values for both assays. Performance of the Liaison XL system was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The comparison between the Liaison XL system performance and the ScheBo ELISA kit as reference revealed a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 86.8%, 94.3%, and 92.1%, respectively, using a cutoff of 100 µg FPE1/g stool. When the cutoff is 200 µg FPE1/g stool the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 86.6%, 97.1%, and 90.7%, respectively. Furthermore, linear correlation of FPE1 levels between the two assays were found to be significant by Pearson's correlation coefficient test (R = 0.85, p-values < 0.0001). The Liaison XL system showed good laboratory performance with our pre-determined cutoff values when compared to our previous assay. An important advantage of this system is its semi-automated mechanism that enables large scale analysis of FPE1. In addition to that, the Liaison XL system is ideal for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of FPE1 allowing for its application to the clinical setting.",,640
102,35983381,Coverage of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Booster Dose (Precautionary) in the Adult Population: An Online Survey.,"Background The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic devastated public health worldwide, including India. COVID-19 vaccines and their boosters are life-saving developments that have helped prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. We conducted this study to assess the coverage of the booster dose in an Indian population (the third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in India is referred to as the booster or precautionary dose), record the reasons for not taking the booster dose, and determine the effectiveness of the booster. The levels of adherence to COVID-19 precautionary behavior was also assessed.  Methods We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study using convenient sampling via an online survey of 550 respondents older than 18 in the second quarter of 2022. The respondents were distributed among 18 states and union territories in India. The data were analyzed as simple proportions and percentages. Results Of the 550 respondents, 152 (27.6%) received the booster dose, indicating low coverage. A small percentage of respondents (7.2%) reported suffering from COVID-19 following the booster, of whom 91% were medical professionals. The most common reported reason for not taking the vaccine was that the respondents were not yet due for their dose (48.1%). The time between the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and the booster had no impact on infection rates. Men were less likely to adhere to COVID-19 precautionary behavior than women, despite similar vaccination rates. Conclusion The COVID-19 vaccine booster had a low acceptance in our study population, with roughly one-quarter of the population receiving the booster. The booster dose has been influential in the prevention of COVID-19. Most respondents followed behavioral safety measures despite the decline of active cases of COVID-19 in India following the Omicron wave. Our results indicate a need to strengthen public strategies to affect behavioral changes, such as improving India's Behavior Change Communication program to ensure adequate booster dose coverage.",,641
1695,35968075,Predicting Healthcare-associated Infections: are Point of Prevalence Surveys data useful?,"Since 2012, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) promotes a point prevalence survey (PPS) of HAIs in European acute care hospitals. Through a retrospective analysis of 2012, 2015 and 2017 PPS of HAIs performed in a tertiary academic hospital in Italy, we developed a model to predict the risk of HAI. Following ECDC protocol we surveyed 1382 patients across three years. Bivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between HAI and several variables. Those statistically significant were included in a stepwise multiple regression model. The goodness of fit of the latter model was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, ultimately constructing a probability curve to estimate the risk of developing HAIs. Three variables resulted statistically significant in the stepwise logistic regression model: length of stay (OR 1.03; 95% CI: 1.02-1.05), devices breaking the skin (i.e. peripheral or central vascular catheter, OR 4.38; 95% CI: 1.52-12.63), urinary catheter (OR 4.71; 95% CI: 2.78-7.98). PPSs are a convenient and reliable source of data to develop HAIs prediction models. The differences found between our results and previously published studies suggest the need of developing hospital-specific databases and predictive models for HAIs.",,642
1343,35969706,"Plasma concentration of dopamine varies depending on breed, sex, and the genotype of DRD4 in horses.","Dopamine (DA) is known to be a key modulator of animal behaviors. Thus, the plasma concentration of DA might be used as a biomarker for the behavioral characteristics of horses. The behavioral characteristics of horses vary depending on the breed, age, and sex. Moreover, the DA receptor genotypes are also related to horse behaviors. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the DA concentration variations of horse plasma by breed, age, sex, or genotype of its receptor. The horses were divided by breed into Thoroughbred (n = 13), Pony (n = 9), Warmblood (n = 4), and Haflinger (n = 5). The age variable was divided into three different groups: post-pubertal (2-5 years, n = 6), adult (6-13 years, n = 19), and aged horses (15-24 years, n = 6). The sex variable was divided into geldings (n = 8) and mares (n = 23). Approximately 10 mL of blood was collected, and an ELISA kit was used to measure the plasma concentration of DA. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to identify the genetic variation in the DA D4 receptor gene (DRD4). SPSS statistical software was used for statistical analysis. The DA concentrations in geldings were significantly lower than those in mares. There was no significant difference in DA concentrations among breed and age groups. Horses with the GG and GA genotypes had significantly higher plasma concentrations of DA compared to horses with the AA genotype for the G292A gene. Briefly, the plasma concentration of DA varied depending on the sex and genotype of G292A. These factors should be considered when the concentration of DA is used as a biomarker for the behavioral characteristics of horses. In conclusion, the DA concentration or DRD4 genotype of horse plasma has the potential to be used as a biomarker that can predict the behavioral characteristics of horses.",,643
1035,35974584,Switching from a continuous to a discontinuous phase transition under quenched disorder.,"Discontinuous phase transitions are particularly interesting from a social point of view because of their relationship to social hysteresis and critical mass. In this paper, we show that the replacement of a time-varying (annealed, situation-based) disorder by a static (quenched, personality-based) one can lead to a change from a continuous to a discontinuous phase transition. This is a result beyond the state of the art, because so far numerous studies on various complex systems (physical, biological, and social) have indicated that the quenched disorder can round or destroy the existence of a discontinuous phase transition. To show the possibility of the opposite behavior, we study a multistate q-voter model, with two types of disorder related to random competing interactions (conformity and anticonformity). We confirm, both analytically and through Monte Carlo simulations, that indeed discontinuous phase transitions can be induced by a static disorder.",,644
277,35981950,A history of adjustment disorder predicts greater weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy.,"Bariatric surgery is one of the most effective long-term options for treating class III obesity or class II obesity with medical co-morbidities; however, a significant number of patients do not achieve the expected weight loss. New studies are needed to find the predictive value of different variables on surgery outcomes. Our aim was to study a number of physical, medical, and psychopathological variables as potential risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with class II-IV obesity scheduled for sleeve gastrectomy. Sagrat Cor University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain. This prospective longitudinal study enrolled a sample consisting of 441 patients from whom a descriptive analysis was obtained. For 235 of them, we performed a comparative analysis between the patients with differing responses to sleeve gastrectomy after 1 year of follow-up. The remaining patients had differing follow-up data or were lost to follow-up. To collect the data, a semi-structured interview was conducted, and various tests were administered to assess the patients' psychopathology (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) and functionality (Global Assessment of Functioning Scale). The results show the prognostic relationship between certain presurgery variables and the good or poor outcomes of the bariatric surgery, based on the patients' weight loss. Advanced age, high body mass index, diabetes, and respiratory problems were significant predictors of a poor response to surgery. Contrarywise, a history of adjustment disorder predicted a better response. The results allow us to conclude that, beyond well-established physical and medical conditions, a psychopathological study of patients prior to bariatric surgery including adjustment disorders could be predictive of therapeutic response and could help to personalize the follow-up.",,645
544,35978679,N-Alkyl-2-Quinolonopyrones Demonstrate Antimicrobial Activity against ESKAPE Pathogens Including Staphylococcus aureus.,"Antibiotic resistance has grown significantly in the last three decades, while research and development of new antibiotic classes has languished. Therefore, new chemical frameworks for the control of microbial behavior are urgently required. This study presents a novel suite of compounds, based on a tricyclic 4-hydroxy-2H-pyrano[3,2-c]quinoline-2,5(6H)-dione core, with significant antibiotic activity against the ESKAPE pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis and the accidental pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis. A potent analogue with an N-heptyl-9-t-Bu substitution pattern emerged as a hit with MIC levels ≤2 μg/mL across four strains of MRSA.

1639,35968137,"Intrinsically disordered protein, DNA binding with one finger transcription factor (OsDOF27) implicates thermotolerance in yeast and rice.","Intrinsically disorder regions or proteins (IDRs or IDPs) constitute a large subset of the eukaryotic proteome, which challenges the protein structure-function paradigm. These IDPs lack a stable tertiary structure, yet they play a crucial role in the diverse biological process of plants. This study represents the intrinsically disordered nature of a plant-specific DNA binding with one finger transcription factor (DOF-TF). Here, we have investigated the role of OsDOF27 and characterized it as an intrinsically disordered protein. Furthermore, the molecular role of OsDOF27 in thermal stress tolerance has been elucidated. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDOF27 was significantly upregulated under different abiotic stress treatments in rice, particularly under heat stress. The stress-responsive transcript induction of OsDOF27 was further correlated with enriched abiotic stress-related cis-regulatory elements present in its promoter region. The in vivo functional analysis of the potential role of OsDOF27 in thermotolerance was further studied in yeast and in planta. Ectopic expression of OsDOF27 in yeast implicates thermotolerance response. Furthermore, the rice transgenic lines with overexpressing OsDOF27 revealed a positive role in mitigating heat stress tolerance. Collectively, our results evidently show the intrinsically disorderedness in OsDOF27 and its role in thermal stress response in rice.",,647
597,35977898,Effect of a nutritional support protocol on enteral nutrition and clinical outcomes of critically ill patients: a retrospective cohort study.,"Enteral nutrition (EN) supply within 48 hours after intensive care unit (ICU) admission improves clinical outcomes. The new ICU evaluation & development of nutritional support protocol (NICE-NST) was introduced in an ICU of tertiary academic hospital. This study showed that early EN through protocolized nutritional support would supply more nutrition to improve clinical outcomes. This study screened 170 patients and 62 patients were finally enrolled; patients who were supplied nutrition without the protocol were classified as the control group (n=40), while those who were supplied according to the protocol were classified as the test group (n=22). In the test group, EN started significantly earlier (3.7±0.4 days vs. 2.4±0.5 days, P=0.010). EN calorie (4.0±1.0 kcal/kg vs. 6.7±0.9 kcal/kg, P=0.006) and protein (0.17±0.04 g/kg vs. 0.32±0.04 g/kg, P=0.002) supplied were significantly higher in the test group. Although EN was supplied through continuous feeding in the test group, there was no difference in complications such as feeding hold due to excessive gastric residual volume or vomit, and hyper- or hypo-glycemia between the two groups. Hospital mortality was significantly lower in the group that started EN within 1.5 days (42.9% vs. 11.8%, P=0.018). The proportion of patients who started EN within 1.5 days was higher in the test group (40.9% vs. 17.5%, P=0.044). The NICE-NST may improve EN supply and mortality of critically ill patients without increasing complications.",,648
466,35978919,Decreased complement 4d increases poor prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer combined with gastrointestinal lymph node metastasis.,"Lung cancer is a common malignancy that is difficult to treat and has a high risk of mortality. Although gastrointestinal lymph node metastasis has long been known to exert major impact on the prognosis of lung cancer, the mechanism of its occurrence and potential biological markers remain elusive. Therefore, the present study retrospectively analyzed data from 132 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) combined with lymph node metastasis between February 2010 and April 2019 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (Suzhou, China) and Sichuan Cancer Hospital (Chengdu, China). Overall survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox logistic regression model. In addition, a prediction model was constructed based on immune indicators such as complement C3b and C4d (measured by ELISA), before the accuracy of this model was validated using calibration curves for 5-year OS. Among the 132 included patients, a total of 92 (70.0%) succumbed to the disease within 5 years. Multifactorial analysis revealed that complement C3b deficiency increased the risk of mortality by nearly two-fold [hazard ratio (HR)=2.23; 95% CI=1.20-4.14; P=0.017], whilst complement C4d deficiency similarly increased the risk of mortality by two-fold (HR=2.14; 95% CI=1.14-4.00; P=0.012). The variables were subsequently screened using Cox model to construct a prediction model based on complement C3b and C4d levels before a Nomogram plotted. By internal validation for the 132 patients, the Nomogram accurately estimated the risk of mortality, with a corrected C-index of 0.810. External validation of the model in another 50 patients from Sichuan Cancer Hospital revealed an accuracy of 77.0%. Overall, this mortality risk prediction model constructed based on complement levels showed accuracy in assessing the prognosis of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Therefore, complement C3b and C4d have potential for use as biomarkers to predict the risk of mortality in such patients.",,649
1568,35968318,Diagnosis and prognostic value of circDLGAP4 in acute ischemic stroke and its correlation with outcomes.,"Circular RNAs are a subclass of noncoding RNAs in mammalian cells and highly expressed in the central nervous system. Although their physiological functions are not yet completely defined, they are thought to promise as stroke biomarkers because of their stability in peripheral blood.Sample Size Estimate: 222 participants. The plasma of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) (n = 111) and non-stroke controls (n = 111) from November 2017 to February 2019 were enrolled in our research. The expression of circDLGAP4 in plasma was evaluated using real-time PCR. In patients with AIS, circDLGAP4 was significantly decreased in comparison with non-stroke controls. The CircDLGAP4 level had a significant AUC of 0.7896 with 91.72% sensitivity and 64.83% specificity in diagnosing AIS. Furthermore, the circDLGAP4 level was related to smoking history and previous transient ischemic attack/stroke/myocardial infarction in all samples. The change rate in circDLGAP4 within the first 7 days showed an AUC curve of 0.960 in predicting an stroke outcome. circDLGAP4 could serve as biomarker for AIS diagnosis and prediction of stroke outcomes.",,650
1050,35974569,Information-driven transitions in projections of underdamped dynamics.,"Low-dimensional representations of underdamped systems often provide useful insights and analytical tractability. Here, we build such representations via information projections, obtaining an optimal model that captures the most information on observed spatial trajectories. We show that, in paradigmatic systems, the minimization of the information loss drives the appearance of a discontinuous transition in the optimal model parameters. Our results raise serious warnings for general inference approaches, and they unravel fundamental properties of effective dynamical representations impacting several fields, from biophysics to dimensionality reduction.",,651
1818,35967822,Association between malnutrition and leucopenia in patients with osteosarcoma.,"Leucopenia (LP) greatly limits the efficacy of chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients. This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional status of osteosarcoma patients before chemotherapy, assess the risk of LP during the perichemotherapy period, and explore the association between malnutrition and LP. This study retrospectively analyzed osteosarcoma patients treated in the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, China, between January 2009 and December 2020 according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Malnutrition in adolescents (5 to 19 years old) and adults (≥20 years old) was diagnosed using WHO AnthroPlus software (version 1.0.4) and Global Leadership initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM), respectively. According to the diagnostic criteria of LP in CTCAE 5.0, patients were divided into the LP group and the non-LP group. A total of 245 osteosarcoma patients were included. The incidence of malnutrition was 49.0%, and the incidence of LP was 51.8%. The incidence of malnutrition in adolescent patients was 53.1%, and their incidence of LP was 55.2%; the incidence of malnutrition in adult patients was 43.1%, and their incidence of LP was 47.1%. Logistic regression analysis showed that malnutrition before chemotherapy was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of LP after chemotherapy (OR = 6.85, 95% CI = 2.16-25.43; and OR = 35.03, 95% CI = 6.98-238.46 in mildly and severely malnourished young patients; OR = 6.06; 95% CI = 1.43-30.16; and OR = 38.09, 95% CI = 7.23-285.78 in mildly and severely malnourished adult patients, respectively). The results showed that age and nutritional status had a joint effect on the occurrence of LP. The nutrition status of osteosarcoma patients before chemotherapy is significantly correlated with the occurrence and severity of LP during peri-chemotherapy period. During osteosarcoma chemotherapy, necessary nutritional support should be given to patients of different ages to correct their malnutrition status in a timely manner, ultimately improving the efficacy of chemotherapy and the prognosis of patients.",,652
210,35982810,A Rare Case of Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma with Liver Metastases.,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most frequent type of differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) and commonly metastasizes to regional lymph nodes. Distant metastases of DTC typically occur in the lungs and bones. Liver metastases of DTC are very rare and difficult to diagnose. We present a case of a 52-year-old woman who had a previous history of PTC treated by total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection. The patient received two radioactive iodine-131 (I-131) treatments. The second postradioiodine therapy whole-body scan (WBS) revealed intense iodine uptake in the neck region and in the lungs. After 2 months, during the follow-up period, increase in serum thyroglobulin (Tg) level was detected. Positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) revealed increased FDG uptake in the mass lesion that invaded the muscles in the neck area, lung, bone, and liver. The uptake in liver was interpreted as suspicion of malignancy. The trucut biopsy of the liver masses demonstrated metastases of the thyroid carcinoma with the immunohistochemical thyroid transcription factor-1 and PAX8 positivity observed in these tumor cells. In DTC patients with progressive rapid rise of Tg level, the diagnostic value of I-131 WBS will decrease as the differentiation of the tumor decreases. The combined use of I-131 WBS and FDG PET-CT as diagnostic modalities in these patients will be important in treatment planning in detecting locoregional or distant metastases, especially in patients with negative diagnostic I-131 WBS.",,653
427,35979171,Effect of biochar on antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes variations during co-composting of pig manure and corn straw.,"Pig manure is a reservoir of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The effect of biochar on the variations in physicochemical properties, bacterial communities, antibiotics, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of compost product during co-composting of pig manure and corn straw have been investigated in this study. Compared with the control treatment (CK), biochar addition accelerated the increase in pile temperature and prolonged the high temperature period (>55°C) for 2 days. Under biochar influence, organic matter degradation, NH4 +-N conversion and NO3 --N production was accelerated, and dissolved total organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) utilization by microorganisms were enhanced. Biochar addition altered the microbial community and promoted the vital activity of Actinobacteria in the later composting stage. The antibiotics removal efficiency (except danofloxacin and enrofloxacin) was accelerated in the early composting stage (1-14 days) by biochar addition, the pile temperature had a positive effect on antibiotics removal, and the total antibiotics removal efficiency in CK and CK+Biochar treatments was 69.58% and 78.67% at the end of the composting process, respectively. The absolute abundance of most of the ARGs in the CK+Biochar treatment was lower than that in the CK treatment during composting, and the ARGs removal mainly occurred in the early (1-14 days) and later (28-50 days) stages. Biochar addition reduced the absolute abundance of MGEs (intI1, intI2) in the compost product, and most of the ARGs had a significant positive correlation with MGEs. Network analysis and redundancy analysis showed that ARGs and MGEs occurred in various host bacteria (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Halanaerobiaeota), and that DTN and NH4 +-N are the main factors regulating the changes in bacterial communities, antibiotics, ARGs, and MGEs during composting. Moreover, MGEs contributed the most to the variation in ARGs. In summary, biochar addition during composting accelerated antibiotics removal and inhibited accumulation and transmission of ARGs. The results of this study could provide theoretical and technical support for biochar application for antibiotics and ARGs removal during livestock and poultry manure composting.",,654
507,35978752,Predictive Value of Emergency Designation on Outcomes of Moribund Patients.,"Anesthesiologists are increasingly encountering sicker patients that require potentially life-saving surgical interventions, and assess risk using the American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status (ASA PS) classification system. Here, we examined long-term mortality along with hospital length of stay (LoS) and discharge disposition for survivors in ASA PS 5 and 5E patients. Adult surgeries were extracted from New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center's Electronic Medical Record (EMR) for cases between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017; outcomes were collected from EMRs and the Social Security Death Index Master File. 194,947 cases were identified. Mortality correlated with increasing ASA PS; the same trend was observed within both emergent and non-emergent sub-populations. Two hundred seventy-six cases were identified as 5/5E. This patient population had a higher rate of mortality at 30 days than at 48 hours (25.9% vs. 13.4%, respectively, p < 0.01); there was no difference between survivor functions at 30 or 90 days (p = 0.63, p = 0.09, respectively). Survivors within the 5 or 5E subpopulations did not have significantly different LoSs. Further, survivors after 90 days typically had a disposition of hospice, long-term facilities, inpatient rehabilitation, or self-discharged. Mortality increases with increases in ASA PS classifications. There is no difference in outcomes for 5 vs 5E at 30- or 90-day postoperatively. Similarly, emergency status did not play a role in LoS. Most 5 or 5E patients are not discharged home but to another facility. These outcomes should be considered during the informed consent process in this high-risk surgical population.",,655
2368,35967006,Auditory and cross-modal attentional bias toward positive natural sounds: Behavioral and ERP evidence.,"Recently, researchers have expanded the investigation into attentional biases toward positive stimuli; however, few studies have examined attentional biases toward positive auditory information. In three experiments, the present study employed an emotional spatial cueing task using emotional sounds as cues and auditory stimuli (Experiment 1) or visual stimuli (Experiment 2 and Experiment 3) as targets to explore whether auditory or visual spatial attention could be modulated by positive auditory cues. Experiment 3 also examined the temporal dynamics of cross-modal auditory bias toward positive natural sounds using event-related potentials (ERPs). The behavioral results of the three experiments consistently demonstrated that response times to targets were faster after positive auditory cues than they were after neutral auditory cues in the valid condition, indicating that healthy participants showed a selective auditory attentional bias (Experiment 1) and cross-modal attentional bias (Experiment 2 and Experiment 3) toward positive natural sounds. The results of Experiment 3 showed that N1 amplitudes were more negative after positive sounds than they were after neutral sounds, which further provided electrophysiological evidence that positive auditory information enhances attention at early stages in healthy adults. The results of the experiments performed in the present study suggest that humans exhibit an attentional bias toward positive natural sounds.",,656
404,35979270,Pain at the First Post-hemorrhoidectomy Defecation Is Associated with Stool Form.,"Post-hemorrhoidectomy defecation pain is problematic, and pain associated with the first defecation is particularly important for patients. The present study aimed to investigate whether stool form consistency affected defecation pain after hemorrhoidectomy. A prospective, cohort, observational study where patients scheduled for hemorrhoidal surgery were analyzed. This study used two patient-reported scales to study parameters based on the first postoperative defecation. The Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) and visual analog scale (VAS) assessed stool consistency and defecation pain. The association between stool consistency and defecation pain intensity was assessed using multiple linear regression analysis. Where there was evidence of non-linearity, we applied a restricted cubic spline with three knots to explore the non-linear association. We performed a non-linear regression analysis to estimate the association. A total of 179 patients were analyzed. The regression model results demonstrated that these scales negatively correlated with statistical significance (p = 0.003). This study showed that the softer the stool, the less painful the defecation. Surgeons should attempt to induce a patient to avoid hard stool after surgery. The Ethics Review Committee of the Japan Medical Association approved the study. The study was registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT1030190224, https://jrct.niph.go.jp/latest-detail/jRCT1030190224).",,657
1669,35968105,Combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis of the resistance mechanism of quinoa seedlings to Spodoptera exigua.,"Quinoa has attracted considerable attention owing to its unique nutritional, economic, and medicinal values. The damage intensity of Spodoptera exigua at the seedling stage of quinoa fluctuates with the crop's biological cycle and the environmental changes throughout the growing season. In this study, we used independently selected quinoa seedling resistant and susceptible cultivars to investigate the difference between insect resistance and insect susceptibility of quinoa at the seedling stage. Samples were collected when Spodoptera exigua 45 days after planting the seedlings, and broad targeted metabolomics studies were conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry combined with transcriptomic co-analysis. The metabolomic and genomic analyses of the insect-resistant and insect-susceptible quinoa groups revealed a total of 159 differential metabolites and were functionally annotated to 2334 differential genes involved in 128 pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. In total, 14 metabolites and 22 genes were identified as key factors for the differential accumulation of insect-resistant metabolites in quinoa seedlings. Among them, gene-LOC110694254, gene-LOC110682669, and gene-LOC110732988 were positively correlated with choline. The expression of gene-LOC110729518 and gene-LOC110723164, which were notably higher in the resistant cultivars than in the susceptible cultivars, and the accumulations of the corresponding metabolites were also significantly higher in insect-resistant cultivars. These results elucidate the regulatory mechanism between insect resistance genes and metabolite accumulation in quinoa seedlings, and can provide a basis for the breeding and identification of new insect-resistant quinoa cultivars as well as for screening potential regulatory metabolites of quinoa insect-resistant target genes.",,658
2056,35967515,A comprehensive in silico exploration of the impacts of missense variants on two different conformations of human pirin protein.,"Pirin, a member of the cupin superfamily, is an iron-binding non-heme protein. It acts as a coregulator of several transcription factors, especially the members of NFκB transcription factor family. Based on the redox state of its iron cofactor, it can assume two different conformations and thereby act as a redox sensor inside the nucleus. Previous studies suggested that pirin may be associated with cancer, inflammatory diseases as well as COVID-19 severities. Hence, it is important to explore the pathogenicity of its missense variants. In this study, we used a number of in silico tools to investigate the effects of missense variants of pirin on its structure, stability, metal cofactor binding affinity and interactions with partner proteins. In addition, we used protein dynamics simulation to elucidate the effects of selected variants on its dynamics. Furthermore, we calculated the frequencies of haplotypes containing pirin missense variants across five major super-populations (African, Admixed American, East Asian, European and South Asian). Among a total of 153 missense variants of pirin, 45 were uniformly predicted to be pathogenic. Of these, seven variants can be considered for further experimental studies. Variants R59P and L116P were predicted to significantly destabilize and damage pirin structure, substantially reduce its affinity to its binding partners and alter pirin residue fluctuation profile via changing the flexibility of several key residues. Additionally, variants R59Q, F78V, G98D, V151D and L220P were found to impact pirin structure and function in multiple ways. As no haplotype was identified to be harboring more than one missense variant, further interrogation of the individual effects of these seven missense variants is highly recommended. Pirin is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes and can play an important role in inflammatory responses. The variants predicted to be pathogenic in this study may thus contribute to a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of various inflammatory diseases. Future studies should be focused on clarifying if any of these variants can be used as disease biomarkers.

1218,35971496,Dry eye disease and ocular surface characteristics in patients with keratoconus.,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the ocular surface alterations in patients with mild or severe keratoconus (KC). A total of 80 participants were included in the study. The corneal topography was performed on each participant using Pentacam and the grouping was done accordingly. The patients with Kmax ≥52.0 D (severe KC) were considered Group 1 (n = 28), the patients with Kmax ≥47.2 and <52.0 D (mild KC) were considered Group 2 (n = 30). Healthy control participants with Kmax <47.2 D were considered Group 3 (n = 22). Tear breakup time (TBUT), Schirmer-I test, ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire, and conjunctival impression cytology (CIC) were evaluated among the groups. The mean values of TBUT and Schirmer-I test were significantly lower (P = 0.012, P = 0.012) and the mean scores of OSDI and CIC were significantly higher (P = 0.006, P < 0.001) in Group 1 and Group 2 than in Group 3. The mean values of TBUT and Schirmer-I test were lower and the mean scores of OSDI and CIC were higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 but the differences were insignificant (P > 0.05 for all). These results indicated that the tests associated with dry eye disease are correlated with KC. Tear film alterations and goblet cell loss are higher in severe KC.",,660
2067,35967451,New vistas unfold: Chicken MHC molecules reveal unexpected ways to present peptides to the immune system.,"The functions of a wide variety of molecules with structures similar to the classical class I and class II molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have been studied by biochemical and structural studies over decades, with many aspects for humans and mice now enshrined in textbooks as dogma. However, there is much variation of the MHC and MHC molecules among the other jawed vertebrates, understood in the most detail for the domestic chicken. Among the many unexpected features in chickens is the co-evolution between polymorphic TAP and tapasin genes with a dominantly-expressed class I gene based on a different genomic arrangement compared to typical mammals. Another important discovery was the hierarchy of class I alleles for a suite of properties including size of peptide repertoire, stability and cell surface expression level, which is also found in humans although not as extreme, and which led to the concept of generalists and specialists in response to infectious pathogens. Structural studies of chicken class I molecules have provided molecular explanations for the differences in peptide binding compared to typical mammals. These unexpected phenomena include the stringent binding with three anchor residues and acidic residues at the peptide C-terminus for fastidious alleles, and the remodelling binding sites, relaxed binding of anchor residues in broad hydrophobic pockets and extension at the peptide C-terminus for promiscuous alleles. The first few studies for chicken class II molecules have already uncovered unanticipated structural features, including an allele that binds peptides by a decamer core. It seems likely that the understanding of how MHC molecules bind and present peptides to lymphocytes will broaden considerably with further unexpected discoveries through biochemical and structural studies for chickens and other non-mammalian vertebrates.",,661

Six leachates characterised by similar COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) but different BOD5/COD (Biochemical Oxygen demand/COD) and TOC/COD (Total Organic Carbon/COD) ratios were tested. By combining these ratios, the BOD5/TOC ratio was introduced to take into account the effect of both leachate properties (biodegradability and oxidation degree). Process treatment performance was significantly influenced by the quality of organic substances. Higher BOD5/TOC values (higher biodegradability and lower oxidation degree) resulted in a greater and faster larvae growth, with final wet weight of between 49.2 and 91.9mg/larva; lower mortality between 5 and 32%; higher prepupation percentages ranging from 4 to 21% and higher specific substrate consumption rate with values varying from 0.051 to 0.063 mgTOC/mg larva/d, up to 3-fold higher than values obtained using conventional activated sludge based on COD consumption. Conversely, no significant differences were detected in larvae protein and lipid contents, including the profiling of fatty acids.",,663
1108,35974511,Random-walk shielding-potential viscosity model for warm dense metals.,"We develop a model, called the random-walk shielding-potential viscosity model (RWSP-VM) that introduces the statistics of random-walk ions and the Debye shielding effect to describe the viscosities of warm dense metals. The viscosities of several metals with low to high atomic numbers (Be, Al, Fe, and U) are calculated using the analytical expression of RWSP-VM. Additionally, we simulate the viscosities of Fe and Be by employing the Langevin molecular dynamics (MD) and classical MD, while the MD data for Al and U are obtained from a previous work. The results of the RWSP-VM are in good agreement with the MD results, which validates the proposed model. Furthermore, we compare the RWSP-VM with the one-component plasma model and Yukawa viscosity model and show that the three models yield results in excellent agreement with each other in the regime where the RWSP-VM is applicable. These results indicate that the RWSP-VM is a universal, accurate, and highly efficient model for calculating the viscosity of metals in the warm dense state. The code of the proposed RWSP-VM is provided, and it is envisaged that it will have broad application prospects in numerous fields.",,664
1235,35971405,Sex differences in decision-making: Identifying multisensory behavioral differences in males and hermaphrodites.,"This present study uses C. elegans as a model to investigate how sex differences can influence sensory behavior and decision-making when encountering conflicting cues. We use a multi-sensory behavioral assay to characterize the differences between hermaphrodites and male worms when escaping from a food lawn during exposure to repulsive odors, such as, 2-nonanone. We find that male worms show a delayed food leaving during exposure to 2-nonanone when compared to hermaphrodite worms, and this is observed across multiple repulsive cues (2-nonanone and undiluted benzaldehyde) and multiple food types ( E. coli (OP50) and Comamonas sp ). Overall, this study provides a platform to further investigate how sensory-dependent decision-making behavior differs between sexes.",,665
2113,35967405,Case Report: Successful treatment of late-onset immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated membranous nephropathy in a patient with advanced renal cell carcinoma.,"Diagnosing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated nephritis can be challenging since it is a rare complication of therapy, associated with a spectrum of immune-mediated pathologies, and can present months after ICI therapy discontinuation (i.e., late-onset). ICIs are increasingly administered in combination with other cancer therapies with associated nephrotoxicity, further obfuscating the diagnosis of ICI-associated nephritis. In this report, we describe the first suspected case of late-onset ICI-associated membranous nephropathy (MN) in a patient with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who had discontinued ICI therapy 6 months prior to presentation. Prompt recognition of the suspected late-onset immune-related adverse event (irAE) resulted in the successful treatment of MN and continuation of RCC therapy. A 57-year-old man with metastatic clear cell RCC was responsive to third-line RCC therapy with lenvatinib (oral TKI) and everolimus (oral mTOR inhibitor) when he presented with nephrotic range proteinuria and acute kidney injury (AKI). His kidney biopsy revealed probable secondary MN with subendothelial and mesangial immune complex deposits and negative staining for both phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) and thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A). While a diagnosis of paraneoplastic MN could not be excluded, the patient was responding to cancer therapy and had tumor regression. However, 6 months prior to presentation, the patient had received pembrolizumab, an ICI, with his first-line RCC treatment. Due to concern that the patient may be presenting with late-onset ICI-associated MN, he was effectively treated with rituximab, which allowed for his continued RCC therapy. This report highlights the first case of suspected late-onset ICI-associated MN and the increasing complexity of recognizing renal irAEs. With the growing indications for the use of ICIs in combination with other cancer therapies, recognizing the various presentations of ICI-immune nephritis can help guide patient management and treatment.",,666
1496,35968391,EEG response in humans for frequency-tagged anticorrelated random-dot stereograms: Increased coherency and alpha oscillations.,"In humans, the presence of a neural mechanism triggered by anticorrelated random-dot stereograms have been theorized based on animal models from invasive studies, but have not been experimentally verified with the use of electroencephalography. In this study, we employed a phase-consistent, temporally modulated alternating depth stereogram stimulus, where we created anticorrelation by inverting the contrast between the eyes. We recorded the electrical response of the resulting brain oscillations of our four participants using EEG in both the correlated and anticorrelated conditions and whether they perceived depth movement. Our analysis found that the correlated stereograms elicited a strong coherency at the even harmonics of the depth alternation, and the anticorrelated stimulus created lower coherency peaks at the first harmonic of the depth alternation, even when participants did not report the depth movement to be visible. While both conditions created a diminishment of spectral power in the beta band, we found that the anticorrelated condition created increased spectral power in the alpha band. We experimentally verified the presence of a neural mechanism triggered by anticorrelated random-dot stereograms in the human brain with our coherency analysis and that it would not have been detected with the conventional spectral analysis due to the weakness of the response. We hypothesize that the decreased beta oscillations are related to either visual discomfort and visual attention to our stimulus, and that the increased alpha oscillations in the anticorrelated condition is a response to the incorrect depth information created by the stereogram.",,667
1971,35967636,Anti-monopoly supervision model of platform economy based on big data and sentiment.,"With the advent of the cloud computing era, big data technology has also developed rapidly. Due to the huge volume, variety, fast processing speed and low value density of big data, traditional data storage, extraction, transformation and analysis technologies are not suitable, so new solutions for big data application technologies are needed. However, with the development of economic theory and the practice of market economy, some links in the industrial chain of natural monopoly industries already have a certain degree of competitiveness. In this context, the article conducts a research on the anti-monopoly supervision mode of platform economy based on big data and sentiment analysis. This paper introduces the main idea of MapReduce, the current software implementation specifies a Map function that maps a set of key-value pairs into a new set of key-value pairs. It specifies a concurrent Reduce function that guarantees that each of all mapped key-value pairs share the same set of keys. establishes a vector space model, and basically realizes the extraction of text emotional elements. It introduces the theoretical controversy of antitrust regulation of predatory pricing behavior of third-party payment platforms, and conducted model experiments. The experimental results show that the throughput of 40 test users in 1 h of test is determined by two factors, QPS and the number of concurrent, where QPS = 40/(60*60) transactions/second. The time for each test user to log in to the system is 10 min, and the average response time is 10*60 s, then the number of concurrency = QPS*average response time = 40/(60*60)*10*60 = 6.66. This paper has successfully completed the research on the anti-monopoly supervision model of platform economy based on big data and sentiment analysis.",,668
1633,35968144,Genome-wide identification and functional exploration of the legume lectin genes in Brassica napus and their roles in Sclerotinia disease resistance.,"As one of the largest classes of lectins, legume lectins have a variety of desirable features such as antibacterial and insecticidal activities as well as anti-abiotic stress ability. The Sclerotinia disease (SD) caused by the soil-borne fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating disease affecting most oil crops such as Brassica napus. Here, we identified 130 legume lectin (LegLu) genes in B. napus, which could be phylogenetically classified into seven clusters. The BnLegLu gene family has been significantly expanded since the whole-genome duplication (WGD) or segmental duplication. Gene structure and conserved motif analysis suggested that the BnLegLu genes were well conserved in each cluster. Moreover, relative to those genes only containing the legume lectin domain in cluster VI-VII, the genes in cluster I-V harbored a transmembrane domain and a kinase domain linked to the legume lectin domain in the C terminus. The expression of most BnLegLu genes was relatively low in various tissues. Thirty-five BnLegLu genes were responsive to abiotic stress, and 40 BnLegLu genes were strongly induced by S. sclerotiorum, with a most significant up-regulation of 715-fold, indicating their functional roles in SD resistance. Four BnLegLu genes were located in the candidate regions of genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) results which resulted from a worldwide rapeseed population consisting of 324 accessions associated with SD. Among them, the positive role of BnLegLus-16 in SD resistance was validated by transient expression in tobacco leaves. This study provides important information on BnLegLu genes, particularly about their roles in SD resistance, which may help targeted functional research and genetic improvement in the breeding of B. napus.",,669
1657,35968117,Genome-wide identification of Cymbidium sinense WRKY gene family and the importance of its Group III members in response to abiotic stress.,"Transcription factors (TFs) of the WRKY family play pivotal roles in defense responses and secondary metabolism of plants. Although WRKY TFs are well documented in numerous plant species, no study has performed a genome-wide investigation of the WRKY gene family in Cymbidium sinense. In the present work, we found 64 C. sinense WRKY (CsWRKY) TFs, and they were further divided into eight subgroups. Chromosomal distribution of CsWRKYs revealed that the majority of these genes were localized on 16 chromosomes, especially on Chromosome 2. Syntenic analysis implied that 13 (20.31%) genes were derived from segmental duplication events, and 17 orthologous gene pairs were identified between Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY (AtWRKY) and CsWRKY genes. Moreover, 55 of the 64 CsWRKYs were detectable in different plant tissues in response to exposure to plant hormones. Among them, Group III members were strongly induced in response to various hormone treatments, indicating their potential essential roles in hormone signaling. We subsequently analyzed the function of CsWRKY18 in Group III. The CsWRKY18 was localized in the nucleus. The constitutive expression of CsWRKY18 in Arabidopsis led to enhanced sensitivity to ABA-mediated seed germination and root growth and elevated plant tolerance to abiotic stress within the ABA-dependent pathway. Overall, our study represented the first genome-wide characterization and functional analysis of WRKY TFs in C. sinense, which could provide useful clues about the evolution and functional description of CsWRKY genes.",,670
589,35977908,Association of sarcopenia and its components with clinical outcomes in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.,"Further studies are needed to identify whether muscle mass, muscle strength, or sarcopenia is the best indicator of survival in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). We aimed to compare the association of sarcopenia and its components with survival in patients undergoing PD. We identified all patients with prevalent PD (n = 199). We routinely recommended handgrip strength (HGS) and lean mass measurements using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in all patients with PD. Sarcopenia was defined using cutoff values from the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. We evaluated the patient and technique survival rates. The number of patients with low HGS was 95 (47.7%). The median follow-up interval was 17 months (interquartile range, 13-21 months). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that patients with low HGS or sarcopenia had poorer patient and technique survival compared with patients with normal HGS or without sarcopenia. Cox regression analysis showed that patients with low HGS had greater hazard ratios for patient death and technique failure compared with those with normal HGS. However, patients with low muscle mass did not show significant hazard ratios for patient death or technique failure compared with those with normal muscle mass. Patients with sarcopenia had significantly greater hazard ratios for patient death or technique failure than those without sarcopenia only in univariate analysis. The present study demonstrated that HGS may be superior to muscle mass or sarcopenia for predicting patient or technique survival in patients undergoing PD.",,671
2362,35967014,"Electronic Structures and Electrical Properties of Cr2+-, Cu2+-, Ni2+-, and Zn2+-Doped Sodium Titanate Nanotubes.","Sodium titanate nanotubes (Na-TNTs) and their metal-doped derivatives were prepared using simple hydrothermal and metal ion-exchange methods, respectively. The as-prepared doped materials were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The dielectric constant, the loss tangent, and the AC electrical conductivity of NaM-TNTs (where M = Cr, Cu, Ni, or Zn) were measured at selected frequencies (400 kHz and 2 MHz) as a function of temperature. The activation energy was calculated and reported at 400 kHz. All samples showed mixed ionic electronic conductivity. Some of the materials were used as examples for theoretically exploring structures and optoelectronic properties (density of states, reflectivity, absorption curve, refractive index, dielectric function, optical conductivity, and loss function) using density functional theory calculations. The band gaps of the materials were found to vary from 2.4 to 3.17 eV, which makes them suitable for many optoelectronic applications.",,672

1804,35967851,Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is predisposed to lasR mutation through up-regulated activity of efflux pumps in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients.,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a frequent opportunistic pathogen that causes significant mortality in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). Although the quorum sensing (QS) system is a potential target for treatment, lasR mutants that present with a QS-deficient phenotype have been frequently reported among clinical P. aeruginosa isolates. We aimed to investigate whether antibiotic resistance would select for lasR mutants during chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection and determine the mechanism underlying the phenomenon. We prospectively evaluated episodes of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections in NCFB patients over a 2-year period at two centers of our institution. QS phenotypic assessments and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of P. aeruginosa isolates were performed. Evolution experiments were conducted to confirm the emergence of lasR mutants in clinical MDR P. aeruginosa cultures. We analyzed episodes of P. aeruginosa infection among 97 NCFB patients and found only prior carbapenem exposure independently predictive of the isolation of MDR P. aeruginosa strains. Compared with non-MDR isolates, MDR isolates presented significantly QS-deficient phenotypes, which could not be complemented by the exogenous addition of 3OC12-HSL. The paired isolates showed that their QS-phenotype deficiency occurred after MDR was developed. Whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed that lasR nonsynonymous mutations were significantly more frequent in MDR isolates, and positive correlations of mutation frequencies were observed between genes of lasR and negative-efflux-pump regulators (nalC and mexZ). The addition of the efflux pump inhibitor PAβN could not only promote QS phenotypes of these MDR isolates but also delay the early emergence of lasR mutants in evolution experiments. Our data indicated that MDR P. aeruginosa was predisposed to lasR mutation through the upregulated activity of efflux pumps. These findings suggest that anti-QS therapy combined with efflux pump inhibitors might be a potential strategy for NCFB patients in the challenge of MDR P. aeruginosa infections.",,674
1070,35974549,Plasma environmental effects in the atomic structure for simulating x-ray free-electron-laser-heated solid-density matter.,"High energy density (HED) matter exists extensively in the Universe, and it can be created with extreme conditions in laboratory facilities such as x-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL). In HED matter, the electronic structure of individual atomic ions is influenced by a dense plasma environment, and one of the most significant phenomena is the ionization potential depression (IPD). Incorporation of the IPD effects is of great importance in accurate modeling of dense plasmas. All theoretical treatments of IPD so far have been based on the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, but its validity is questionable in ultrafast formation dynamics of dense plasmas, particularly when interacting with intense XFEL pulses. A treatment of transient IPD, based on an electronic-structure calculation of an atom in the presence of a plasma environment described by classical particles, has recently been proposed [Phys. Rev. E 103, 023203 (2021)2470-004510.1103/PhysRevE.103.023203], but its application to and impact on plasma dynamics simulations have not been investigated yet. In this work, we extend XMDYN, a hybrid quantum-classical approach combining Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics, by incorporating the proposed IPD treatment into plasma dynamics simulations. We demonstrate the importance of the IPD effects in theoretical modeling of aluminum dense plasmas by comparing two XMDYN simulations: one with electronic-structure calculations of isolated atoms (without IPD) and the other with those of atoms embedded in a plasma (with IPD). At equilibrium, the mean charge obtained in the plasma simulation with IPD is in good agreement with the full quantum-mechanical average-atom model. The present approach promises to be a reliable tool to simulate the creation and nonequilibrium evolution of dense plasmas induced by ultraintense and ultrashort XFEL pulses.",,675
863,35974860,A Comprehensive Analysis of Myocarditis in Formerly Healthy Individuals Following SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination (COVID-19 Immunization).,"Due to the rapid development of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expedited the authorization of immunizations to counteract life-threatening COVID-19 effects. COVID-19 immunization was seen as an essential component of surviving endemically with COVID-19. Although there were no major adverse event reports that mandated an early authorization of the mass vaccination approval in initial studies, a few significant adverse events were reported after real-world usage. The most prevalent adverse events are regional reactions, such as discomfort at the injection site. Anaphylactic shock and acute responses were quite infrequent. Current evidence strongly convince the community that the advantages of immunization outweigh the risks. The review investigates the potential adverse reaction in the form of myocarditis caused by the COVID-19 vaccine. Age, sexuality, vaccination type, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic modalities were among the confounding factors associated with vaccine-induced myocarditis. This picture depicts COVID-19 immunization-induced myocarditis and the treatment options available to practitioners. Further evaluation is needed to establish the underlying cause of this association. We compiled the most recent data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced myocarditis after reviewing available research. Information sources including PubMed and Google Scholar were evaluated retrospectively.",,676
946,35974739,Multivariate versus traditional quantitative phase analysis of X-ray powder diffraction and fluorescence data of mixtures showing preferred orientation and microabsorption.,"In materials and earth science, but also in chemistry, pharmaceutics and engineering, the quantification of elements and crystal phases in solid samples is often essential for a full characterization of materials. The most frequently used techniques for this purpose are X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for elemental analysis and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) for phase analysis. In both methods, relations between signal and quantity do exist but they are expressed in terms of complex equations including many parameters related to both sample and instruments, and the dependence on the active element or phase amounts to be determined is convoluted among those parameters. Often real-life samples hold relations not suitable for a direct quantification and, therefore, estimations based only on the values of the relative intensities are affected by large errors. Preferred orientation (PO) and microabsorption (MA) in XRPD cannot usually be avoided, and traditional corrections in Rietveld refinement, such as the Brindley MA correction, are not able, in general, to restore the correct phase quantification. In this work, a multivariate approach, where principal component analysis is exploited alone or combined with regression methods, is used on XRPD profiles collected on ad hoc designed mixtures to face and overcome the typical problems of traditional approaches. Moreover, the partial or no known crystal structure (PONKCS) method was tested on XRPD data, as an example of a hybrid approach between Rietveld and multivariate approaches, to correct for the MA effect. Particular attention is given to the comparison and selection of both method and pre-process, the two key steps for good performance when applying multivariate methods to obtain reliable quantitative estimations from XRPD data, especially when MA and PO are present. A similar approach was tested on XRF data to deal with matrix effects and compared with the more classical fundamental-parameter approach. Finally, useful indications to overcome the difficulties of the general user in managing the parameters for a successful application of multivariate approaches for XRPD and XRF data analysis are given.",,677
394,35979280,Two smoking-related lesions in the same pulmonary lobe of squamous cell carcinoma and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis: A case report.,Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) is a rare cystic lung disease usually affecting young adults. It is predicted that PLCH is a lung tumor precursor associated with dysfunction of the myeloid dendritic cells in the lung. A 70-year-old male patient presented with chronic cough and sputum. He had symptoms for 5 years and described shortness of breath on exertion for the previous 3 years. He had a 60 packs/year smoking history. Computerized tomography of the thorax revealed an 11-mm nodule in the right lung lower lobe superior segment and a 7-mm nodule in the right lung lower lobe poster basal segment. Those two nodules were resected by means of right thoracoscopic surgery. Pathological evaluation revealed a squamous cell carcinoma and PLCH. Coexistent squamous cell carcinoma and PLCH suggest possible association between PLCH and lung cancer.,,678

654,35975833,Structure stabilization effect of vacancies and entropy in hexagonal WN.,"The structural stability of hexagonal tungsten mononitride (WN) has been studied combining scanning transmission electron microscopy and first-principles calculations. The results show that the WC-type WN with vacancies of 6∼8 at% is more stable than the previously proposed MnP-type and NiAs-type structures. Due to the larger vibrational entropy of the WC-type WN, the vacancy concentration required to stabilize the WC-type structure is lower at high temperatures. The results demonstrate the importance of vacancies and configurational and vibrational entropies in the structural stability of compounds synthesized at high temperatures.",,680
74,35983413,When Less Is More: Identifying Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Engaging in Unnecessary Blood Glucose Monitoring.,"This study examined whether certain patient characteristics are associated with the prescribing of self-monitoring of blood glucose for patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin and have well-controlled blood glucose. Against recommendations, one-third of the patient sample from a large health network in North Carolina (N = 9,338) received a prescription for testing supplies (i.e., strips or lancets) within the prior 18 months. Women, African Americans, individuals prescribed an oral medication, nonsmokers, and those who were underweight or normal weight all had greater odds of receiving such a prescription. These results indicate that providers may have prescribing tendencies that are potentially biased against more vulnerable patient groups and contrary to guidelines.",,681
2359,35967017,Research on the Effect of Freeze-Thaw Cycles at Different Temperatures on the Pore Structure of Water-Saturated Coal Samples.,"To study the pore structure transformation of coal at different temperatures, freeze-thaw cycle experiments at different temperature intervals (20 to -20 °C, 20 to -40 °C, 20 to -196 °C) were carried out. The low-field nuclear magnetic resonance equipment was used to characterize the peak area, pore size distribution, and pore number of each group of coal samples. The pore transformation effect of coal samples at different temperature intervals was compared, and the change characteristics of the pore structure of coal samples under the freeze-thaw action were explored. The research shows that the freeze-thaw cycles at different freezing temperature intervals have obvious differences in the effect of coal pore transformation. The area of each peak spectrum in the T 2 distribution curve of coal samples increased significantly under the action of freeze-thaw cycles in different freezing temperature intervals. The increased value of the number of mesopores and macropores shows the phenomenon of first increase and then decrease with the increase of the temperature difference. There is a quadratic function relationship between the temperature difference in the freezing temperature interval and the proportion change rate of the adsorption pore or seepage pore. The continuous increase of the temperature difference has a certain marginal effect on the proportion change rate of seepage pores and adsorption pores in coal.",,682
2380,35966993,Exploring how healthcare teams balance the neurodynamics of autonomous and collaborative behaviors: a proof of concept.,"Team members co-regulate their activities and move together at the collective level of behavior while coordinating their actions toward shared goals. In parallel with team processes, team members need to resolve uncertainties arising from the changing task and environment. In this exploratory study we have measured the differential neurodynamics of seven two-person healthcare teams across time and brain regions during autonomous (taskwork) and collaborative (teamwork) segments of simulation training. The questions posed were: (1) whether these abstract and mostly integrated constructs could be separated neurodynamically; and, (2) what could be learned about taskwork and teamwork by trying to do so? The taskwork and teamwork frameworks used were Neurodynamic Information (NI), an electroencephalography (EEG) derived measure shown to be a neurodynamic proxy for the pauses and hesitations associated with individual uncertainty, and inter-brain EEG coherence (IBC) which is a required component of social interactions. No interdependency was observed between NI and IBC, and second-by-second dynamic comparisons suggested mutual exclusivity. These studies show that proxies for fundamental properties of teamwork and taskwork can be separated neurodynamically during team performances of ecologically valid tasks. The persistent expression of NI and IBC were not simultaneous suggesting that it may be difficult for team members to maintain inter-brain coherence while simultaneously reducing their individual uncertainties. Lastly, these separate dynamics occur over time frames of 15-30 s providing time for real-time detection and mitigation of individual and collaborative complications during training or live patient encounters.",,683
1300,35970647,Post-transplant diabetes mellitus following heart transplantation.,"Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is common following heart transplant, impacting greater than 20% of patients with most cases occurring in the first year after transplant. PTDM is associated with multiple negative sequelae including increased post-operative infections, a higher rate of renal failure, and increased mortality. Compared with pre-transplant diabetes mellitus, PTDM has several unique risk factors and immunosuppressive medications play an important role in disease pathophysiology. Newer treatments for hyperglycemia, including glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, may counter the mechanisms of immunosuppression-related hyperglycemia making them an appealing treatment option for patients with PTDM. Here, we review the definitions, incidence, risk factors, pathophysiology, clinical outcomes, treatment options, pharmacologic considerations, and future directions in PTDM.",,684
1034,35974585,Dust mobilization in the presence of magnetic fields.,"We present a study of surface dust mobilization due to photoelectric charging in the presence of a magnetic field. Dust mobilization is observed to be inhibited in certain regions and is correlated with the orientation of the magnetic field. The recent patched charge model, which describes a mechanism for dust charging and mobilization, is extended to explain the effects of magnetic fields seen in our laboratory results. We propose that ambient electrons collected in photoemitting areas precipitate changes in the emission and reabsorption of photoelectrons inside microcavities between dust grains. This affects the charging, repulsion, and subsequent mobilization of the dust grains surrounding the microcavities. The magnetic field controls the movement of ambient electrons across the dusty surface, resulting in active and inactive regions of dust mobilization. Computer simulations show that regions of ambient electron accumulation as imposed by the magnetic field match the areas of high dust activity.",,685
790,35975047,A facile synthesis of CuSe nanosheets for high-performance sodium-ion hybrid capacitors.,"Due to the low price and abundant reserves of sodium resources, sodium-ion batteries have become the main candidate for the next generation of energy storage equipment, particularly for large-scale grid storage and low-speed electric vehicles. Transition metal selenides have attracted considerable attention because of their high reversible capacity, superior electrical conductivity and versatile structures. In this study, two-dimensional CuSe nanosheets are synthesized via a simple hydrothermal reaction. When acting as an electrode material for sodium-ion batteries, the CuSe electrode exhibits an initial coulombic efficiency of 96.7% at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 and a specific capacity of 330 mA h g-1 after 100 operation cycles, as well as retains a specific capacity of 211 mA h g-1 even at a high current density of 10 A g-1. Moreover, the anode delivers a specific capacity of 236 mA h g-1 after 3300 cycles at 5 A g-1 with a capacity retention of 91.2%. In sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SHICs) with the two-dimensional CuSe nanosheets and Ti3C2T x MXene as the negative and positive materials, respectively, the nanosheets without any pre-sodiation present a lifespan of up to 2000 cycles at 2 A g-1 and a capacity retention of about 77.7%.",,686
1144,35973822,Acromioclavicular dislocation associated with scapular fractures - pathoanatomy of the injury.,"No detailed study dealing with an injury to the AC joint in combination with scapular fractures has been published to date. The aim of this study is to describe pathoanatomy of these injuries. In a series of 519 scapular fractures in adult patients from the period of 20022020 we identified a total of 20 (3.9%) cases associated with AC dislocation. The group comprised 17 men and 3 women with the mean age of 49 years (range, 2178). Radiographs of the shoulder joint followed by CT examination, including 3D reconstructions, were performed in all patients. This documentation allowed assessment of the scapular fracture pattern and type of injury to the AC joint. AC dislocation was associated with a simple scapular fracture in 15 cases (7 fractures of the coracoid base, 4 fractures of the acromion or the lateral spine, 2 fractures of the scapular body, 1 fracture of the superior and 1 fracture of the inferior glenoid). In 5 cases AC dislocation accompanied multiple or complex scapular fractures (once a combination of a coracoid fracture and a fracture of the lateral scapular spine, once a combination of a fracture of the superior glenoid and of the acromion, 2 cases of a complex intraarticular fracture and 1 case of scapulothoracic dissociation). AC dislocation is relatively infrequent injury accompanying scapular fractures. It is most commonly associated with fractures of coracoid, acromion/lateral spine or superior glenoid. No case of AC dislocation was recorded in a fracture of the scapular neck.",,687
2107,35967411,ELISA based assays to measure adenosine deaminases concentration in serum and saliva for the diagnosis of ADA2 deficiency and cancer.,"Adenosine deaminases (ADAs) are enzymes of purine metabolism converting adenosine to inosine. There are two types of ADAs in humans ADA1 and ADA2. While both ADA1 and ADA2 share the same substrate, they differ in expression, cellular localization, and catalytic properties. The genetic deficiency of ADA1 results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), while lack in ADA2 (DADA2) results in multiple phenotypes ranging from systemic inflammation to vascular pathology. Clinical studies have shown that the levels of ADAs in biological fluids are altered in pathophysiological conditions, suggesting that ADA activity could be a convenient marker for the diagnosis of immune diseases and cancer. Here, we describe sensitive and straightforward ELISA assays to measure ADA1 and ADA2 concentrations in biological fluids. Analysis of the serum and saliva samples from the healthy controls and DADA2 patients revealed that ADA2 enzyme concentration is significantly lower in patients than in healthy controls. In contrast, the concentration of ADA2 increases in the serum of patients with large granular leukocyte leukemia (LGLL) and patients' saliva with head and neck cancer. Thus, this simple, non-invasive method allows for distinguishing healthy controls from the affected patient. It can be implemented in screening and diagnosis of DADA2 and follow up the treatment of LGLL and several types of head and neck cancer.",,688
1203,35971742,Merlin immunohistochemistry is useful in diagnosis of tumours within the spectrum of biphasic hyalinizing psammomatous renal cell carcinoma.,"Biphasic hyalinizing psammomatous (BHP) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a newly described emerging entity within the spectrum of papillary RCC in the WHO 2022 classification. Molecular analyses have discovered that BHP RCC consistently harbour somatic mutations in the neurofibromin 2 (NF2) gene. The NF2 gene product, merlin, is known to primarily function as a tumour suppressor. Merlin protein loss correlates closely with the presence of NF2 mutations in benign and malignant tumours arising in different sites. In the present study we explored the role of merlin immunohistochemistry (IHC) in tumours within the spectrum of BHP RCC to determine the diagnostic utility of this marker. We performed merlin IHC in 13 BHP RCC, 18 papillary RCC, 10 TFE3-translocation RCC, 15 TFEB-altered RCC (including 13 TFEB-rearranged and 2 TFEB-amplified), and 10 mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinomas of unknown mutational status. Unequivocal loss of merlin expression in >90% of the tumour cells was observed in 12/13 BHP-RCC (92%), with the remaining tumour demonstrating weak focal cytoplasmic expression in ~10% of the tumour. In contrast, merlin was diffusely or multifocally expressed in all papillary RCC, TFE3-translocation RCC, and TFEB-altered RCC, as well as in 70% of mucinous tubular and spindle carcinomas. In this study, merlin IHC was ~92% sensitive and ~94% specific for BHP RCC. These data suggest that merlin IHC is a reliable surrogate marker for the presence of underlying NF2 gene inactivation, being diagnostically useful to identify BHP RCC. In this study, merlin IHC was ~92% sensitive and ~94% specific for BHP RCC. These data suggest that merlin IHC is a reliable surrogate marker for the presence of underlying NF2 gene inactivation, being diagnostically useful to identify BHP RCC.",,689
203,35982818,Ex vivo Measurement of the Radioactivity of PET/CT-Guided Biopsy Specimen: Is it Helpful to Confirm the Sampling from a Viable Region of the Tumor and the Nature of the Lesion?,"Ex vivo radioactivity measurement of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-guided biopsy tissue specimen to check the viable tumor sampling and predict the nature of the biopsied lesion. We prospectively evaluated the retrieved tissue specimens during PET/CT-guided biopsies for the presence of radioactivity. The qualitative radioactivity was measured by acquiring PET/CT images of the specimen. For quantitative analysis, a multichannel-analyzer (MCA) was used, and a counting-factor (CF) in counts/mCi.mm3 was calculated based on background-corrected net-counts, tissue-volume (mm3), and exponential tracer-activity during biopsy (mCi). The CF-values were compared with the 2-(fluorine-18) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-avidity in the target lesion and correlated with the histopathology. A total of 49 patients (30 males) aged 51.8 ± 17.8 years were recruited for the biopsy, and radioactivity was measured. All the specimens revealed the presence of radioactivity on PET/CT images of the specimens and MCA counting. The mean CF-values were 17.2 ± 15.6 counts/mCi.mm3. One sample had meager counts with a CF-value of 0.162 and was subjected to re-biopsy after repositioning the coaxial needle to the hypermetabolic site. Pathological diagnosis was established in all the patients (malignancy-29, benign-20). The CF-values were significantly higher in malignant lesions than benign (21.45 ± 18.05 vs. 10.76 ± 8.96 counts/mCi.mm3, P = 0.025). CF-values and maximum standardized uptake value had a significant correlation (Pearson's r = 0.457, P = 0.001). The ex vivo measurement of the radioactivity of retrieved tissue specimens during PET/CT-guided biopsy helps to confirm the sampling from viable region and a highly practical approach to avoid erroneous sampling of a lesion with a large necrotic area. It is also helpful in predicting the nature of the biopsied lesion before the histopathological analysis.",,690
1600,35968284,Quantitative EEG parameters can improve the predictive value of the non-traumatic neurological ICU patient prognosis through the machine learning method.,"Better outcome prediction could assist in reliable classification of the illnesses in neurological intensive care unit (ICU) severity to support clinical decision-making. We developed a multifactorial model including quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) parameters for outcome prediction of patients in neurological ICU. We retrospectively analyzed neurological ICU patients from November 2018 to November 2021. We used 3-month mortality as the outcome. Prediction models were created using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based on QEEG parameters, APACHEII score, and clinically relevant features. Additionally, we compared our best models with APACHEII score and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The DeLong test was carried out to compare the ROC curves in different models. A total of 110 patients were included and divided into a training set (n=80) and a validation set (n = 30). The best performing model had an AUC of 0.85 in the training set and an AUC of 0.82 in the validation set, which were better than that of GCS (training set 0.64, validation set 0.61). Models in which we selected only the 4 best QEEG parameters had an AUC of 0.77 in the training set and an AUC of 0.71 in the validation set, which were similar to that of APACHEII (training set 0.75, validation set 0.73). The models also identified the relative importance of each feature. Multifactorial machine learning models using QEEG parameters, clinical data, and APACHEII score have a better potential to predict 3-month mortality in non-traumatic patients in neurological ICU.",,691
56,35983473,Areata-Like Lupus as a Clinical Manifestation of Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus.,"Lupus erythematosus (LE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that frequently causes hair loss and scalp lesions. Hair loss can be scarring and nonscarring, diffuse, or patchy. The nonscarring patchy alopecia is usually related to systemic LE (SLE) and may simulate alopecia areata (AA), reason why it is named areata-like lupus. Our case was diagnosed with areata-like lupus but did not meet criteria for SLE. A 63-year-old woman presented with irregular nonscarring patchy alopecia in the temporal and frontoparietal scalp. Trichoscopy showed exclamation mark hairs, vellus hairs, and sparse yellow dots. Histology revealed epidermal vacuolar interface dermatitis, lymphohistiocytic infiltrate around the bulbs of anagen follicles, and eccrine glands. Direct immunofluorescence showed deposits of C3, IgA, and IgG in the basement membrane zone. Patients with cutaneous LE can also manifest as nonscarring patchy alopecia that is clinically similar to AA, despite the absence of systemic manifestations. Areata-like lupus is secondary to the lupus autoimmune infiltrate that affects the skin including the hair follicles. Trichoscopy, histology, and direct immunofluorescence are important to differentiate this form of alopecia from AA, which is believed to have a higher incidence in lupus patients.",,692
1769,35967906,Improving antibody thermostability based on statistical analysis of sequence and structural consensus data.,"The use of Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs) as therapeutics has been increasing over the past 30 years due to their high specificity and strong affinity toward the target. One of the major challenges toward their use as drugs is their low thermostability, which impacts both efficacy as well as manufacturing and delivery. To aid the design of thermally more stable mutants, consensus sequence-based method has been widely used. These methods typically have a success rate of about 50% with maximum melting temperature increment ranging from 10 to 32°C. To improve the prediction performance, we have developed a new and fast MAbs specific method by adding a 3D structural layer to the consensus sequence method. This is done by analyzing the close-by residue pairs which are conserved in >800 MAbs' 3D structures. Combining consensus sequence and structural residue pair covariance methods, we developed an in-house application for predicting human MAb thermostability to guide protein engineers to design stable molecules. Major advantage of this structural level assessment is in significantly reducing the false positives by almost half from the consensus sequence method alone. This application has shown success in designing MAb engineering panels in multiple biologics programs. Our data science-based method shows impacts in Mab engineering.",,693
229,35982791,Computer vision for assessing species color pattern variation from web-based community science images.,"Openly available community science digital vouchers provide a wealth of data to study phenotypic change across space and time. However, extracting phenotypic data from these resources requires significant human effort. Here, we demonstrate a workflow and computer vision model for automatically categorizing species color pattern from community science images. Our work is focused on documenting the striped/unstriped color polymorphism in the Eastern Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus). We used an ensemble convolutional neural network model to analyze this polymorphism in 20,318 iNaturalist images. Our model was highly accurate (∼98%) despite image heterogeneity. We used the resulting annotations to document extensive niche overlap between morphs, but wider niche breadth for striped morphs at the range-wide scale. Our work showcases key design principles for using machine learning with heterogeneous community science image data to address questions at an unprecedented scale.",,694
1442,35968456,What effects of COVID-19 on regional economic resilience? Evidence from 31 provinces in China.,"After the 2008 global financial crisis, more and more scholars began to focus on economic resilience. In 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 made the public aware of the importance of regional economies to resist and adapt to external shocks. Based on cross-sectional data from 2020 and 2021, this paper uses causal inference counterfactual to assess the regional economic resilience of various Chinese provinces under the COVID-19 pandemic, and analyzes the determinants of regional economic resilience through geographic detector models. It is found that (1) from the regional perspective, the eastern and central regions are the first to be affected by the epidemic, and their economic resistance is lower than the national average, but the eastern and central regions can stabilize the development trend of the epidemic earlier; (2) from the perspective of provinces, developed provinces are more vulnerable to the epidemic in the early stages than backward provinces; (3) government forces and social environment play an important role in regional economic resistance and adaptation in the initial stage of epidemic impact. Therefore, at the critical moment of China's post-epidemic economic recovery, it should be noted that the regional response to the epidemic depends on the path of action and the specific environment, and cannot be one-size-fits-all. Pay close attention to the key role of government and the management of risk prevention. The region has established sound public health policies, systems and mechanisms.",,695
1460,35968438,Anxiety and depression in dry eye patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: Mental state investigation and influencing factor analysis.,"Investigate the anxiety and depression states among dry eye (DE) patients during the COVID-19 outbreak and analyze their influence factors. The study was conducted in a tertiary eye hospital in Tianjin, China from March-April 2021. Four hundred twenty-eight DE patients were tested with the Ocular Surface Disease Index, Short Healthy Anxiety Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive statistics was used to assess the difference between DE with depression or anxiety among different groups. And multiple linear regression was used to explore factors that influence anxiety and depression in DE patients. The incidence rates of anxiety and depression among DE patients during COVID-19 were 27.34 and 26.87%, respectively. The proportion with comorbid anxiety and depression was 24.30%. Patients' education level (t = -3.001, P < 0.05; t = -3.631, P < 0.05), course of disease (t = 2.341, P < 0.05; t = 2.444, P < 0.05), health anxiety (t = 3.015, P < 0.05; t = 2.731, P < 0.05), and subjective sleep quality (t = 3.610, P < 0.05; t = 4.203, P < 0.05) had certain influences on anxiety and depression. The results showed that subjective symptoms of DE patients were related to depression and anxiety. Higher education, shorter disease duration, lower health anxiety levels, and better subjective sleep quality were associated with the reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms in DE patients. These findings could be deemed beneficial to the treatment and prevention of DE during the COVID-19 epidemic.",,696
978,35974641,Slow dynamics and large deviations in classical stochastic Fredkin chains.,"The Fredkin spin chain serves as an interesting theoretical example of a quantum Hamiltonian whose ground state exhibits a phase transition between three distinct phases, one of which violates the area law. Here we consider a classical stochastic version of the Fredkin model, which can be thought of as a simple exclusion process subject to additional kinetic constraints, and study its classical stochastic dynamics. The ground-state phase transition of the quantum chain implies an equilibrium phase transition in the stochastic problem, whose properties we quantify in terms of numerical matrix product states (MPSs). The stochastic model displays slow dynamics, including power-law decaying autocorrelation functions and hierarchical relaxation processes due to exponential localization. Like in other kinetically constrained models, the Fredkin chain has a rich structure in its dynamical large deviations-which we compute accurately via numerical MPSs-including an active-inactive phase transition and a hierarchy of trajectory phases connected to particular equilibrium states of the model. We also propose, via its height field representation, a generalization of the Fredkin model to two dimensions in terms of constrained dimer coverings of the honeycomb lattice.",,697
1696,35968074,"A surveillance for hepatitis C virus infection in northeastern, Thailand: a 10-year cohort.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an infection that may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Most patients with HCV infection are asymptomatic. The previous study conducted in age group of 30-64 years and in two provinces. Additionally, most surveillance studies conducted in a point period; not longitudinally. This study aimed to evaluate HCV infection rate in all age groups in the northeastern, Thailand in a longitudinal fashion. This was a surveillance study conducted in 20 provinces of northeastern, Thailand. The study period was between July 2010 and November 2019. During the surveillance, demographic data of participants were collected. HCV screening test was performed in each participant by using a rapid point-of-care assay. Rates of HCV infection in each province and in overall were calculated. During the surveillance period, there were 31,855 subjects who participated the project. Of those, 1,285 subjects (4.037%) were tested positive for HCV infection (Tab. I). The HCV infection rate was highest in 2011 (8.98%): ranges 1.28 to 9.59%. The age group of over 50 years had 690 subjects with HCV infection (5.45%) out of 12,660 subjected tested in this age group. There was significant different among age groups (p < 0.001) and difference of age over 30 years and sex (p 0.043). This longitudinal surveillance showed that HCV infection rates in northeastern, Thailand were varied across the provinces with the highest rate of 9.59%. The HCV infection should be aware in male with age over 30 years.",,698
2005,35967582,Non-myeloablative conditioning is sufficient to achieve complete donor myeloid chimerism following matched sibling donor bone marrow transplant for myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) mutation-driven congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia: Case report.,"Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) is a rare platelet production disorder caused mainly by loss of function biallelic mutations in myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL), the gene encoding the thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR). Patients with MPL-mutant CAMT are not only at risk for life-threatening bleeding events, but many affected individuals will also ultimately develop bone marrow aplasia owing to the absence of thrombopoietin/TPOR signaling required for maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells. Curative allogeneic stem cell transplant for patients with CAMT has historically used myeloablative conditioning; however, given the inherent stem cell defect in MPL-mutant CAMT, a less intensive regimen may prove equally effective with reduced morbidity, particularly in patients with evolving aplasia. We report the case of a 2-year-old boy with MPL-mutant CAMT and bone marrow hypocellularity who underwent matched sibling donor bone marrow transplant (MSD-BMT) using a non-myeloablative regimen consisting of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). The patient achieved rapid trilinear engraftment and resolution of thrombocytopenia. While initial myeloid donor chimerism was mixed (88% donor), due to the competitive advantage of donor hematopoietic cells, myeloid chimerism increased to 100% by 4 months post-transplant. Donor chimerism and blood counts remained stable through 1-year post-transplant. This experience suggests that non-myeloablative conditioning is a suitable approach for patients with MPL-mutant CAMT undergoing MSD-BMT and is associated with reduced risks of conditioning-related toxicity compared to traditional myeloablative regimens.",,699
275,35981955,Novel androgen therapies including selective androgen receptor modulators.,"Male hypogonadism is associated with reduced quality of life and the development of co-morbidities including obesity, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidaemia. The mainstay of treatment for male hypogonadism is testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). However, TRT has recognised side effects including impaired spermatogenesis and there are concerns regarding its use in men with concurrent cardiovascular disease. Thus, there has been an impetus to develop novel androgen therapies for treating male hypogonadism to mitigate the side effects of TRT. This review will discuss the benefits and adverse effects of TRT, and novel therapies including nasal testosterone, aromatase inhibitors, selective oestrogen receptor modulators, and selective androgen receptor modulators.",,700
303,35980779,Psychosocial stress and HPA-axis stress reactivity: variations by race and socioeconomic status among adults at risk of diabetes.,"While stress is posited to play a key role in health disparities, the extent to which commonly used self-report psychosocial stress measures are related to neurobiological stress processes, especially across diverse populations, is unresolved. This study examined how two measures of psychosocial stress, perceived stress and domain-specific stress, covary with the acute neurobiological stress response. The Richmond Stress and Sugar Study includes a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort of adults at risk for type 2 diabetes (n = 125; mean age 57 years, 48% black, and 61% high neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES)). Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity was assessed by salivary cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a laboratory stressor. Higher perceived stress was associated with a lower cortisol response to the TSST [-7.5%; 95% CI: -13.1%, -1.5%], but was not associated with cortisol recovery after the TSST [3%; 95% CI: -0.6%, 6.8%]. In contrast, domain-specific stress was not associated with cortisol response [-2.1%; 95%CI: -20.7%, 20.9%], but was inversely associated with cortisol recovery [3.7%; 95%CI: 0.6%, 7.0%]. SES modified these associations: both perceived stress and domain-specific stress were associated with TSST cortisol response only among participants from high SES neighborhoods. There was minimal evidence of effect-modification by race. Both self-report measures of psychosocial stress were associated with HPA-axis reactivity to an acute stressor. These associations varied by perceived vs. domain-specific measurement scales and by neighborhood SES. Further efforts to refine stress measures and clarify biological linkages between social status and health are needed.",,701

The resulting quinoline derivatives showed significant ability to reduce the GLI1 protein level and were characterized by submicromolar antiproliferative activity toward human melanoma A375 and medulloblastoma DAOY cell lines. Decoration of the quinoline ring and chemical rigidification to an oxazino-quinoline scaffold allowed us to deduce SAR considerations for future ligand optimization.,,702
58,35983471,Chronic Retronychia: Nonsurgical Treatment.,"Retronychia is a particular form of post-traumatic ingrown nail associated with repeated microtrauma of the underside of the proximal nail fold. It is caused by the nail embedding backward into the underside of the proximal nail fold, forming multiple generations of nail plate. The study aims to evaluate the results of a novel nonsurgical treatment of retronychia. A review was performed on 20 patients who underwent the treatment, 16 having suffered from a chronic form of the condition, with the remaining 4 being afflicted with retronychia for less than a year prior to treatment. The treatment was a combination of eliminating the proximal sharp edge of the uppermost nail layer and thinning of the nail with fraises and drills of various sizes. This therapy was repeated every 7-14 days. The patients came for checkup every 6 weeks. Treatment duration varied from 2 to 14 months. The rate, at which the appearance of a healthy nail occurred depended on the length of the intact nail layer below the part of the nail affected by retronychia, the age of the patient, and cofactors such as obesity, diabetes, etc. The treatment result in our case study was completely healthy nail growth without relapse of retronychia in all the 20 patients for a follow-up period of 18 months. By combining a healthy nail growth and the simultaneous protection of the nail, we were able to achieve a normal nail in all cases. In order to maintain the achieved results, we recommended our patients to continue wearing protective tubes whenever they would wear closed shoes because recurrence of retronychia may occur even after minimal trauma.",,703
55,35983491,Therapeutic Uses and Pharmacological Properties of Shallot (Allium ascalonicum): A Systematic Review.,"Shallot (Allium ascalonicum L.) is a traditional plant species used throughout the world both for culinary purposes and as a folk remedy. To date (i.e., April 2022), there is no report on the main pharmacological activities exerted by shallot preparations and/or extracts. The aim of this study was to comprehensively review the pharmacological activities exerted by shallot, with rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria based on the scientific rigor of studies. Prisma guidelines were followed to perform the literature search. The literature search yielded 2,410 articles of which 116 passed the required rigorous criteria for inclusion in this review. The extracts exert a potent antioxidant activity both in vitro and in vivo, as well as a strong inhibitory capacity on various pathogens with relevant implications for public health. Moreover, shallot can be used as adjuvant therapy in cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer prevention, and other non-communicable diseases associated with inflammatory and oxidative pathways. Future studies investigating the chemical composition of this species, as well as the molecular mechanisms involved in the empirically observed pharmacological actions are required.",,704
2213,35967305,A Cross-Tissue Transcriptome-Wide Association Study Identifies Novel Susceptibility Genes for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis in Asia and Europe.,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease in children, and its pathogenesis is still unclear. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of JIA have identified hundreds of risk factors, but few of them implicated specific biological mechanisms. A cross-tissue transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was performed with the functional summary-based imputation software (FUSION) tool based on GWAS summary datasets (898 JIA patients and 346,102 controls from BioBank Japan (BBJ)/FinnGen). The gene expression reference weights of skeletal muscle and the whole blood were obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTExv8) project. JIA-related genes identified by TWAS findings genes were further compared with the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified by the mRNA expression profile of JIA from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number: GSE1402). Last, candidate genes were analyzed using functional enrichment and annotation analysis by Metascape to examine JIA-related gene sets. The TWAS identified 535 significant genes with P < 0.05 and contains 350 for Asian and 195 for European (including 10 genes both expressed in Asian and European), such as CDC16 (P = 1.72E-03) and PSMD5-AS1 (P = 3.65E-02). Eight overlapping genes were identified based on TWAS results and DEGs of JIA patients, such as SIRPB1 (P TWAS = 4.21E-03, P DEG = 1.50E-04) and FRAT2 (P TWAS = 2.82E-02, P DEG = 1.43E-02). Pathway enrichment analysis of TWAS identified 183 pathways such as cytokine signaling in the immune system and cell adhesion molecules. By integrating the results of DEGs pathway and process enrichment analyses, 19 terms were identified such as positive regulation of T-cell activation. By conducting two populations TWAS, we identified a group of JIA-associated genes and pathways, which may provide novel clues to uncover the pathogenesis of JIA.",,705
1125,35974494,Reconstructing distant interactions of multiple paths between perceptible nodes in dark networks.,"Quantitative research of interdisciplinary fields, including biological and social systems, has attracted great attention in recent years. Complex networks are popular and important tools for the investigations. Explosively increasing data are created by practical networks, from which useful information about dynamic networks can be extracted. From data to network structure, i.e., network reconstruction, is a crucial task. There are many difficulties in fulfilling network reconstruction, including data shortage (existence of hidden nodes) and time delay for signal propagation between adjacent nodes. In this paper a deep network reconstruction method is proposed, which can work in the conditions that even only two nodes (say A and B) are perceptible and all other network nodes are hidden. With a well-designed stochastic driving on node A, this method can reconstruct multiple interaction paths from A to B based on measured data. The distance, effective intensity, and transmission time delay of each path can be inferred accurately.",,706

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of knowledge management capabilities (KMC) in new product development performance with the mediating role of organizational agility. Additionally, this study also intends to examine the moderating role of business model innovation on the relationship of KMC with organizational agility. This study was conducted on the Chinese automobile sector, and the NPD project managers, supervisors, and engineers of the sector were respondents of this study. A survey questionnaire was used to collect the data from 201 respondents, and data were analyzed using the Smart PLS 3 software. The findings of this research, although limited to the automobile industries, indicate that knowledge sharing and knowledge application have significant and positive effects on the development of new products. Organizational agility significantly mediates the relationship of KMC with NPD. The results found that business model innovation has a significant moderating role in the relationship between KMC and organizational agility. Moreover, the results of this study will assist the managers in developing a modern competitive business environment by implicating KMC in the process of NPD. Lastly, organizations may improve the sustainability of their product and their overall performance by using organizational agility and modern ways of value delivery.",,707
1019,35974600,Nanoparticle transport within non-Newtonian fluid flow in porous media.,"Control over dispersion of nanoparticles in polymer solutions through porous media is important for subsurface applications such as soil remediation and enhanced oil recovery. Dispersion is affected by the spatial heterogeneity of porous media, the non-Newtonian behavior of polymer solutions, and the Brownian motion of nanoparticles. Here, we use the Euler-Lagrangian method to simulate the flow of nanoparticles and inelastic non-Newtonian fluids (described by Meter model) in a range of porous media samples and injection rates. In one case, we use a fine mesh of more than 3 million mesh points to model nanoparticles transport in a sandstone sample. The results show that the velocity distribution of nanoparticles in the porous medium is non-Gaussian, which leads to the non-Fickian behavior of nanoparticles dispersion. Due to pore-space confinement, the long-time mean-square displacement of nanoparticles depends nonlinearly on time. Additionally, the gradient of shear stress in the pore space of the porous medium dictates the transport behavior of nanoparticles in the porous medium. Furthermore, the Brownian motion of nanoparticles increases the dispersion of nanoparticles along the longitudinal and transverse direction.",,708
1584,35968300,Automated measurement of the disc-fovea angle based on DeepLabv3.,"To assess the value of automatic disc-fovea angle (DFA) measurement using the DeepLabv3+ segmentation model. A total of 682 normal fundus image datasets were collected from the Eye Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. The following parts of the images were labeled and subsequently reviewed by ophthalmologists: optic disc center, macular center, optic disc area, and virtual macular area. A total of 477 normal fundus images were used to train DeepLabv3+, U-Net, and PSPNet model, which were used to obtain the optic disc area and virtual macular area. Then, the coordinates of the optic disc center and macular center were obstained by using the minimum outer circle technique. Finally the DFA was calculated. In this study, 205 normal fundus images were used to test the model. The experimental results showed that the errors in automatic DFA measurement using DeepLabv3+, U-Net, and PSPNet segmentation models were 0.76°, 1.4°, and 2.12°, respectively. The mean intersection over union (MIoU), mean pixel accuracy (MPA), average error in the center of the optic disc, and average error in the center of the virtual macula obstained by using DeepLabv3+ model was 94.77%, 97.32%, 10.94 pixels, and 13.44 pixels, respectively. The automatic DFA measurement using DeepLabv3+ got the less error than the errors that using the other segmentation models. Therefore, the DeepLabv3+ segmentation model was finally chosen to measure DFA automatically. The DeepLabv3+ segmentation model -based automatic segmentation techniques can produce accurate and rapid DFA measurements.",,709
539,35978688,Discovery of Desmuramylpeptide NOD2 Agonists with Single-Digit Nanomolar Potency.,"The innate immune receptor nucleotide-binding oligomerization-domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) represents an important target for the development of structurally defined small molecule immunomodulatory compounds that have great potential to be used either as vaccine adjuvants or as general immunostimulatory agents. We report here the investigation of the structure-activity relationship of a series of novel desmuramylpeptide NOD2 agonists. Extensive exploration of chemical space culminated in the discovery of a lipophilic adamantane-moiety-featuring compound 40, the first single-digit nanomolar and the most potent NOD2 agonist in its structural class to date. Moreover, 40 acted synergistically with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ to induce the production of cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and enhance their nonspecific cytotoxic activity against K562 cancer cells. These findings provide initial insight into its immunostimulatory potential, especially when used in combination with other immunopotentiators.",,710
119,35983313,Surface Nanostructure Effects on Dopamine Adsorption and Electrochemistry on Glassy Carbon Electrodes.,"Dopamine (DA) adsorption and electron-transfer kinetics are strongly sensitive to the structure and composition of carbon electrodes. Activation of carbon surfaces is a popular method to improve DA detection, but the role of carbon structural features on DA behavior remains uncertain. Herein, we use scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) for local anodization of glassy carbon (GC) electrodes in acid media followed by electrochemical imaging of DA adsorption and electrochemistry covering both unmodified and anodized GC regions of the same electrode. Electrochemical measurements of adsorbed DA involve the delivery of DA from the SECCM meniscus (30 μM) for 1 s periods followed by voltammetric analysis at a reasonable sweep rate (47 V s-1). This general approach reduces effects from interelectrode variability and allows for considerable numbers of measurements and statistical analysis of electrochemical data sets. Localized electrode activity is correlated to surface structure and chemistry by a range of characterization techniques. Anodization enhances DA electron-transfer kinetics and provides more sites for adsorption (higher specific surface area). A consequence is that adsorption takes longer to approach completion on the anodized surface. In fact, normalizing DA surface coverage by the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) reveals that adsorption is less extensive on anodized surfaces compared to as-prepared GC on the same time scale. Thus, ECSA, which has often been overlooked when calculating DA surface coverage on carbon electrodes, even where different activation methods would be expected to result in different surface roughness and nanostructure, is an important consideration. Lower graphitic and higher oxygen content on anodized GC also suggest that oxygen-containing functional groups do not necessarily enhance DA adsorption and may have the opposite effect. This work further demonstrates SECCM as a powerful technique for revealing surface structure-function relationships and correlations at heterogeneous electrodes.",,711
922,35974768,Site specific NMR characterization of abeta-40 oligomers cross seeded by abeta-42 oligomers.,"Extracellular accumulation of β amyloid peptides of 40 (Aβ40) and 42 residues (Aβ42) has been considered as one of the hallmarks in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. In this work, we are able to prepare oligomeric aggregates of Aβ with uniform size and monomorphic structure. Our experimental design is to incubate Aβ peptides in reverse micelles (RMs) so that the peptides could aggregate only through a single nucleation process and the size of the oligomers is confined by the physical dimension of the reverse micelles. The hence obtained Aβ oligomers (AβOs) are 23 nm in diameter and they belong to the category of high molecular-weight (MW) oligomers. The solid-state NMR data revealed that Aβ40Os adopt the structural motif of β-loop-β but the chemical shifts manifested that they may be structurally different from low-MW AβOs and mature fibrils. From the thioflavin-T results, we found that high-MW Aβ42Os can accelerate the fibrillization of Aβ40 monomers. Our protocol allows performing cross-seeding experiments among oligomeric species. By comparing the chemical shifts of Aβ40Os cross seeded by Aβ42Os and those of Aβ40Os prepared in the absence of Aβ42Os, we observed that the chemical states of E11, K16, and E22 were altered, whereas the backbone conformation of the β-sheet region near the C-terminus was structurally invariant. The use of reverse micelles allows hitherto the most detailed characterization of the structural variability of Aβ40Os.",,712
434,35979150,Evaluation of the effectiveness of partial splenic endovascular embolization in patients with refractory thrombocytopaenia.,"Partial splenic endovascular embolization (PSEE) could be an option for patients with thrombocytopaenia (TCP). We selected a group of 22 patients diagnosed with refractory TCP to undergo PSEE, and we followed them for detailed analysis. Twenty-two patients aged 27-75 years (mean 46.5 ± 3.5 years) underwent PSEE, and 5 participants underwent a second PSEE due to the lack of effectiveness after the first procedure. A total of 27 PSEEs were performed. A semi-quantitative scale was used to assess the severity of the post-embolization syndrome. The percentage of spleen parenchyma excluded from circulation was 30-70%. We used the mixture of Histoacryl N-butyl cyanoacry-late glue and Lipiodol in 10 cases, spirals in 10 cases, and polyvinyl alcohol in 7 cases, for the embolization. The mean value of platelet count (PLT) before procedure increased from 22.0 ± 15.0 to 87.7 ± 67.9 (p < 0.05) in a mean period of 194 days. In 2 cases severe post-embolization syndrome was observed. Closure less than 50% of the spleen circulation was associated with poorly expressed post-embolization symptoms. Serious complications occurred in 1 patient (3.5%). A strong positive correlation (r = 0.8, p < 0.05) was found between C-reactive protein (CRP) and the severity of post-embolization syndrome. Increased symptoms of post-embolization syndrome were also associated with a significant increase in hospitalization time - 27.0 vs. 7.2 days (r = 0.66, p < 0.05). Partial endovascular embolization of the spleen (PSEE) may be a valuable therapeutic option for patients with refractory TCP. PSEE is a safe method with a low complication rate.",,713
1979,35967628,The impact of implicit theories on resilience among Chinese nurses: The chain mediating effect of grit and meaning in life.,"Implicit theories refer to assumptions people hold about different domains, also known as mindsets. There are two implicit theories on the malleability of one's ability: entity theory and incremental theory. They constrain and regulate people's understanding and responses to an individual's behavior, leading to different social cognitive patterns and behavioral responses. Resilience is a positive adaptation in highly stressful situations that represents mechanisms for coping with and transcending difficult experiences, i.e., a person's ability to successfully adapt to change, resist the adverse effects of stressors, avoid significant dysfunction, and be chronically affected by considered a protective factor for mental health. Although previous studies showed that individuals' implicit theories are associated with resilience, this relationship has received little attention in the nursing population. It is unclear which variables may contribute to explaining the relationship between implicit theories and resilience. Therefore, the current study aims to deeply explore the relationship between implicit theories and the resilience of Chinese nurses. In addition, we also seek to demonstrate the chain mediating effects of grit and meaning in life on this relationship. We surveyed 709 Chinese nurses through online questionnaires using the self-made demographic questionnaire, the Implicit Theories Scale, the Short Grit Scale, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. After controlling for demographic variables such as age, gender, educational background, marital status, professional title, and working years, the results reveal positive associations between Chinese nurses' implicit theories and their resilience, and grit and meaning in life play a partial mediating role in this relationship, respectively. Furthermore, grit and meaning in life play a chain mediating role between implicit theories and resilience. These findings contribute to understanding the psychological impact mechanism of implicit theories on nurses' resilience and provide a theoretical basis for nursing managers to formulate strategies to improve nurses' psychological resilience.",,714
1295,35970677,Development and validation of a national perioperative mortality risk model for pediatric surgery: The New Zealand pediatric surgical risk tool (NZRISK-pediatric): NZRISK-Pediatric.,"Risk prediction models are well established as an adjunct to perioperative decision making, but few exist for pediatric surgical outcomes. The majority of risk tools do not feature Australasian data and do not estimate mortality risk beyond 30-days. Our aim was to develop and validate a model for mortality risk prediction in children (age <18yrs) at 30-days, 90-days and 1 year following all types of surgery using a national database. The New Zealand Ministry of Health National Minimum Dataset was accessed to obtain clinical and demographic data for all children having surgery between June 1st 2011 and July 1st 2016. Three quarters of the data were used to derive 3 models to predict 30-day, 90-day and 1-year mortality risk, and the remaining data used for validation. We constructed 3 models using data from 135 217 patients, validating a total of 11 covariates for risk prediction. Included were neonate, prematurity, ASA-PS status, heart and lung disease, active malignancy, sepsis, surgical type, surgical severity score, surgical urgency, ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation. All models showed excellent discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.947, 0.933 and 0.908 respectively) and calibration statistics (calibration slopes of 0.778, 1.125, 1.153, Brier scores of 0.001, 0.002, 0.003 respectively). Combining objective data with severity indices, NZRISK-Paed presents a risk stratification model which is intuitive and practical. Application of 30-day, 90-day and 1-year percentage mortality risk aids in longer-term planning, shared decision-making and allocation of resource to the individual and to high needs populations. Risk prediction tools add an objective measure to pre-operative assessment but few exist for pediatric surgery and none predict mortality beyond 30-days.",,715
431,35979153,Evaluation of the frequency of incidental findings and their clinical significance in multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging examination.,"Conventional diagnostic methods have limitations in the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa); therefore, the use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in PCa has become widespread. We aimed to determine the frequency of IF detected in the mpMRI examination according to organ distribution and clinical significance. mpMRI examinations performed between January 2015 and 2020 based on the diagnosis or suspicion of PCa were retrospectively evaluated. IFs were divided into 2 groups, as genitourinary system and non- genitourinary system findings. In addition, IFs were also evaluated in 2 groups, as clinically significant and clinically non-significant. The patient population was divided into age ranges, and the frequency of IFs in these age ranges and their clinical significance were recorded. The mpMRI examinations of 426 patients revealed a total of 321 Ifs, comprising 212 (49.8%) genitourinary (41.1%) and 189 (58.9%) extragenitourinary findings. The mean age of the patients was 63.53 ± 7.89 years. As the age increased, the rate of IFs increased (p = 0.001). However, there was no increase for the 75-year-old group compared to the 65-74-year-old age range (p = 0.853). There were a total of 22 (6.9%) clinically significant Ifs - 4 associated with the genitourinary system and 18 extragenitourinary. Although the rate of clinically significant IF was only 6.9%, this rate was high in patients, especially in those over the age of 65 years. It should be kept in mind that the early detection of these findings in the asymptomatic period will increase the survival and successful treatment of patients.",,716
2378,35966995,"Contrast Sensitivity and Night Driving in Older People: Quantifying the Relationship Between Visual Acuity, Contrast Sensitivity, and Hazard Detection Distance in a Night-Time Driving Simulator.","(i) To assess how well contrast sensitivity (CS) predicts night-time hazard detection distance (a key component of night driving ability), in normally sighted older drivers, relative to a conventional measure of high contrast visual acuity (VA); (ii) To evaluate whether CS can be accurately quantified within a night driving simulator. Participants were 15 (five female) ophthalmologically healthy adults, aged 55-81 years. CS was measured in a driving simulator using Landolt Cs, presented under static or dynamic driving conditions, and with or without glare. In the dynamic driving conditions, the participant was asked to simultaneously maintain a (virtual) speed of 60 km/h on a country road. In the with glare conditions, two calibrated LED arrays, moved by cable robots, simulated the trajectories and luminance characteristics of the (low beam) headlights of an approaching car. For comparison, CS was also measured clinically (with and without glare) using a Optovist I instrument (Vistec Inc., Olching, Germany). Visual acuity (VA) thresholds were also assessed at high and low contrast using the Freiburg Visual Acuity Test (FrACT) under photopic conditions. As a measure of driving performance, median hazard detection distance (MHDD) was computed, in meters, across three kinds of simulated obstacles of varying contrast. Contrast sensitivity and low contrast VA were both significantly associated with driving performance (both P < 0.01), whereas conventional high contrast acuity was not (P = 0.10). There was good correlation (P < 0.01) between CS measured in the driving simulator and a conventional clinical instrument (Optovist I). As expected, CS was shown to decrease in the presence of glare, in dynamic driving conditions, and as a function of age (all P < 0.01). Contrast sensitivity and low contrast VA predict night-time hazard detection ability in a manner that conventional high contrast VA does not. Either may therefore provide a useful metric for assessing fitness to drive at night, particularly in older individuals. CS measurements can be made within a driving simulator, and the data are in good agreement with conventional clinical methods (Optovist I).",,717
364,35979310,Ant sting-induced whole-body pustules in an inebriated male: A case report.,"Many ant species can harm humans; however, only a few cause life-threatening allergic reactions. Normally, reactions caused by ants occur in patients who come into contact with ant venom. Venom contains various biologically active peptides and protein components, of which acids and alkaloids tend to cause anaphylaxis. Ant venom can cause both immediate and delayed reactions. The main histopathological changes observed in ant hypersensitivity are eosinophil recruitment and Th2 cytokine production. A 70-year-old man was bitten by a large number of ants when he was in a drunken stupor and was hospitalized at a local hospital. Five days later, because of severe symptoms, the patient was transferred to our hospital for treatment. Numerous pustules were observed interspersed throughout the body, with itching and pain reported. He had experienced fever, vomiting, hematochezia, mania, soliloquy, sleep disturbances, and elevated levels of myocardial enzymes since the onset of illness. The patient had a history of hypertension for more than 1 year, and his blood pressure was within the normal range after hypotensive drug treatment. He had no other relevant medical history. Based on the clinical history of an ant bite and its clinical manifestations, the patient was diagnosed with an ant venom allergy. The patient was treated with 60 mg methylprednisolone for 2 d, 40 mg methylprednisolone for 3 d, and 20 mg methylprednisolone for 2 d. Oral antihistamines and diazepam were administered for 12 d and 8 d, respectively. Cold compresses were used to treat the swelling during the process. After 12 d of treatment, most pustules became crusts, whereas some had faded away. No symptoms of pain, itching, or psychological disturbances were reported during the follow-up visits within 6 mo. This case report emphasizes the dangers of ant stings.",,718
1611,35968273,"Vessel wall MR imaging of aortic arch, cervical carotid and intracranial arteries in patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source: A narrative review.","Despite advancements in multi-modal imaging techniques, a substantial portion of ischemic stroke patients today remain without a diagnosed etiology after conventional workup. Based on existing diagnostic criteria, these ischemic stroke patients are subcategorized into having cryptogenic stroke (CS) or embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). There is growing evidence that in these patients, non-cardiogenic embolic sources, in particular non-stenosing atherosclerotic plaque, may have significant contributory roles in their ischemic strokes. Recent advancements in vessel wall MRI (VW-MRI) have enabled imaging of vessel walls beyond the degree of luminal stenosis, and allows further characterization of atherosclerotic plaque components. Using this imaging technique, we are able to identify potential imaging biomarkers of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques such as intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid rich necrotic core, and thin or ruptured fibrous caps. This review focuses on the existing evidence on the advantages of utilizing VW-MRI in ischemic stroke patients to identify culprit plaques in key anatomical areas, namely the cervical carotid arteries, intracranial arteries, and the aortic arch. For each anatomical area, the literature on potential imaging biomarkers of vulnerable plaques on VW-MRI as well as the VW-MRI literature in ESUS and CS patients are reviewed. Future directions on further elucidating ESUS and CS by the use of VW-MRI as well as exciting emerging techniques are reviewed.",,719
1099,35974520,Interplay between jamming and motility-induced phase separation in persistent self-propelling particles.,"In living and engineered systems of active particles, self-propulsion induces an unjamming transition from a solid to a fluid phase and phase separation between a gas and a liquidlike phase. We demonstrate an interplay between these two nonequilibrium transitions in systems of persistent active particles. The coexistence and jamming lines in the activity-density plane meet at the jamming transition point in the limit of hard particles or zero activity. This interplay induces an anomalous dynamic in the liquid phase and hysteresis at the active jamming transition.",,720
1533,35968353,"MIR133A regulates cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis by targeting SOX9 in human colorectal cancer cells.","The human microRNA 133A (MIR133A) was identified as a CRC-associated miRNA. It was down-regulated in human CRC tissues. We identified the putative MIR133A1 and A2 target genes by comparing the transcriptome analysis data of MIR133A1 and A2 knock-in cells with the candidate MIR133A target genes predicted by bioinformatics tools. We identified 29 and 33 putative MIR133A and A2 direct target genes, respectively. Among them, we focused on the master transcription regulator gene SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9), which exhibits a pleiotropic role in cancer. We confirmed that SOX9 is a direct target gene of MIR133A by luciferase reporter assay, quantitative RT-PCR, and western blot analysis. Overexpression of MIR133A in CRC cell lines significantly decreased SOX9 and its downstream PIK3CA-AKT1-GSK3B-CTNNB1 and KRAS-BRAF-MAP2K1-MAPK1/3 pathways and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, functional studies reveal that cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration ability were significantly decreased by MIR133A-overexpressed CRC cell lines. Knockdown of SOX9 in CRC cell lines by SOX9 gene silencing showed similar results. We also used a xenograft model to show that MIR133A overexpression suppresses tumor growth and proliferation. Our results suggest that MIR133A regulates cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis by targeting SOX9 in human colorectal cancer.",,721
1120,35974499,Non-Markovian thermal operations boosting the performance of quantum heat engines.,"It is investigated whether non-Markovianity, i.e., the memory effects resulting from the coupling of the system to its environment, can be beneficial for the performance of quantum heat engines. Specifically, two physical models are considered. The first one is a well-known single-qubit Otto engine; the non-Markovian behavior is there implemented by replacing standard thermalization strokes with so-called extremal thermal operations which cannot be realized without the memory effects. The second one is a three-stroke engine in which the cycle consists of two extremal thermal operations and a single qubit rotation. It is shown that the non-Markovian Otto engine can generate more work-per-cycle for a given efficiency than its Markovian counterpart, whereas performance of both setups is superior to the three-stroke engine. Furthermore, both the non-Markovian Otto engine and the three-stroke engine can reduce the work fluctuations in comparison with the Markovian Otto engine, with their relative advantage depending on the performance target. This demonstrates the beneficial influence of non-Markovianity on both the average performance and the stability of operation of quantum heat engines.",,722
2237,35967254,Reproduction and genetic diversity of Juniperus squamata along an elevational gradient in the Hengduan Mountains.,"Elevation plays a crucial factor in the distribution of plants, as environmental conditions become increasingly harsh at higher elevations. Previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of large-scale elevational gradients on plants, with little attention on the impact of smaller-scale gradients. In this study we used 14 microsatellite loci to survey the genetic structure of 332 Juniperus squamata plants along elevation gradient from two sites in the Hengduan Mountains. We found that the genetic structure (single, clonal, mosaic) of J. squamata shrubs is affected by differences in elevational gradients of only 150 m. Shrubs in the mid-elevation plots rarely have a clonal or mosaic structure compared to shrubs in lower- or higher-elevation plots. Human activity can significantly affect genetic structure, as well as reproductive strategy and genetic diversity. Sub-populations at mid-elevations had the highest yield of seed cones, lower levels of asexual reproduction and higher levels of genetic diversity. This may be due to the trade-off between elevational stress and anthropogenic disturbance at mid-elevation since there is greater elevational stress at higher-elevations and greater intensity of anthropogenic disturbance at lower-elevations. Our findings provide new insights into the finer scale genetic structure of alpine shrubs, which may improve the conservation and management of shrublands, a major vegetation type on the Hengduan Mountains and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",,723
2188,35967330,Design and implementation of a mobile app for the pharmacotherapeutic follow-up of patients diagnosed with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: eMidCare.,"Pharmacotherapeutic management of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) has become more complex due to the development of new treatments, such as biological therapies. Mobile health, especially apps, can provide IMID patients with greater autonomy and facilitate communication with healthcare professionals. Our objective was to design and implement an app for remote monitoring and communication with IMID patients. A multidisciplinary group was created to design and develop an app for IMID patients in a tertiary hospital. The app functionalities were identified through a focus group with IMID patients and through an observational, descriptive study of available apps for IMID patients at App Store and Play Store platforms. Once the app was designed and developed, we offered the app to IMID patients who initiated a new biological therapy. The inclusion period was from December 2020 to August 2021. We performed an observational, longitudinal study to assess the app's impact on medication safety, communication, satisfaction, and usability. We designed an app (eMidCare®) with the following modules: My Medication, My Questionnaires, Adverse Events, Useful Information, Messages, and Patient Profile. A total of 85 patients were installed with the app. The median (range) follow-up time for app use was 123 (5-270) days. In the My Medication module, 100% of patients registered their biological therapy and 25.9% also used this module to record each dose of medication administered. A total of 82 adverse events (AEs) were registered. Thirty-two percent of the patients registered at least 1 AE. The most frequent AEs were fatigue, injection site reaction, headache, and nausea. Fifty-two percent of patients used the Messages module to communicate with healthcare professionals. The most frequent messages concerned doubts about managing AEs (26.2%) and drug interactions (18.9%). The satisfaction survey yielded a median (range) score of 9.1 (7-10) out of 10. We developed an app, eMidCare®, which reminds patients to take their medication, enables them to record AEs, and helps them communicate with healthcare professionals. Approximately one-third of the patients registered the administration of the biological therapies and registered at least 1 AE. The most used and most satisfactory functionality was communication with health professionals.",,724
800,35975037,Scaling of catalytic cracking fluidized bed downer reactor based on CFD simulations-Part II: effect of reactor scale.,"The practical realization of the scaling up of gas-solid multiphase flow reactors with chemical reactions is hindered by chaotic flow behaviors and complex heat and mass transfers in the reactor. In addition, a law to scale up complex reaction mechanisms in multiphase flow systems has been rarely proposed in the existing literature. Thus, this study aims to investigate the scaling up of the catalytic cracking fluidized bed downer reactor based on the similitude method of chemical reaction performance. Three downer reactor scales with a height of 5, 15, and 30 m, were investigated. To anticipate the behavior of reactive flow, a Eulerian-Eulerian CFD model, two-fluid model, was constructed, which was combined with the kinetic theory of granular flow. A four-lump kinetic model was chosen to represent the mechanism of the catalytic cracking reaction of heavy oil from the pyrolysis of waste plastic. The CFD model accurately predicted the species composition distribution. The scaling law based on the geometric similarity, kinematic similarity, and chemical reaction similarity, was proposed. The catalytic cracking performance similarity of the downer reactor was obtained. With variances in the range of 10% and mean relative absolute error less than 5%, the axial and lateral distributions of chemical performance (heavy oil conversion, gasoline mass fraction, and gasoline selectivity) were found to be extremely similar.",,725
1909,35967700,Relationship Between Childhood Sensory Processing Differences and Quality of Life as Adults.,"Research suggests a relationship between sensory processing, motor skills and quality of life (QOL) in a variety of clinical populations of adults and children. There have been no studies which investigated the relationship of childhood sensory processing and integration and related motor performance (sensori-motor) patterns identified using an Ayres Sensory Integration® (ASI) frame of reference and later QOL of those children as adults. This longitudinal follow-up study examined this relationship. Adult QOL was also examined in relation to current adult sensori-motor patterns. Fifty-three adults who received occupational therapy services as children, were identified as having sensori-motor difficulties at that time and completed a sensory history and a quality-of-life measure as adults participated. Measures included the OTA the Koomar Center Sensory History (SXHX), Adult/Adolescent Sensory History (ASH), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF). MANCOVA found that Total childhood sensori-motor scores had a small relationship to Physical Health QOL as adults that approached significance. Pearson Correlations found that adults with childhood sensori-motor challenges who report sensori-motor challenges as adults had a moderate significant relationship among overall sensori-motor functioning and Physical Health (r = -0.56, p = 0.018). Visual (r = -0.76, p = 0.001), movement (vestibular; r = -0.48, p = 0.042) and tactile processing (r = -0.63, p = 0.008) had moderate to large significant relationships with Physical Health. Visual processing (r = -0.54, p = 0.024) was also significantly related to Psychological Health. Motor Coordination trended to significance for Physical Health (r = -0.42) and Psychological Health (r = -0.41). Conversely, adults who reported typical sensori-motor scores as adults, despite childhood sensori-motor challenges, had a good QOL. Furthermore, similar to previous research, there was a relationship between current visual, movement (vestibular) and tactile (touch) sensory processing and adult Physical and Psychological Health. A multivariate linear regression found Sensory Discrimination and Modulation accounted for one-quarter of the variance in QOL in adults with only Discrimination being statistically significant. Therefore, it is important to consider childhood sensori-motor function as well as adult functioning when examining QOL. Further, heretofore unexamined Sensory Discrimination was found to play a role in adult QOL.",,726

Although there are several reviews on gas hydrate mitigation in gas-dominated systems, limited reviews have been dedicated to the understanding and mechanism of hydrate formation and mitigation in oil-dominated systems. Hence, this review article discusses and summarizes the prior studies on the hydrate formation behavior and mitigation in oil-dominated multiphase systems. The factors (such as oil volume or water cut, bubble point, and hydrate formers) that affect hydrate formation in oil systems are also discussed in detail. Furthermore, insight into the hydrate mitigation and mechanism in oil systems is also presented in this review. Also, a detailed table on the various studied hydrate tests in oil systems, including the experimental methods, inhibitor type, conventions, and testing conditions, is provided in this work. The findings presented in this work are relevant for developing the best solution to manage hydrate formation in oil-dominated systems for the oil and gas industry.",,727
1903,35967706,A New Destination on the Palm? The Moderating Effect of Travel Anxiety on Digital Tourism Behavior in Extended UTAUT2 and TTF Models.,"Digital tourism has developed rapidly, especially in museums. However, as people become increasingly familiar with digital museums, their use intentions and behavior have changed. Taking the Digital Palace Museum in China as an example, applying the PLS-SEM method, this study uncovers visitors' use intentions and actual use behavior for digital museums by integrating the new UTAUT model (UTAUT2) and TTF model (TTF under social distancing) and introduces the PATS (Pandemic Anxiety Travel Scale) model to reveal how pandemic anxiety promotes the transformation of use intentions into use behavior more easily. The results show that performance expectations, hedonic motivations, habits, and task-technology-fit positively affect use intentions for digital museums. However, the price-saving orientation negatively affects use intentions. Pandemic anxiety moderates the effect of use intentions on actual behavior. When travel anxiety is relatively high, use intentions have a greater effect on use behavior for digital museums. The results reveal the influencing factors on use intentions of digital museums and the moderating effect of pandemic anxiety on the relation between use intentions and actual behavior.",,728
1728,35968015,Targeted sampling reduces the uncertainty in force of infection estimates from serological surveillance.,"Age bins are frequently used in serological studies of infectious diseases in wildlife to deal with uncertainty in the age of sampled animals. This study analyzed how age binning and targeted sampling in serological surveillance affect the width of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the estimated force of infection (FOI) of infectious diseases. We indicate that the optimal target population with the narrowest 95% CI differs depending on the expected FOI using computer simulations and mathematical models. In addition, our findings show that we can substantially reduce the number of animals required to infer transmission risk by tailoring targeted, age-based sampling to specific epidemiological situations.",,729

Cumulative clinical evidence showed that systemic treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in combination with immunotherapy may shed light on the dim clinical outcome in advanced BTC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of lenvatinib plus programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody in patients with BTC who progressed after first-line cisplatin/gemcitabine (CisGem) chemotherapy. Patients with advanced BTCs who progressed after CisGem were recruited. A combination regimen of lenvatinib (8/12 mg daily) plus PD-1 antibody (200/240 mg injection every 3 weeks) was prescribed. Clinicopathological information and therapeutic outcome, including tumor subtypes, biomarkers, treatment duration, adverse events (AE), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), were recorded and estimated. A total of 351 patients with BTCs were reviewed and 74 were recruited eventually: 35 had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (47.3%), 4 had extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (5.4%), and 35 had gallbladder cancer (47.3%). The median administered cycles of PD-1 antibody were 6.43 (95% CI: 5.83-7.04) cycles, and the median duration of lenvatinib medication was 21.0 weeks (95% CI: 18.04-23.93). Twenty-eight patients (37.83%) experienced detectable objective response per RECIST1.1 within a median follow-up duration of 15.0 months. The objective response rate (ORR) was 20.27% (95% CI: 10.89%-29.65%), and the disease control rate (DCR) was 71.62% (95% CI: 61.11%-82.14%). The median PFS and OS were 4.0 months (95% CI: 3.5-5.0) and 9.50 months (95% CI: 9.0-11.0), respectively. Seventy-three patients (98.64%) reported AEs and 39 (52.70%) experienced ≥grade 3 AEs. In subgroup analyses, tumoral PD-L1 expression ≥50% and tumor mutation burden (TMB) ≥2.5 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged PFS.

1787,35967868,A case-control study of infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae producing New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1: Predictors and outcomes.,"Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are a significant cause of death worldwide, and carbapenemase-producing bacteria are the principal agents. New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP-NDM-1) is an extensively drug-resistant bacterium that has been previously reported in Mexico. Our aim was to conduct a case-control study to describe the risk factors associated with nosocomial infections caused by K. pneumoniae producing NDM-1 in a tertiary-care hospital in Mexico. A retrospective case-control study with patients hospitalized from January 2012 to February 2018 at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Fray Antonio Alcalde was designed. During this period, 139 patients with a culture that was positive for K. pneumoniae NDM-1 (cases) and 486 patients hospitalized in the same department and on the same date as the cases (controls) were included. Data were analyzed using SPSS v. 24, and logistic regression analysis was conducted to calculate the risk factors for KP-NDM-1 infection. One hundred and thirty-nine case patients with a KP-NDM-1 isolate and 486 control patients were analyzed. In the case group, acute renal failure was a significant comorbidity, hospitalization days were extended, and significantly more deaths occurred. In a multivariate analysis of risk factors, the independent variables included the previous use of antibiotics (odds ratio, OR = 12.252), the use of a urinary catheter (OR = 5.985), the use of a central venous catheter (OR = 5.518), the use of mechanical ventilation (OR = 3.459), and the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (OR = 2.334) as predictors of infection with NDM-1 K. pneumoniae. In this study, the previous use of antibiotics, the use of a urinary catheter, the use of a central venous catheter, the use of mechanical ventilation, and ICU stay were shown to be predictors of infection with NDM-1 K. pneumoniae and were independent risk factors for infection with NDM-1 K. pneumoniae.",,731
169,35983107,Association of human papillomavirus in penile cancer: A single-center analysis.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known risk factor of penile cancer (PeCa). However, studies evaluating its true association are limited. In this study, we aimed to estimate HPV prevalence and its true association with PeCa in terms of molecular biological activities. This single-institutional prospective observational study was conducted between June 2016 and August 2019. We included 40 men with PeCa as a study group and 20 age-matched uncircumcised men who underwent circumcision for phimosis as a control group. Both the groups underwent deoxyribonucleic acid isolation for HPV subtyping followed by evaluation of relative E6/E7 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression profile and relative telomerase activity in tissue samples. HPV-16 and -18 were categorized as high-risk, whereas HPV-6 and -11 were categorized as low-risk subtypes. The mean (±standard deviation) age of PeCa was 51 ± 15.9 years. The majority of patients had stage II disease, and the most common procedure done was partial penectomy. The overall prevalence of HPV in PeCa was 42.5% (n = 17) as compared to 20% (n = 4) in controls. Among the subtypes, the most common subtype was HPV-16 noted in 33.3% (8/24) of cases, followed by HPV-18 in 29.2% (7/24) of cases. PeCa tissues had a significantly higher relative E7 mRNA expression for HPV-18 than the control group (P = 0.016). The mean relative telomerase activity was significantly higher in the PeCa tissues than the control group (138.66 vs. 14.46, P < 0.001). A significantly higher relative telomerase activity was noted in the PeCa tissues positive for high-risk HPV subtypes than controls (141.90 vs. 14.46, P = 0.0008), but not between high-risk HPV-positive and HPV-negative PeCa cases (141.90 vs. 137.03, P = 0.79). High-risk subtypes were not associated with tumor stage (P = 0.76) or lymph node metastasis (P = 0.816). HPV was associated in 42.5% of PeCa cases based on our experience from a single institution. PeCa tissues had a higher relative E7 mRNA expression for HPV-18 and relative telomerase activity as compared to controls suggesting their potential role as surrogate markers of virus-induced tumorigenesis.",,732
1153,35973766,Integration analysis of PacBio SMRT- and Illumina RNA-seq reveals P450 genes involved in thiamethoxam detoxification in Bradysia odoriphaga.,"The sciarid fly Bradysia odoriphaga is a serious pest of Chinese chive (Liliaceae). Neonicotinoid insecticides including thiamethoxam have been used for B. odoriphaga control. However, thiamethoxam resistance in B. odoriphaga has developed in recent years. To identify potential genes involved in detoxification metabolism of thiamethoxam in B. odoriphaga, a PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) transcriptome sequencing and Illumina RNA-seq analysis on thiamethoxam treated B. odoriphaga were performed to explore differentially expressed genes in B. odoriphaga. After SMRT sequencing, analysis of Illumina RNA-Seq data showed a total of 172 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after thiamethoxam treatment, among which eight upregulated DEGs were P450 genes that may be related to thiamethoxam metabolism. The qRT-PCR results of the eight up-regulated P450 unigenes after thiamethoxam treatment were consistent with RNA-Seq data. Furthermore, oral delivery mediated RNA interference of the eight upregulated P450 transcripts followed by insecticide bioassay was conducted, and three P450 unigenes were verified to be related to thiamethoxam detoxification in B. odoriphaga. This study provides new information about the P450 genes involved in thiamethoxam detoxification in B. odoriphaga.",,733
1057,35974562,Self-sustaining oscillation of two axonemal microtubules based on a stochastic bonding model between microtubules and dynein.,"The motility of cilia and flagella plays important physiological roles, and there has been a great deal of research on the mechanisms underlying the motility of molecular motors. Although recent molecular structural analyses have revealed the components of the ciliary axoneme, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of dynein activity are still unknown, and how multiple dyneins coordinate their movements remains unclear. In particular, the mode of binding for axonemal dynein has not been elucidated. In this study, we constructed a thermodynamic stochastic model of microtubule-dynein coupling and reproduced the experiments of Aoyama and Kamiya on the minimal component of axonemal microtubule-dynein. We then identified the binding mode of axonemal dynein and clarified the relationship between dynein activity distribution and axonemal movement. Based on our numerical results, the slip-bond mechanism agrees quantitatively with the experimental results in terms of amplitude, frequency, and propagation velocity, implying that axial microtubule-dynein coupling may follow a slip-bond mechanism. Moreover, the frequency and propagation velocity decayed in proportion to the fourth power of microtubule length, and the critical load of the trigger for the oscillation agreed well with Euler's critical load.",,734
1054,35974565,Drag on a circular intruder traversing a shape-heterogeneous granular mixture.,"The main aim of our work is to explore the effect of particle shape heterogeneity on the dynamics of an intruder moving through a two-dimensional mixture of dumbbells and disks. In spite of similar physical conditions (the mass of the dumbbell is the same as that of the disk) and the same area fraction, we noticed a significant difference in the drag experienced by the intruder as the mixture concentration varies. The propagation of stress from the intruder to the granular grains manifests in the form of force chains, and interestingly these force chains can vary significantly depending on the shape of the grains. These differences, however, appear to be suppressed in the frictionless case where the force chains cannot extend very far from the initial point of contact. Apart from particle shape, the effect of the area fraction of the system and the size of the intruder have also been explored. As the area fraction increases, the drag force on the intruder increases owing to the increase in the contact forces. Finally, we present the velocity and stress fields at different dumbbell fractions and for various intruder diameters to show the effect of the moving intruder on its surrounding particles.",,735
1159,35973758,"Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCG10, ABCH3 and ABCH4 in Aphis craccivora (Koch) facilitates its tolerance to imidacloprid.","Aphis craccivora (Koch), a globally pest that causes significant threat to the legumes, has developed different degrees of resistance to a variety of insecticides. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters comprise a multifunctional transporter protein superfamily which play important roles in the transport and detoxification of xenobiotic compounds in insects. However, whether ABC transporters take part in the tolerance of imidacloprid in A. craccivora is still unknown. In order to investigate the functions of ABC transporters in the imidacloprid tolerance, fifty- eight ABC transporters were identified in the transcriptome and genome of A. craccivora and the toxicity of imidacloprid against A. craccivora was significantly increased after application the inhibitors of verapamil and Ko143. The relative expression levels of ABCG5, ABCG6, ABCG10, ABCH3, ABCH4, ABCH8 and ABCH10 were significantly up-regulated in response to imidacloprid treatment with LC15, LC50 and LC85 concentrations, and the expression patterns of these seven ABC transporters were further analyzed at different developmental stages and in different tissues of A. craccivora by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Furthermore, knockdown of ABCG10, ABCH3 and ABCH4 significantly increased the mortality of A. craccivora to imidacloprid. Our results reveal the key functions of ABC transporters in the tolerance of imidacloprid and provide valuable information regarding the development of improved management strategies in A. craccivora.",,736
194,35982843,Effect of helmet design on impact performance of industrial safety helmets.,"Comparative studies of different helmet designs are essential to determine differences in helmet performance. The present study comparatively evaluated the impact performance of hardhat helmets, climbing-style safety helmets, and helmets with novel rotation-damping technologies to determine if advanced designs deliver improved protection. Six helmet designs from three categories of safety helmets were tested: two traditional hardhat helmets (HH Type I, HH Type II), two climbing-style helmets (CS Web, CS Foam), and two helmets with dedicated rotation-damping technologies (MIPS, CEL). Helmets were first evaluated in impacts of 31 J energy representing a falling object according to standard Z89.1-2014. Subsequently, helmets were evaluated in impacts representing a fall by dropping a helmeted head-neck surrogate at 275 J impact energy. The resulting head kinematics were used to calculate the probability of sustaining a head or brain injury. Crown impacts representative of a falling object resulted in linear acceleration of less than 50 g in all six helmet models. Compared to crown impacts, front, side and rear impacts caused a several-fold increase in head acceleration in all helmets except HH Type II and CEL helmets. For impacts representative of falls, all helmets except the CEL helmet exhibited significantly increased head accelerations and an increased brain injury probability compared to the traditional HH Type I hardhat. Neck compression was 35%-90% higher in the two climbing-style helmets and 80% higher in MIPS helmets compared to the traditional HH type I hardhat. Contemporary helmets do not necessarily deliver improved protection from impacts and falls compared to traditional hardhat helmets.",,737
1207,35971607,Short-term outcomes of two-stage reverse total shoulder arthroplasty with antibiotic-loaded cement spacer for shoulder infection.,"The purpose of our study was to investigate short-term outcomes of two-stage reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) with an antibiotic-loaded cement spacer for shoulder infection. Eleven patients with shoulder infection were treated by two-stage RTSA following temporary antibiotic-loaded cement spacer. Of the 11 shoulders, nine had pyogenic arthritis combined with complex conditions such as recurrent infection, extensive osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, or massive rotator cuff tear and two had periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). The mean follow-up period was 29.9 months (range, 12-48 months) after RTSA. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, subjective shoulder value (SSV), and serial plain radiographs. The mean time from antibiotic-loaded cement spacer to RTSA was 9.2 months (range, 1-35 months). All patients had no clinical and radiographic signs of recurrent infection at final follow-up. The mean final VAS score, ASES score, and SSV were significantly improved from 4.5, 38.6, and 29.1% before RTSA to 1.7, 75.1, and 75.9% at final follow-up, respectively. The mean forward flexion, abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation values were improved from 50.0o, 50.9o, 17.7o, and sacrum level before RTSA to 127.3o, 110.0o, 51.8o, and L2 level at final follow-up, respectively. Two-stage RTSA with antibiotic-loaded cement spacer yields satisfactory short-term clinical and radiographic outcomes. In patients with pyogenic arthritis combined with complex conditions or PJI, two-stage RTSA with an antibiotic-loaded cement spacer would be a successful approach to eradicate infection and to improve function with pain relief.",,738
1973,35967634,Integrating multi-informant reports of youth mental health: A construct validation test of Kraemer and colleagues' (2003) Satellite Model.,"Accurately assessing youth mental health involves obtaining reports from multiple informants who typically display low levels of correspondence. This low correspondence may reflect situational specificity. That is, youth vary as to where they display mental health concerns and informants vary as to where and from what perspective they observe youth. Despite the frequent need to understand and interpret these informant discrepancies, no consensus guidelines exist for integrating informants' reports. The path to building these guidelines starts with identifying factors that reliably predict the level and form of these informant discrepancies, and do so for theoretically and empirically relevant reasons. Yet, despite the knowledge of situational specificity, few approaches to integrating multi-informant data are well-equipped to account for these factors in measurement, and those that claim to be well-positioned to do so have undergone little empirical scrutiny. One promising approach was developed roughly 20 years ago by Kraemer and colleagues (2003). Their Satellite Model leverages principal components analysis (PCA) and strategic selection of informants to instantiate situational specificity in measurement, namely components reflecting variance attributable to the context in which informants observe behavior (e.g., home/non-home), the perspective from which they observe behavior (e.g., self/other), and behavior that manifests across contexts and perspectives (i.e., trait). The current study represents the first construct validation test of the Satellite Model. A mixed-clinical/community sample of 134 adolescents and their parents completed six parallel surveys of adolescent mental health. Adolescents also participated in a series of simulated social interactions with research personnel trained to act as same-age, unfamiliar peers. A third informant (unfamiliar untrained observer) viewed these interactions and completed the same surveys as parents and adolescents. We applied the Satellite Model to each set of surveys and observed high internal consistency estimates for each of the six-item trait (α = 0.90), context (α = 0.84), and perspective (α = 0.83) components. Scores reflecting the trait, context, and perspective components displayed distinct patterns of relations to a battery of criterion variables that varied in the context, perspective, and source of measurement. The Satellite Model instantiates situational specificity in measurement and facilitates unifying conceptual and measurement models of youth mental health.",,739
336,35979432,Still poorly adopted in male professional football: but teams that used the Nordic Hamstring Exercise in team training had fewer hamstring injuries - a retrospective survey of 17 teams of the UEFA Elite Club Injury Study during the 2020-2021 season.,"The primary objective was to study the adoption of the NHE programme in European football teams in the 2020/21 season and to compare it to the previous study. A second objective was to compare hamstring injury rates between teams that used the NHE programme in the team training and teams that used the NHE only for players with previous or current hamstring injuries. Data about the implementation of the NHE programme and injury rates were included for 17 teams participating in the Elite Club Injury Study during the 2020/2021 season. One team (6%) used the full original NHE programme, and another four teams used it for all or most players in the team (team training group, n=5). Eleven teams used NHE only for players with a previous or current hamstring injury (individual training group), and one team did not use NHE. The team training group had fewer hamstring injuries (5 vs 11 per team, p=0.008) and a lower injury burden (12 vs 35 lay-off days per 1000 hours, p=0.003) than the individual training group. Similar to previous reports, low adoption of the NHE programme was seen in the 2020/2021 season. The low adoption rate (13%) relates to the number of teams fully or partly using NHE programmes. Teams that used NHE for the whole team or most players had a lower hamstring injury burden than teams that used NHE only for individual players.",,740
691,35975517,Clinical and Imaging Characteristics of Primary Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia Caused by Hypervirulent Klebsiella Pneumoniae.,"To investigate the CT imaging features and microbial phenotypes of primary severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp). Patients diagnosed with primary hvKp pneumonia were included, and their clinical data were analyzed, including the baseline characteristics and CT imaging results. After hypermucoviscosity phenotyping, the strains, serological types, and virulence genes of hvKp were identified using multiplex PCR. Twelve patients with primary hvKp pneumonia were included (11 males, 1 female). All patients were infected via respiratory tract inhalation. Ten patients were long-term drinkers. Four patients (33.3%), who were long-term alcohol abusers, died within 30 days after diagnosis. No extrapulmonary metastatic infection was found in any patient. The imaging of lung lesions at the early disease stage exhibited an extensive consolidation in the lungs. As the disease progressed, the most common imaging features were pleural effusion (9/12), cavitation and necrosis (8/12), and pneumothorax (3/12). The serological typing of the capsular polysaccharides on hvKp strains were K1 (6/12) and K2 (6/12). Furthermore, the virulence genotyping showed rmpA (11/12), magA (11/12), ureA (12/12), mrkD (12/12), fim-1 (12/12), wabG (12/12), ybtS (12/12), and iucB (11/12). Primary severe community-acquired hvKp-associated pneumonia is more common in men, especially those with a long-term history of alcohol consumption. CT scanning at the early disease stage mostly showed extensive pulmonary consolidation, which was prone to be combined with cavitation, necrosis, and pleural effusion. K1 and K2 serotypes were identified among the hvKp strains, which were not prone to form extrapulmonary metastasis via the bloodstream.",,741
871,35974852,The Prevalence of Obesity Among Employees of a Tertiary Healthcare Organization in Saudi Arabia and Its Impact on the Organization.,"Obesity is a significant risk factor for multiple diseases such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. Many healthcare organizations worldwide have identified a high prevalence of obesity among their employees. In this study, we are looking at the prevalence of obesity among the employees of our healthcare organization and its impact on the employees' productivity and if its current prevalence is costly to the employer. This is a non-interventional cross-sectional study conducted at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Data on the current employees were obtained from medical records. We investigated a random sample of employees who worked in the hospital for at least one year between January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2022. We explored the prevalence of obesity among hospital employees at the beginning of their employment and its current prevalence. In addition, we aimed to investigate the effect of having employees suffering from obesity on their productivity and their utilization of healthcare during their employment period. We identified that our hospital has relatively younger healthcare workers and more employees who are suffering from obesity than in different other countries. The percentage of obese male and female employees was comparable. We had a relatively high increase in the prevalence of obesity among our employees during the last few years. We found a higher number of obesity-related medical problems, more office visits, more sick leaves, and more medications prescribed for overweight and employees who are suffering from obesity compared to those with normal weight. Healthcare workers suffering from obesity had lower productivity and they had higher utilization of healthcare. Therefore, employers should investigate the prevalence of obesity in their organization and implement diverse strategies to prevent and manage this issue to help their employees have better health and, at the same time, be more productive and lower their utilization of healthcare.",,742
2480,35966778,Clinical determinants and neural correlates of presbyphagia in community-dwelling older adults.,"Presbyphagia refers to characteristic age-related changes in the complex neuromuscular swallowing mechanism. It has been hypothesized that cumulative impairments in multiple domains affect functional reserve of swallowing with age, but the multifactorial etiology and postulated compensatory strategies of the brain are incompletely understood. This study investigates presbyphagia and its neural correlates, focusing on the clinical determinants associated with adaptive neuroplasticity. 64 subjects over 70 years of age free of typical diseases explaining dysphagia received comprehensive workup including flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), magnetoencephalography (MEG) during swallowing and pharyngeal stimulation, volumetry of swallowing muscles, laboratory analyzes, and assessment of hand-grip-strength, nutritional status, frailty, olfaction, cognition and mental health. Neural MEG activation was compared between participants with and without presbyphagia in FEES, and associated clinical influencing factors were analyzed. Presbyphagia was defined as the presence of oropharyngeal swallowing alterations e.g., penetration, aspiration, pharyngeal residue pooling or premature bolus spillage into the piriform sinus and/or laryngeal vestibule. 32 of 64 participants showed swallowing alterations, mainly characterized by pharyngeal residue, whereas the airway was rarely compromised. In the MEG analysis, participants with presbyphagia activated an increased cortical sensorimotor network during swallowing. As major clinical determinant, participants with swallowing alterations exhibited reduced pharyngeal sensation. Presbyphagia was an independent predictor of a reduced nutritional status in a linear regression model. Swallowing alterations frequently occur in otherwise healthy older adults and are associated with decreased nutritional status. Increased sensorimotor cortical activation may constitute a compensation attempt to uphold swallowing function due to sensory decline. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the swallowing alterations observed can be considered physiological per se or whether the concept of presbyphagia may need to be extended to a theory with a continuous transition between presbyphagia and dysphagia.",,743
1253,35971362,A Closed-Loop Audit for Orthopedic Trauma Operation Notes Comparing Typed Electronic Notes With Handwritten Notes.,"Introduction Operation notes are important documents for ensuring patient safety, effective communication between clinicians, and for medicolegal purposes. It is essential that they are clear and accurate. We audited the quality of our operation notes against the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) of England's Good Surgical Practice Guidelines. Methods This was a prospective audit of 99 orthopedic trauma operation notes. In the first cycle, we audited 58 operation notes for orthopedic trauma surgical procedures. We audited 17 parameters per note. We presented our findings, implemented changes including the use of a typed operation note template, and performed a re-audit using 41 operation notes. Results Our documentation for 3/17 parameters was up to standard in both cycles. Post-intervention, there was an improvement in documentation for 12/17 of the parameters with marked improvements in indication for surgery (45% vs 75%), tourniquet time (20% vs 45%), antibiotic prophylaxis (71% vs 89%), closure technique (62% vs 86%) and detailed postoperative instruction (40% vs 92%). Other parameters, particularly estimated blood loss (7% vs 8%) remained unchanged. In the second cycle, we noted that 25% of the typed notes had 100% compliance with the standards, whereas no handwritten note achieved this. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of correctly documented parameters between the typed and handwritten notes (p < 0.05). Conclusion The use of operation note templates (preferably typed) can improve appropriate documentation in orthopedic trauma operation notes. These templates should be made easily accessible to all surgeons. We will recommend orthopedic trauma units to apply similar non-rigid templates that can be tailored to suit different categories of trauma surgery.",,744
2498,35966712,The dynamic transcriptome during maturation of biofilms formed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a leading cause of chronic infections, forms prolific biofilms which afford an escape route from antibiotic treatment and host immunity. However, MRSA clones are genetically diverse, and mechanisms underlying biofilm formation remain under-studied. Such studies form the basis for developing targeted therapeutics. Here, we studied the temporal changes in the biofilm transcriptome of three pandemic MRSA clones: USA300, HEMRSA-15, and ST239. Biofilm formation was assessed using a static model with one representative strain per clone. Total RNA was extracted from biofilm and planktonic cultures after 24, 48, and 72 h of growth, followed by rRNA depletion and sequencing (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, United States, NextSeq500, v2, 1 × 75 bp). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis between phenotypes and among early (24 h), intermediate (48 h), and late (72 h) stages of biofilms was performed together with in silico co-expression network construction and compared between clones. To understand the influence of SCCmec and ACME on biofilm formation, isogenic mutants containing deletions of the entire elements or of single genes therein were constructed in USA300. Genes involved in primarily core genome-encoded KEGG pathways (transporters and others) were upregulated in 24-h biofilm culture compared to 24-h planktonic culture. However, the number of affected pathways in the ST239 24 h biofilm (n = 11) was remarkably lower than that in USA300/EMRSA-15 biofilms (USA300: n = 27, HEMRSA-15: n = 58). The clfA gene, which encodes clumping factor A, was the single common DEG identified across the three clones in 24-h biofilm culture (2.2- to 2.66-fold). In intermediate (48 h) and late (72 h) stages of biofilms, decreased expression of central metabolic and fermentative pathways (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid biosynthesis), indicating a shift to anaerobic conditions, was already evident in USA300 and HEMRSA-15 in 48-h biofilm cultures; ST239 showed a similar profile at 72 h. Last, SCCmec+ACME deletion and opp3D disruption negatively affected USA300 biofilm formation. Our data show striking differences in gene expression during biofilm formation by three of the most important pandemic MRSA clones, USA300, HEMRSA-15, and ST239. The clfA gene was the only significantly upregulated gene across all three strains in 24-h biofilm cultures and exemplifies an important target to disrupt early biofilms. Furthermore, our data indicate a critical role for arginine catabolism pathways in early biofilm formation.",,745
199,35982823,BTZ-Derived Benzisothiazolinones with In Vitro Activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"8-Nitro-1,3-benzothiazin-4-ones (BTZs) are known as potent antitubercular agents. BTZ043 as one of the most advanced compounds has reached clinical trials. The putative oxidation products of BTZ043, namely, the corresponding BTZ sulfoxide and sulfone, were reported in this journal (Tiwari et al. ACS Med. Chem Lett. 2015, 6, 128-133). The molecular structures were later revised to the constitutionally isomeric benzisothiazolone and its 1-oxide, respectively. Here, we report two BTZ043-derived benzisothiazolinones (BITs) with in vitro activity against mycobacteria. The constitutionally isomeric O-acyl benzisothiazol-3-ols, in contrast, show little or no antimycobacterial activity in vitro. The structures of the four compounds were investigated by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Molecular covalent docking of the new compounds to Mycobacerium tuberculosis decaprenylphosphoryl-β-d-ribose 2'-epimerase (DprE1) suggests that the active BITs exert antimycobacterial activity through inhibition of DprE1 like BTZs.",,746
13,35985220,Molecular mechanisms and genomic basis of tigecycline-resistant Enterobacterales from swine slaughterhouses.,"The continuous emergence of tigecycline-resistant bacteria is undermining the effectiveness of clinical tigecycline. Environmental tigecycline-resistant bacteria have the potential to infect humans through human-environment interactions. Furthermore, the mechanisms of tigecycline resistance in Enterobacterales are complicated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the additional pathways of tigecycline resistance in environmental Enterobacterales besides tet(X) and tmexCD-toprJ. During the years 2019-2020, tigecycline-resistant Enterobacterales (n = 45) negative for tet(X) and tmexCD-toprJ were recovered from 328 different samples from two slaughterhouses. Five distinct bacteria species were identified, of which Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 37) was the most common, with K. pneumoniae ST45 and ST35 being the predominant clones. Tigecycline resistance determinants analysis showed that tet(A) mutations and ramR inactivation were the most prevalent mechanisms for tigecycline resistance in the 45 strains. Two known tet(A) variants (type 1 and tet(A)-v) and one novel tet(A) variant (type 3) were identified. Cloning experiments confirmed that the novel type 3 tet(A) could enhance the 4-fold MIC for tigecycline. Inactivation of ramR was induced by either point mutations or indels of sequences, which could result in the overexpression of AcrAB pump genes leading to tigecycline resistance. In addition, all isolates were resistant to a wide range of antimicrobials and carried various resistance genes. These findings enriched the epidemiological and genomic characterizations of tigecycline-resistant Enterobacterales from slaughterhouses and contributed to a better understanding of the complex mechanisms of tigecycline resistance in environmental bacteria.",,747

677,35975535,Immunosuppression is a Double-Edged Sword in COVID-19 Treatment: a Case Report of Rhino-Orbito-Cerebral Mucormycosis.,"Mucormycosis is a life-threatening fungal infection mostly occurring in immunosuppressed patients such as organ transplant or diabetic patients. In this paper, we described a case of COVID-19 with rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis. The nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) from a nasopharyngeal sample for SARS-CoV-2 was done. Demographic data, biochemical tests, paranasal sinuses (PNS) CT scan, brain CT scan, chest CT scan, and palate biopsy were performed. The NAAT was positive for SARS-CoV-2. PNS CT scan revealed mucosal thickening of all paranasal sinuses, brain CT scan showed hypodense area in antero-inferior cortex, and chest CT scan revealed diffuse ground glass opacity in favor of COVID-19 infection. Palate biopsy revealed fibroconnective tissue with broad pauciseptated ribbon-like hyphae. In this paper, a case of COVID-19 with rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis was described. The treatment with immunosuppressive drugs predisposed this patient to secondary fungal infection. Immunosuppression is a double-edged sword in COVID-19 treatment and immunosuppressive drugs should be prescribed only in severely ill patients and for a short period.",,749
1574,35968312,Cerebral small vessel disease and perihematomal edema formation in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD)-related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The formation of perihematomal edema (PHE) is presumed to reflect acute BBB permeability following ICH. We aimed to assess the association between cSVD burden and PHE formation in patients with spontaneous ICH. We selected patients with spontaneous ICH who underwent 3T MRI imaging within 21 days after symptom onset from a prospective observational multicenter cohort study. We rated markers of cSVD (white matter hyperintensities, enlarged perivascular spaces, lacunes and cerebral microbleeds) and calculated the composite score as a measure of the total cSVD burden. Perihematomal edema formation was measured using the edema extension distance (EED). We assessed the association between the cSVD burden and the EED using a multivariable linear regression model adjusting for age, (log-transformed) ICH volume, ICH location (lobar vs. non-lobar), and interval between symptom onset and MRI. We included 85 patients (mean age 63.5 years, 75.3% male). Median interval between symptom onset and MRI imaging was 6 days (IQR 1-19). Median ICH volume was 17.0 mL (IQR 1.4-88.6), and mean EED was 0.54 cm (SD 0.17). We found no association between the total cSVD burden and EED (B = -0.003, 95% CI -0.003-0.03, p = 0.83), nor for any of the individual radiological cSVD markers. We found no association between the cSVD burden and PHE formation. This implies that mechanisms other than BBB dysfunction are involved in the pathophysiology of PHE.",,750
2081,35967437,Distinct host immune responses in recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and vulvovaginal candidiasis.,"Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) are one of the most common gynecological infections, primarily caused by Candida species. Although risk factors of RVVC and VVC have been identified in many studies, antifungal immunological mechanisms are still not fully understood. We performed a 1-year prospective study in a local hospital to monitor 98 patients clinically diagnosed with gynecological Candida infection. The results showed that 20.41% (20/98) are with RVVC, and 79.59% (78/98) patients have VVC. C. albicans accounts for 90% and 96.1% of all strains isolated collected from RVVC and VVC patients, respectively. Antifungal susceptibility testing showed no significant difference in Candida species between RVVC and VVC patients. However, the serum levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17F in the RVVC group were significantly lower than those of the VVC group, while IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 were higher in the RVVC patients than VVC patients. IL-17A and IL-2 levels were comparable between the two groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the host-immune responses, especially Th1/2 immunity, may play important roles in prognosis of RVVC and VVC.",,751
2004,35967583,Open controversies on the treatment of undescended testis: An update.,"Cryptorchidism is a common congenital malformation in pediatric urology. Although there have been many studies on the etiology of the disease, it has not been fully clarified, and while its diagnostic and treatment models have gradually approached standardization and systematization, some controversies regarding treatment remain. Additionally, although ultrasound is a non-invasive examination without ionizing radiation, its role in the evaluation of cryptorchidism remains controversial. The main basis for treating cryptorchidism is orchidopexy, and the main view on treatment age is that treatment should be performed between 6 and 12 months after birth, but no more than 18 months after birth. The view on hormone therapy is still controversial because most scholars believe that early surgery is the key to treatment. There are many surgical treatment methods for cryptorchidism, including traditional open surgery and laparoscopic surgery, which provide satisfactory results. In conclusion, the treatment of undescended testis (UDT) had been largely standardized, apart from the treatment of high intra-abdominal testis (IAT), which remains a matter of debate.",,752
1626,35968152,Genome-wide characterization and analysis of Golden 2-Like transcription factors related to leaf chlorophyll synthesis in diploid and triploid Eucalyptus urophylla.,"Golden 2-Like (GLK) transcription factors play a crucial role in chloroplast development and chlorophyll synthesis in many plant taxa. To date, no systematic analysis of GLK transcription factors in tree species has been conducted. In this study, 40 EgrGLK genes in the Eucalyptus grandis genome were identified and divided into seven groups based on the gene structure and motif composition. The EgrGLK genes were mapped to 11 chromosomes and the distribution of genes on chromosome was uneven. Phylogenetic analysis of GLK proteins between E. grandis and other species provided information for the high evolutionary conservation of GLK genes among different species. Prediction of cis-regulatory elements indicated that the EgrGLK genes were involved in development, light response, and hormone response. Based on the finding that the content of chlorophyll in mature leaves was the highest, and leaf chlorophyll content of triploid Eucalyptus urophylla was higher than that of the diploid control, EgrGLK expression pattern in leaves of triploid and diploid E. urophylla was examined by means of transcriptome analysis. Differential expression of EgrGLK genes in leaves of E. urophylla of different ploidies was consistent with the trend in chlorophyll content. To further explore the relationship between EgrGLK expression and chlorophyll synthesis, co-expression networks were generated, which indicated that EgrGLK genes may have a positive regulatory relationship with chlorophyll synthesis. In addition, three EgrGLK genes that may play an important role in chlorophyll synthesis were identified in the co-expression networks. And the prediction of miRNAs targeting EgrGLK genes showed that miRNAs might play an important role in the regulation of EgrGLK gene expression. This research provides valuable information for further functional characterization of GLK genes in Eucalyptus.",,753
1682,35968091,Selection strategies to introgress water deficit tolerance derived from Solanum galapagense accession LA1141 into cultivated tomato.,"Crop wild relatives have been used as a source of genetic diversity for over one hundred years. The wild tomato relative Solanum galapagense accession LA1141 demonstrates the ability to tolerate deficit irrigation, making it a potential resource for crop improvement. Accessing traits from LA1141 through introgression may improve the response of cultivated tomatoes grown in water-limited environments. Canopy temperature is a proxy for physiological traits which are challenging to measure efficiently and may be related to water deficit tolerance. We optimized phenotypic evaluation based on variance partitioning and further show that objective phenotyping methods coupled with genomic prediction lead to gain under selection for water deficit tolerance. The objectives of this work were to improve phenotyping workflows for measuring canopy temperature, mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from LA1141 that contribute to water deficit tolerance and comparing selection strategies. The phenotypic variance attributed to genetic causes for canopy temperature was higher when estimated from thermal images relative to estimates based on an infrared thermometer. Composite interval mapping using BC2S3 families, genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphisms, suggested that accession LA1141 contributed alleles that lower canopy temperature and increase plant turgor under water deficit. QTLs for lower canopy temperature were mapped to chromosomes 1 and 6 and explained between 6.6 and 9.5% of the total phenotypic variance. QTLs for higher leaf turgor were detected on chromosomes 5 and 7 and explained between 6.8 and 9.1% of the variance. We advanced tolerant BC2S3 families to the BC2S5 generation using selection indices based on phenotypic values and genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs). Phenotypic, genomic, and combined selection strategies demonstrated gain under selection and improved performance compared to randomly advanced BC2S5 progenies. Leaf turgor, canopy temperature, stomatal conductance, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were evaluated and compared in BC2S5 progenies grown under deficit irrigation. Progenies co-selected for phenotypic values and GEBVs wilted less, had significantly lower canopy temperature, higher stomatal conductance, and lower VPD than randomly advanced lines. The fruit size of water deficit tolerant selections was small compared to the recurrent parent. However, lines with acceptable yield, canopy width, and quality parameters were recovered. These results suggest that we can create selection indices to improve water deficit tolerance in a recurrent parent background, and additional crossing and evaluation are warranted.",,754
251,35982596,Quantification of Efflorescences in Pustular Psoriasis Using Deep Learning.,"Pustular psoriasis (PP) is one of the most severe and chronic skin conditions. Its treatment is difficult, and measurements of its severity are highly dependent on clinicians' experience. Pustules and brown spots are the main efflorescences of the disease and directly correlate with its activity. We propose an automated deep learning model (DLM) to quantify lesions in terms of count and surface percentage from patient photographs. In this retrospective study, two dermatologists and a student labeled 151 photographs of PP patients for pustules and brown spots. The DLM was trained and validated with 121 photographs, keeping 30 photographs as a test set to assess the DLM performance on unseen data. We also evaluated our DLM on 213 unstandardized, out-of-distribution photographs of various pustular disorders (referred to as the pustular set), which were ranked from 0 (no disease) to 4 (very severe) by one dermatologist for disease severity. The agreement between the DLM predictions and experts' labels was evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the test set and Spearman correlation (SC) coefficient for the pustular set. On the test set, the DLM achieved an ICC of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-0.98) for count and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92-0.94) for surface percentage. On the pustular set, the DLM reached a SC coefficient of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.60-0.74) for count and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83) for surface percentage. The proposed method quantifies efflorescences from PP photographs reliably and automatically, enabling a precise and objective evaluation of disease activity.",,755
1945,35967663,Is good more alike than bad? Positive-negative asymmetry in the differentiation between options. A study on the evaluation of fictitious political profiles.,"Our research focuses on the perception of difference in the evaluations of positive and negative options. The literature provides evidence for two opposite effects: on the one hand, negative objects are said to be more differentiated (e.g., density hypothesis), on the other, people are shown to see greater differences between positive options (e.g., liking-breeds-differentiation principle). In our study, we investigated the perception of difference between fictitious political candidates, hypothesizing greater differences among the evaluations of favorable candidates. Additionally, we analyzed how positive and negative information affect candidate evaluation, predicting further asymmetries. In three experiments, participants evaluated various candidate profiles presented in a numeric and narrative manner. The evaluation tasks were designed as individual or joint assessments. In all three studies, we found more differentiation between positive than negative options. Our research suggests that after exceeding a certain, relatively small level of negativity, people do not see any further increase in negativity. The increase in positivity, on the other hand, is more gradual, with greater differentiation among positive options. Our findings are discussed in light of cognitive-experiential self-theory and density hypothesis.",,756
1288,35970692,"The effect of motivational strategy on voluntary plasma donation, a field trial.","Plasma protein therapies (PPTs) are a group of medicines extracted from human plasma through fractionation. The manufacture of adequate amounts of PPTs requires a large volume of human plasma. WHO emphasized that whole blood and blood component donations should be voluntary and non-remunerated. So, motivating people to donate plasma is crucial. In this study, we evaluated the impact of social media on motivating blood donors to donate plasma without any compensation and the moderating effects of blood donation history on plasma donation. we allocated blood donors (n = 501) to intervention and control groups randomly. Participants in the intervention group got educational and motivational messages through a WhatsApp channel. Then, we followed up all participants for six months and registered the information of the plasma donation during this period. In the intervention group, 6.8% had returned to donate plasma, while this was 2% in the control group (p = 0.016, OR:3.59, 95%CI:1.3-9.89). Among regular blood donors in the intervention group, 17.86% had returned to donate plasma but, no regular donor returned to donate plasma in the control group (p = 0.055). In addition, 10.8% of donors who had academic education in the intervention group returned to donate plasma, although this was 2.54% in the control group (P = 0.0485). Our findings suggest that the educational interventions have more effects on academically educated donors to motivate them to donate plasma.",,757
1089,35974530,Numerical study on the Leidenfrost behavior of a droplet stream impinging on a heated wall.,"A detailed understanding of drop-wall interactions at high-temperature and high-pressure conditions can help optimize fuel injection, engine operation, and material design. The existing formulas developed for simulating drop-wall interactions are either valid only for a small range of operating conditions or based on the single-drop impact scenarios neglecting the effect of the nonstationary liquid film on the wall. The Leidenfrost temperature is a critical parameter in determining the impact outcome and needs to be considered in characterizing the impact behavior at extreme conditions. In this study, the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, a Lagrangian-based method, is used to study the impact of an n-heptane droplet stream on a heated wall near and above the Leidenfrost temperature. The impingement frequency and wall temperature are varied to understand the impact dynamics and outcomes. Visualizations of the impact outcomes are provided to explain the interaction between the succeeding drops and the liquid film created by the preceding drops. To further characterize the shift in the Leidenfrost behaviors and the corresponding impact outcomes caused by the change in ambient pressure, simulations are also conducted at the corresponding fluid states for ambient pressures of 5 and 20 bar. Results show that the increase in ambient pressure impedes splashing and the film is concentrated inwards near the impingement point.",,758
2354,35967022,Experimental Investigation of Supercritical CO2-Rock-Water Interactions in a Tight Formation with the Pore Scale during CO2-EOR and Sequestration.,"In recent years, gas injection, especially CO2 injection, has been acknowledged as a promising approach for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and CO2 capture and storage (CCS), especially for tight reservoirs. However, when CO2 is injected into the oil reservoirs, it can disturb the equilibrium of the system and lead to chemical reactions between CO2, formation water, and reservoir rocks. The reactions will alter some geochemical and physicochemical characteristics of the target reservoirs. However, the reactions still lack quantitative characterization at the pore scale, especially under reservoir conditions. Herein, we conducted an experimental study of the interactions between CO2, brine, and rocks in the Mahu oilfield at 20 MPa and 70 °C. The low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) measurements showed that the incremental amplitude for tight cores of CO2-rock-water tests was larger than that for CO2-rock tests, and the amplitude alteration presented significant differences corresponding to different types of minerals and pores. Furthermore, the interplanar spacing of the core samples was increased with the increase of reaction time in the CO2-rock experiments but still lower than that in CO2-rock-water tests. This research demonstrated evident changes in the geochemistry in tight reservoirs caused by CO2, brine, and rock reactions. The results of this study may provide a significant reference for the exploration of similar reservoirs in the field of CO2-EOR and CO2 sequestration.",,759
1169,35973372,"Integrated transcriptomics unravels implications of glycosylation-regulating signature in diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic benefits of hepatocellular carcinoma.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, featured by markedly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME), meet diverse clinical outcome and neoadjuvant response. Yet the comprehensive influences of aberrant glycosylation on the TME of HCC remain elusive. In this study, by integrated transcriptome profiling, we systemically analyzed the considerable value of glycosylation-regulating signature in diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. A diagnostic model for HCC based on glycosylation-regulating REOs (relative expression orderings) was constructed. A robust glycoscore system was developed to evaluate distinct glycosylation patterns of patients in both the discovery and independent validation cohorts. Mechanisms for prognostic discrepancies between these patterns were dissected in tumor immunoediting, metabolic reprogramming, somatic mutations, and copy number variation (CNV). An individual survival prediction webserver based on a nomogram model (https://survpredict.shinyapps.io/DynNom/) was also established, which facilitates the translational and clinical application of glycoscore. The glycoscore could also effectively predict therapeutic response to sorafenib, Transhepatic Arterial Chemotherapy and Embolization (TACE), and anti-PD-1 therapies in patients with divergent glycosylation patterns, which was validated by a machine learning model. In summary, our study provided a unique insight into the HCC diagnosis and prognostic stratification based on integrated glycosylation-regulating signature. The robust glycosylation scoring system could comprehensively evaluate TME traits, predict prognosis and clinical benefits from neoadjuvant therapies, which may hold promise for promoting personalized clinical decision-making.",,760
522,35978737,A Clinical Significance of Fungal Infections in Diabetic Foot Ulcers.,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are the most common and serious complications in uncontrolled diabetes. Infections are predominantly polymicrobial, with aerobic Gram-positive, anerobic, and fungal infections. Early detection of fungal infection and initiation of appropriate treatment in DFUs may lead to better healing and avoid amputations. The primary objective was to find out the prevalence of DFUs getting infected with fungus and the secondary objective was to identify the appropriate methodology for the detection of the fungus in DFUs.  This was a cross-sectional observational study carried out in a tertiary care hospital with a sample size of 60 DFUs. Microbiological analysis was done by swab culture and deep tissue culture. Observational data were collected and the significance level was statistically analyzed.  In the present study, the prevalence of fungal infections in DFUs was 31.7%. Only fungal tissue was positive in 15%, the fungal swab was positive in 8.33%, and both tissue and swab were positive in 8.33%. All these patients were treated with antifungal treatment as per the culture report in addition to appropriate antimicrobial therapy.  A fungal culture should be done in all patients with non-healing DFUs. Both fungal swab and tissue culture testing should be advocated in patients with DFUs for better mycological evaluation. The addition of antifungal medications may provide better outcomes in selected cases.",,761
2098,35967420,Pathophysiology of RAGE in inflammatory diseases.,"The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a non-specific multi-ligand pattern recognition receptor capable of binding to a range of structurally diverse ligands, expressed on a variety of cell types, and performing different functions. The ligand-RAGE axis can trigger a range of signaling events that are associated with diabetes and its complications, neurological disorders, cancer, inflammation and other diseases. Since RAGE is involved in the pathophysiological processes of many diseases, targeting RAGE may be an effective strategy to block RAGE signaling.",,762
2371,35967003,Balance impairment in myotonic dystrophy type 1: Dynamic posturography suggests the coexistence of a proprioceptive and vestibular deficit.,"Falls are frequent in Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the pathophysiology of the balance impairment needs further exploration in this disease. The current work aims to provide a richer understanding of DM1 imbalance. Standing balance in 16 patients and 40 controls was tested in two posturographic tests (EquiTest™). In the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), standstill balance was challenged by combining visual (eyes open vs. closed) and environmental conditions (fixed vs. sway-tuned platform and/or visual surround). In the react test, reflexes induced by sudden shifts in the support base were studied. Oscillations of the body centre of mass (COM) were measured. In the SOT, COM sway was larger in patients than controls in any condition, including firm support with eyes open (quiet standing). On sway-tuned support, COM oscillations when standing with closed eyes were larger in patients than controls even after taking into account the oscillations with eyes open. In the react paradigm, balance reflexes were delayed in patients. Results in both experimental paradigms (i.e., SOT and react test) are consistent with leg muscle weakness. This, however, is not a sufficient explanation. The SOT test highlighted that patients rely on vision more than controls to maintain static balance. Consistently enough, evidence is provided that an impairment of proprioceptive and vestibular systems contributes to falls in DM1. Rehabilitation programs targeted at reweighting sensory systems may be designed to improve safe mobility in DM1.",,763
1437,35968461,Machine learning-assisted prediction of pneumonia based on non-invasive measures.,"Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. The use of machine learning systems to detect respiratory diseases via non-invasive measures such as physical and laboratory parameters is gaining momentum and has been proposed to decrease diagnostic uncertainty associated with bacterial pneumonia. Herein, this study conducted several experiments using eight machine learning models to predict pneumonia based on biomarkers, laboratory parameters, and physical features. We perform machine-learning analysis on 535 different patients, each with 45 features. Data normalization to rescale all real-valued features was performed. Since it is a binary problem, we categorized each patient into one class at a time. We designed three experiments to evaluate the models: (1) feature selection techniques to select appropriate features for the models, (2) experiments on the imbalanced original dataset, and (3) experiments on the SMOTE data. We then compared eight machine learning models to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting pneumonia. Biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin demonstrated the most significant discriminating power. Ensemble machine learning models such as RF (accuracy = 92.0%, precision = 91.3%, recall = 96.0%, f1-Score = 93.6%) and XGBoost (accuracy = 90.8%, precision = 92.6%, recall = 92.3%, f1-score = 92.4%) achieved the highest performance accuracy on the original dataset with AUCs of 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. On the SMOTE dataset, RF and XGBoost achieved the highest prediction results with f1-scores of 92.0 and 91.2%, respectively. Also, AUC of 0.97 was achieved for both RF and XGBoost models. Our models showed that in the diagnosis of pneumonia, individual clinical history, laboratory indicators, and symptoms do not have adequate discriminatory power. We can also conclude that the ensemble ML models performed better in this study.",,764
2110,35967408,m6A-related metabolism molecular classification with distinct prognosis and immunotherapy response in soft tissue sarcoma.,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, one of the most crucial RNA modifications, has been proven to play a key role that affect prognosis of soft tissue sarcoma (STS). However, m6A methylation potential role in STS metabolic processes remains unknown. We comprehensively estimated the m6A metabolic molecular subtypes and corresponding survival, immunity, genomic and stemness characteristics based on 568 STS samples and m6A related metabolic pathways. Then, to quantify the m6A metabolic subtypes, machine learning algorithms were used to develop the m6A-metabolic Scores of individual patients. Finally, two distinct m6A metabolic subtypes (Cluster A and Cluster B) among the STS patients were identified. Compared to Cluster B subtype, the Cluster A subtype was mainly characterized by better survival advantages, activated anti-tumor immune microenvironment, lower gene mutation frequency and higher anti-PD-1 immunotherapy response rates. We also found that the m6A-metabolic Scores could accurately predict the molecular subtype of STS, prognosis, the abundance of immune cell infiltration, tumor metastasis status, sensitivity to chemotherapeutics and immunotherapy response. In general, this study revealed that m6A-regulated tumor metabolism processes played a key role in terms of prognosis of STS, tumor progression, and immune microenvironment. The identification of metabolic molecular subtypes and the construction of m6A-metabolic Score will help to more effectively guide immunotherapy, metabolic therapy and chemotherapy in STS.",,765

Pathological femoral shaft fracture along with MAS is not a common occurrence. Bisphosphonates can be used for the management of pathological fractures. A seven-year-old male child presented with pathological femoral shaft fracture with MAS (café-au-lait macules and hyperthyroidism). The patient was managed conservatively with closed reduction along with hip spica and oral alendronate. Fracture consolidation occurred within six to eight weeks with improvement in bone pains. Oral alendronate can be used as an adjuvant to conservative therapy for pathological fracture in MAS in children.,,766
1950,35967657,Responsible Leadership and Affective Organizational Commitment: The Mediating Effect of Corporate Social Responsibility.,"Organizations and their leaders are challenged to assume a responsible behavior given the increase of corporate scandals and the deterioration of employee commitment. However, relatively few studies have investigated the impact of responsible leadership (RL) on employee commitment and the effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in this relationship. Using the social identity theory this article examined the mediating effect of CSR practices in the relationship between RL and affective organizational commitment (AOC). Data collection was done through a paper survey completed by 309 full-time Colombian employees. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results showed that CSR fully mediated the influence of RL on AOC. Thus, RL is an effective mechanism to develop CSR practices that in turn increase the levels of AOC of employees.",,767
1024,35974595,Boundary chaos.,"Scrambling in many-body quantum systems causes initially local observables to spread uniformly over the whole available Hilbert space under unitary dynamics, which in lattice systems causes exponential suppression of dynamical correlation functions with system size. Here, we present a perturbed free quantum circuit model, in which ergodicity is induced by an impurity interaction placed on the system's boundary, that allows for demonstrating the underlying mechanism. This is achieved by mapping dynamical correlation functions of local operators acting at the boundary to a partition function with complex weights defined on a two-dimensional lattice with a helical topology. We evaluate this partition function in terms of transfer matrices, which allow for numerically treating system sizes far beyond what is accessible by exact diagonalization and whose spectral properties determine the asymptotic scaling of correlations. Combining analytical arguments with numerical results, we show that for impurities which remain unitary under partial transpose correlations are exponentially suppressed with system size in a particular scaling limit. In contrast, for generic impurities or generic locations of the local operators, correlations show persistent revivals with a period given by the system size.",,768
2486,35966772,Automatic segmentation of white matter hyperintensities in routine clinical brain MRI by 2D VB-Net: A large-scale study.,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are imaging manifestations frequently observed in various neurological disorders, yet the clinical application of WMH quantification is limited. In this study, we designed a series of dedicated WMH labeling protocols and proposed a convolutional neural network named 2D VB-Net for the segmentation of WMH and other coexisting intracranial lesions based on a large dataset of 1,045 subjects across various demographics and multiple scanners using 2D thick-slice protocols that are more commonly applied in clinical practice. Using our labeling pipeline, the Dice consistency of the WMH regions manually depicted by two observers was 0.878, which formed a solid basis for the development and evaluation of the automatic segmentation system. The proposed algorithm outperformed other state-of-the-art methods (uResNet, 3D V-Net and Visual Geometry Group network) in the segmentation of WMH and other coexisting intracranial lesions and was well validated on datasets with thick-slice magnetic resonance (MR) images and the 2017 medical image computing and computer assisted intervention WMH Segmentation Challenge dataset (with thin-slice MR images), all showing excellent effectiveness. Furthermore, our method can subclassify WMH to display the WMH distributions and is very lightweight. Additionally, in terms of correlation to visual rating scores, our algorithm showed excellent consistency with the manual delineations and was overall better than those from other competing methods. In conclusion, we developed an automatic WMH quantification framework for multiple application scenarios, exhibiting a promising future in clinical practice.",,769
604,35977870,Identifying additional risk factors for early asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia in term and late preterm babies.,"Neonatal hypoglycemia is a common metabolic disorder in newborns, which may present with non-specific symptoms or even be asymptomatic. Current guidelines recommend screening for hypoglycemia in at-risk babies (late preterm, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, and infants of diabetic mothers). Past studies have suggested other potential risk factors, such as maternal obesity, gestational hypertension, cesarean section, etc. In this study, we aim to identify additional prenatal and perinatal maternal/fetal characteristics associated with early asymptomatic hypoglycemia in term and late preterm babies. We performed a retrospective review on medical charts of all newborns, born between January, 2017 and December, 2020, in the well-baby newborn nursery of a tertiary medical center. We identified newborns who had received blood glucose concentration monitor after birth. Detailed prenatal and perinatal maternal/newborn information were collected for analysis. In the study period, 841 newborns had received blood glucose screening after birth. After matching by sex and indication for postnatal blood glucose screen (SGA, LGA, and GDM), 148 newborns were included in the hypoglycemia group and 296 newborns were included in the euglycemia group. In the univariate analysis, parity, insulin treatment for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and cesarean section were associated with an increased risk for neonatal hypoglycemia. Factors associated with decreased risk included higher gestational age, longer duration of skin-to-skin contact, neonatal hyperthermia, higher maternal labor pain score, and epidural anesthesia administration. By multivariable analysis, insulin treatment for GDM was identified as an independent factor associated with increased risk for neonatal hypoglycemia. Our study showed insulin treatment for GDM to be independently associated with neonatal hypoglycemia. Other risk factors noted in the univariate analysis, such as decreased skin-to-skin contact duration, hypothermia, Cesarean section, and preterm delivery, would require further investigation to confirm the findings.",,770
352,35979322,Review of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors administration to non-small-cell lung cancer patients undergoing hemodialysis.,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) causes significant mortality worldwide. Patients with chronic renal failure have an increased risk of developing lung cancer. NSCLC Patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis (HD) often exhibit poor performance, and chemotherapy is generally contraindicated. Oral epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective treatment agents for NSCLC patients. However, the benefits and adverse effects of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC undergoing HD are known. There are no clinical studies on the effects of EGFR-TKIs on NSCLC patients undergoing HD. We reviewed all previous case reports about EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients undergoing HD. It is difficult to design studies about the effects of EGFR-TKIs in patients undergoing HD, and this review is quite important. EGFR-TKIs are well tolerated in patients undergoing HD. The main routes of elimination of EGFR-TKIs are metabolism via the liver, and renal elimination is minor. The recommended doses and pharmacokinetics of these EGFR-TKIs for patients undergoing HD are similar to those for patients with normal renal function. The plasma protein binding of EGFR-TKIs is very high, and it is not necessary to adjust the dose after HD. In conclusion, EGFR-TKIs are effective and well tolerated in patients undergoing HD.",,771
999,35974620,Modeling fluid polyamorphism through a maximum-valence approach.,"We suggest a simple model to describe polyamorphism in single-component fluids using a maximum-valence approach. The model contains three types of interactions: (i) Atoms attract each other by van der Waals forces that generate a liquid-gas transition at low pressures, (ii) atoms may form covalent bonds that induce association, and (iii) atoms with maximal valence attract or repel each other stronger than other atoms, thus generating liquid-liquid separation. As an example, we qualitatively compare this model with the behavior of liquid sulfur and show that condition (iii) generates a liquid-liquid phase transition in addition to the liquid-gas phase transition.",,772
1946,35967662,Training in women soccer players: A systematic review on training load monitoring.,"The present systematic review aimed to provide an overview of training load (TL), along with their responses, monitoring during training sessions in highly trained and elite adult women soccer players. Electronic databases searches (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Ebsco) for relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals were conducted, and eligibility criteria were based on the PICOS model in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies were considered as follows: (a) highly trained and elite adult (>18 years) women's soccer players; (b) continuous (minimum 1-week duration) TL monitoring in the context of the team routine; (c) TL collected from entire training session. Methodological qualitative assessments and risk of bias criteria were used for judging the studies. A total of 1,163 studies were identified, and 16 were included. The selected studies were fully screened to extract the population characteristics; the number of players; a type of study design; region where the study was performed; the main findings. Accumulated external TL (ETL) during the pre-season was positively correlated to enhanced adaptations in intermittent exercise capacity. Daily ETL was negatively correlated to next-day self-reported fatigue and muscle soreness. Daily internal TL (ITL) was negatively correlated to post-session sleep duration and sleep efficiency. One study showed that higher accumulated player load and total distance were associated with injury. Information about TL during training sessions in women soccer players is very sparse, and it is currently very difficult to consider evidence-based practices for training sessions in highly trained and elite adult women soccer players. Moreover, the dose-response relationships between TL and training outcome (e.g., fatigue, training adaptations and injuries) need to be further explored to understand the optimal training stimulus to enhance performance outcomes while preserving player health.",,773
1513,35968373,Computer-based musical interval training program for Cochlear implant users and listeners with no known hearing loss.,"A musical interval is the difference in pitch between two sounds. The way that musical intervals are used in melodies relative to the tonal center of a key can strongly affect the emotion conveyed by the melody. The present study examines musical interval identification in people with no known hearing loss and in cochlear implant users. Pitch resolution varies widely among cochlear implant users with average resolution an order of magnitude worse than in normal hearing. The present study considers the effect of training on musical interval identification and tests for correlations between low-level psychophysics and higher-level musical abilities. The overarching hypothesis is that cochlear implant users are limited in their ability to identify musical intervals both by low-level access to frequency cues for pitch as well as higher-level mapping of the novel encoding of pitch that implants provide. Participants completed a 2-week, online interval identification training. The benchmark tests considered before and after interval identification training were pure tone detection thresholds, pure tone frequency discrimination, fundamental frequency discrimination, tonal and rhythm comparisons, and interval identification. The results indicate strong correlations between measures of pitch resolution with interval identification; however, only a small effect of training on interval identification was observed for the cochlear implant users. Discussion focuses on improving access to pitch cues for cochlear implant users and on improving auditory training for musical intervals.",,774
2159,35967359,A Simple-to-Perform ifn-γ mRNA Gene Expression Assay on Whole Blood Accurately Appraises Varicella Zoster Virus-Specific Cell-Mediated Immunity After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.,"Herpes zoster, which is due to the reactivation of Varicella zoster virus (VZV), is a leading cause of morbidity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). While cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is critical to inhibiting VZV reactivation, CMI is not routinely assessed due to a lack of reliable tests. In this study, we aimed to evaluate VZV-specific CMI among allo-HSCT recipients (n = 60) and healthy individuals (HI, n = 17) through a panel of three immune functional assays after ex vivo stimulation by VZV antigen: quantification of (i) IFN-γ release in the supernatants, (ii) T-cell proliferation after a 7-day stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and (iii) measurement of the ifn-γ mRNA gene expression level after 24 h of stimulation of a whole-blood sample. VZV responsiveness was defined according to IFN-γ release from VZV-stimulated PBMC. Upon VZV stimulation, we found that allo-HSCT recipients at a median time of 6 [5-8] months post-transplant had lower IFN-γ release (median [IQR], 0.34 [0.12-8.56] vs. 409.5 [143.9-910.2] pg/ml, P <.0001) and fewer proliferating T cells (0.05 [0.01-0.57] % vs. 8.74 [3.12-15.05] %, P <.0001) than HI. A subset of allo-HSCT recipients (VZV-responders, n = 15/57, 26%) distinguished themselves from VZV-non-responders (n = 42/57, 74%; missing data, n = 3) by higher IFN-γ release (80.45 [54.3-312.8] vs. 0.22 [0.12-0.42] pg/ml, P <.0001) and T-cell proliferation (2.22 [1.18-7.56] % vs. 0.002 [0.001-0.11] %, P <.0001), suggesting recovery of VZV-specific CMI. Interestingly, VZV responders had a significant fold increase in ifn-γ gene expression, whereas ifn-γ mRNA was not detected in whole blood of VZV-non-responders (P <.0001). This study is the first to suggest that measurement of ifn-γ gene expression in 24-h-stimulated whole blood could be an accurate test of VZV-specific CMI. The routine use of this immune functional assay to guide antiviral prophylaxis at an individual level remains to be evaluated.",,775
39,35983692,Habitat Type Affects Elevational Patterns in Ground-dwelling Arthropod Communities.,"Understanding factors that drive biodiversity distributions is central in ecology and critical to conservation. Elevational gradients are useful for studying the effects of climate on biodiversity but it can be difficult to disentangle climate effects from resource differences among habitat types. Here we compare elevational patterns and influences of environmental variables on ground-dwelling arthropods in open- and forested-habitats. We examine these comparisons in three arthropod functional groups (detritivores, predators, and herbivores) and two taxonomic groups (beetles and arachnids). We sampled twelve sites spanning 1,132 m elevation and four life zones, collecting 4,834 individual ground arthropods identified to 123 taxa. Elevation was a strong predicator for arthropod composition, however, patterns differed among functional and taxonomic groups and individual species between open- and forested-habitats. Beetles, arachnids, and predators decreased with elevation in open habitats but increased in forests showing a significant interaction between habitat type and elevation. Detritivores and herbivores showed no elevational patterns. We found 11 arthropod taxa with linear elevational patterns, seven that peaked in abundance at high elevations, and four taxa at low elevations. We also found eight taxa with parabolic elevational patterns that peaked in abundance at mid-elevations. We found that vegetation composition and productivity had stronger explanatory power for arthropod composition in forested habitats, while ground cover was a stronger predictor in open habitats. Temperature and precipitation were important in both habitats. Our findings demonstrate that relationships between animal diversity and elevation can be mediated by habitat type, suggesting that physiological restraints and resource limitations work differently between habitat types.",,776
1918,35967691,Differential effects of psychological distress on mitigation and vaccination: A public health conundrum.,"CDC-recommended mitigation behaviors and vaccination status were assessed in an online sample (N = 810; ages 18-80). Results were consistent with a differential distress hypothesis positing that whereas psychological distress, which is induced in part by social deprivation, interferes with mitigation behaviors involving social distancing, it motivates vaccination, in part because it, in turn, can increase social interaction. Age modulated these effects. Despite the greater risk of severe consequences, older adults not only showed less distress, but compared to younger participants with equivalent levels of distress, the older adults showed less effect of distress on both social distancing and vaccination status. Together these findings highlight a conundrum faced in public health messaging. Traditional fear messages may be less effective for older adults, who are most in danger, whereas in younger adults, the distress induced by fear messages may motivate vaccination but diminish mitigation behaviors needed to prevent subsequent breakthrough infections.",,777
1569,35968317,Neuropsychiatric Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease and Caregiver Burden.,"In addition to cognitive decline, one of the most important problems for caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's is neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). This study aimed to evaluate the NPS in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and investigate its relationship with caregiver burden (CB). In a cross-sectional study of 85 patients with AD referred to Shafa Hospital in Rasht and their caregivers in 2020, information was collected using a demographic questionnaire, Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), and the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI). Data were analyzed by Spearman correlation, t-test, and linear regression, with SPSS version 22. The mean age of the patients and their caregivers were 74.95 ± 8.87 years and 43.98 ± 11.38 years, respectively. The mean total score of NPS in patients with AD was 44.25 (0-144) and the mean CB score was 36.27 (0-96), which was a moderate level. According to the results, 91% of patients had apathy, while happiness/euphoria was reported as the most uncommon symptom. In addition, there was a significant relationship between the score of NPS and CB (r = 0.542, P < 0.0001), as well as all its sub-components, time-dependence burden with more correlation (r = 0.509, P < 0.0001), and social burden with less correlation (r = 0.352, P < 0.001). NPS, hallucination, aberrant motor behavior (AMB), delusion, and depression were most correlated with CB. Also, the mean score of CB was significantly higher in women than in men (P = 0.045). Living in a rural area had a significant relationship with NPS score (P = 0.026). Also, linear regression showed that with increasing 1 year of patients' age, the mean score of patient's NPS decreased by 0.374 (P = 0.048). Neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially hallucination, aberrant motor behavior (AMB), delusion, and depression were associated with caregiver burden. Apathy was the most common symptom in patients with AD.",,778
1805,35967850,Streptococcus pneumoniae interactions with the complement system.,"Host innate and adaptive immunity to infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae is critically dependent on the complement system, demonstrated by the high incidence of invasive S. pneumoniae infection in people with inherited deficiency of complement components. The complement system is activated by S. pneumoniae through multiple mechanisms. The classical complement pathway is activated by recognition of S. pneumoniae by C-reactive protein, serum amyloid P, C1q, SIGN-R1, or natural or acquired antibody. Some S. pneumoniae strains are also recognised by ficolins to activate the mannose binding lectin (MBL) activation pathway. Complement activation is then amplified by the alternative complement pathway, which can also be activated by S. pneumoniae directly. Complement activation results in covalent linkage of the opsonic complement factors C3b and iC3b to the S. pneumoniae surface which promote phagocytic clearance, along with complement-mediated immune adherence to erythrocytes, thereby protecting against septicaemia. The role of complement for mucosal immunity to S. pneumoniae is less clear. Given the major role of complement in controlling infection with S. pneumoniae, it is perhaps unsurprising that S. pneumoniae has evolved multiple mechanisms of complement evasion, including the capsule, multiple surface proteins, and the toxin pneumolysin. There is considerable variation between S. pneumoniae capsular serotypes and genotypes with regards to sensitivity to complement which correlates with ability to cause invasive infections. However, at present we only have a limited understanding of the main mechanisms causing variations in complement sensitivity between S. pneumoniae strains and to non-pathogenic streptococci.",,779
1917,35967692,"Legal Environment, Technological Innovation, and Sustainable Economic Growth.","The productivity gains generated by innovation are the root cause of long-term economic growth. In this paper, two empirical hypotheses are proposed to clarify our view: the trade turnover of technology market and intellectual property protection are important factors to stimulate innovation; The main channel of communication is through the increase of research staff and R&D funds. The empirical research result show that: (1) The greater the technology trade volume, the greater the incentive to regional innovation activities, the greater the number of regional patents; (2) About the intellectual property protection, The higher the protection intensity is, the greater the incentive is to regional innovation activities and the greater the number of regional patents. Different from relevant researches, this paper discusses the decisive role of market activity and legal environment on regional innovation behavior from the perspective of technology trade and patent protection, and emphasizes the theoretical significance of market and legal system from a more general perspective.",,780
61,35983468,"Multiple Clinical Manifestations of Lichenoid Spectrum: A Patient with Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia, Lichen Planus Pigmentosus, and Nail Lichen Planus.","Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is characterized by irreversible, symmetrical band-like hair loss in the frontotemporal region. Lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) is a variant of lichen planus (LP) that presents with hyperpigmented macules and patches predominantly in sun-exposed areas. Nail LP is a subtype of LP that can be present alone or with other forms of LP. We report a rare case of a 59-year-old woman presenting with symmetrical, gray-brown, hyperpigmented lesions on her neck and face, band-like alopecia in the frontotemporal region, severe onycholysis in two fingernails, and prominent longitudinal ridging in all fingernails. Clinical, dermoscopic, and histological findings established a diagnosis of FFA associated with LPP and nail LP was established. In recent years, it has been established that FFA can be associated with LPP and it is thought to be a variant of lichen planopilaris. Nail involvement is rarely reported in FFA or LPP. To our knowledge, the presence of the three conditions in the same patient has not been previously reported. Although rare we would like to emphasize the importance of a careful examination of the nails in patients with FFA and/or LPP to prevent irreversible nail changes.",,781
369,35979305,Effect of cold snare polypectomy for small colorectal polyps.,"Colorectal cancer remains a considerable challenge in healthcare nowadays. Approximately 60%-80% of colorectal cancer is caused by intestinal polyps, and resection of intestinal polyps has been proved to reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. The vast majority of intestinal polyps can be found during colonoscopy and removed endoscopically. Therefore, more attention has been paid to the development of endoscopic resection of intestinal polyps. In this study, we compared the efficacy and safety of cold snare polypectomy (CSP) and hot snare polypectomy (HSP). To investigate the efficacy and safety of CSP and HSP for colorectal polyps. Between January and December 2020, 301 patients with colorectal polyps 4-9 mm in diameter were treated with endoscopic therapy in our hospital, and were divided into the CSP group (n = 154) and HSP group (n = 147). The operating time, incidence of bleeding and perforation, use of titanium clips, and complete resection rate were compared between the two groups. We included 249 patients (301 polyps). No differences in gender, age, and polyp size, location, shape and type were observed between the CSP and HSP groups, and the resection rates in these two groups were 93.4% and 94.5%, respectively, with no significant difference. The use of titanium clips was 15.6% and 95.9%, the operating time was 3.2 ± 0.5 min and 5.6 ± 0.8 min, the delayed bleeding rate was 0% and 2.0%, and delayed perforation was 0% and 0.7%, in the CSP and HSP groups, respectively. For sessile colorectal polyps < 10 mm, CSP had the same resection rate of impaired tissue integrity as traditional HSP had. The rate of complications was lower in the CSP group. CSP is a safe and effective method for polypectomy.",,782
2424,35966872,Comparative proteomic and clinicopathological analysis of breast adenoid cystic carcinoma and basal-like triple-negative breast cancer.,"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare type of triple-negative breast cancer that has an indolent clinical behavior. Given the substantial overlapping morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features with other basal-like triple-negative breast cancer (BL-TNBC), accurate diagnosis of ACC is crucial for effective clinical treatment. The integrative analysis of the proteome and clinicopathological characteristics may help to distinguish these two neoplasms and provide a deep understanding on biological behaviors and potential target therapy of ACC. We applied mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics to analyze the protein expression in paired tumor and adjacent normal breast tissue of five ACC and five BL-TNBC. Bioinformatic analyses and the clinicopathological characteristics, including histological features, immunohistochemistry, and FISH results, were also collected to get comprehensive information. A total of 307 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified between ACC and BL-TNBC. Clustering analysis of DEPs clearly separated ACC from BL-TNBC. GSEA found downregulation of the immune response of ACC compared with BL-TNBC, which is consistent with the negative PD-L1 expression of ACC. Vesicle-mediated transport was also inhibited, while ECM organization was enriched in ACC. The top upregulated proteins in DEPs were ITGB4, VCAN, and DPT. Moreover, in comparison with normal breast tissue, ACC showed elevated ribosome biogenesis and RNA splicing activity. This study provides evidence that ACC presents a substantially different proteomic profile compared with BL-TNBC and promotes our understanding on the molecular mechanisms and biological processes of ACC, which might be useful for differential diagnosis and anticancer strategy.",,783
2232,35967259,Metabolome profiling of stratified seeds provides insight into the regulation of dormancy in Davidia involucrata.,"Dove tree (Davidia involucrata), a tertiary vestige species, is well-adapted to cool conditions. Dormancy in D. involucrata seed lasts for an extremely long period of time, typically between 3 and 4 years, and this characteristic makes the species an excellent model for studying the mechanisms of seed dormancy. The molecular mechanisms governing germination control in D. involucrata are still unknown. Seed stratification have been reported to enhance germination in recalcitrant seeds. We performed a widely targeted metabolome profiling to identify metabolites and associated pathways in D. involucrata seeds from six different moist sand stratification durations (0-30 months) using the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-Q Exactive Orbitrap-Mass spectrometry. There was an increasing germination rate with prolonged stratification durations (12-30 months). Furthermore, we detected 10,008 metabolites in the stratified seeds. We also detected 48 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) between all stratification periods in the seeds, with 10 highly conserved metabolites. Most of the differentially accumulated metabolites between unstratified and stratified seeds were enriched in purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and arginine biosynthesis pathways. Key phytohormones, abscisic acid, indole-3 acetic acid, and sinapic acid were differentially accumulated in the seeds and are predicted to regulate dormancy in D. involucrata. We have provided extensive metabolic information useful for future works on dove tree germination study.",,784
759,35975078,Plasmonic colloidal Au nanoparticles in DMSO: a facile synthesis and characterisation.,"We report a new pathway for the synthesis of plasmonic gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) in a bio-compatible medium. A modified room temperature approach based on the standard Turkevich synthesis, using sodium citrate as a reducing and stabilizing agent, results in a highly stable colloidal suspension of Au NPs in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The mean NP size of about 15 nm with a fairly low size distribution is revealed by scanning electron microscopy. The stability test through UV-vis absorption spectroscopy indicates no sign of aggregation for months. The Au NPs are also characterized by X-ray photoelectron, Raman scattering, and FTIR spectroscopies. The stabilisation mechanism of the Au NPs in DMSO is concluded to be similar to that of NPs synthesized in water. The Au NPs obtained in this work are applicable as SERS substrates, as proved by common analytes. In terms of bio-applications, they do not possess such side-effects as pronounced antibacterial activity, based on the tests performed on non-pathogenic Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria.",,785
523,35978736,Type III Endoleak Leading to Aortic Rupture After Endovascular Repair.,"Endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm concerns the introduction of aortic endoprosthesis which aims to isolate aneurysm from the circulation. The leading complication of this technique is the endoleak which is defined by the persistence of blood flow within the aneurysm sac. The main risk is the rupture of the aorta which can jeopardize the vital prognosis of patient. White classification defines five types of endoleaks. Type III is secondary either to a disconnection between the components of the endoprosthesis (type IIIA) or to material damage (type IIIB). This type presents a particularly high risk of aortic rupture. Endovascular approach is the treatment of choice for this type of endoleaks through stent-grafts implantation. Type III endoleak may appear at any time after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Although the frequency of endoleak after EVAR has been reduced after improvement and development of stent-graft systems, there are still many improvements and additions expected to improve the prognoses for patients after EVAR. Our case is an 80-year-old patient, who received an EVAR in 2012 for his abdominal aortic aneurysm, admitted to our vascular surgery department for a type III endoleak, for which he benefited from an endovascular treatment by placement of stent-grafts.",,786
820,35974955,Spinal Epidural Hematoma Due to Venous Congestion Caused by Nutcracker Syndrome.,"The causes of spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) have been attributed to coagulopathy, trauma, vascular anomalies, and so forth. The incidence of vascular anomalies shown by digital subtraction angiography has been reported to be 15%, and most cases have been reported to be spinal epidural arteriovenous fistulae. SEH has rarely been caused by venous congestion. We report a case of SEH in a 78-year-old male who presented to our emergency department with sudden-onset back pain, followed by complete paraplegia with bladder and rectal disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a dorsally placed extradural hematoma extending from T10 to L1. An urgent laminectomy from T11 to L2 was performed. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) performed 1 week after the operation showed compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery with dilation of the surrounding veins, including the spinal epidural venous plexus, at the same level as the hematoma. This was diagnosed as Nutcracker syndrome (NCS), which was consistent as a cause of SEH. The patient's symptoms gradually improved, and after 6 months, he regained normal strength in his lower extremities, but bladder and rectal disturbance remained and required intermittent self-catheterization. We chose conservative treatment for NCS, and SEH did not recur until the patient died of a cause unrelated to SEH or NCS. SEH could occur secondary to venous congestion including NCS. We emphasize the importance of investigating venous return to evaluate the etiology of SEH, which can be clearly visualized using CTA.",,787

1155,35973764,"Novel real-time PCR assay detects widespread distribution of knock down resistance (kdr) mutations associated with pyrethroid resistance in the mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, in Thailand.","Susceptibility to pyrethroids in the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, the major vector of lymphatic filariasis, is being seriously threatened worldwide. Knockdown resistance (kdr), caused by mutations in the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene, particularly the L1014F mutation, is an important resistance mechanism. Our aim was to develop a real-time PCR with melt curve analysis to evaluate the distribution of the L1014F mutation in Cx. quinquefasciatus throughout Thailand and to determine the polymorphism pattern of a VGSC gene fragment spanning the L1014F mutation. A total of 3760 females from 18 localities across five regions of Thailand were bio-assayed by exposure to 0.05% deltamethrin WHO papers, showing mortality rates ranging from 2.4% to 83.0%. Genotyping of 753 dead and surviving mosquitoes using our novel real-time PCR assay with melt curve analysis and tetra-primer allele-specific PCR revealed the mutant F1014 allele is closely associated with the deltamethrin resistance phenotype. The L1014F mutation was found at high frequency throughout Thailand, particularly in the North. However, some survivors were homozygous for wild type L1014 allele, which were further sequenced for the IIP-IIS6 region of VGSC gene. The haplotype network of phenotypically characterized individuals indicated the presence of other possible kdr alleles/resistance mechanisms at play including two novel mutations, V978E and D992E. The finding of new putative kdr alleles and widespread distribution of the F1014 allele emphasizes the significant role of kdr mutations in pyrethroid resistance in Thai Cx. quinquefasciatus populations. Monitoring kdr variations and phenotypic resistance is critical for managing resistance in Cx. quinquefasciatus.",,789
47,35983549,Selective bundle versus complete anterior-cruciate ligament reconstruction: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Selective bundle reconstruction (SLB) refers to preservation of the intact bundle and reconstruction of the ruptured bundle in a partial tear while complete ACL reconstruction involves the removal of all remnant tissue and reconstruction of one or both bundles. As the evidence for SLB versus complete ACL reconstruction remains unclear, this study aimed to compare the two techniques. This study's hypothesis was that SLB reconstruction allows better function and stability compared to complete ACL reconstruction. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane Library was conducted, identifying studies that compared SLB ('selective' group) versus complete ('complete' group) ACL reconstruction. Meta-analysis was conducted for post-operative functional scores, stability outcomes and complications as well as pre-operative to post-operative change. Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis, with 1107 patients and a pooled mean follow-up of 29.5 months. Post-operatively, the Selective group had significantly reduced anterior laxity, shown by a lower mean arthrometry side-to-side difference (p<0.01). Analysis of change results showed that the Selective group had a lower mean improvement in arthrometry side-to-side difference as well (p<0.01). No significant difference was shown for all other post-operative outcomes. This study provides valuable insight to the management of partial tears. It has demonstrated that the preservation of the intact bundle offers stability and function that is as good as complete reconstruction and that SLB is a potentially viable option in the management of partial tears.

2064,35967454,Aedes aegypti CLIPB9 activates prophenoloxidase-3 in the presence of CLIPA14 after fungal infection.,"Melanization is an integral part of the insect defense system and is often induced by pathogen invasion. Phenoloxidases (POs) are critical enzymes that catalyze melanin formation. PO3 is associated with the antifungal response of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, but the molecular mechanism of the prophenoloxidase-3 (PPO3) activation is unclear. Here we report that PPO3 cleavage activation is mediated by a clip-domain serine protease, CLIPB9. We purified recombinant CLIPB9 and found that it cleaved PPO3 and increased PO activity in the hemolymph. We then identified CLIPA14 (a serine protease homolog) by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-CLIPB9 antibody. After being cleaved by CLIPB9, Ae. aegypti CLIPA14 acted as a cofactor for PPO3 activation. In addition, dsRNA co-silencing of CLIPB9 and CLIPA14 genes reduced melanization after infection with the entomopathogen, Beauveria bassiana, making the adult mosquitoes more sensitive to fungal infection. These results illustrate the roles of CLIPB9 and CLIPA14 in the PPO activation pathway and revealed the complexity of the upstream serine protease network controlling melanization.",,791
1749,35967993,The immunogenicity of plant-based COE-GCN4pII protein in pigs against the highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain from genotype 2.,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a serious infectious causative agent in swine, especially in neonatal piglets. PEDV genotype 2 (G2) strains, particularly G2a, were the primary causes of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) outbreaks in Vietnam. Here, we produced a plant-based CO-26K-equivalent epitope (COE) variant from a Vietnamese highly virulent PEDV strain belonging to genotype 2a (COE/G2a) and evaluated the protective efficacy of COE/G2a-GCN4pII protein (COE/G2a-pII) in piglets against the highly virulent PEDV G2a strain following passive immunity. The 5-day-old piglets had high levels of PEDV-specific IgG antibodies, COE-IgA specific antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, and IFN-γ responses. After virulent challenge experiments, all of these piglets survived and had normal clinical symptoms, no watery diarrhea in feces, and an increase in their body weight, while all of the negative control piglets died. These results suggest that the COE/G2a-pII protein produced in plants can be developed as a promising vaccine candidate to protect piglets against PEDV G2a infection in Vietnam.",,792

In this study, the authors compared the erector spinae plane (ESP) block having dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant with conventional pain management along with intravenous dexmedetomidine. Prospective randomized single-blinded trial. Tertiary care teaching hospital. All of the patients scheduled for elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with an ejection fraction of >45%. After obtaining institutional ethical committee approval, 130 patients were randomized into Group E and Group D. Group E patients received ESP block bilaterally with 25 mL of bupivacaine plus 0.5 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine. The patients in Group D received conventional intravenous analgesia, as well as a 0.7 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine bolus, followed by a 0.3 μg/kg dexmedetomidine infusion during surgery and continued postoperatively for 24 hours. Group E patients received 8 mL/h of bupivacaine infusion bilaterally for 24 hours. The primary outcome assessed was pain scores in the postoperative period. The secondary outcomes assessed were postoperative rescue analgesic consumption, time to first rescue analgesia, intraoperative fentanyl consumption, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Both groups were comparable in demographic characteristics. The postoperative pain scores from 4 hours to 12 hours were lower in Group E compared with Group D. The pain scores at 24 hours were not significantly different between groups. Postoperative fentanyl consumption in Group E (99.23 ± 50.19 μg) was significantly lower than in Group D (181.15 ± 82.92 μg), with a p value of 0.001. Time to first rescue analgesia was significantly longer in Group E, with a median score of 8 hours when compared with that of 4 hours in Group D, with a p value of 0.01. Intraoperative fentanyl consumption was significantly lower in Group E (392.15 ± 55.36 μg) compared with Group D (604.00 ± 131.87 μg; p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in the duration of mechanical ventilation in both groups. Duration of ICU stay was significantly lower in Group E (51.95 ± 8.54 hours) when compared with Group D (59.06 ± 8.68 hours) (p = 0.001). Erector spinae fascial plane blocks appeared to reduce postoperative pain scores in off-pump coronary artery bypass graft patients. Furthermore, ESP block was beneficial in terms of less intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption, longer time to first rescue analgesia, and shorter ICU stay.",,793
2109,35967409,Neutrophils in malaria: A double-edged sword role.,"Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in human peripheral blood. They form the first line of defense against invading foreign pathogens and might play a crucial role in malaria. According to World Health Organization (WHO), malaria is a globally significant disease caused by protozoan parasites from the Plasmodium genus, and it's responsible for 627,000 deaths in 2020. Neutrophils participate in the defense response against the malaria parasite via phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Neutrophils might also be involved in the pathogenesis of malaria by the release of toxic granules and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Intriguingly, malaria parasites inhibit the anti-microbial function of neutrophils, thus making malaria patients more susceptible to secondary opportunistic Salmonella infections. In this review, we will provide a summary of the role of neutrophils during malaria infection, some contradicting mouse model neutrophil data and neutrophil-related mechanisms involved in malaria patients' susceptibility to bacterial infection.",,794
1683,35968090,Physiological characterization of the wild almond Prunus arabica stem photosynthetic capability.,"Leaves are the major plant tissue for transpiration and carbon fixation in deciduous trees. In harsh habitats, atmospheric CO2 assimilation via stem photosynthesis is common, providing extra carbon gain to cope with the detrimental conditions. We studied two almond species, the commercial Prunus dulcis cultivar Um-el-Fahem and the rare wild Prunus arabica. Our study revealed two distinctive strategies for carbon gain in these almond species. While, in P. dulcis, leaves possess the major photosynthetic surface area, in P. arabica, green stems perform this function, in particular during the winter after leaf drop. These two species' anatomical and physiological comparisons show that P. arabica carries unique features that support stem gas exchange and high-gross photosynthetic rates via stem photosynthetic capabilities (SPC). On the other hand, P. dulcis stems contribute low gross photosynthesis levels, as they are designed solely for reassimilation of CO2 from respiration, which is termed stem recycling photosynthesis (SRP). Results show that (a) P. arabica stems are covered with a high density of sunken stomata, in contrast to the stomata on P. dulcis stems, which disappear under a thick peridermal (bark) layer by their second year of development. (b) P. arabica stems contain significantly higher levels of chlorophyll compartmentalized to a mesophyll-like, chloroplast-rich, parenchyma layer, in contrast to rounded-shape cells of P. dulcis's stem parenchyma. (c) Pulse amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry of P. arabica and P. dulcis stems revealed differences in the chlorophyll fluorescence and quenching parameters between the two species. (d) Gas exchange analysis showed that guard cells of P. arabica stems tightly regulate water loss under elevated temperatures while maintaining constant and high assimilation rates throughout the stem. Our data show that P. arabica uses a distinctive strategy for tree carbon gain via stem photosynthetic capability, which is regulated efficiently under harsh environmental conditions, such as elevated temperatures. These findings are highly important and can be used to develop new almond cultivars with agriculturally essential traits.",,795
299,35980787,Remotely provided open-label placebo reduces frequency of and impairment by allergic symptoms.,"Placebos being prescribed with full honesty and disclosure (i.e., open-label placebo = OLP) have been shown to reduce symptom burden in a variety of conditions. With regard to allergic rhinits, previous research provided inconclusive evidence for the effects of OLP, possibly related to a separate focus on either symptom severity or symptom frequency. Overcoming this limitation of previous research, the present study aimed to examine the effects of OLP on both the severity and frequency of allergic symptoms. In a randomized-controlled trial, patients with allergic rhinits (N = 74) were randomized to OLP or treatment as usual (TAU). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, OLP was administered remotely in a virtual clinical encounter. Participants took placebo tablets for 14 days. The primary outcomes were the severity and frequency of allergic symptoms. The secondary endpoint was allergy-related impairment. OLP did not significantly improve symptom severity over TAU, F(1, 71) = 3.280, p = .074, ɳ2p = .044, but did reduce symptom frequency, F(1, 71) = 7.272, p = .009, ɳ2p = .093, and allergy-related impairment more than TAU, F(1, 71) = 6.445, p = .013, ɳ2p = .083, reflecting medium to large effects. The use of other anti-allergic medication did not influence the results. While OLP was able to lower the frequency of allergic symptoms and allergy-related impairment substantially, its effects on symptom severity were weaker. The remote provision of OLP suggests that physical contact between patients and providers might not be necessary for OLP to work.",,796
1908,35967701,The modified German subjective vitality scale (SVS-GM): Psychometric properties and application in daily life.,"Subjective vitality describes the positive feeling of experiencing physical and mental energy, which can lead to purposive actions, but no German instruments exist with action-oriented verbiage: This work supports the development and modification of already existing German Subjective Vitality Scales and provides further evidence for its psychometric properties. In a first step (N = 56) two modified (action-oriented) short-forms were developed. An extension of time perspectives (past, present, future) should also enrich the scale by enhancing the accuracy of self-reports. Study 1 (N = 183) then examined the psychometric properties for each time perspective. Study 2 (N = 27) was a 6-day diary study to identify the reliability of within- and between-person differences in vitality over time and working days with responses recorded three times per day. The exploratory factor analysis from study 1 revealed a three-factor solution with three items each. Test-retest reliability was moderate for the past and future time perspective and less stable for state subjective vitality. The modified German Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS-GM) showed divergent validity with fatigue, negative affect, and optimism, and convergent but distinguishable validity with life satisfaction, positive affect, and perceived self-efficacy. High reliability for daily vitality measures (with lower vitality rates in the morning) was found in study 2, but no substantial variation was found between working days and days off. The SVS-GM shows good psychometric properties in different settings and provides researchers with a 3-item (for cross-sectional or longitudinal studies) and 1-item (for short screenings) version to measure subjective vitality in German-speaking populations.",,797
598,35977897,Effect of prone positioning on gas exchange according to lung morphology in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.,"There are limited data on the clinical effects of prone positioning according to lung morphology. We aimed to determine whether the gas exchange response to prone positioning differs according to lung morphology. This retrospective study included adult patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The lung morphology of ARDS was assessed by chest computed tomography scan and classified as diffuse or focal. The primary outcome was change in partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio after the first prone positioning session: first, using the entire cohort, and second, using subgroups of patients with diffuse ARDS matched 2 to 1 with patients with focal ARDS at baseline. Ninety-five patients were included (focal ARDS group, 23; diffuse ARDS group, 72). Before prone positioning, the focal ARDS group showed worse oxygenation than the diffuse ARDS group (median PaO2/FiO2 ratio, 79.9 mm Hg [interquartile range (IQR)], 67.7-112.6 vs. 104.0 mm Hg [IQR, 77.6-135.7]; P=0.042). During prone positioning, the focal ARDS group showed a greater improvement in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio than the diffuse ARDS group (median, 55.8 mm Hg [IQR, 11.1-109.2] vs. 42.8 mm Hg [IQR, 11.6-83.2]); however, the difference was not significant (P=0.705). Among the PaO2/FiO2-matched cohort, there was no significant difference in change in PaO2/FiO2 ratio after prone positioning between the groups (P=0.904). In patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, changes in PaO2/FiO2 ratio after prone positioning did not differ according to lung morphology. Therefore, prone positioning can be considered as soon as indicated, regardless of ARDS lung morphology.",,798
1547,35968339,Multiple myeloma with t(11;14): unique biology and evolving landscape.,"Multiple myeloma is characterized by heterogeneity in clinical presentation, response to treatment, and importantly, patient outcomes. The translocation of chromosomes 11 and 14 [t(11;14)(q13;32)], hereafter referred to as t(11;14), is the most common primary translocation event in multiple myeloma, occurring in approximately 16%-24% of patients. Multiple myeloma harboring t(11;14) represents a unique disease subset as t(11;14)-positive myeloma cells exhibit biological features that are distinct from t(11;14)-negative myeloma cells, including overexpression of cyclin D1, higher levels of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2, and the frequent expression of the B-cell lineage protein CD20. Additionally, t(11;14) is associated with less common clinical features, such as immunoglobulin M and light chain disease. With the evolution of the treatment landscape, the prognostic significance of t(11;14) multiple myeloma remains debatable. However, it is clear that t(11;14) multiple myeloma represents a distinct subset and a rare opportunity for targeted therapy with BCL-2 inhibition. In this review, we first describe the underlying biology of t(11;14) multiple myeloma cells, then summarize the body of literature evaluating the prognosis of patients with t(11;14) multiple myeloma, and finally discuss therapeutic implications.",,799
2416,35966880,Androgen receptor signaling and spatial chromatin organization in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death and affects millions of men in the world. The American Cancer Society estimated about 34,500 deaths from prostate cancer in the United States in year 2022. The Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a major pathway that sustains local and metastatic prostate tumor growth. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer patient and can suppress the tumor growth for a median of 2-3 years. Unfortunately, the malignancy inevitably progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which is more aggressive and no longer responsive to ADT. Surprisingly, for most of the CPRC patients, cancer growth still depends on androgen receptor signaling. Accumulating evidence suggests that CRPC cells have rewired their transcriptional program to retain AR signaling in the absence of androgens. Besides AR, other transcription factors also contribute to the resistance mechanism through multiple pathways including enhancing AR signaling pathway and activating other complementary signaling pathways for the favor of AR downstream genes expression. More recent studies have shown the role of transcription factors in reconfiguring chromatin 3D structure and regulating topologically associating domains (TADs). Pioneer factors, transcription factors and coactivators form liquid-liquid phase separation compartment that can modulate transcriptional events along with configuring TADs. The role of AR and other transcription factors on chromatin structure change and formation of condensate compartment in prostate cancer cells has only been recently investigated and appreciated. This review intends to provide an overview of transcription factors that contribute to AR signaling through activation of gene expression, governing 3D chromatin structure and establishing phase to phase separation. A more detailed understanding of the spatial role of transcription factors in CRPC might provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of CRPC.",,800
1081,35974538,Diffusion tensor imaging of anisotropic inhomogeneous turbulent flow.,"Inhomogeneous anisotropic turbulent flow is difficult to measure, and yet it commonly occurs in nature and in many engineering applications. This work aims to introduce a technique based on magnetic resonance imaging which can spatially map the degree of turbulence as well as the degree of anisotropy. Our interpretation relies on the eddy diffusion model of turbulence, and combines this with the technique of diffusion tensor imaging. The result is an eddy diffusion tensor, which is represented by a symmetric three-by-three matrix. This tensor contains a wealth of information about the magnitude and directions of the turbulent fluctuations; however, the correlation time must be considered before interpreting this information. In the constricted pipe flow used in this study, the turbulence is greatest in magnitude in the space surrounding the core of the turbulent jet, and the turbulence is highly anisotropic.",,801
2375,35966998,Preliminary psychometric properties of a standard vocabulary test administered using a non-invasive brain-computer interface.,"To examine measurement agreement between a vocabulary test that is administered in the standardized manner and a version that is administered with a brain-computer interface (BCI). The sample was comprised of 21 participants, ages 9-27, mean age 16.7 (5.4) years, 61.9% male, including 10 with congenital spastic cerebral palsy (CP), and 11 comparison peers. Participants completed both standard and BCI-facilitated alternate versions of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test - 4 (PPVT™-4). The BCI-facilitated PPVT-4 uses items identical to the unmodified PPVT-4, but each quadrant forced-choice item is presented on a computer screen for use with the BCI. Measurement agreement between instruments was excellent, including an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.98, and Bland-Altman plots and tests indicating adequate limits of agreement and no systematic test version bias. The mean standard score difference between test versions was 2.0 points (SD 6.3). These results demonstrate that BCI-facilitated quadrant forced-choice vocabulary testing has the potential to measure aspects of language without requiring any overt physical or communicative response. Thus, it may be possible to identify the language capabilities and needs of many individuals who have not had access to standardized clinical and research instruments.",,802
543,35978680,"Small-Molecule Inhibitors of the MLL1 CXXC Domain, an Epigenetic Reader of DNA Methylation.","The CXXC domain is a reader of DNA methylation which preferentially binds to unmethylated CpG DNA motifs. Chromosomal translocations involving the MLL1 gene produce in-frame fusion proteins in which the N-terminal portion of the MLL1 protein harboring its CXXC domain is fused to the C-terminal portion of multiple partners. For the MLL-AF9 fusion, mutations which disrupt CXXC domain-DNA binding abrogate the ability to cause leukemia in mice. Based on this, we initiated an effort to develop small-molecule inhibitors of the MLL1 CXXC domain as a novel approach to therapy. We developed a fluorescence polarization-based assay for MLL CXXC domain-DNA binding and screened a library of Cys-reactive molecules. For the most potent hit from this screen, we have synthesized a library of analogs to explore the structure-activity relationship, defined the binding site using chemical shift perturbations in NMR spectra, and explored the selectivity of compounds across the CXXC domain family.",,803
1691,35968081,"OsSIDP301, a Member of the DUF1644 Family, Negatively Regulates Salt Stress and Grain Size in Rice.","As a major environmental factor, salt stress substantially retards growth and reduces the productivity of rice (Oryza sativa). Members of the DUF1644 family, the domains of unknown function 1644 motif are predicted to play an essential regulatory role in response to abiotic stress. However, the specific molecular mechanisms of most members of this family remain elusive. Here, we report that the OsSIDP301 (stress-induced DUF1644 protein) was induced by salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA). We found that overexpression of OsSIDP301 (OE) in plants conferred salt hypersensitivity and reduced grain size, whereas plants with OsSIDP301 RNA interference (RNAi) exhibited salt tolerance and increased grain size in rice. OsSIDP301 determines salt stress tolerance by modulating genes involved in the salt-response and ABA signaling pathways. Further studies suggest that OsSIDP301 regulates grain size by influencing cell expansion in spikelet hulls. Moreover, OsSIDP301 interacts with OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1), which positively regulates grain size in rice. Our findings reveal that OsSIDP301 functions as a negative regulator of salt stress and grain size, and repressing its expression represents a promising strategy for improving salt stress tolerance and yield in rice.",,804
1963,35967644,Assessing the Satisfaction and Acceptability of an Online Parent Coaching Intervention: A Mixed-Methods Approach.,"Parent-mediated intervention (PMI) has been studied in promoting skill acquisition or behavior change in the children with autism spectrum disorder. Most studies emphasize on the improvement of child's core symptoms or maladaptive behaviors, making parental perceived competence and self-efficacy secondary. Yet, the evaluations of intervention implementation are under-reported, especially when translating such interventions into a new population or context. This research investigated the intervention implementation of a 12-week parent coaching intervention which was delivered through telehealth and tailored to Chinese population. The intervention was based on the Parent-mediated Early Start Denver Model with culturally adapted lectures, manuals, and demonstration and commentary videos. This study aimed to evaluate the intervention implementation by assessing parents' satisfaction, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with two telehealth conditions: self-directed and web+group therapy. Parents in the self-directed condition received intervention individually through the online learning platform. The web+group therapy condition navigated the same program with weekly 1.5-h group coaching sessions via videoconferencing. This mixed-methods study used a concurrent convergent design to evaluate the intervention implementation at post-intervention. The quantitative data was collected from the Program Evaluation Survey and the qualitative data was collected from five focus groups. Parents in self-directed group reported significantly lower scores in total perceived competence than parents in web+group therapy condition, while there was no group difference on the total self-efficacy. Tailored feedback, demonstration and commentary videos, peer commenting, live coaching, and guided reflection were the top-five acceptable telehealth strategies that were strongly endorsed by parents. Family centered care, home-based intervention, strategies relative to daily activities, the remote learning platform, and the program-based community were elements that parents considered when evaluating the program's appropriateness. Parent modeling, step-by-step instructions, and tailored feedback were key components in making intervention strategies feasible for parents to implement at home. Findings indicate the application of telehealth was acceptable, appropriate, and feasible for Chinese parents. Group-based parent coaching intervention via videoconferencing could be a promising home-based service model to increase parental perceived competence. A large-scale RCT is needed to investigate the effectiveness of group-based PMI via telehealth.",,805

1566,35968320,A novel 8-gene panel for prediction of early biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.,"Approximately 25% of prostate cancer (PCa) cases experience biochemical recurrence (BCR) following radical prostatectomy (RP). The patients with BCR, especially with BCR ≤2 year after RP (early BCR), are more likely to develop clinical metastasis and castration resistance. Now decision-making regarding BCR after RP relies solely on clinical parameters. We thus attempted to establish an early BCR-risk prediction model by combining a molecular signature with clinicopathological features for guiding clinical decision-making. In this study, an 8-gene signature was derived, and these eight genes were SPTBN2, LGI3, TGM3, LENG9, HAS3, SLC25A27, PCDHGA1, and ADPRHL1. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly prolonged BCR-free survival in the patients with low-risk scores compared to those with high-risk scores in both training and validation datasets. Harrell's concordance index and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that this gene signature tended to outperform three commercial panels at early BCR prediction. Moreover, this signature was also proven as an independent predictor of BCR-free survival. A nomogram, incorporating the gene signature and clinicopathologic features, was constructed and excellently predicted 1-, 2- and 3-year BCR-free survival of localized PCa patients after RP. Gene set enrichment analysis, tumor immunity, and mRNA expression profiling analysis showed that the high-risk group was more prone to the immunosuppressive microenvironment and impaired DNA damage response than the low-risk group. Collectively, we successfully developed a novel 8-gene signature as a powerful predictor for early BCR after RP and created a prognostic nomogram, which may help inform the clinical management of PCa.",,807
1655,35968119,Transcriptome and association mapping revealed functional genes respond to drought stress in Populus.,"Drought frequency and severity are exacerbated by global climate change, which could compromise forest ecosystems. However, there have been minimal efforts to systematically investigate the genetic basis of the response to drought stress in perennial trees. Here, we implemented a systems genetics approach that combines co-expression analysis, association genetics, and expression quantitative trait nucleotide (eQTN) mapping to construct an allelic genetic regulatory network comprising four key regulators (PtoeIF-2B, PtoABF3, PtoPSB33, and PtoLHCA4) under drought stress conditions. Furthermore, Hap_01PtoeIF-2B, a superior haplotype associated with the net photosynthesis, was revealed through allelic frequency and haplotype analysis. In total, 75 candidate genes related to drought stress were identified through transcriptome analyses of five Populus cultivars (P. tremula × P. alba, P. nigra, P. simonii, P. trichocarpa, and P. tomentosa). Through association mapping, we detected 92 unique SNPs from 38 genes and 104 epistatic gene pairs that were associated with six drought-related traits by association mapping. eQTN mapping unravels drought stress-related gene loci that were significantly associated with the expression levels of candidate genes for drought stress. In summary, we have developed an integrated strategy for dissecting a complex genetic network, which facilitates an integrated population genomics approach that can assess the effects of environmental threats.",,808

Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography done for staging revealed suspicious metastatic omental deposit adjacent to left hemi-diaphragm apart from primary and cervical nodal metastasis. Staging F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography showed high FDG uptake in the primary and metastatic left cervical lymph nodes. However, no FDG uptake was seen in left sub-diaphragmatic mass. Known vascular malformations sites in the left posterior triangle of the neck and liver hemangiomas also showed no uptake. This pattern of uptake raised a suspicion of multiple vascular malformations. Tc-99 m red blood cell scintigraphy was done which confirmed the nature of subdiaphragmatic lesion as haemangioma.",,809
232,35982788,Haploinsufficiency of the sex-determining genes at MATα restricts genome expansion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mating type of haploid cells is determined by the presence or absence of the MATα idiotype containing MATα1 and MATα2, which encode the transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by rapid turnover, but the physiological relevance of this property remains unclear. Here, we show a direct link between their intracellular levels and sexual stability. Polyploid cells with fewer MATα copies had unstable sexual phenotypes, causing morphological changes and an increase in cell death; these effects were mediated by hyperactivation of the mating pheromone response pathway. Thus, the MATα1 and MATα2 genes are haploinsufficient genes, and the reduction in their product levels causes sex fluctuation. Chromosome III harboring the mating type locus is the most prone to loss in diploids. We propose that the haploinsufficiency of MATα compensates for the drop-out prone nature of chromosome III, thereby suppressing speciation through increased genome size via polyploidization.",,810
643,35976797,Double DJ-1 domain containing Arabidopsis DJ-1D is a robust macromolecule deglycase.,"Plants, being sessile, are prone to genotoxin-induced macromolecule damage. Among the inevitable damaging agents are reactive carbonyls that induce glycation of DNA, RNA and proteins to result in the build-up of advanced glycated end-products. However, it is unclear how plants repair glycated macromolecules. DJ-1/PARK7 members are a highly conserved family of moonlighting proteins having double domains in higher plants and single domains in other phyla. Here we show that Arabidopsis DJ-1D offers robust tolerance to endogenous and exogenous stresses through its ability to repair glycated DNA, RNA and proteins. DJ-1D also reduced the formation of reactive carbonyls through its efficient methylglyoxalase activity. Strikingly, full-length double domain-containing DJ-1D suppressed the formation of advanced glycated end-products in yeast and plants. DJ-1D also efficiently repaired glycated nucleic acids and nucleotides in vitro and mitochondrial DNA in vivo under stress, indicating the existence of a new DNA repair pathway in plants. We propose that multi-stress responding plant DJ-1 members, often present in multiple copies among plants, probably contributed to the adaptation to a variety of endogenous and exogenous stresses.",,811
1230,35971481,Accelerated versus conventional corneal collagen crosslinking: Short-term clinical outcomes in stabilizing keratoconus.,"The purpose of the study is to compare the short-term outcomes of corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) using the conventional (Dresden) protocol and an accelerated CXL (ACXL) protocol to stop keratoconus (KC) progression. A chart review was performed for all the patients with KC who underwent CXL in the last 7 years. Data were compared at baseline and at all follow-up examinations for uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BCVA), keratometry (K), central corneal thickness, and complications of CXL. Pre- and post-intervention values were compared for each group. P < 0.05 was statistically significant. After the treatment, there was a statistically greater improvement in UCVA in the conventional CXL (CCXL) group (49%) compared to the ACXL group (34%) (P = 0.028). The improvement in BCVA was similar between the groups (P = 0.060). Gain of two lines of UCVA and stability were comparable between groups (P = 0.078 and P = 0.060, respectively). The average flat K and steep K values fluctuated remarkably across different follow-up assessments in both the groups. At 3 months of follow-up, there was a statistically significantly faster return to baseline levels of flat and steep Ks in the CCXL group (P = 0.028 and P = 0.002, respectively). The findings of the current study confirm the efficacy and safety of accelerated high-fluence CXL compared to CCXL. Both protocols were effective in stabilizing KC at 9th-month and the last follow-up visit. Larger prospective randomized controlled trials and longer follow-up are required to confirm our findings.",,812
607,35977792,Neotropical Birds Respond Innately to Unfamiliar Acoustic Signals.,"AbstractMany animals respond to heterospecific signals that indicate the presence of food or predators. Although the benefits of responding are clear, the behavioral and cognitive mechanisms underlying responses are not. Whether responses are learned, innate, or an epiphenomenon created by following other species as they respond to signals remains unknown because most studies have involved respondents that are sympatric with their heterospecific signalers and that have therefore had opportunities to learn their signals. In this study, we tested the mechanisms underlying avian responses to heterospecific chick-a-dee calls. All North American parids produce chick-a-dee calls in response to arousing stimuli, such as food and predators, and diverse species respond by approaching the caller and consuming the food or mobbing the predator. We broadcast chick-a-dee calls plus two control stimuli in Costa Rica, Colombia, and Brazil, where no parids ever occur. We conducted our trials in the winter, when Neotropical migrants that might be familiar with chick-a-dee calls were present, and in the temperate breeding season, when migrants were absent. Across 138 trials, 38 resident species from 14 families and four orders responded to chick-a-dee calls by approaching to within 5 m of the playback speaker. A phylogenetic logistic regression showed that whether a species responded was not significantly associated with the species' mean body mass or the structural similarity between its calls and chick-a-dee calls. Residents were significantly more likely to approach chick-a-dee calls than either control stimulus. This pattern was unaffected by the presence of migrants, thus demonstrating that the observed responses are innate. Our study shows that learning cannot fully explain responses to heterospecific chick-a-dee calls and that structural features distinguishing these calls from other vocalizations are important.",,813
1597,35968287,"Efficacy and safety of acupuncture combined with auricular acupressure for smoking cessation: A study protocol of a multicentre, randomized, controlled clinical trial.","Nicotine dependence is an addictive behavioral disease facilitated by habitually smoking cigarettes. In many countries, acupuncture and auricular acupressure have attracted growing attention as complementary or alternative treatments for smoking cessation; however, there is a lack of rigorous randomized, controlled studies evaluating the combination of these two interventions specifically for smoking cessation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using acupuncture combined with auricular acupressure (A&AA) to increase the rates of smoking cessation and ultimately reduce the rates of relapse. This is a multicentre, prospective, parallel, randomized, controlled trial. A total of 360 patients with severe nicotine dependence will be randomized into test (A&AA) or control (nicotine replacement therapy, NRT) groups. The test group will be treated with A&AA twice weekly, while the control group will use an NRT patch daily. All treatments will be administered for 8 weeks, with a follow-up period of 4 months. The primary outcome will be the smoking abstinence rate at week 24, with a combined safety assessment. The secondary outcomes will be smoking cessation rates at other timepoints, saliva cortisone test results, and scores on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, the Autonomy over Tobacco Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The cost of treatment will also be used to evaluate the economic effects of different smoking cessation interventions. Statistical analysis on the data collected from both the intention-to-treat (all randomly assigned patients) and per-protocol (patients who complete the trial without any protocol deviations) patients, will be performed using the statistical software package, IBM SPSS 27.0. This study will provide rigorous clinical evidence evaluating the efficacy and safety of using A&AA as a smoking cessation therapy.

281,35981879,TMS Does Not Increase BOLD Activity at the Site of Stimulation: A Review of All Concurrent TMS-fMRI Studies.,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely used for understanding brain function in neurologically intact subjects and for the treatment of various disorders. However, the precise neurophysiological effects of TMS at the site of stimulation remain poorly understood. The local effects of TMS can be studied using concurrent TMS-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique where TMS is delivered during fMRI scanning. However, although concurrent TMS-fMRI was developed over 20 years ago and dozens of studies have used this technique, there is still no consensus on whether TMS increases blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity at the site of stimulation. To address this question, here we review all previous concurrent TMS-fMRI studies that reported analyses of BOLD activity at the target location. We find evidence that TMS increases local BOLD activity when stimulating the primary motor (M1) and visual (V1) cortices but that these effects are likely driven by the downstream consequences of TMS (finger twitches and phosphenes). However, TMS does not appear to increase BOLD activity at the site of stimulation for areas outside of the M1 and V1 when conducted at rest. We examine the possible reasons for such lack of BOLD signal increase based on recent work in nonhuman animals. We argue that the current evidence points to TMS inducing periods of increased and decreased neuronal firing that mostly cancel each other out and therefore lead to no change in the overall BOLD signal.",,815

1752,35967988,Identifying Signatures of Perceived Interpersonal Synchrony.,"Interpersonal synchrony serves as a subtle, yet powerful bonding mechanism in social interactions. Problematically, the term 'synchrony' has been used to label a variety of distinct aspects of interpersonal coordination, such as postural similarities or movement activity entrainment. Accordingly, different algorithms have been suggested to quantify interpersonal synchrony. Yet, it remains unknown whether the different measures of synchrony represent correlated features of the same perceivable core phenomenon. The current study addresses this by comparing the suitability of a set of algorithms with respect to their association with observers' judgments of dyadic synchrony and leader-followership. One-hundred fifteen observers viewed computer animations of characters portraying the movements of real dyads who performed a repetitive motor task with instruction to move in unison. Animations were based on full-body motion capture data synchronously collected for both partners during the joint exercise. Results showed most synchrony measures significantly correlated with (a) perceived synchrony and (b) the perceived level of balance of leading/following by each dyad member. Phase synchrony and Pearson correlations were associated most strongly with the observer ratings. This might be typical for intentional, structured forms synchrony such as ritualized group activities. It remains open if these findings also apply to spontaneous forms of synchrony as, for instance, occurring in free-running conversations.",,817
1382,35969064,Large-scale Preparation of Synovial Fluid Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes by 3D Bioreactor Culture.,"Exosomes secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been suggested as promising candidates for cartilage injuries and osteoarthritis treatment. Exosomes for clinical application require large-scale production. To this aim, human synovial fluid MSCs (hSF-MSCs) were grown on microcarrier beads, and then cultured in a dynamic three-dimension (3D) culture system. Through utilizing 3D dynamic culture, this protocol successfully obtained large-scale exosomes from SF-MSC culture supernatants. Exosomes were harvested by ultracentrifugation and verified by a transmission electron microscope, nanoparticle transmission assay, and western blotting. Also, the microbiological safety of exosomes was detected. Results of exosome detection suggest that this approach can produce a large number of good manufacturing practices (GMP)-grade exosomes. These exosomes could be utilized in exosome biology research and clinical osteoarthritis treatment.",,818
1888,35967722,The why of the phenomenal aspect of consciousness: Its main functions and the mechanisms underpinning it.,"What distinguishes conscious information processing from other kinds of information processing is its phenomenal aspect (PAC), the-what-it-is-like for an agent to experience something. The PAC supplies the agent with a sense of self, and informs the agent on how its self is affected by the agent's own operations. The PAC originates from the activity that attention performs to detect the state of what I define the self (S). S is centered and develops on a hierarchy of innate and acquired values, and is primarily expressed via the central and peripheral nervous systems; it maps the agent's body and cognitive capacities, and its interactions with the environment. The detection of the state of S by attention modulates the energy level of the organ of attention (OA), i.e., the neural substrate that underpins attention. This modulation generates the PAC. The PAC can be qualified according to five dimensions: qualitative, quantitative, hedonic, temporal and spatial. Each dimension can be traced back to a specific feature of the modulation of the energy level of the OA.",,819
2254,35967177,Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Head and Neck Cancer Stage and Treatment Duration.,"Objective To assess the efficacy of oncologic healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in a tertiary university hospital in Germany. Methods This retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study included 94 patients with newly diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma during a two-year period. Patients were assigned to two date-dependent groups; referrals before (group A) and during (group B) the COVID-19 pandemic. Time intervals from the symptom(s) onset to diagnosis, diagnosis to treatment, and treatment initiation to completion were recorded. Furthermore, TNM stages and the application of reconstructive surgery with free tissue transfer were determined. Patients' outcomes and characteristics were compared between the two groups. Finally, a comprehensive literature review was carried out to identify similar epidemiological studies. Results The symptom-to-diagnosis interval was longer during the COVID-19 pandemic [median 9.5 (A) versus 15 (B) weeks, p = 0.054]. The intervals from diagnosis to treatment and treatment initiation to end of treatment were approximately the same in both groups [median 3 (A) versus 3.2 (B) weeks, p = 0.264; and 6.9 (A) versus 6.3 (B) weeks, p = 0.136]. The T-and N-stages were not higher during the pandemic [early T-stage (T1+T2) versus advanced T-stage (T3+T4), p = 0.668; and N-negative (N0) versus N-positive status (N1,2,3), p = 0.301]. Patients who presented with distant metastatic disease and those who underwent reconstructive surgery with free tissue transfer were observed more frequently in the lockdown phase [M1 versus M0, p= 0.022; and flap versus no flap, p=0.007]. Conclusion This study suggests the consistent diagnostic and therapeutical performance of the tertiary oncologic healthcare in Berlin, Germany, despite the challenges that patient care units faced during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,820
295,35981428,"Understanding the factors contributing to groundwater salinity in the coastal region of Andhra Pradesh, India.","The present study focused on understanding the factors responsible for groundwater salinity in the coastal region, Prakasam district, Andhra Pradesh, India. Groundwater samples were collected and analysed for pH, EC, TDS, TA, TH, CH, NCH, EA, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, and F-. Groundwater quality was assessed using entropy weighted water quality index (EWQI), Chadha and Gibbs diagrams, ionic ratios, chloro-alkaline indices (CA), saturation indices (SI), principal component analysis (PCA), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). TDS vs TH indicated that 86% of groundwater samples fall under brackish-cum-very hard water-quality type, while TA and TH relationship showed that 70% and 30% of groundwater samples fall under non‑carbonate hardness (NCH) and excess alkalinity (EA), respectively. EWQI classified groundwater samples into medium (22%), poor (40%), and exremely poor (38%) water quality types, indicating that most samples are not suitable for drinking purposes. Hydrogeochemical types in Chadha diagram showed saline water (Na+-Cl-) type in 92% of groundwater samples. Ionic ratios indicated that anthropogenic activities resulting from the leaching of surface water pollutants are the main source of groundwater pollution. Base ion exchange was indicated as the main process in CA indices. SI revealed precipitation of the calcite phase and dissolution of the gypsum and halite phases in groundwater. Evaporation appeared in Gibb's diagram as a primary process rather than a geogenic origin. PC1 (Na+, Cl-, SO42-, Mg2+, K+, and NO3-) and PC2 (HCO3- and F-) were considered salinity-process and alkalinity-process, respectively. The main sources of salinity in groundwater are brackish-water aquaculture and salt-making activities with household waste, septic tank spills, irrigation-return-flows, and chemical fertilizers being secondary sources. HCA classified groundwater samples into Group-I (46%), which represents domestic water, agricultural activities, etc., Group-II (30.24%), which shows the influence of both Group-I and Group-II, and Group-III (23.76%), which specifies brackish-water aquaculture and salt-making activities. Consequently, the present study obviously indicated that the groundwater quality of anthropogenic origin has largely overcome the influence of geogenic sources. The EWQI classification spatially delineated the study region into medium, high, and very high vulnerable zones, covering 28.69%, 32.75%, and 38.56%, respectively. Therefore, it is suggested to control the dumping of domestic waste and septic tank leaks, limit irrigation-return-flows and chemical fertilizers, ban brackish water aquaculture and salt production activities, and strictly implement an aquifer recharge management strategy to ensure human health. This study will assist decision-makers in addressing groundwater salinity issues in coastal regions.",,821
914,35974806,Kidney Replacement Therapy in Cardiorenal Syndromes.,"Cardiorenal syndromes (CRS) have increasingly been recognized as distinct disorders that affect the heart and kidneys simultaneously, either with acute or chronic onset. The different types share common pathophysiological characteristics. The concept cardiorenal shall emphasize the inter- or even multidisciplinary approach to respective patients. Anticongestive therapy becomes mandatory in many subjects that suffer from CRS. In recent years, the role of dialysis treatment in a broader sense has been investigated in CRS in more detail. We performed a search for studies related to the topic in the following databases: MEDLINE, PROSPERO, and Web of Science. The following keywords were used for reference identification: CRS, cardiorenal syndrome, dialysis, hemodialysis, hemofiltration, renal replacement therapy, kidney replacement therapy, peritoneal dialysis, and aquapheresis. Finally, a total number of 22 studies, partly performed as retrospective cohort studies, and partly designed as prospective investigations, were included. The selected studies evaluated different modes of peritoneal dialysis (PD) or of non-PD procedures including intermittent hemodialysis, continuous procedures, and so-called aquapheresis. Inclusion and outcome parameters were almost not comparable between selected trials. Some studies revealed dialysis as effective, with reasonable tolerability. Particularly so-called pure ultrafiltration (e.g., aquapheresis) was associated with higher rates of adverse events. Future studies should be designed in a more homogenous manner, particularly concerning the inclusion criteria, the respective dialysis procedure applied, and endpoints in the short- and long-term.",,822
2314,35967065,"Green Design, Synthesis, and Molecular Docking Study of Novel Quinoxaline Derivatives with Insecticidal Potential against Aphis craccivora.","An efficient and environmentally friendly method was established for designing novel 3-amino-1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-2-carbonitrile (1) via the reaction of bromomalononitrile and benzene-1,2-diamine under microwave irradiation in an excellent yield (93%). This targeted amino derivative was utilized for the construction of a series of Schiff bases (8-13). A new series of thiazolidinone derivatives (15-20) were synthesized in high yields (89-96%) via treatment of thioglycolic acid with Schiff bases (8-13) under microwave irradiation in high yields (89-96%). Moreover, new pyrimidine derivatives (26-30 and 35-38) were prepared by treatment of compound 1 with arylidenes (21-25) and/or alkylidenemalononitriles (31-34) using piperidine as a basic catalyst under microwave conditions. Based on elemental analyses and spectral data, the structures of the new assembled compounds were determined. The newly synthesized quinoxaline derivatives were screened and studied as an insecticidal agent against Aphis craccivora. The obtained results indicate that compound 16 is the most toxicological agent against nymphs of cowpea aphids (Aphis craccivora) compared to the other synthesized pyrimidine and thiazolidinone derivatives. The molecular docking study of the new quinoxaline derivatives registered that compound 16 had the highest binding score (-10.54 kcal/mol) and the thiazolidinone moiety formed hydrogen bonds with Trp143.",,823
1703,35968067,Prediction the survival of patients with breast cancer using random survival forests for competing risks.,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cause of cancer death in Iranian women. Sometimes death from other causes precludes the event of interest and makes the analysis complicated. The purpose of this study was to identify important prognostic factors associated with survival duration among patients with BC using random survival forests (RSF) model in presence of competing risks. Also, its performance was compared with cause-specific hazard model. This retrospective cohort study assessed 222 patients with BC who were admitted to Ayatollah Khansari hospital in Arak, a major industrial city and the capital of Markazi province in Iran. The cause-specific Cox proportional hazards and RSF models were employed to determine the important risk factors for survival of the patients. The mean and median survival duration of the patients were 90.71 (95%CI: 83.8-97.6) and 100.73 (95%CI: 89.2-121.5) months, respectively. The cause-specific model indicated that type of surgery and HER2 had statistically significant effects on the risk of death of BC. Moreover, the RSF model identified that HER2 was the most important variable for the event of interest. According to the results of this study, the performance of the RSF model was better than the cause-specific hazard model. Moreover, HER2 was the most important variable for death of BC in both of the models.",,824
518,35978741,Clinical Implications of Herbal Supplements in Conventional Medical Practice: A US Perspective.,"Herbal supplements are common complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches with an ever-increasing use trend in the last two decades among the US population. Self-medication with herbal supplements which are promoted for general well-being, weight loss, immunity, and memory boost, and mental and physical health claims are very prevalent. There is a misperception that herbal supplements are harmless as they are prepared from natural sources. Unlike conventional drugs, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate herbal supplements for premarketing purity and potency. Hence, there is a growing concern for health risks due to misbranded toxic ingredients, contaminants, adulterants, and herb-drug interactions (HDI) with co-administered drugs. The spectrum of pharmacological and toxicological effects of herbal supplements includes deranged lab results, allergic reactions, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, organ damage, and even fatality contributing to sizable emergency visits and hospitalizations in the US. The use of herbal supplements should be carefully monitored in high-risk groups such as pediatric and geriatric populations, pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, immunocompromised patients, and surgical candidates. The deleterious health effects of herbal supplements are loosely addressed in conventional medical practice in part due to the limited knowledge of practitioners. This comprehensive narrative review aims to explore the clinical implications of herbal supplements in order to fill the knowledge gaps by summarizing scientific publications. It also highlights the pivotal roles physicians can play in minimizing the health risks of herbal supplements by encouraging patients to disclose usage through a non-judgmental approach, employing HDI screening tools, and reporting adverse reactions to FDA. Formal training of physicians, a standardized pharmacovigilance system, stricter regulation of the herbal industry, and more scientific studies are keys to establishing herbal safety and efficacy in clinical practice.",,825
1548,35968338,"LMNB1, a potential marker for early prostate cancer progression.","Although prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer among men in the Western world, there are no good biomarkers that can reliably differentiate between potentially aggressive and indolent PC. This leads to overtreatment, even for patients who can be managed conservatively. Previous studies have suggested that nuclear lamin proteins-especially lamin B1 (LMNB1)-play important roles in PC progression. However, the results of these studies are inconsistent. Here, we transfected the LMNB1 gene into the telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized benign prostatic epithelial cell line, EP156T to generate a LMNB1-overexpressing EP156T (LMN-EP156T) cell line with increased cellular proliferation. However, LMN-EP156T cells could neither form colonies in soft agar, nor establish subcutaneous growth or metastasis in the xenograft NOD/SCID mouse model. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of LMNB1 in PC specimens from 143 patients showed a statistically significant trend of stronger LMNB1 staining with higher Gleason scores. A univariate analysis of the clinicopathological parameters of 85 patients with PC who underwent radical prostatectomy revealed that pathological stage, resection margin, and extracapsular extension were significant predictors for biochemical recurrence (BCR). However, LMNB1 staining showed only a non-significant trend of association with BCR (high vs. low staining: hazard ratio (HR), 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98-3.41; P = 0.059). In multivariate analysis, only pathological stage was a significant independent predictor of BCR (pT3 vs. pT2: HR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.18-4.43; P = 0.014). In summary, LMNB1 may play a role in the early steps of PC progression, and additional molecular alterations may be needed to confer full malignancy potential to initiated cells.",,826
1976,35967631,Online Customer Experience Leads to Loyalty via Customer Engagement: Moderating Role of Value Co-creation.,"With the increasing growth of online shopping, businesses are intertwining to establish new shopping antecedents. Customer experience has steadily become the most important source of retailers' long-term competitive advantage via difference. To preserve long-term and sustained consumer loyalty, retailers must continually improve the customer experiences. This study presents a framework for online retailing in a digital environment called the Online Customer Experience-Engagement Context model in the presence of value co-creation (VCC). Data was gathered from 189 people who purchased products online. For additional analysis, testing the hypothesis, and model construction, SPSS 26 and Smart-PLS were used. The data was then evaluated further using descriptive statistics, path analysis, measurement, and structural model. The findings show that the online customer experience (measured as shopping environment, shopping procedure, staff service experience, and product experience) substantially influenced customer engagement, which improved customer loyalty. The VCC strengthened the link between online customer experience and customer engagement. It suggests that including consumers in co-creating a delightful online customer experience from time to time may be a valuable strategy for online retailers to increase customer engagement and loyalty. To create an overarching outcome, information integration theory (IIT), multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT), and the attitude-behavior-context theory (ABC) theories are converged to explain the proposed model in the study.",,827
752,35975085,Novel extraction route of lithium from α-spodumene by dry chlorination.,"Processing spodumene for lithium is challenging as it requires a high temperature transformation of the natural α-monoclinic form to β-tetragonal form, usually followed by acid baking and digestion. This three-step extraction process requires significant heat energy, acid, process complexity and residence time, leading to both operating and capital costs. An approach which helps to eliminate this challenge will therefore be a milestone in processing spodumene. This study, thus, investigates a direct chlorination of α-spodumene using calcium chloride followed by water leaching of the residue to recover lithium, which reduces the energy requirement and number of unit operations. HSC Chemistry software was used to simulate the process using both phases (α and β) of the mineral up to 1100 °C prior to experimental investigation. The α-form was the only polymorph identified in residues after leaching, suggesting that the extraction is directly from the α-phase. However, an initial formation of a metastable β-form followed by a fast synthesis of lithium chloride from it is also suspected. Under optimal conditions of calcium chloride/spodumene molar ratio of 2.0, and 1000 °C treatment for 60 minutes, almost 90 percent lithium chloride was extracted and 85 percent was recovered to the leach solution with the remainder exiting with the off-gas. An apparent activation energy of about 122 ± 6 kJ mol-1 was obtained at temperatures ranging from 800 to 950 °C during the process.",,828
963,35974656,Active colloidal molecules in activity gradients.,"We consider a rigid assembly of two active Brownian particles, forming an active colloidal dimer, in a gradient of activity. We show analytically that depending on the relative orientation of the two particles the active dimer accumulates in regions of either high or low activity, corresponding to, respectively, chemotaxis and antichemotaxis. Certain active dimers show both chemotactic and antichemotactic behavior, depending on the strength of the activity. Our coarse-grained Fokker-Planck approach yields an effective potential, which we use to construct a nonequilibrium phase diagram that classifies the dimers according to their tactic behavior. Moreover, we show that for certain dimers a higher persistence of the motion is achieved similar to the effect of a steering wheel in macroscopic devices. This work could be useful for designing autonomous active colloidal structures which adjust their motion depending on the local activity gradients.",,829
300,35980785,"Pain is associated with depressive symptoms, inflammation, and poorer physical function in older adults with HIV.","People living with HIV (PLWH) frequently experience pain, which often co-occurs with psychological symptoms and may impact functional outcomes. We investigated cross-sectional associations between pain, depressive symptoms, and inflammation, then explored whether pain was related to poorer physical function among older PLWH. We examined data from PLWH ages 54-78 (n = 162) recruited from a single outpatient program for a larger study on HIV and aging. Participants reported depressive symptoms (CES-D-10), then attended a biomedical visit in which they reported past-month pain (MOS-HIV pain subscale), completed physical function assessments, and provided blood samples (assayed for IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and CRP). Links between pain, depressive symptoms, inflammation, and physical function were tested using linear regression models. PLWH with greater depressive symptoms experienced more pain than those with fewer depressive symptoms (B = 1.31, SE = 0.28, p < 0.001), adjusting for age, gender, race, BMI, smoking, disease burden, time since HIV diagnosis, and medication use. Higher composite cytokine levels were associated with worse pain (B = 5.70, SE = 2.54, p = 0.027 in adjusted model). Poorer physical function indicators, including slower gait speed, weaker grip strength, recent falls, and pre-frail or frail status, were observed among those with worse pain. Exploratory mediation analyses suggested that pain may partially explain links between depressive symptoms and several physical function outcomes. Pain is a potential pathway linking depressive symptoms and inflammation to age-related health vulnerabilities among older PLWH; longitudinal investigation of this pattern is warranted. PLWH presenting with pain may benefit from multidisciplinary resources, including behavioral health and geriatric medicine approaches.",,830
2225,35967292,Structural plasticity in I-Ag7 links autoreactivity to hybrid insulin peptides in type I diabetes.,"We recently provided evidence for promiscuous recognition of several different hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs) by the highly diabetogenic, I-Ag7-restricted 4.1-T cell receptor (TCR). To understand the structural determinants of this phenomenon, we solved the structure of an agonistic HIP/I-Ag7 complex, both in isolation as well as bound to the 4.1-TCR. We find that HIP promiscuity of the 4.1-TCR is dictated, on the one hand, by an amino acid sequence pattern that ensures I-Ag7 binding and, on the other hand, by the presence of three acidic residues at positions P5, P7 and P8 that favor an optimal engagement by the 4.1-TCR's complementary determining regions. Surprisingly, comparison of the TCR-bound and unbound HIP/I-Ag7 structures reveals that 4.1-TCR binding triggers several novel and unique structural motions in both the I-Ag7 molecule and the peptide that are essential for docking. This observation indicates that the type 1 diabetes-associated I-Ag7 molecule is structurally malleable and that this plasticity allows the recognition of multiple peptides by individual TCRs that would otherwise be unable to do so.",,831
1861,35967779,An insight to potential application of synbiotic edible films and coatings in food products.,"Edible films and coatings have gained significant consideration in recent years due to their low cost and decreasing environmental pollution. Several bioactive compounds can be incorporated into films and coatings, including antioxidants, antimicrobials, flavoring agents, colors, probiotics and prebiotics. The addition of probiotics to edible films and coatings is an alternative approach for direct application in food matrices that enhances their stability and functional properties. Also, it has been noted that the influence of probiotics on the film properties was dependent on the composition, biopolymer structure, and intermolecular interactions. Recently, the incorporation of probiotics along with prebiotic compounds such as inulin, starch, fructooligosaccharide, polydextrose and wheat dextrin has emerged as new bioactive packaging. The simultaneous application of probiotics and prebiotics improved the viability of probiotic strains and elevated their colonization in the intestinal tract and provided health benefits to humans. Moreover, prebiotics created a uniform and compact structure by filling the spaces within the polymer matrix and increased opacity of edible films. The effects of prebiotics on mechanical and barrier properties of edible films was dependent on the nature of prebiotic compounds. This review aims to discuss the concept of edible films and coatings, synbiotic, recent research on synbiotic edible films and coatings as well as their application in food products.",,832
1433,35968466,Utilization of artificial intelligence approach for prediction of DLP values for abdominal CT scans: A high accuracy estimation for risk assessment.,"This study aimed to evaluate Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modeling to estimate the significant dose length product (DLP) value during the abdominal CT examinations for quality assurance in a retrospective, cross-sectional study. The structure of the ANN model was designed considering various input parameters, namely patient weight, patient size, body mass index, mean CTDI volume, scanning length, kVp, mAs, exposure time per rotation, and pitch factor. The aforementioned examination details of 551 abdominal CT scans were used as retrospective data. Different types of learning algorithms such as Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian and Scaled-Conjugate Gradient were checked in terms of the accuracy of the training data. The R-value representing the correlation coefficient for the real system and system output is given as 0.925, 0.785, and 0.854 for the Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian, and Scaled-Conjugate Gradient algorithms, respectively. The findings showed that the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm comprehensively detects DLP values for abdominal CT examinations. It can be a helpful approach to simplify CT quality assurance. It can be concluded that outcomes of this novel artificial intelligence method can be used for high accuracy DLP estimations before the abdominal CT examinations, where the radiation-related risk factors are high or risk evaluation of multiple CT scans is needed for patients in terms of ALARA. Likewise, it can be concluded that artificial learning methods are powerful tools and can be used for different types of radiation-related risk assessments for quality assurance in diagnostic radiology.",,833
1556,35968330,Early increase of plasma soluble VEGFR-2 is associated with clinical benefit from second-line treatment of paclitaxel and ramucirumab in advanced gastric cancer.,"Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel is considered the standard of care in the second-line treatment of gastric carcinoma (GC). The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), VEGF-D, and circulating soluble VEGF receptor-2 (sVEGFR-2) as possible markers of resistance or response to ramucirumab administered with paclitaxel in pretreated metastatic GC patients. Plasma samples were collected at different time points (on days 1 and 15 of the first 3 cycles, at best radiologic response and at disease progression). VEGF-A, VEGF-D and sVEGFR-2 were analysed by ELISA. Correlations of biomarker baseline levels or dynamic changes with outcome measures were assessed. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint of the study. Forty-one patients were enrolled. VEGF-A and VEGF-D, but not sVEGFR-2, values significantly increased during treatment compared to baseline (P < 0.001). A positive correlation between VEGF-A and sVEGFR-2 at cycle 2 was found (P=0.045). At univariate analysis, higher baseline levels of VEGF-A were associated with worse OS (P=0.015). Early increase of sVEGFR-2 levels after the first treatment cycle was the only factor associated with longer PFS (6.6 vs. 3.6 months, P=0.049) and OS (18.6 vs. 5.2 months, P=0.008). Significance of sVEGFR-2 early increase was retained at multivariate analysis for OS (HR 0.32; 95% CI 0.12-0.91; P=0.032). The reported results confirmed the prognostic role of baseline VEGF-A and, with the limitations of the limited sample size and the lack of a control arm, suggested that the early increase of sVEGFR-2 after 1 cycle of treatment could be a potential predictive biomarker of benefit from second-line ramucirumab plus paclitaxel in GC.",,834
974,35974645,Finite-size scaling of critical avalanches.,"We examine probability distribution for avalanche sizes observed in self-organized critical systems. While a power-law distribution with a cutoff because of finite system size is typical behavior, a systematic investigation reveals that it may also decrease with increasing the system size at a fixed avalanche size. We implement the scaling method and identify scaling functions. The data collapse ensures a correct estimation of the critical exponents and distinguishes two exponents related to avalanche size and system size. Our simple analysis provides striking implications. While the exact value for avalanches size exponent remains elusive for the prototype sandpile on a square lattice, we suggest the exponent should be 1. The simulation results represent that the distribution shows a logarithmic system size dependence, consistent with the normalization condition. We also argue that for the train or Oslo sandpile model with bulk drive, the avalanche size exponent is slightly less than 1, which differs significantly from the previous estimate of 1.11.",,835
1592,35968292,Preoperative Brain Tumor Imaging: Models and Software for Segmentation and Standardized Reporting.,"For patients suffering from brain tumor, prognosis estimation and treatment decisions are made by a multidisciplinary team based on a set of preoperative MR scans. Currently, the lack of standardized and automatic methods for tumor detection and generation of clinical reports, incorporating a wide range of tumor characteristics, represents a major hurdle. In this study, we investigate the most occurring brain tumor types: glioblastomas, lower grade gliomas, meningiomas, and metastases, through four cohorts of up to 4,000 patients. Tumor segmentation models were trained using the AGU-Net architecture with different preprocessing steps and protocols. Segmentation performances were assessed in-depth using a wide-range of voxel and patient-wise metrics covering volume, distance, and probabilistic aspects. Finally, two software solutions have been developed, enabling an easy use of the trained models and standardized generation of clinical reports: Raidionics and Raidionics-Slicer. Segmentation performances were quite homogeneous across the four different brain tumor types, with an average true positive Dice ranging between 80 and 90%, patient-wise recall between 88 and 98%, and patient-wise precision around 95%. In conjunction to Dice, the identified most relevant other metrics were the relative absolute volume difference, the variation of information, and the Hausdorff, Mahalanobis, and object average symmetric surface distances. With our Raidionics software, running on a desktop computer with CPU support, tumor segmentation can be performed in 16-54 s depending on the dimensions of the MRI volume. For the generation of a standardized clinical report, including the tumor segmentation and features computation, 5-15 min are necessary. All trained models have been made open-access together with the source code for both software solutions and validation metrics computation. In the future, a method to convert results from a set of metrics into a final single score would be highly desirable for easier ranking across trained models. In addition, an automatic classification of the brain tumor type would be necessary to replace manual user input. Finally, the inclusion of post-operative segmentation in both software solutions will be key for generating complete post-operative standardized clinical reports.",,836
1328,35969965,Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide in the synthesis of mesoporous silica nanoparticles: General aspects and in vitro toxicity.,"Pharmaceutical nanotechnology has become a trend with incalculable advantages in the applicability of systems in the controlled, safe and effective release of drugs. Among the nanotechnological nanoparticles, the mesoporous silica nanoparticles stand out, a system with significant biocompatibility, good physical chemical stability, greater surface contact area with desirable and adjustable pore structure. Once developed and well defined, these pores can carry drugs and control their release. However, to create this type of nanoparticle is essencial to use surfactants since they act as pore template. Among the most important surfactants, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) highlights, a quaternary ammonium compound widely used as a surfactant in the synthesis of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), hollow mesoporous silica (HMSNs) and core-shell MSNs. However, for achieving good results of drug-loaded pores it is necessary to remove CTAB by extraction techniques, which provides pores formation throughout the silica and the incorporation of molecules. During and after the removal process, it is possible that CTAB residues remains inside the pores, despide several removal processes are described as efficient in the complete removal of surfactants. In turn, the presence of CTAB residues can be advantageous, especially when considering its antimicrobial activity. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the presence of CTAB may present high toxicity risks. This review seeks to explore not only general aspects of the use of CTAB in the synthesis of MSNs, but also to assess its toxicity in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, in order to determine whether CTAB residues are acceptable in MSNs that will be used as drug delivery systems for further in vivo and clinical assays.",,837
259,35982571,A cross-scale study on the relationship between urban expansion and ecosystem services in China.,"Clarifying the relationship between urban expansion and ecosystem services (ESs) is critical for sustainable management of land resources and ecosystems. However, little is known about the relationship between the two at the cross-scale (particularly at the national-provincial scale). Therefore, we conducted a systematic assessment of the spatiotemporal dynamics and the relationship between urban expansion and ESs including food production (FP), soil conservation (SC), carbon sequestration (CS), and water yield (WY) in China from 1992 to 2020 on the national-provincial scale. The results show that China's urban expansion took up a large amount of cropland, accounting for 79.35% of the newly-added built-up land. Shandong had the largest expansion scale and the highest speed, Shanghai had the most pronounced expansion intensity, and more than 50% of the provinces were dominated by outlying expansion pattern. In terms of total change, the three ESs of FP, SC, and WY increased by 286.5 × 106 t, 1893.61 × 106 t, and 8337.20 × 106 mm, respectively, and CS decreased by 683.90 × 106 Mg C. However, in the urban expansion area, FP and CS net decreased by 1757.6 × 104 t and 19,640.19 × 104 Mg C, respectively, while SC and WY net increased by 347.52 × 104 t and 20,264.11 × 104 mm, respectively. Shandong contributed the most to changes in ESs in urban expansion areas. Urban expansion was significantly negatively correlated with FP and CS with the correlation coefficients > -0.8; it was significantly positively correlated with SC and WY, with coefficients of 0.714 and 0.413, respectively, and urban expansion had a lagged effect on ESs. The impact of urban expansion on ESs had a spatial spillover effect and showed prominent spatial clustering in Anhui, Henan, and Shandong. Based on these results, we proposed urban planning countermeasures grounded in the perspective of ES improvement, which would provide policy references for the sustainable management of the ecological environment and land resources.",,838
31,35985053,With the Increasing Health Awareness: Clinical and Computed Tomography Findings in Primary Pulmonary Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Lymphoma.,"The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical manifestations, computed tomography (CT) findings, and prognosis of primary pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) with the improved health awareness nowadays. Clinical data and CT images of patients with pathologically confirmed MALToma from October 2012 to October 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Eighteen MALToma patients were included in the study (8 men and 10 women; mean age, 56.17 years; range, 33-73 years). Six men had a long-term history of smoking (>20 years). One patient had an autoimmune disease (Sjögren syndrome). Eight patients (44.44%) were asymptomatic, and 10 (55.56%) had mild chest or systemic symptoms. Most lesions (88.89%) were subpleural or located along the bronchovascular tree. According to the CT characteristics, the lesions were divided into 4 groups: nodular type (n = 8; 44.44%, including 5 solid nodules and 3 ground-glass nodules), mass type (n = 4, 22.22%), patch or consolidate type (n = 5, 27.78%), and mixed type (n = 1, 5.56%). Air bronchogram (11/18, 61.11%) and angiogram sign (8/16, 50%) were the most frequent CT findings and may help differential diagnosis. The patients were misdiagnosed with lung cancer (n = 11, 61.11%), inflammatory or chronic inflammatory disease (n = 4, 22.22%), bronchiectasis accompanied by infection (n = 1, 5.56%), diffuse interstitial lung disease (n = 1, 5.56%), and granuloma or tuberculosis (n = 1, 5.56%). The prognosis of all patients was favorable; 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Nowadays, patients with MALToma are usually asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic. Nodular lesions, including ground-glass nodules, are the most common presentation. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma is most likely misdiagnosed as lung cancer. Lesions located in the subpleural areas or along the bronchovascular tree and presenting with an air bronchogram or angiogram sign could indicate a MALToma diagnosis.",,839
255,35982576,Dynamics of soil organic carbon and nitrogen and their relations to hydrothermal variability in dryland.,"Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles of terrestrial ecosystems play key roles in global climate change and ecosystem sustainability. In recent decades, climate change has threatened the nutrient balance of dryland ecosystems. However, its impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) in drylands of China are still unclear. In this study, the structural equation model (SEM) was used to explain the relationship between environmental variables used by the best model and SOC or STN. Then Adaptive Boosting Regressor (AdaBoost), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBRT), Extreme gradient boosting Regression (XGBoost) and Random Forest Regression (RF) were used to establish the prediction model of SOC and STN based on soil samples along with environmental variables. The performance of these models was assessed based on a 10-fold cross-validation method using three statistical indicators. Finally, we predicted the SOC and STN of soil samples from 2000 to 2019 based on the best model. Overall, the RF model performed better at predicting SOC and STN in drylands than the other three prediction models (AdaBoost, GBRT, XGBoost). Climate factors were the main factors affecting SOC and STN in the study area. In the Alashan, a dryland in northern China, the precipitation in the growing season increased from 2000 to 2019, at a rate of 12.9 mm/decade. During the same period, the annual sunshine duration significantly decreased by 66 h/decade. Along with interannual hydrothermal variability, SOC showed a fluctuating upward trend at a rate of 0.04 g/kg/decade, while STN exhibited a fluctuating downward trend at 0.003 g/kg/decade from 2000 to 2019. Due to the effects of climate change, dryland were considered as potential sites for carbon sequestration. However, due to the annual hydrothermal variance causing dynamic annual changes, it was deemed unstable. Moreover, it would cause STN loss, which might reduce soil fertility. More attention should be paid to STN monitoring in dryland in the future.",,840
2313,35967066,Concentrated Solar Induced Graphene.,"Graphene is one of the most promising nanomaterials with many extraordinary properties and numerous exciting applications. In this work, a green, facile, and rapid method was developed to prepare graphene directly from common biomass materials such as banana peels, cantaloupe peels, coconut peels, and orange peels by using concentrated solar radiation. The basic principle of this method is photothermal conversion. On a sunny day, the sunlight was concentrated by a biconvex lens to form a focused light spot with a high temperature above 1000 °C, which can directly convert fruit peels into graphene nanosheets within 2-3 s. The product is named concentrated-solar-induced graphene (CSIG) based on the process employed to generate it. The resulting CSIG was characterized using a range of analytical techniques. The Raman spectrum of the CSIG displayed two distinct peaks corresponding to the D and G bands at ∼1343 and ∼1568 cm-1, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction were used to confirm that the CSIG consists of a few layers of turbostratic graphene nanosheets. Atomic force microscopy characterization revealed that the CSIG nanosheets have a thickness of ∼4 nm. The antibacterial potential of the CSIG was also explored. The CSIG had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of Escherichia coli. This simple, green, and straightforward method for producing graphene may open a new route for turning waste into useful materials: an inexhaustible and pollution-free natural resource can be readily exploited by using a solar tracker-lens system for the large-scale production of graphene materials directly from low-cost biomass materials.",,841
1008,35974611,Volume-shear coupling in a mesoscopic model of amorphous materials.,"We present a two-dimensional mesoscopic model of a yield stress material that includes the possibility of local volume fluctuations coupled to shear in such a way that the shear strength of the material decreases as the local density decreases. The model reproduces a number of effects well known in the phenomenology of this kind of material. In particular, we find that the volume of the sample increases as the deformation rate increases; shear bands are no longer oriented at 45^{∘} with respect to the principal axis of the applied stress (as in the absence of volume-shear coupling); and homogeneous deformation becomes unstable at low enough deformation rates if volume-shear coupling is strong enough. We also discuss the effect of this coupling on some out-of-equilibrium configurations, which can be relevant to the study of the shear bands observed in metallic glasses.",,842
2133,35967385,The adenosinergic signaling in the pathogenesis and treatment of multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly disabling, progressive neurodegenerative disease with no curative treatment available. Although significant progress has been made in understanding how MS develops, there remain aspects of disease pathogenesis that are yet to be fully elucidated. In this regard, studies have shown that dysfunctional adenosinergic signaling plays a pivotal role, as patients with MS have altered levels adenosine (ADO), adenosine receptors and proteins involved in the generation and termination of ADO signaling, such as CD39 and adenosine deaminase (ADA). We have therefore performed a literature review regarding the involvement of the adenosinergic system in the development of MS and propose mechanisms by which the modulation of this system can support drug development and repurposing.",,843
2145,35967373,Systematic identification of key extracellular proteins as the potential biomarkers in lupus nephritis.,"Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common and severe clinical manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with considerable morbidity/mortality and limited treatment options. Since kidney biopsy is a relative hysteretic indicator, it is indispensable to investigate potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and predicting clinical outcomes of LN patients. Extracellular proteins may become the promising biomarkers by the secretion into body fluid. Our study linked extracellular proteins with lupus nephritis to identify the emerging biomarkers. The expression profiling data were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Meanwhile, the two gene lists encoding extracellular proteins were collected from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and UniProt database. Subsequently, the extracellular protein-differentially expressed genes (EP-DEGs) were screened out, and the key EP-DEGs were determined by MCODE, MCC, and Degree methods via the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The expression level, immune characteristics, and diagnostic value of these candidate biomarkers were investigated. Finally, the Nephroseq V5 tool was applied to evaluate the clinical significance of the key EP-DEGs. A total of 164 DEGs were acquired by comparing LN samples with healthy controls based on GSE32591 datasets. Then, 38 EP-DEGs were screened out through the intersection between DEGs and extracellular protein gene lists. Function enrichment analysis indicated that these EP-DEGs might participate in immune response and constitute the extracellular matrix. Four key EP-DEGs (LUM, TGFBI, COL1A2, and POSTN) were eventually identified as candidate biomarkers, and they were all overexpressed in LN samples. Except that LUM expression was negatively correlated with most of the immune regulatory genes, there was a positive correlation between the remaining three biomarkers and the immune regulatory genes. In addition, these biomarkers had high diagnostic value, especially the AUC value of the LUM-TGFBI combination which reached almost 1 (AUC = 0.973), demonstrating high accuracy in distinguishing LN from controls. Finally, we found a meaningful correlation of these biomarkers with sex, WHO class, and renal function such as glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine level, and proteinuria. In summary, our study comprehensively identified four key EP-DEGs exerting a vital role in LN diagnosis and pathogenesis and serving as promising therapeutic targets.",,844
1090,35974529,Anisotropic active Brownian particle with a fluctuating propulsion force.,"The active Brownian particle (ABP) model describes a swimmer, synthetic or living, whose direction of swimming is a Brownian motion. The swimming is due to a propulsion force, and the fluctuations are typically thermal in origin. We present a two-dimensional model where the fluctuations arise from nonthermal noise in a propelling force acting at a single point, such as that due to a flagellum. We take the overdamped limit and find several modifications to the traditional ABP model. Since the fluctuating force causes a fluctuating torque, the diffusion tensor describing the process has a coupling between translational and rotational degrees of freedom. An anisotropic particle also exhibits a mass-dependent noise-induced drift, which does not disappear in the overdamped limit. We show that these effects have measurable consequences for the long-time diffusivity of active particles, in particular adding a contribution that is independent of where the force acts.",,845
596,35977900,Hydranencephaly in a newborn due to occupational toluene exposure during pregnancy: a case report.,"The etiopathogenesis of hydranencephaly remains unclear; however, exposure to toxic substances during pregnancy likely increases hydranencephaly risk. Head computed tomography (CT) was performed in a neonate 9 hours post-delivery because the anterior fontanelle was large and there were clinical signs of encephalopathy. Head CT revealed a lack of both cerebral hemispheres and significant cystic enlargement, while the cerebellar hemispheres and pons were found to have developed normally. History-taking revealed that the mother worked in the automotive industry, specifically in the car paint cleaning business and was exposed to toluene during the pregnancy. The patient was diagnosed with hydranencephaly, central diabetes insipidus and central hypothyroidism. Due to the increased head circumference and tense anterior fontanelle, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Toluene exposure during pregnancy should be considered among the causes of hydranencephaly. Furthermore, central diabetes insipidus and central hypothyroidism may develop in such cases.",,846
1498,35968389,New MS lesion segmentation with deep residual attention gate U-Net utilizing 2D slices of 3D MR images.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that causes lesions in the central nervous system of humans due to demyelinating axons. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used for monitoring and measuring MS lesions. Automated methods for MS lesion segmentation have usually been performed on individual MRI scans. Recently, tracking lesion activity for quantifying and monitoring MS disease progression, especially detecting new lesions, has become an important biomarker. In this study, a unique pipeline with a deep neural network that combines U-Net, attention gate, and residual learning is proposed to perform better new MS lesion segmentation using baseline and follow-up 3D FLAIR MR images. The proposed network has a similar architecture to U-Net and is formed from residual units which facilitate the training of deep networks. Networks with fewer parameters are designed with better performance through the skip connections of U-Net and residual units, which facilitate information propagation without degradation. Attention gates also learn to focus on salient features of the target structures of various sizes and shapes. The MSSEG-2 dataset was used for training and testing the proposed pipeline, and the results were compared with those of other proposed pipelines of the challenge and experts who participated in the same challenge. According to the results over the testing set, the lesion-wise F1 and dice scores were obtained as a mean of 48 and 44.30%. For the no-lesion cases, the number of tested and volume of tested lesions were obtained as a mean of 0.148 and 1.488, respectively. The proposed pipeline outperformed 22 proposed pipelines and ranked 8th in the challenge.",,847
1156,35973763,Sodium channel-directed alkaloids synergize the mosquitocidal and neurophysiological effects of natural pyrethrins.,"We explored the potential of two sodium channel activators, veratrine and aconitine, as both insecticides and synergists of natural pyrethrins (NP) on Aedes aegypti adults and larvae. Aconitine was more toxic than veratrine, with an LD50 of 157 ng/mg compared to 376 ng/mg, on the pyrethroid-susceptible Orlando strain, but only aconitine showed significant resistance in the pyrethroid-resistant Puerto Rico strain (RR = 14.6 in topical application and 8.8 in larval bioassay). When applied in mixtures with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and NP, large synergism values were obtained on the Orlando strain. Aconitine + PBO mixture synergized NP 21.8-fold via topical adult application and 10.2-fold in larval bioassays, whereas veratrine + PBO synergized NP 5.3-fold via topical application and 30.5-fold in larval bioassays. Less synergism of NP was observed on the resistant Puerto Rico strain, with acontine + PBO synergizing NP only 4.1-fold in topical application (8-fold in larval bioassays) and veratrine + PBO synergizing NP 9.5-fold in topical application (13.3-fold in larval bioassays). When alkaloids were applied directly to the mosquito larval nervous system, veratrine was nearly equipotent on both strains, while aconitine was less active on pyrethroid-resistant nerve preparations (no block at 10 μM compared to block at 1 μM on the susceptible strain). The nerve blocking effect of NP was significantly synergized by both compounds on the pyrethroid-susceptible strain by about 10-fold, however only veratrine synergized NP block on the pyrethroid-resistant strain, also showing 10-fold synergism). These results highlight the potential of site II sodium channel activators as insecticides and their ability to synergize pyrethroids, which may extend the commercial lifetime of these chemistries so essential to public health vector control.",,848
986,35974633,Effects of time-varying habitat connectivity on metacommunity persistence.,"Network structure or connectivity patterns are critical in determining collective dynamics among interacting species in ecosystems. Conventional research on species persistence in spatial populations has focused on static network structure, though most real network structures change in time, forming time-varying networks. This raises the question, in metacommunities, how does the pattern of synchrony vary with temporal evolution in the network structure. The synchronous dynamics among species are known to reduce metacommunity persistence. Here we consider a time-varying metacommunity small-world network consisting of a chaotic three-species food chain oscillator in each patch or node. The rate of change in the network connectivity is determined by the natural frequency or its subharmonics of the constituent oscillator to allow sufficient time for the evolution of species in between successive rewirings. We find that over a range of coupling strengths and rewiring periods, even higher rewiring probabilities drive a network from asynchrony towards synchrony. Moreover, in networks with a small rewiring period, an increase in average degree (more connected networks) pushes the asynchronous dynamics to synchrony. On the other hand, in networks with a low average degree, a higher rewiring period drives the synchronous dynamics to asynchrony resulting in increased species persistence. Our results also follow the calculation of synchronization time and are robust across other ecosystem models. Overall, our study opens the possibility of developing temporal connectivity strategies to increase species persistence in ecological networks.",,849
1481,35968416,Qualitative Research on the Training Experiences and Needs of Intensive Care Unit General Nurses Against the Background of Regular Coronavirus Disease 2019 Prevention and Control.,"This study aimed to investigate the training experiences and needs of intensive care unit (ICU) general nurses against a background of regular Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) prevention and control. Using the phenomenological method of qualitative research, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 ICU nurses. The interview data were analyzed, sorted, summarized, and refined using the content analysis method. The following five themes were extracted from the interviews, based on the training experiences of the nurses: 1) broadening their thinking; 2) discovering their personal shortcomings; 3) gaining self-confidence; 4) calmly facing frontline work; 5) experiencing high assessment pressure. The training needs of the nurses could be summarized into the following four themes: 1) increased training time; 2) improving the assessment mechanism; 3) establishing a normal rotating-shift training system; 4) balancing the teaching levels. Against a background of regular epidemic prevention and control, ICU training for general nurses is of high practical significance and value. Thus, active exploration and research should be conducted to establish perfect training and assessment mechanisms for these nurses. Additionally, training methods that are suitable for clinical needs should be formulated and training systematization and standardization must be promoted.",,850
1692,35968080,Priming seeds for the future: Plant immune memory and application in crop protection.,"Plants have evolved adaptive strategies to cope with pathogen infections that seriously threaten plant viability and crop productivity. Upon the perception of invading pathogens, the plant immune system is primed, establishing an immune memory that allows primed plants to respond more efficiently to the upcoming pathogen attacks. Physiological, transcriptional, metabolic, and epigenetic changes are induced during defense priming, which is essential to the establishment and maintenance of plant immune memory. As an environmental-friendly technique in crop protection, seed priming could effectively induce plant immune memory. In this review, we highlighted the recent advances in the establishment and maintenance mechanisms of plant defense priming and the immune memory associated, and discussed strategies and challenges in exploiting seed priming on crops to enhance disease resistance.",,851
1246,35971369,Comparison of Early Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Suture Fixation Versus Tack Fixation of Mesh in Laparoscopic Transabdominal Preperitoneal (TAPP) Repair of Inguinal Hernia.,"The advent of laparoscopic techniques in repairing inguinal hernia has significantly improved outcomes of inguinal hernia surgery. However, acute and chronic postoperative pain after fixation of mesh with tacks and the cost of tacking devices are major hindrances to the widespread use of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair in resource-poor settings. This study sought to introduce a method of mesh fixation that will reduce the cost of laparoscopic TAPP repair and might help reduce postoperative pain. To compare outcomes in the early postoperative period like pain, seroma, hematoma, urinary retention, and neuralgia after fixation with suture versus the tack fixation of mesh in laparoscopic TAPP repair of inguinal hernia.  Subjects and methods: This study was conducted from 1st June 2019 to 31st May 2020. A total of 144 patients between ages 18 and 60 years with an inguinal hernia on any side and having an American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score of I/II were included in this study. Patients with a recurrent hernia, large scrotal hernia, strangulated and obstructed hernias, ASA III and ASA IV, prostatism, and chronic cough were excluded. Seventy-two patients were in Group A (tack fixation group) while 72 were in Group B (suture fixation group). Separate investigators were assigned to collect pre-operative and post-operative data from both groups, recorded on specially designed proforma.  The age range was 18 to 60 years with a mean age of 46.53 years ±10.01 S.D in Group A and 46.19 ±9.58 S.D in Group B. In Group A 98.6% of patients were male, and 1.4% were females while in Group B 100% of patients were male. It was found that mean pain in Group A was 4.88 ±0.887 and 5.29± 0.777 at 6 hours and 24 hours respectively. Mean pain in group B was 3.43 ±0.962 and 4.11±0.703 at 6 hours and 24 hours respectively. Moreover, mean pain in Group B was significantly less than mean pain in Group A both at 6 hours and 24 hours intervals with a p-value < 0.001. The early postoperative complications were not significantly different in both groups.  Conclusion: In TAPP repair, suture fixation of mesh is less painful than tack fixation. However, there is no significant difference in the rate of other early postoperative outcomes like seroma, hematoma, urinary retention, and neuralgia. Further multicentric studies with a longer duration of follow-up are needed to validate our results.",,852
1642,35968133,Limiting resource and leaf functional traits jointly determine distribution patterns of leaf intrinsic water use efficiency along aridity gradients.,"Intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) is a critical eco-physiological function allowing plants to adapt to water- and nutrient-limited habitats in arid and semi-arid regions. However, the distribution of iWUE in coexisting species along aridity gradients and its controlling factors are unknown. We established two transects along an aridity gradient in the grasslands of Losses Plateau (LP) and Inner Mongolia Plateau (MP) to elucidate the patterns and underlying mechanisms of iWUE distribution in coexisting species along aridity gradient. We determined leaf carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) stable isotopes, functional traits related to carbon fixation, and limiting resources. Bulk leaf δ13C and δ18O were used as proxies for time-integrated iWUE and stomatal conductance (gs) during the growing season. Our results showed that variability in iWUE within transect was primarily controlled by species, sampling sites and an interactive effect between species and sampling sites. Mean values of iWUE (iWUEMean) increased and coefficient of variation (CV) in iWUE (iWUECV) decreased with an increase in aridity, demonstrating that increases in aridity lead to conservative and convergent water use strategies. Patterns of iWUEMean and iWUECV were controlled primarily by the ratio of soil organic carbon to total nitrogen in LP and soil moisture in MP. This revealed that the most limited resource drove the distribution patterns of iWUE along aridity gradients. Interspecific variation in iWUE within transect was positively correlated with Δ18O, indicating that interspecific variation in iWUE was primarily regulated by gs. Furthermore, relationship between iWUE and multi-dimensional functional trait spectrum indicated that species evolved species-specific strategies to adapt to a harsh habitat by partitioning limiting resources. Overall, these findings highlighted the interactive effects of limiting resources and leaf functional traits on plant adaptation strategies for iWUE, and emphasized the importance of considering biological processes in dissecting the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation strategies at large regional scales.",,853
1822,35967818,Cardiovascular risk among 6-8-year-old children living in urban and rural communities in Ecuador: A cross-sectional analysis.,"Cardiovascular diseases have their origins in childhood. At least 20% of children and adolescents in Latin America are overweight or obese. However, little is known regarding the cardiovascular risk of young children living in the region. This paper aims to identify associations between socio-demographics, adiposity, and dietary intake with cardiometabolic risk among children between 6- and 8-years old living in urban and rural Andean regions of Ecuador. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 267 children attending elementary schools between February and August 2018. Sociodemographic data were collected using a structured interview. Bodyweight, height, and waist circumference were measured in duplicate; blood samples were taken after overnight fasting to determine blood lipids, hepatic enzymes, and adipokines; food intake data was assessed by two 24-h recalls administered to the guardians. Associations between cardiometabolic risk (i.e., blood lipids, hepatic enzymes, and adipokines) with sociodemographic characteristics, dietary intake, and waist circumference were tested using multiple hierarchical regression models. Twenty-nine percent of the children were overweight or obese, 12% had low HDL levels, and over 18% had high levels of LDL and triglycerides. Children living in the urban region had lower levels of HDL (β-4.07 mg/dL; 95% CI: -7.00; -1.15; P = 0.007) but higher levels of LDL cholesterol (β 8.52 mg/dL; 95% CI: 1.38; 15.66; P = 0.019). Hepatic enzymes were also higher among urban children (SGOT: β% 22.13; 95% CI: 17.33; 26.93; P < 0.001; SGPT: β 0.84 U/L; 95% CI: 0.09; 1.59; P = 0.028). Leptin blood levels were higher (β% 29.27; 95% CI: 3.57; 54.97; P = 0.026), meanwhile adiponectin plasma concentrations were lower among urban children (β%-103.24; 95% CI: -58.9; -147.58; P = < 0.001). Fiber intake was inversely associated with total cholesterol (β-9.27 mg/dL; 95% CI -18.09; -0.45; P = 0.040) and LDL cholesterol blood levels (β-9.99 mg/dL; 95% CI: -18.22; -1.75; P = 0.018). Our findings demonstrate that young children are at high cardiovascular risk; if no actions are taken, the burden of non-communicable diseases will be substantial. The differences in risk between rural and urban areas are evident; urbanization might predispose children to a different reality and, in most cases, result in poor habits.",,854
973,35974646,Spectral fingerprints of nonequilibrium dynamics: The case of a Brownian gyrator.,"The same system can exhibit a completely different dynamical behavior when it evolves in equilibrium conditions or when it is driven out-of-equilibrium by, e.g., connecting some of its components to heat baths kept at different temperatures. Here we concentrate on an analytically solvable and experimentally relevant model of such a system-the so-called Brownian gyrator-a two-dimensional nanomachine that performs a systematic, on average, rotation around the origin under nonequilibrium conditions, while no net rotation takes place under equilibrium ones. On this example, we discuss a question whether it is possible to distinguish between two types of a behavior judging not upon the statistical properties of the trajectories of components but rather upon their respective spectral densities. The latter are widely used to characterize diverse dynamical systems and are routinely calculated from the data using standard built-in packages. From such a perspective, we inquire whether the power spectral densities possess some fingerprint properties specific to the behavior in nonequilibrium. We show that indeed one can conclusively distinguish between equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamics by analyzing the cross-correlations between the spectral densities of both components in the short frequency limit, or from the spectral densities of both components evaluated at zero frequency. Our analytical predictions, corroborated by experimental and numerical results, open a new direction for the analysis of a nonequilibrium dynamics.",,855
1293,35970683,Health care organization and use of technological devices in people with diabetes in Italy: Results from a survey of the Working Group on Diabetes and Technology.,"The use of technology offers recognized benefits to persons with diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the organization of healthcare facilities, the composition of the diabetes team, and the use of Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) in Italy. Diabetes care centers were asked to complete a web survey based on information collected in 2018. Sixty-one pediatric and 243 adult centers participated in the survey, accounting for 507,386 patients, mostly with type 2 diabetes (86.4%). Fifty-three percent of pediatric centers and 11% of adult centers reported a team composed of diabetologists, nurses, and psychologists. Overall, 13,204 patients (2.6%) were using CSII (95% with type 1 diabetes), and 28,936 (5.7%), were using CGM (74% with type 1 diabetes). When stratifying for the type of diabetes, 24% and 40.8% of patients with type 1 were using CSII and CGM, respectively, whereas low use of technology was reported for patients with type 2 and women with gestational diabetes. The percentage of adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes on CSII and CGM was respectively 21% and 32%, and 35% and 57%. The spread of CGM and CSII increased in Italy between 2013 and 2018. However, the percentage of users is still lower than what is expected based on clinical indications for use of technology. The inadequate number of professionals in the diabetes care team and insufficient economic resources are relevant barriers to disseminating technology for diabetes management.",,856
1142,35973824,Delayed diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture after blunt chest trauma - 2 case reports.,"Diaphragmatic rupture is a rare but life-threatening condition that occurs in 0.85% of surgically managed thoracoabdominal injuries. In most cases, the condition is accompanied by associated traumas responsible for poor prognosis. Signs of diaphragmatic rupture are often masked by more serious manifestations of the associated trauma. The rupture is usually revealed by an X-ray of the chest or CT scan. However, a minor defect may be missed, especially if the patient is not indicated for urgent surgery. The authors present 2 case reports of patients treated for chronic diaphragmatic rupture at the Department of Surgery of the Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital in Pilsen between 01 January 2009 and 31 December 2021. The aim was to analyze the clinical data and to compare this data with literature. Both patients with the chronic diaphragmatic rupture were men in their productive age. The mechanism of their primary trauma was a traffic accident. In the first case, the rupture was diagnosed 6 years after the trauma. The second case was diagnosed 14 years after the primary trauma. The diaphragmatic rupture was present on the left side in the first case and on the right in the other. Both patients underwent suture of the diaphragmatic defect via thoracotomy. Unrecognized diaphragmatic rupture is a severe condition that can result in a life-threatening complication, namely incarceration of abdominal organs dislocated to the chest. It is necessary to keep this diagnosis in mind in patients with gastrointestinal or respiratory problems after a previous high-energy, blunt-force abdominal and thoracic injury, even many years after the trauma.",,857
2331,35967046,Exploring the Cobalt-Histidine Complex for Wide-Ranging Colorimetric O2 Detection.,"Developing a robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly sensor for monitoring molecular oxygen (O2) ranging from a minute to a medically relevant level (85-100%) in a stream of flowing breathable gas is vital in various industrial domains. Here, we report an innovative application of the cobalt(l-histidine)2 complex, a bioinspired model of O2-carrying metalloproteins, for rapid and reliable sensing of O2 from 0 to 100% saturation levels under realistic conditions. We have established two distinct colorimetric O2 detection techniques, which can be executed with the use of a common smartphone camera and readily available color-detecting software. A series of spectroscopic experiments were performed to demonstrate the molecular-level alteration in cobalt(l-histidine)2 following its exposure to oxygen, leading to an exclusive pink-to-brown color change. Therefore, this study establishes a template for designing bioinspired molecular complexes for O2 sensing, leading to practical and straightforward solutions. This metal-amino acid complex's broad-spectrum sensing of O2 has widened the scope of bioinspired model complexes for divergent applications in industrial sectors.",,858

Using data from the 2016 China Labor Force Dynamic Survey (CLDS), we explore the influence of farming experience on urban residents' entrepreneurial decisions at the theoretical and empirical levels. A Probit model with instrumental variables method was used to analyze the influence of farming experience on urban residents' entrepreneurial decisions, while a mediating effect model was used to test its channels of action. The results show that: (1) farming experience can contribute to the entrepreneurial decision of urban residents relative to those without experience in farming. To overcome possible endogeneity issues, an Eprobit model based on the estimation of instrumental variables was used for testing. (2) Heterogeneity tests based on age, city type, and physical capital found that this effect was more significant in urban residents with non-capital cities, middle-aged groups, and high-material capital. (3) Farming experience indirectly drives entrepreneurial decisions through the mediating role of promoting positive personality traits, such as optimism and mutual aid consciousness. Therefore, the farming experience has a positive effect on urban residents' entrepreneurial decisions and helps to understand the deeper influence of micro-individual characteristics on entrepreneurial decisions in the urbanization process.",,859
377,35979297,Arteriovenous thrombotic events in a patient with advanced lung cancer following bevacizumab plus chemotherapy: A case report.,"In driver gene-negative non-small cell lung cancer patients who relapse following radical resection, combination chemotherapy using bevacizumab and platinum-based dual drugs is known to increase both progression-free and overall survival. Treatment initially includes bevacizumab, and if patients are able to tolerate it, bevacizumab can continue to be utilized until disease progression. Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal neutralizing antibody that acts against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Various anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can increase the risk of arterial thromboembolism. Current data indicate that VEGF-targeted treatment does not significantly increase the risk of venous thromboembolism events, except for bevacizumab. A 55-year-old man underwent radical resection for cancer of the right lung. Six months following surgery, multiple metastases were observed in his left lung. Subsequently, six cycles of bevacizumab combined with pemetrexed/carboplatin chemotherapy was given. Efficacy evaluation continued to be partial relief according to RECIST 1.1 standards, and no noticeable adverse reactions were noted. After three cycles of maintenance therapy using a combination of bevacizumab and pemetrexed, the patient developed dizziness and dyspnea. The patient was diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction and pulmonary embolism following head magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography (CT) angiography, and chest enhanced CT. Although the patient received low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulation and other treatment, the patient eventually died of respiratory failure 1 mo later. This case report may offer some insight into fatal arteriovenous embolism, which has not been previously reported. Bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy may also increase the risk of arteriovenous thromboembolism. Accordingly, patients who receive angiogenesis inhibitor therapy should be carefully selected. Furthermore, close monitoring and timely intervention are necessary in order to reduce the risk of such toxicities.",,860
1825,35967815,Transitioning to sustainable healthy diets: A model-based and conceptual system thinking approach to optimized sustainable diet concepts in the United States.,"Food production and consumption are essential in human existence, yet they are implicated in the high occurrences of preventable chronic diseases and environmental degradation. Although healthy food may not necessarily be sustainable and vice versa, there is an opportunity to make our food both healthy and sustainable. Attempts have been made to conceptualize how sustainable healthy food may be produced and consumed; however, available data suggest a rise in the prevalence of health-related and negative environmental consequences of our food supply. Thus, the transition from conceptual frameworks to implementing these concepts has not always been effective. This paper explores the relative environmental and health risks associated with highly consumed food groups and develops a methodological workflow for evaluating the sustainability of diet concepts in the context of different health, socio-economic and environmental indicators. In addition, we apply the multi-criteria decision-making techniques (an integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process- Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (AHP-TOPSIS) model) to examine the health and environmental impact of selected sustainable healthy diet concepts implemented in the United States. The principal findings indicate that adopting plant-based diet patterns would benefit the environment and the population's health. However, the up-scale, broad adoption and implementation of these concepts are hindered by critical bottlenecks. Hence we propose potential modification strategies through a conceptual system thinking approach to deliver optimized sustainable diet concepts to aid in the realization of the anticipated benefits of adoption/implementation.",,861
1131,35973899,Morphology of the Lisfranc Joint Complex.,"Lisfranc injuries are complicated injuries of the tarsometatarsal joint with high rates of sequelae. Both anatomy and injury of the Lisfranc joint are variably documented. Descriptions of these injuries and their associated structures vary greatly. The most injured structures are those of the Lisfranc joint complex, which involves the medial cuneiform, second and third metatarsals, and the dorsal, interosseous, and plantar Lisfranc ligaments. This study sought to examine morphology of the Lisfranc joint in cadavers. Twenty-two embalmed cadaveric feet were dissected (13 male, 9 female, 80.3 years ± 14.03) to isolate the bones and ligaments of the Lisfranc joint complex. The dorsal, interosseous, and plantar Lisfranc ligaments were present in each specimen. Each ligament was measured and morphology noted. The dissected dorsal Lisfranc ligament had consistent morphology (mean = 10.8 mm ± 1.79). The interosseous Lisfranc ligament had a consistent path, but 11/17 of specimens possessed a connection to the plantar Lisfranc ligament. The plantar Lisfranc ligament demonstrated wide variability with a Y-variant (n = 3) and a fan-shaped variant (n = 14). Ligament thickness was greatest in the interosseous Lisfranc ligament (mean = 13.74 ± 3.08) and least in the dorsal Lisfranc ligament (mean = 1.36 ± 0.42). While the objective of defining joint and ligament morphology was achieved, further questions were raised. Variations of the interosseous and plantar Lisfranc ligament may play a role in susceptibility to joint injury, and arthritic changes to the joints examined raise questions regarding the prevalence of arthritis in the uninjured Lisfranc joint.",,862
117,35983315,RAIRS Characterization of CO and O Coadsorption on Cu(111).,"In a study preliminary to investigating CO2 dissociation, we report our results on oxygen and carbon monoxide coadsorption on Cu(111). We use reflection adsorption infrared spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy to characterize and quantify adsorbed species. On clean Cu(111), the CO internal stretch mode appears initially at 2077 cm-1 for a surface temperature of ∼80 K. We accurately reproduce the previously determined redshift of the absorption band with increasing CO coverage. We subsequently oxidize the surface by exposure to O2 at 300 K to ensure O2 dissociation. The band's frequency and line shape of subsequently adsorbed CO at ∼80 K are not affected. However, the maximum absorbance and integrated peak intensities drop with increasing O coverage. The data suggest that CO is not adsorbed near O, likely as a consequence of the mechanism of Cu(111) surface oxidation by O2 at 300 K. We discuss whether our RAIRS results may be used to quantify CO2 dissociation in the zero-coverage limit.",,863
1761,35967963,Single-Port Cholecystectomy for Cholecystitis Versus Non-Cholecystitis.,"To assess the safety and efficacy of single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SPLC) for the treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis in different gallbladder pathologic conditions. All patients who underwent SPLC in our department between October 1, 2017 and March 31, 2020 were registered consecutively in a prospective database. Patients' charts were retrospectively divided according to histological diagnosis: normal gallbladder (NG) (n = 13), chronic cholecystitis (CC) (n =47), and acute cholecystitis (AC) (n = 10). The parameters for assessing the procedure outcome included operative time, blood loss, use of additional trocars, conversion to laparotomy, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay. Patient groups were statistically compared. Seventy patients underwent SPLC. Duration of surgery increased from NG (55 ± 22.7 min) to CC (70 ± 33.5 min), and to AC patients (110.5 ± 50.5 min), which is statistically significant (P = .001). Postoperative complication rates were 7.6% in NG patients, 17% in CC, and 30% in AC (P = .442). Length of hospitalization was shorter for NG patients (1.0 ± 0.6 days) versus CC (2.0 ± 1.1 days) and AC patients (2.0 ± 4.7 days), with statistical significance (P = .020). Multivariate analysis found that pathology type and the occurrence of postoperative complications were independent predictors for prolonged operative times and prolonged hospital stay, respectively. SPLC is feasible for acute and chronic cholecystitis with good procedural outcomes. Since SPLC technique itself can be sometimes challenging with the existing technology, its application, especially in cases of acute cholecystitis, should be done with caution. Only prospective randomized studies on this approach for acute and chronic gallbladder diseases will assess the complete reliability of this technique.",,864
1424,35968476,"Perceived Stress, Resilience, and Wellbeing in Seasoned Isha Yoga Practitioners Compared to Matched Controls During the COVID-19 Pandemic.","Yoga practices, including breathing, meditation, and posture protocols (asanas), have been shown to facilitate physical and mental wellbeing. Seasoned yoga practitioners were recruited from the Isha Foundation. Recruitment of the comparison group was achieved using snowball sampling and were not yoga practitioners. Participants in the non-yoga group were randomized to a 3-min Isha practice or a comparator group asked to perform 15-min of daily reading. Participants completed a series of web-based surveys (REDCap) at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks. These surveys include validated scales and objective questions on COVID-19 infection and medical history. The validated questionnaires assess for: perceived stress (PSS), mood states [anxiety and depression (PHQ-4), joy (DPES-Joy subscale)], mindfulness attention and awareness (MAAS), resilience (BRS), mental wellbeing (WEMWBS) and recovery from traumatic event (PTGI). Weekly activity diaries were employed as a tool for collecting compliance information from study participants. Perceived stress scale scores were identified as primary outcome for this study. The median Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score for the yoga practitioners compared to the active and placebo comparators was significantly lower at all time-points: baseline: 11 [IQR 7-15] vs. 16 [IQR 12-21] in both the active and placebo comparators (p < 0.0001); 6 weeks: 9 [IQR 6-13] vs. 12 [IQR 8-17] in the active comparator and 14 [IQR 9-18] in the placebo comparator (p < 0.0001); and 12 weeks: 9 [IQR 5-13] vs. 11.5 [IQR 8-16] in the active comparators and 13 [IQR 8-17] in the placebo comparator (p < 0.0001). Among the randomized participants that were compliant for the full 12 weeks, the active comparators had significantly lower median PSS scores than the placebo comparators 12 weeks [10 (IQR 5-14) vs. 13 (IQR 8-17), p = 0.017]. Further, yoga practitioners had significantly lower anxiety at all three-time points (p < 0.0001), lower depression at baseline and 6 weeks (p < 0.0003), and significantly higher wellbeing (p < 0.0001) and joy (p < 0.0001) at all three-time points, compared to the active and placebo comparator groups. The lower levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and higher level of wellbeing and joy seen in the yoga practitioners compared to the active and placebo comparators illustrate the impact of regular yoga practices on mental health even during the pandemic.

1735,35968007,Case report: Use of penicillin G potassium in poloxamer 407 gel to aid in healing of an equine sublingual abscess.,"The use of poloxamer 407 gels have been reported in several studies to prolong the release of drugs at the injection site. Oral lesions unrelated to dental disease are rare but may result in ulceration and sequestration of bone. To date, there have been no reports on the use of penicillin G potassium poloxamer 407 gel and its effect on wound healing. The present case report describes the use of a penicillin G potassium poloxamer 407 gel for the treatment of a sublingual abscess involving the mandible in a 20 year old Arabian mare who initially presented with acute onset of dysphagia, hypersalivation, and a mass under the tongue. A presumptive diagnosis of lingual cellulitis was made, and a sublingual abscess ruptured on day 7 of hospitalization. In this case, poloxamer 407 gel was used to decrease wound contamination, protect the exposed mandible, and potentially prolong the release of penicillin G potassium into the wound.",,866
241,35982694,Glutathione and copper ions as critical factors of green plant regeneration efficiency of triticale in vitro anther culture.,"Plant tissue culture techniques are handy tools for obtaining unique plant materials that are difficult to propagate or important for agriculture. Homozygous materials derived through in vitro cultures are invaluable and significantly accelerate the evaluation of new varieties, e.g., cereals. The induction of somatic embryogenesis/androgenesis and the regeneration and its efficiency can be influenced by the external conditions of tissue culture, such as the ingredients present in the induction or regeneration media. We have developed an approach based on biological system, molecular markers, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, and structural equation modeling technique to establish links between changes in sequence and DNA methylation at specific symmetric (CG, CHG) and asymmetric (CHH) sequences, glutathione, and green plant regeneration efficiency in the presence of variable supplementation of induction medium with copper ions. The methylation-sensitive Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism was used to assess tissue culture-induced variation, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy to describe the glutathione spectrum, and a structural equation model to develop the relationship between sequence variation, de novo DNA methylation within asymmetric sequence contexts, and copper ions in the induction medium, as well as, glutathione, and green plant efficiency. An essential aspect of the study is demonstrating the contribution of glutathione to green plant regeneration efficiency and indicating the critical role of copper ions in influencing tissue culture-induced variation, glutathione, and obtaining green regenerants. The model presented here also has practical implications, showing that manipulating the concentration of copper ions in the induction medium may influence cell function and increases green plant regeneration efficiency.",,867
1999,35967588,Copper acetate-facilitated transfer-free growth of high-quality graphene for hydrovoltaic generators.,"Direct synthesis of high-quality graphene on dielectric substrates without a transfer process is of vital importance for a variety of applications. Current strategies for boosting high-quality graphene growth, such as remote metal catalyzation, are limited by poor performance with respect to the release of metal catalysts and hence suffer from a problem with metal residues. Herein, we report an effective approach that utilizes a metal-containing species, copper acetate, to continuously supply copper clusters in a gaseous form to aid transfer-free growth of graphene over a wafer scale. The thus-derived graphene films were found to show reduced multilayer density and improved electrical performance and exhibited a carrier mobility of 8500 cm2 V-1 s-1. Furthermore, droplet-based hydrovoltaic electricity generator devices based on directly grown graphene were found to exhibit robust voltage output and long cyclic stability, in stark contrast to their counterparts based on transferred graphene, demonstrating the potential for emerging energy harvesting applications. The work presented here offers a promising solution to organize the metal catalytic booster toward transfer-free synthesis of high-quality graphene and enable smart energy generation.",,868
1477,35968420,Approaches related to the effects of Covid-19 pandemics on financing of the healthcare system in Romania.,"The healthcare financial system faced a significant disturbance of the budget balance after the outbreak of the pandemic, amid government measures to combat the disease. These measures have led to shifts in funding weights within the income and expenditure budget structure, with a focus on prevention and treatment of patients infected with SARS-COV 2. The purpose of this research is to analyse the financial balance of the healthcare system and the related modelling to support decision-makers in adopting and implementing appropriate financing measures for the pandemic. The working hypotheses of this study were tested using an econometric linear regression model based on the financing budgetary function, which matches funding to the specific need for each expenditure heading. SPSS 25 statistical software was used to define the model and to test the homogeneity of the data and their statistical relevance to the phenomenon under analysis. The proposed model showed that there is a significant correlation of the dependent variable, Dynamics of budget revenues in the healthcare sector (TIM), with the regressors. We believe that a problem-solving rebalancing of allocations could help to eliminate the synergy in health. This redistribution should take into account the impact that economic and budgetary factors have on healthcare factors and vice versa, so that at some point after successive adjustments the minimum distance between forecast and realisation or between need and financing of need can be reached. The used data were analysed dynamically to assess changes in trend as absolute data do not allow the construction of an overall picture. Relative data captures changes in financing from year to year and can be linked to events such as pandemics, financial crises or inflation. In relation to the objectives of the research, it emerges that, under the impact of pandemic stress, measures to improve healthcare management, increase performance and streamline financial allocation are vulnerable and cannot counteract the effects that the pandemic has on the healthcare of the population as reflected in the morbidity and mortality indicators collected during the pandemic. In this regard, it is necessary a rethinking of the strategic healthcare management, a better planning of the procurement of medicines and healthcare supplies, a rethinking of the partnerships with the European Commission and other global entities. This approach can effectively improve the impact of the pandemic on the healthcare status of the population, a rebalancing of the demand-supply balance in healthcare and a maintenance of the strategic programmes, according to the objectives assumed in the planning, given that these programmes protect categories of people already medically affected.",,869
1273,35971342,Assessment of SARS-CoV-2-Infected Patients and Their Clinical Outcomes During the Third Wave in India: A Single-Center Observational Study.,"Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged from the Chinese mainland has spread throughout the world affecting the normal lives of the people. Both developed and developing nations have been equally affected and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) resulted in the death of millions of people worldwide. The virus is undergoing mutations and is evolving into variants that are responsible for wave after wave. This study was carried out to assess the clinical outcomes of people infected with the novel virus during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Methods The study was carried out between November 2021 and January 2022 and included 100 consecutive patients attending the hospital attached to the BLDE (Deemed to be University) Shri B.M. Patil Medical College, Bijapur, Karnataka, South India. All patients included in the study returned a positive report in a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patient details collected included age, sex, cycle threshold (Ct) values for envelope (E)/nucleocapsid (N), and Orf1b (open reading frame 1b) genes, hospitalization status, vaccine status, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and final clinical outcome. The data were entered into Microsoft Office Excel sheets, and statistical inferences were drawn using SPSS 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Of the 100 patients included in the study, only 14 (14%) patients were vaccinated. The patient's mean age was 34.22±17.50. Among the vaccinated patients, the majority had taken COVISHIELD™ (85.71%) compared to COVAXIN® (14.29%). Only 14% of patients were symptomatic, and the mean Ct values among all the patients were 29.92±3.74 (E gene/N gene) and 27.6±4.78 (Orf1B gene). Eight (8%) patients were hospitalized, and all the patients recovered from the infection. Among the hospitalized patients, six (75%) were vaccinated. The mean age of the hospitalized patients was 43.8±14.25 years. The mean CRP, D-dimer, and IL-6 concentrations among the hospitalized patients were noted to be 22.375±16.58 mg/L, 654.325±577.24 ng/mL, and 5.075±2.15 ng/mL, respectively. Conclusion The study results demonstrate that despite unvaccinated status, most patients in the third wave had only suffered from asymptomatic infection. Moreover, people who developed a clinical infection and those who required hospitalization had an uneventful recovery irrespective of their vaccination status.",,870
53,35983512,Sexual dimorphism through androgen signaling; from external genitalia to muscles.,"Sexual dimorphisms can be seen in many organisms with some exhibiting subtle differences while some can be very evident. The difference between male and female can be seen on the morphological level such as discrepancies in body mass, presence of body hair in distinct places, or through the presence of specific reproductive structures. It is known that the development of the reproductive structures is governed by hormone signaling, most commonly explained through the actions of androgen signaling. The developmental program of the male and female external genitalia involves a common anlage, the genital tubercle or GT, that later on develop into a penis and clitoris, respectively. Androgen signaling involvement can be seen in the different tissues in the GT that express Androgen receptor and the different genes that are regulated by androgen in the mesenchyme and endoderm component of the GT. Muscles are also known to be responsive to androgen signaling with male and female muscles exhibiting different capabilities. However, the occurrence of sexual dimorphism in muscle development is unclear. In this minireview, a summary on the role of androgen in the sexually dimorphic development of the genital tubercle was provided. This was used as a framework on analyzing the different mechanism employed by androgen signaling to regulate the sexual dimorphism in muscle development.",,871
1031,35974588,Nonequilibrium phase transitions of a nematic liquid crystal under ac field-driven electroconvection.,"We report on phase transitions between isotropic and nematic liquid crystal phases in nonequilibrium systems (NESs). ac field-driven electroconvection (EC) provides an NES, which can be well controlled by the voltage V and frequency f; it arises electrohydrodynamically at a threshold voltage V_{c}. In continuous cooling and heating processes with various rates R, the critical temperature T_{c} was determined at a critical time t_{c} for phase transitions. Moreover, the morphological and dynamical features in the phase transitions were examined using an electro-optical image processing method. In comparison with an equilibrium system (V=0), two typical turbulent ECs (i.e., NESs), which are called dynamic scattering mode 1 (DSM1 for V>V_{c}) and DSM2 (for V≫V_{c}), were examined to understand the nonequilibrium phase transitions. In particular, our results show that in high voltage-induced turbulence (i.e., DSM2), T_{c} can be determined effectively without considering R; this provides a possibility for a material technology application in nonequilibrium-based circumstances.",,872
1687,35968085,Responses of photosynthetic characteristics of oat flag leaf and spike to drought stress.,"Raising crops production via improving photosynthesis has always been focused. Recently excavating and increasing the photosynthetic capacity of non-leaf organs becomes an important approach to crops yield increase. Here we studied the photosynthetic characteristics of the flag leaf and the non-leaf organs including the sheath, the glume and the lemma under greenhouse. The relative water content (RWC), the stomatal characteristics, the photosynthetic pigment contents, the enzyme activities in C3 and C4 pathway and the malate content of the flag leaf and the non-leaf organs on 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after anthesis (denoted by 7DAA, 14DAA, 21DAA, and 28DAA) were determined under well-watered (CK) and water-stressed (D) treatments. Drought stress significantly reduced the RWC of the flag leaf and the non-leaf organs, while the variation of RWC in the glume and the lemma was lower than in the flag leaf. The chlorophyll a content, the chlorophyll b content, the total chlorophyll content and the xanthophyll content in the flag leaf were significantly decreased under D. However, drought stress significantly increased the photosynthetic pigment contents in the glume at the late stage (21DAA and 28DAA). In addition, the induced activities of PEPC, NADP-MDH, NADP-ME, NAD-ME, and PPDK in non-leaf organs under drought stress suggested that the C4 photosynthetic pathway in non-leaf organs compensated the limited C3 photosynthesis in the flag leaf. Non-leaf organs, in particular the glume, showed the crucial function in maintaining the stable photosynthetic performance of oat.",,873
958,35974721,A semi-supervised deep-learning approach for automatic crystal structure classification.,"The structural solution problem can be a daunting and time-consuming task. Especially in the presence of impurity phases, current methods, such as indexing, become more unstable. In this work, the novel approach of semi-supervised learning is applied towards the problem of identifying the Bravais lattice and the space group of inorganic crystals. The reported semi-supervised generative deep-learning model can train on both labeled data, i.e. diffraction patterns with the associated crystal structure, and unlabeled data, i.e. diffraction patterns that lack this information. This approach allows the models to take advantage of the troves of unlabeled data that current supervised learning approaches cannot, which should result in models that can more accurately generalize to real data. In this work, powder diffraction patterns are classified into all 14 Bravais lattices and 144 space groups (the number is limited due to sparse coverage in crystal structure databases), which covers more crystal classes than other studies. The reported models also outperform current deep-learning approaches for both space group and Bravais lattice classification using fewer training data.",,874
2054,35967520,Subjective Global Nutritional Assessment [SGNA] in Children on Chronic Dialysis- A Prospective Observational Study.,"Nutritional assessment in children undergoing chronic dialysis is challenging as no single objective reference tool is available. There is a need to explore the application of the subjective global nutritional assessment (SGNA) tool in these children. This study assessed the nutritional status of children on chronic dialysis using SGNA, evaluated the utility of SGNA parameters in the longitudinal assessment of nutrition, and compared the SGNA tool with other nutritional measures. Children 2-18 years of age on chronic dialysis for at least 1 month were prospectively studied over a period of 18 months with two follow-up visits at least 3 months apart. Malnutrition was diagnosed by SGNA (well-nourished, moderately, and severely malnourished), mid-arm circumference <5th centile for age and gender, and serum albumin <3.8 g/l at baseline and follow-up. In 41 children on dialysis (age: 124.8 ± 32 months), 73% had moderate or severe malnutrition by SGNA. Height for age (P = 0.008), weight for height (P = 0.004), dietary intake (P = 0.025) functional capacity (P = 0.001), loss of subcutaneous fat (P < 0.001), and muscle wasting (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with the presence and severity of malnutrition. SGNA showed a poor agreement with MUAC and serum albumin. On follow-up, there was no significant change in the category of nutritional status (P = 0.63) and no individual SGNA parameter was associated with the presence or severity of malnutrition. Two-thirds of the children on chronic dialysis were diagnosed with moderate to severe malnutrition by SGNA, while the majority remained in the same category of nutritional status on follow-up. Only half of the parameters used for assessment were strongly associated with the presence and severity of malnutrition. SGNA showed a poor agreement with objective nutritional measures and was not responsive in identifying a change in the nutritional status on follow-up.",,875
1722,35968022,Rapid detection of porcine circovirus type 4 via multienzyme isothermal rapid amplification.,"Porcine circovirus type 4 (PCV4) is a newly emerging pathogen that was first detected in 2019 and is associated with diverse clinical signs, including respiratory and gastrointestinal distress, dermatitis and various systemic inflammations. It was necessary to develop a sensitive and specific diagnostic method to detect PCV4 in clinical samples, so in this study, a multienzyme isothermal rapid amplification (MIRA) assay was developed for the rapid detection of PCV4 and evaluated for sensitivity, specificity and applicability. It was used to detect the conserved Cap gene of PCV4, operated at 41°C and completed in 20 min. With the screening of MIRA primer-probe combination, it could detect as low as 101 copies of PCV4 DNA per reaction and was highly specific, with no cross-reaction with other pathogens. Further assessment with clinical samples showed that the developed MIRA assay had good correlation with real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of PCV4. The developed MIRA assay will be a valuable tool for the detection of the novel PCV4 in clinical samples due to its high sensitivity and specificity, simplicity of operation and short testing time.",,876
346,35979328,Microbial nanocellulose biotextiles for a circular materials economy.,"The synthesis and bottom-up assembly of nanocellulose by microbes offers unique advantages to tune and meet key design criteria-rapid renewability, low toxicity, scalability, performance, and degradability-for multi-functional, circular economy textiles. However, development of green processing methods that meet these criteria remains a major research challenge. Here, we harness microbial biofabrication of nanocellulose and draw inspiration from ancient textile techniques to engineer sustainable biotextiles with a circular life cycle. The unique molecular self-organization of microbial nanocellulose (MC) combined with bio-phosphorylation with a lecithin treatment yields a compostable material with superior mechanical and flame-retardant properties. Specifically, treatment of MC with a lecithin-phosphocholine emulsion makes sites available to modulate cellulose cross-linking through hydroxyl, phosphate and methylene groups, increasing the interaction between cellulose chains. The resultant bioleather exhibits enhanced tensile strength and high ductility. Bio-phosphorylation with lecithin also redirects the combustion pathway from levoglucosan production towards the formation of foaming char as an insulating oxygen barrier, for outstanding flame retardance. Controlled color modulation is demonstrated with natural dyes. Life cycle impact assessment reveals that MC bioleather has up to an order of magnitude lower carbon footprint than conventional textiles, and a thousandfold reduction in the carcinogenic impact of leather production. Eliminating the use of hazardous substances, these high performance materials disrupt linear production models and strategically eliminate its toxicity and negative climate impacts, with widespread application in fashion, interiors and construction. Importantly, the biotextile approach developed in this study demonstrates the potential of biofabrication coupled with green chemistry for a circular materials economy.",,877
1397,35968620,Clinical outcomes and survival following treatment of bone metastases from uterine leiomyosarcoma: A report of 6 cases.,"This study aimed to analyze the patient-reported outcomes and survival following surgical treatment of bone metastases from (uLMS) uterine leiomyosarcoma. A retrospective review of six patients undergoing surgical procedures for metastatic uLMS over seven years was conducted at a single center. All patients were reviewed for their primary malignancy and characteristics of bone metastasis during follow-up. Clinical presentation of bone metastasis, modality, and the type of treatment related to musculoskeletal involvement were also analyzed. The visual analog pain scale (VAS) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status scale were used pre-and postoperatively to evaluate the patient-reported outcome. Four patients had solitary bone metastases, whereas multiple bone metastases were diagnosed in two. Of those who had solitary bone metastasis, all of them were treated with wide resection. One of the two patients with multiple bone metastases was also treated with wide resection, and the other was treated with intralesional curettage. Four patients died from primary disease, and two were alive without evidence of disease recurrence. The median survival time following a diagnosis of bone metastasis was 15.0 months (95% CI, 0.6 to 29.4 months). The mean VAS scores for all six patients improved. However, the improvement in ECOG performance status was seen in only four patients. Although the prognosis of uLMS patients with bone metastasis seems poor, wide resection of the solitary bone metastasis may help prolong the overall survival. Performing orthopedic surgeries for the bone metastasis from uLMS in case of intractable pain after palliative radiotherapy, impending or pathological fracture, or solitary disease has been shown to decrease the pain significantly and improve the performance status in the majority. Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",,878
1029,35974590,Determining the Kerr constant in optically isotropic liquid crystals.,"A new scheme is investigated for evaluating the temperature dependence and dispersion relation of the Kerr constant (K) of an optically isotropic medium in isotropic and blue phases (BPs) liquid crystals. The scheme employs the measurement of the component of the transmitted light intensity of double modulated frequency using the modified in-plane-switching cell geometry (based on metallic film electrodes). It overcomes to a large extent the problem of a nonuniform electric field, employs relatively small driving voltages, and allows K to be measured directly. It is shown that the dispersion relation based on the single-band birefringence model describes well both blue and isotropic liquid crystal phases. It is found that the experimental data indicate that the temperature-dependent coefficients in this relation have a simple linear form in the isotropic phase, which allows a general model for the temperature and wavelength dependence of the Kerr constant in the isotropic liquid crystal phase to be formulated. In the BPs the temperature dependence of the experimental data deviate from the simple linear trend, but follow well an inverse exponential form.",,879
1147,35973774,Bioactivity of mefentrifluconazole against different Fusarium spp.,"Emergence and development of resistance to 14α-demethylase inhibitors (DMIs) have become a critical issue in both agriculture and medical fields. Mefentrifluconazole, the first isopropanol triazole fungicide belonging to a new subclass of DMIs, has been proposed to show high activity, minimal adverse side effects, and inconsistent cross resistance with other DMIs due to its high structural flexibility. In this study, mefentrifluconazole showed disparate inhibitory activity against the mycelium growth of seven tested Fusarium species. The most sensitive species included F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. commuae, and F. fujikuroi, followed by F. equiseti and F. graminearum, while F. solani was most insensitive. Consistently, mefentrifluconazole presented the strongest inhibiting effects on conidium germination, cell membrane integrity, and ergosterol biosynthesis in F. fujikuroi, followed by F. graminearum, while F. solani ranked last. Further results indicated that all F. fujikuroi isolates causing rice bakanae disease (RBD) were sensitive to mefentrifluconazole regardless of their resistance to prochloraz, tebuconazole, carbendazim, and phenamacril. Additionally, the inoculation tests found that mefentrifluconazole presented a better protective efficacy on rice seedlings when applied 12 h before the F. fujikuroi inoculation, compared to applied 12 h post the inoculation. Overall, this study demonstrated the various bioactivity of mefentrifluconazole combating Fusarium spp. and put new insights into RBD management as well as the applications of DMIs.",,880
1059,35974560,Influence of particle shape and material on the acoustic radiation force and microstreaming in a standing wave.,"In view of its influence on the acoustic radiation force, we investigate the microstreaming around a small solid elastic particle in an ultrasonic standing wave in dependence of its material properties and shape. The configuration is axisymmetric, making it accessible to numerical methods, such as the finite element method. The results reveal a transition from viscous scattering- to microstreaming-dominated acoustic radiation force that depends on the particle density. When a deviation of the particle shape from a sphere becomes smaller than the viscous boundary layer thickness, we show that the influence of the shape on the viscous contributions to the acoustic radiation force diminishes, allowing the use of theoretical models for a spherical particle. However, extreme asymmetric shape perturbations, such as crowns with sharp edges, can give rise to noticeable viscous contributions for a dense particle that is larger than the viscous boundary layer thickness. We also introduce a hybrid analytical model for the acoustic radiation force on a spherical particle that accounts for the microstreaming and particle compressibility and shows a good agreement with numerical simulations for an arbitrary particle size and density.",,881
2136,35967382,Real-life data on monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs in Italian inborn errors of immunity patients during COVID-19 pandemic.,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with Inborn Errors of Immunity have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus showing a spectrum of disease ranging from asymptomatic to severe COVID-19. A fair number of patients did not respond adequately to SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, thus early therapeutic or prophylactic measures were needed to prevent severe or fatal course or COVID-19 and to reduce the burden of hospitalizations. Longitudinal, multicentric study on patients with Inborn Errors of Immunity immunized with mRNA vaccines treated with monoclonal antibodies and/or antiviral agents at the first infection and at reinfection by SARS-CoV-2. Analyses of efficacy were performed according to the different circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. The analysis of the cohort of 192 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, across 26 months, showed the efficacy of antivirals on the risk of hospitalization, while mabs offered a positive effect on hospitalization, and COVID-19 severity. This protection was consistent across the alpha, delta and early omicron waves, although the emergence of BA.2 reduced the effect of available mabs. Hospitalized patients treated with mabs and antivirals had a lower risk of ICU admission. We reported 16 re-infections with a length of SARS-CoV-2 positivity at second infection shorter among patients treated with mabs. Treatment with antivirals and mabs was safe. The widespread use of specific therapy, vaccination and better access to care might have contributed to mitigate risk of mortality, hospital admission, and severe disease. However, the rapid spread of new viral strains underlines that mabs and antiviral beneficial effects should be re- evaluated over time.",,882

Herein, we report the deuterium (d12) congeners of tetramethyl(silicon)rhodamine, obtained by isotopic labelling of the four methyl groups, show improved photophysical parameters (i.e. brightness, lifetimes) and reduced chemical bleaching. We explore this finding for SNAP- and Halo-tag labelling in live cells, and highlight enhanced properties in several applications, such as fluorescence activated cell sorting, fluorescence lifetime microscopy, stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy and single-molecule Förster-resonance energy transfer. We finally extend this idea to other dye families and envision deuteration as a generalizable concept to improve existing and to develop new chemical biology probes.",,883
376,35979298,Sustained dialysis with misplaced peritoneal dialysis catheter outside peritoneum: A case report.,"In patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), catheter dysfunction is a common complication. A misplaced catheter is one of the reasons contributing to its dysfunction. The present study aimed to describe a case of misplaced PD catheter with an unusual location of the catheter tip. A 61-year-old man undergoing PD for 4 years was investigated for progressive nausea and fatigue of 3 mo. Dialysis adequacy studies indicated inefficient dialysis. Imaging discovered that the PD catheter tip was mispositioned in the pelvic cavity with its tip outside the peritoneal cavity. Despite the dialysate accumulating outside the peritoneal cavity, the patient had not developed perineal or scrotal edema. The patient had experienced a sustainable prolonged dialysis efficacy in this case until the renal function deteriorated further in view of the poor dialysis outcome and worsening health condition. The patient was subsequently transitioned to hemodialysis. Proper placement of the catheter in the peritoneal cavity should always be confirmed and re-checked when necessary in patients undergoing PD to ensure dialytic adequacy.",,884

This study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practice of 483 people with diabetes with regard to the prevention of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Data were collected using a valid and reliable questionnaire, and logistic regression was carried out to predict the effect of statistically significant independent variables on the scores of dependent variables. A significant association was found between knowledge and attitude about DFU prevention. Individuals who were unmarried were more likely to have higher knowledge scores than those who were married, and those who had university and secondary education were more likely to have higher attitude and practice scores than other groups.

1022,35974597,Anomalous elasticity in classical glass formers.,"Amorphous solids under mechanical strains are prone to plastic responses. Recent work showed that in amorphous granular systems these plastic events, that are typically quadrupolar in nature, can screen the elastic response. When the density of the quadrupoles is high, the gradients of the quadrupole field act as emergent dipole sources, leading to qualitative changes in the mechanical response, as seen for example in the displacement field. In this paper we examine the effect of screening in classical glass formers. These are made of point particles that interact via binary forces. Both inverse power law forces and Lennard-Jones interactions are examined, and it is shown that in both cases the elastic response can be strongly screened, in agreement with the novel theory. The degree of deviation from classical elasticity theory is parametrized by a proposed measure that is shown to have a functional dependence on the amount of energy lost to plastic responses.",,886
2108,35967410,Progressive Host-Directed Strategies to Potentiate BCG Vaccination Against Tuberculosis.,"The pursuit to improve the TB control program comprising one approved vaccine, M. bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has directed researchers to explore progressive approaches to halt the eternal TB pandemic. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) was first identified as the causative agent of TB in 1882 by Dr. Robert Koch. However, TB has plagued living beings since ancient times and continues to endure as an eternal scourge ravaging even with existing chemoprophylaxis and preventive therapy. We have scientifically come a long way since then, but despite accessibility to the standard antimycobacterial antibiotics and prophylactic vaccine, almost one-fourth of humankind is infected latently with M.tb. Existing therapeutics fail to control TB, due to the upsurge of drug-resistant strains and increasing incidents of co-infections in immune-compromised individuals. Unresponsiveness to established antibiotics leaves patients with no therapeutic possibilities. Hence the search for an efficacious TB immunization strategy is a global health priority. Researchers are paving the course for efficient vaccination strategies with the radically advanced operation of core principles of protective immune responses against M.tb. In this review; we have reassessed the progression of the TB vaccination program comprising BCG immunization in children and potential stratagems to reinforce BCG-induced protection in adults.",,887
1867,35967773,Improving bioaccessibility and physicochemical property of blue-grained wholemeal flour by steam explosion.,"Whole grain contains many health-promoting ingredients, but due to its poor bioaccessibility and processibility, it is not widely accepted by consumers. The steam explosion was exploited to modify the nutritional bioaccessibility and the physicochemical properties of wholemeal flour in this study. In vitro starch digestibility, in vitro protein digestibility of wholemeal flour, total flavonoids content, and total phenolics content of digestive juice were used to evaluate the bioaccessibility, and a significant variation (p < 0.05) was noted. Results showed that steam explosion enhanced the gastric protein digestibility ranged from 5.67 to 6.92% and the intestinal protein digestibility ranged from 16.77 to 49.12%. Steam-exploded wholemeal flour (0.5 MPa, 5 min) had the highest protein digestibility and rapidly digestible starch content. Compared with native flour, steam explosion (0.5 MPa, 5 min) contributed to a 0.72-fold and 0.33-fold increment of total flavonoids content and total phenolics content in digestible juice. Chemical changes of wholemeal flour, induced by steam explosion, caused the changes in the solvent retention capacity, rheological property of wholemeal flour, and altered the falling number (and liquefaction number). An increasing tendency to solid-like behavior and the gel strength of wholemeal flour was significantly enhanced by the steam explosion at 0.5 MPa for 5 min, while the gluten was not weakened. This study indicated that steam-exploded wholemeal flour (0.5 MPa, 5 min) could serve as a potential ingredient with the noticeable bioaccessibility and physicochemical properties in cereal products.",,888
2269,35967162,The Role of Leptin in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Is It Still a Mystery?,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory connective tissue disease with varying clinical manifestations. Recent studies have proposed that leptin may be related to SLE development. This study aims to assess current information regarding the relationship between leptin and SLE. A systematic search was done using PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Epistemonikos, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies published in the English language in the last 10 years were selected based on predefined eligibility criteria. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 tool. A total of 12 studies were included in this systematic review. These included systematic reviews/meta-analyses, cross-sectional studies, and case-control studies. Based on the findings of this review, we conclude thatleptin is significantly elevated in SLE patients; however, it does not seem to correlate with disease activity. The exact mechanism of leptin in the pathogenesis of the disease remains unknown and further research is needed regarding this aspect.",,889
710,35975221,Meloidogyne Incognita Management using Fumigant and Non-fumigant Nematicides on Sweet Potato.,"Southern root-knot nematode (SRKN, Meloidogyne incognita) is a major pest of sweet potato, and nematicides are needed to manage this nematode. The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of fluazaindolizine, a new non-fumigant nematicide, in comparison with the fumigant nematicide 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) and non-fumigant nematicides fluopyram and oxamyl for (1) SRKN management, (2) impacts on free-living nematodes, and (3) sweet potato yield in field trials. Among all nematicides, 1,3-D at 84 kg/ha most consistently (2 of 3 years) managed SRKN soil populations and improved yield. Fluazaindolizine at 2.24 kg/ha and fluazindolizine at 1.12 kg/ha plus oxamyl at 2.14 kg/ha managed SRKN populations and improved yield in 1 of 3 years, whereas fluazaindolizine alone at 1.12 kg/ha only decreased SRKN populations. Fluopyram at 238 g/ha did not affect SRKN or yield. Nematicide application also had non-target effects on free-living nematodes with 1,3-D reducing abundances relative to untreated most frequently (2018 and 2020), but other nematicides also reducing free-living nematode abundances in 2020. In summary, 1,3-D is the most consistent option for SRKN control on sweet potato, but fluazaindolizine, oxamyl or combinations of the two products can also be effective.",,890
595,35977901,Clinical implications of discrepancies in predicting pediatric mortality between Pediatric Index of Mortality 3 and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2.,"Pediatric Index of Mortality 3 (PIM 3) and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2) are validated tools for predicting mortality in children. Research suggests that these tools may have different predictive performance depending on patient group characteristics. Therefore, we designed this study to identify the factors that make the mortality rates predicted by the tools different. This retrospective study included patients (<18 years) who were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit from July 2017 to May 2019. After defining the predicted mortality of PIM 3 minus the predicted mortality rate of PELOD-2 as difference in mortality prediction, the clinical characteristics significantly related to this were analyzed using multivariable regression analysis. Predictive performance was analyzed through the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). In total, 945 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 3.0 [0.0-8.0] years; girls, 44.7%) were analyzed. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test revealed AUROCs of 0.889 (χ2=10.187, P=0.313) and 0.731 (χ2=6.220, P=0.183) of PIM 3 and PELOD-2, respectively. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that oxygen saturation, partial pressure of CO2, base excess, platelet counts, and blood urea nitrogen levels were significant factors. Patient condition-related factors such as cardiac bypass surgery, seizures, cardiomyopathy or myocarditis, necrotizing enterocolitis, cardiac arrest, leukemia or lymphoma after the first induction, bone marrow transplantation, and liver failure were significantly related (P<0.001). Both tools predicted observed mortality well; however, caution is needed in interpretation as they may show different prediction results in relation to specific clinical characteristics.",,891
1209,35971605,Horizontal instability after acromioclavicular joint reduction using the two-hole technique is preferred over the loop technique: A single-blind randomized clinical trial.,"Most acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) injuries are caused by direct trauma to the shoulders, and various methods and techniques are used to treat them; however, none of the options can be considered the gold standard. This study examines the horizontal stability of the ACJ after a complete dislocation was repaired using one of two Ethibond suture techniques, the loop technique and the two holes in the clavicle technique. In this single-blind, randomized clinical trial, 104 patients diagnosed with complete ACJ dislocation type V were treated using Ethibond sutures with either the loop technique or the two holes in the clavicle technique. Horizontal changes in the ACJ were radiographically assessed in the lateral axial view, and shoulder function was evaluated by the Constant (CS) and Taft (TS) scores at intervals of 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The horizontal stability of the ACJ was better with the two-hole technique than the loop technique at all measurement times. CS and TS changes showed a significant upward trend over time with both techniques. The mean CS and TS at the final visit were 95.2 and 11.6 with the loop technique and 94 and 11.9 with the two-hole technique, respectively. The incidence of superficial infections caused by the subcutaneous pins was the same in the two groups. Due to the improved ACJ stability with the two-hole technique, it appears to be a more suitable option than the loop technique for AC joint reduction.",,892
2439,35966857,Systemic immune effects of anesthetics and their intracellular targets in tumors.,"According to the result released by the World Health Organization (WHO), non-communicable diseases have occupied four of the top 10 current causes for death in the world. Cancer is one of the significant factors that trigger complications and deaths; more than 80% cancer patients require surgical or palliative treatment. In this case, anesthetic treatment is indispensable. Since cancer is a heterogeneous disease, various types of interventions can activate oncogenes or mutate tumor suppressor genes. More and more researchers believe that anesthetics have a certain effect on the long-term recurrence and metastasis of tumors, but it is still controversial whether they promote or inhibit the progression of cancer. On this basis, a series of retrospective or prospective randomized clinical trials have been conducted, but it seems to be difficult to reach a conclusion within 5 years or longer. This article focuses on the effects of anesthetic drugs on immune function and cancer and reviews their latest targets on the tumor cells, in order to provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the selection of anesthetic drugs, exploring therapeutic targets, and improving the prognosis of cancer patients.",,893

289,35981472,Self-adhesive PMIA membranes with chitosan porous beads immobilized pullulanase for efficient biological aging of beer.,"A novel pulluanase@chitosan porous beads/Poly (m-phthaloyl-m-phenylenediamine) (PULL@CPB/PMIA) membrane with good separation and biocatalysis properties was prepared by a self-adhesive method by introducing an immobilized enzyme (PULL@CPB) onto the PMIA membrane. The combination of PULL@CPB and PMIA could increase the one-step refining of protoplasmic beer as well as the ability of biocatalysis to lower the alcohol-to-ester ratio. The experimental results showed that the addition of PULL@CPB and the increase in the ratio of EtOH/water in the coagulation bath both increased the load of pullulanase on the membrane surface, while excessive addition decreased the activity of pullulanase. Under the amount of PULL@CPB is 0.5 g·L-1 and the ratio of EtOH/water is 60%, the relative activity of pullulanase in PULL@CPB modified PMIA membrane was the highest, which was 91.7% of the initial activity. The interception rates of protein and macromolecular β-glucan were 92.2% and 87.3%, respectively, under the condition of beer flux (162.3 L·m-2·h-1). At the same time, the PULL@CPB/PMIA membrane has strong antibacterial performance and thus plays a role in extending the shelf life of beer. Compared with free pullulanase, the thermal stability, pH stability, organic solvent stability, and storing stability of immobilized pullulanase were significantly improved. The effects of PULL@CPB dosage and operating temperature on biocatalysis efficiency were discussed. The immobilized pullulanase activity on the membrane remained at 70.8% after 10 continuous uses. Therefore, the PMIA membrane is an excellent carrier of pullulanase, so its bioactive membrane has a wide range of prospects in food, medicine, and other fields.",,895
1894,35967716,Social Message Account or Processing Conflict Account - Which Processes Trigger Approach/Avoidance Reaction to Emotional Expressions of In- and Out-Group Members?,"Faces are characterized by the simultaneous presence of several evaluation-relevant features, for example, emotional expression and (prejudiced) ethnicity. The social message account (SMA) hypothesizes the immediate integration of emotion and ethnicity. According to SMA, happy in-group faces should be interpreted as benevolent, whereas happy out-group faces should be interpreted as potentially malevolent. By contrast, fearful in-group faces should be interpreted as signaling an unsafe environment, whereas fearful out-group faces should be interpreted as signaling inferiority. In contrast, the processing conflict account (PCA) assumes that each face conveys two rather independent evaluative features, emotion and ethnicity. Thus, stimuli might be either affectively congruent or incongruent, and thereby exert influences on behavior. The article reviews the evidence with regard to the two accounts before reporting an experiment that aims at disentangling them. In an approach/avoidance task (AAT), either happy/fearful faces of German and Turks were presented or happy/fearful faces of young and old persons. There are prejudices against Turk/Middle-eastern persons (in Germany) as well as against old persons. For SMA, the two prejudices are of different type; thus prediction for the AAT diverge for the two group conditions. In contrast, for PCA both group features (i.e., Turk ethnicity and old age) are negative features (in comparison to their counterparts) which are affectively congruent or incongruent to the emotional expression. Hence, the results pattern in the AAT should be comparable for the two group conditions. In accordance with SMA but in contrast to PCA, we found different patterns for the two group conditions.",,896

C. vulgaris was selected to be one of the constituents of the prepared composite because of its high capability in phytoremediation. The morphology and the structure of CS/GT*m-Alg/ZnO beads were characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD, and TGA. Different monitoring experimental conditions, such as contact time, pH, BPA concentration, and sorbent dosage, were optimized. The optimum conditions for the adsorption process showed outstanding removal efficiency toward BPA at pH 4.0, contact time 40.0 min, and 40.0 mg L-1 BPA initial concentration. Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm models have been studied for adsorption equilibrium, and the best fit is described by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The adsorption kinetics has been studied using pseudo-first-order (PFO), pseudo-second-order (PSO), Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion (IPD) models. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model shows the optimum experimental fit. The monolayer adsorption capacity of the prepared CS/GT*m-Alg/ZnO for BPA was determined to be 38.24 mg g-1. The prepared CS/GT*m-Alg/ZnO beads show advantageous properties, such as their high surface area, high adsorption capacity, reusability, and cost-effectiveness.",,897
916,35974804,Benign Anorectal Disorders and Pelvic Floor Disease After Bariatric Surgery.,"The correlations between morbid obesity, bariatric surgery and gastrointestinal disorders are well known and reported. Symptoms like abdominal pain, constipation, bloating, heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease are known to be significantly more prevalent in overweight patients and body mass index is associated positively with abdominal pain and diarrhea. In spite of these conditions, less is known about the lower gastrointestinal tract. Of these, anorectal disorders and pelvic floor disease are both believed to be more frequent in obese patients compared to the general population. Weight loss related to bariatric surgery seems to improve quality of life and weight-related symptoms, although some of these conditions may get worse. All these conditions are rarely studied in patients undergoing bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. This concise review aimed to focus on these conditions in patients undergoing bariatric surgery for morbid obesity in order to improve patient selection and post-operative management.",,898

The geographical origin has a significant influence on the quality and application of E. rugulosa. In this paper, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and other multivariate statistical analyses were performed for the identification of E. rugulosa. origins. The results showed that the volatile components of E. rugulosa. from different origins were significantly different. PCA and HCA can clearly distinguish the E. rugulosa of Lijiang and Fumin, and Dali and Yongsheng can be distinguished but with a certain overlap. The correlation of different components of was investigated by Pearson correlation. The results showed that E. rugulosa. characteristic component Elsholtzia ketone is regulated by terpenoid metabolism.

1278,35970756,Mechanisms of Resistance to BCL2 Inhibitor Therapy in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia and Potential Future Therapeutic Directions.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) constitutively overexpresses B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) with consequent dysregulation of intrinsic apoptosis leading to abnormal cellular survival. Therapeutic use of BCL2 inhibitors (BCL2i, eg, venetoclax) in CLL, as both continuous monotherapy or in fixed duration combination, has translated scientific rationale into clinical benefit with significant rates of complete responses, including those without detectable minimal residual disease. Unlike with chemotherapy, response rates to venetoclax do not appear to be influenced by pre-existing chromosomal abnormalities or somatic mutations present, although the duration of response observed remains shorter for those with traditional higher risk genetic aberrations. This review seeks to describe both the disease factors that influence primary venetoclax sensitivity/resistance and those resistance mechanisms that may be acquired secondary to BCL2i therapy in CLL. Baseline venetoclax-sensitivity or -resistance is influenced by the expression of BCL2 relative to other BCL2 family member proteins, microenvironmental factors including nodal T-cell stimulation, and tumoral heterogeneity. With selection pressure applied by continuous venetoclax exposure, secondary resistance mechanisms develop in oligoclonal fashion. Those mechanisms described include acquisition of BCL2 variants, dynamic aberrations of alternative BCL2 family proteins, and mutations affecting both BAX and other BH3 proteins. In view of the resistance described, this review also proposes future applications of BCL2i therapy in CLL and potential means by which BCL2i-resistance may be abrogated.",,900
851,35974877,Identification of Ligands for Chicken Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 Channel and Chemosensory Perception of Herbal Compounds in Chickens.,"The pungency induced by spices and herbs plays an important role in food choice and appetite, and it is suggested that adding spices and herbs to feed as natural alternatives to antibiotics has beneficial effects in poultry farming. However, our knowledge of the chemosensory perception of herbal compounds in chickens is limited. Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is involved in the sensory perception of various herbal compounds. Here, we performed calcium imaging and electrophysiological analyses using cells transiently expressing chicken TRPA1 (cTRPA1) and identified two novel cTRPA1 ligands-eugenol and thymol. In a behavioral assay, chickens responded to cTRPA1 ligands, including eugenol, thymol, cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol, and allyl isothiocyanate. These results provide evidence that chickens have a functional TRPA1 channel and chemosensory perception of various herbal compounds.",,901
833,35974938,"Efficacy of levetiracetam, lamotrigine and sodium valproate on seizure attacks and EEG disorders in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: A double blind randomized clinical trial.","Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is one of the most important types of generalized idiopathic epilepsy. Patients generally respond quickly and perfectly to standard antiepileptic drugs but lifelong medication is necessary. Sodium valproate is the drug of choice in most references but it has some adverse reactions and some patients cannot tolerate the complications. Because of the need for life long treatment in this young aged group particularly child bearing women, we aimed to analyze the efficacy of these drugs to determine which has better efficacy with lower adverse effects. In this double-blind clinical trial 102 patients suffering from juvenile myoclonic epilepsy were randomly divided to three groups and treated with valproate, levetiracetam or lamotrigine and followed for 12 months at specified intervals. Patients' mean age was 22.8 years and 28.4% of them were males and 71.6% were females. Effective terminal dose of sodium valproate, levetiracetam and lamotrigine were 1000, 1000 and 250mg, respectively. The rate of failure in controlling seizures and myoclonic jerks in lamotrigine group was meaningfully more than levetiracetam and sodium valproate (P=0.037).The general side effects of sodium valproate were much more; but there was not any significant difference between their effects on electroencephalogram (EEG) findings (P=0.81). Levetiracetam and sodium valproate have similar efficacy. But in the group of lamotrigine, rate of failure, myoclonus and drug adverse reactions were meaningfully more than sodium valproate and levetiracetam. According to our study, lamotrigine could not be a suitable treatment option for JME patients as a mono therapy. Levetiracetam can be a good alternative to sodium valproate, especially in women of childbearing age.",,902
1280,35970747,Making a joint decision: Cannabis as a potential substitute for opioids in obstetrics and gynecology.,"There is a growing body of evidence that cannabis may be effective as an analgesic with potential to reduce opioid usage in chronic pain. This review synthesizes the available literature to elucidate the possible role that cannabis might play in reducing opioid use in gynecological disorders that may potentially lead to a recommendation of substituting opioids with cannabis. With reports of a decrease in opioid use after cannabis initiation, an opioid-sparing effect has been seen in gynecologic malignancies such as ovarian, uterine, endometrial, and cervical cancers, in addition to chronic pelvic pain (CPP). Though many studies have found an association between cannabis and various adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials making it difficult to claim a directly causal relationship between cannabis and these adverse outcomes. Additionally, with increased use of cannabis during pregnancy, the evidence of possible benefits and risks to mothers and fetuses is examined.",,903

We conducted a matched case-control study to identify risk factors for recurrent violent injuries among African women in The Gambia, a small West African country. During the 12-month study period, we recruited study participants from eight emergency departments in the metropolitan areas of the municipality of Kanifing and the West Coast region. We selected women aged ≥15 years who sought medical treatment for an injury due to physical violence at least twice over the study period. Two control groups were used: violence controls (VC), which included those who had experienced a single violence-related injury in the prior 12 months; and nonviolence controls (NVC), which included those who had experienced a nonviolent injury. Control patients were matched based on gender, health facility, injury date, and age (±2 years). In total, 116 case patients and 232 control patients participated in the study. Results of the conditional logistic regression analyses of the VC and NVC control groups individually showed that women with recurrent violent injuries had a significantly higher likelihood of having a secondary education (odds ratio [OR]VC 6.47; ORNVC 4.22), coming from a polygamous family (ORVC 3.81; ORNVC 3.53), and had been raised by a single parent (ORVC 5.25; ORNVC 5.04). Furthermore, compared with the VC group, women with recurrent violent injuries had a significantly higher likelihood of living in a rented house (ORVC 4.74), living with in-laws (ORVC 5.98), and of having experienced childhood abuse (ORVC 2.48). Compared with the NVC group, women with recurrent violent injuries had a significantly higher likelihood of living in an extended family compound (ORVC 4.77), having more than two female siblings (ORVC 4.07), and having been raised by a relative (ORVC 3.52). We identified risk factors for recurrent injuries from physical violence among African women in The Gambia. Intervention strategies targeting these risk factors could be effective in preventing recurrent violence against African women.",,905
338,35979430,Genomic Analyses for Selective Signatures and Genes Involved in Hot Adaptation Among Indigenous Chickens From Different Tropical Climate Regions.,"Climate change, especially weather extremes like extreme cold or extreme hot, is a major challenge for global livestock. One of the animal breeding goals for sustainable livestock production should be to breed animals with excellent climate adaptability. Indigenous livestock and poultry are well adapted to the local climate, and they are good resources to study the genetic footprints and mechanism of the resilience to weather extremes. In order to identify selection signatures and genes that might be involved in hot adaptation in indigenous chickens from different tropical climates, we conducted a genomic analysis of 65 indigenous chickens that inhabit different climates. Several important unique positively selected genes (PSGs) were identified for each local chicken group by the cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH). These PSGs, verified by composite likelihood ratio, genetic differentiation index, nucleotide diversity, Tajima's D, and decorrelated composite of multiple signals, are related to nerve regulation, vascular function, immune function, lipid metabolism, kidney development, and function, which are involved in thermoregulation and hot adaptation. However, one common PSG was detected for all three tropical groups of chickens via XP-EHH but was not confirmed by other five types of selective sweep analyses. These results suggest that the hot adaptability of indigenous chickens from different tropical climate regions has evolved in parallel by taking different pathways with different sets of genes. The results from our study have provided reasonable explanations and insights for the rapid adaptation of chickens to diverse tropical climates and provide practical values for poultry breeding.",,906
1967,35967640,The impact of criminal law regulation-based business environment optimization on entrepreneurial spirit and enterprise development.,"The purpose is to explore the impact of the business environment optimization by Criminal Law Regulation (CLR) on Entrepreneurial Spirit (ES) and Enterprise Development (ED) and to provide a reference for subsequent related research. Based on this, this work first makes a detailed analysis of the business environment and CLR. Second, the research hypotheses are put forward, and the conceptual model is proposed. At the same time, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) is designed to analyze the business environment, ES, and ED, and their relationships. Finally, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) is constructed and the CLR-optimized business environment is used as the intermediary variable to explore the impact of the business environment on ES and ED. Then, 200 QSs (recovering 192 valid ones) are distributed to investigate entrepreneurs' attitudes toward ES and ED in different regions. Statistical analysis and independent t-tests are performed on the survey results to judge the relationship between variables. The results of empirical analysis show that (1) The significance coefficient P of ES and ED is 0.005 < 0.01, and the scores of ES and ED of large enterprises are 132.7864 and 142.3243, respectively, which are the highest. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the ED. (2) The influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ES is 0.60, and the influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ED is 0.75. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation plays a positive role in the development of ES. CLR-optimized business regulation plays a regulating role between ES and ED. (3) CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the formation of ES. The policy enlightenment of this work mainly has three points. First, optimizing the business environment can stimulate and protect ES, thus improving the quality of economic growth. All regions should promote mass entrepreneurship and innovation and high-quality economic development by improving the convergence of economic policies and building a legal and market-oriented business environment. Second, all regions should implement dynamic and differentiated policies to optimize the business environment's spatial pattern in Chinese cities. Third, there is a need to further strengthen the construction of new infrastructure through cutting-edge information technologies, such as Fifth Generation (5G) mobile communication, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",,907
945,35974742,Small-angle X-ray scattering: characterization of cubic Au nanoparticles using Debye's scattering formula.,"A versatile software package in the form of a Python extension, named CDEF (computing Debye's scattering formula for extraordinary form factors), is proposed to calculate approximate scattering profiles of arbitrarily shaped nanoparticles for small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). CDEF generates a quasi-randomly distributed point cloud in the desired particle shape and then applies the open-source software DEBYER for efficient evaluation of Debye's scattering formula to calculate the SAXS pattern (https://github.com/j-from-b/CDEF). If self-correlation of the scattering signal is not omitted, the quasi-random distribution provides faster convergence compared with a true-random distribution of the scatterers, especially at higher momentum transfer. The usage of the software is demonstrated for the evaluation of scattering data of Au nanocubes with rounded edges, which were measured at the four-crystal monochromator beamline of PTB at the synchrotron radiation facility BESSY II in Berlin. The implementation is fast enough to run on a single desktop computer and perform model fits within minutes. The accuracy of the method was analyzed by comparison with analytically known form factors and verified with another implementation, the SPONGE, based on a similar principle with fewer approximations. Additionally, the SPONGE coupled to McSAS3 allows one to retrieve information on the uncertainty of the size distribution using a Monte Carlo uncertainty estimation algorithm.",,908
1708,35968062,Adverse Effects of Sit and Stand Workstations on the Health Outcomes of Assembly Line Workers: A Cross-sectional Study.,"Sitting and standing workstations can affect individual's health outcomes differently. This study aimed to assess the effects of sit and stand workstations on energy expenditure and blood parameters, including glucose and triglyceride, musculoskeletal symptoms/pain and discomfort, fatigue, and productivity among workers of assembly line of a belt factory. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 47 male assembly line workers (24 workers in sitting workstation and 23 workers in standing workstation) with at least one year of working experience. Data were gathered via demographic/occupational characteristics, Fitbit system, medical records, the Persian version of the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (P-NMQ), the Persian version of the Numeric Rating Scale (P-NRS), the Persian version of the Swedish Occupational Fatigue (P-SOFI), and Persian version of the Health and Work Questionnaire (P-HWQ). The results showed that there were no statistically significant between the demographic/occupational details of the participants in sitting and standing groups, except work experience. The findings of the present study revealed that the energy expenditure, and blood glucose/triglyceride there are not statistically differences between sitting and standing groups. In addition, the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in the neck, lower back, knees, and ankles/feet in standing group was significantly higher than the sitting group. The means of severity of discomfort/pain in all body regions were significantly higher in standing group compared to other group. Generally, occupational fatigue was higher among the standing group compared to sitting group. About productivity, the 'concentration/focus' and 'impatience/irritability' subscales in sitting group were higher than the standing group. Contrariwise, other subscales of the productivity, including 'productivity', 'supervisor relations', 'non-work satisfaction', 'work satisfaction' in the standing group were higher than the sitting group. To reduce the adverse effects of sitting and standing workstations on individual's health outcomes, planning to use sit-stand workstations is recommended.",,909
872,35974851,Reduction in Operating Room Airborne Particle Burden and Time-Dependent Contamination of Sterile Instrument Trays With the Use of a Novel Air Filtration System.,"Introduction Postoperative infections represent a substantial burden to patients and healthcare systems. To improve patient care and reduce healthcare expenditures, interventions to reduce surgical infections must be employed. The crystalline C-band ultraviolet (UV-C) air filtration technology (Aerobiotix Inc., Miamisburg, OH, USA) has been designed to reduce airborne bioburden through high-quality filtration and germicidal irradiation. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of a novel UV-C air filtration device to reduce airborne particle counts and contamination of surgical instrument trays in an operating room (OR) setting. Materials and methods Thirty sterile instrument trays were opened in a positive-air-flow OR. The trays were randomly assigned to one of two groups (UV-C or control, n=15 per group). In the UV-C group, the UV-C filtration device was used and in the control, it was not. All trays were opened with the use of a sterile technique and left exposed in the OR for four hours. Air was sampled by a particle counter to measure the numbers of 5µm and 10µm particles. Culture specimens were obtained from the trays to assess for bacterial contamination. Outcome data were collected at 30-minute intervals for the duration of the four-hour study period. Results Use of the UV-C device resulted in statistically significant reductions in the numbers of 5µm (average of 64.9% reduction when compared with the control, p<0.001) and 10µm (average of 65.7% reduction when compared with the control, p<0.001)-sized particles detectable in the OR. There was no significant difference in the overall rates of contamination (33.3% in the control group vs. 26.7% in the UV-C group, p=1.0) or the time to contamination (mean survival of 114 minutes in the control group vs. 105 minutes in the UV-C group, p=0.72) of surgical instrument trays with the use of the UV-C device. Conclusions The results demonstrate that the UV-C filtration device can successfully reduce airborne bioburden in standard ORs, suggesting that it may have the potential to reduce the risk for wound and hardware infections. Further clinical trials are necessary to better determine the effect of this air filtration system on postoperative infection rates.",,910
2012,35967575,Abnormal B-Cell Maturation and Increased Transitional B Cells in CBL Syndrome.,"CBL syndrome is a Noonan-like RASopathy with heterogeneous clinical phenotype and predisposition to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Here we describe two patients with identical germline CBL mutation and clinical and immune-hematological overlapping features with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and B-cell expansion with NF-κB and T-cell anergy (BENTA) syndrome. Increased immature/transitional B cells can be depicted in CBL syndrome, ALPS, and BENTA. Nonetheless, our patients here described showed peculiar B-cell phenotype due to increased immature/transitional CD34+ B cells. This feature differentiates CBL syndrome from BENTA, pointing toward an abnormal proliferation of B-cell early precursors.",,911
2332,35967045,Exploring Conformational Preferences of Leu-enkephalin Using the Conformational Search and Double-Hybrid DFT Energy Calculations.,"The conformational preferences of Leu-enkephalin (Leu-Enk) were explored by the conformational search and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By a combination of low-energy conformers of each residue, the initial structures of the neutral Leu-Enk were generated and optimized using the ECEPP3 force field in the gas phase. These structures were reoptimized at the HF/3-21G(d) and M06-2X levels of theory with 6-31G(d) and 6-31+G(d) basis functions. We finally located the 139 structures with the relative energy <10 kcal mol-1 in the gas phase, from which the structures of the corresponding zwitterionic Leu-Enk were generated and reoptimized at the M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory using the implicit solvation model based on density (SMD) in water. The conformational preferences of Leu-Enk were analyzed using Gibbs free energies corrected by single-point energies calculated at the double-hybrid DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ/def2-TZVP level of theory in the gas phase and in water. The neutral Leu-Enk dominantly adopted a folded structure in the gas phase stabilized by three H-bonds with a βII'-bend-like motif at the Gly3-Phe4 sequence and a close contact between the side chains of Phe4 and Leu5. The zwitterionic Leu-Enk exhibited a folded structure in water stabilized by three H-bonds with double β-bends such as a βII' bend at the Gly2-Gly3 sequence and a βI bend at the Gly3-Phe4 sequence. The calculated ensemble-averaged distance between CGly2 α and CLeu5 α of the zwitterionic Leu-Enk in water is consistent with the value estimated from the simulated annealing using the distance constraints derived from nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra in water. Interestingly, the preferred conformations of the neutral and zwitterionic Leu-Enk are new folded structures not predicted by earlier computational studies. According to the refined model of the zwitterionic Leu-Enk bound to δ-opioid receptor (δOR), there were favorable interactions of the terminal charged groups of Leu-Enk with the side chains of charged residues of δOR as well as a favorable CAryl···H interaction of the Phe4 residue of Leu-Enk with Trp284 of δOR. Hence, these favorable interactions would induce the folded structure of the zwitterionic Leu-Enk with double β-bends isolated in water into the bioactive conformation like an extended structure when binding to δOR.",,912
1436,35968462,"Contribution of Two-Dose Vaccination Toward the Reduction of COVID-19 Cases, ICU Hospitalizations and Deaths in Chile Assessed Through Explanatory Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape.","To assess the impact of the initial two-dose-schedule mass vaccination campaign in Chile toward reducing adverse epidemiological outcomes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Publicly available epidemiological data ranging from 3 February 2021 to 30 September 2021 were used to construct GAMLSS models that explain the beneficial effect of up to two doses of vaccination on the following COVID-19-related outcomes: new cases per day, daily active cases, daily occupied ICU beds and daily deaths. Administered first and second vaccine doses, and the statistical interaction between the two, are strong, statistically significant predictors for COVID-19-related new cases per day (R2 = 0.847), daily active cases (R2 = 0.903), ICU hospitalizations (R2 = 0.767), and deaths (R2 = 0.827). Our models stress the importance of completing vaccination schedules to reduce the adverse outcomes during the pandemic. Future work will continue to assess the influence of vaccines, including booster doses, as the pandemic progresses, and new variants emerge. This work highlights the importance of attaining full (two-dose) vaccination status and reinforces the notion that a second dose provides increased non-additive protection. The trends we observed may also support the inclusion of booster doses in vaccination plans. These insights could contribute to guiding other countries in their vaccination campaigns.",,913
1018,35974601,Projective-truncation-approximation study of the one-dimensional ϕ^{4} lattice model.,"In this paper, we first develop the projective truncation approximation (PTA) in the Green's function equation of motion (EOM) formalism for classical statistical models. To implement PTA for a given Hamiltonian, we choose a set of basis variables and projectively truncate the hierarchical EOM. We apply PTA to the one-dimensional ϕ^{4} lattice model. Phonon dispersion and static correlation functions are studied in detail. Using one- and two-dimensional bases, we obtain results identical to and beyond the quadratic variational approximation, respectively. In particular, we analyze the power-law temperature dependence of the static averages in the low- and high-temperature limits, and we give exact exponents.",,914
1069,35974550,Estimating near-wall diffusion coefficients of arbitrarily shaped rigid macromolecules.,"We developed a computationally efficient approach to approximate near-wall diffusion coefficients of arbitrarily shaped rigid macromolecules. The proposed method relies on extremum principles for Stokes flows produced by the motion of rigid bodies. In the presence of the wall, the rate of energy dissipation is decreased relative to the unbounded fluid. In our approach, the position- and orientation-dependent mobility matrix of a body suspended near a no-slip plane is calculated numerically using a coarse-grained molecular model and the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa description of hydrodynamics. Effects of the boundary are accounted for via Blake's image construction. The matrix components are scaled using ratios of the corresponding bulk values evaluated for the detailed representation of the molecule and its coarse-grained model, leading to accurate values of the near-wall diffusion coefficients. We assess the performance of the approach for two biomolecules at different levels of coarse-graining.",,915

358,35979316,Roxadustat for treatment of anemia in a cancer patient with end-stage renal disease: A case report.,"Most cancer patients are accompanied by anemia, which will be more serious when combined with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). At present, cancer-related anemia and renal anemia treatments mainly include erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), iron supplementation, and blood transfusion, but their effects are often poor with several safety concerns. We have used roxadustat to treat anemia in a cancer patient with ESRD and achieved a successful outcome for the first time. A 64-year-old man was diagnosed with right renal cancer (clear cell renal cell carcinoma). He did not receive surgery or radiotherapy before admission. He was treated with oral soltan (sunitinib malate) on April 18, 2017. During oral chemotherapy, he had numerous complications, including anemia, hypertension, thyroid hypofunction, skin pigment loss, and renal function deterioration. At last, he progressed to ESRD and began hemodialysis treatment. We initially treated the patient with high-dose ESAs, iron supplementation, adequate dialysis, and even blood transfusion, but his anemia did not improve. Roxadustat is a newly developed drug for renal anemia treatment, but not for cancer-related anemia, let alone to treat anemia in cancer patients with ESRD. We prescribed oral roxadustat to the patient. After a period, his hemoglobin gradually increased. He did not have obvious discomfort symptoms, and his tumor did not progress significantly. Oral roxadustat could achieve good results in treating anemia in cancer patients with ESRD.",,917
943,35974747,NickelII-catalyzed asymmetric photoenolization/Mannich reaction of (2-alkylphenyl) ketones.,"A diastereo- and enantioselective photoenolization/Mannich (PEM) reaction of ortho-alkyl aromatic ketones with benzosulfonimides was established by utilizing a chiral N,N'-dioxide/Ni(OTf)2 complex as the Lewis acid catalyst. It afforded a series of benzosulfonamides and the corresponding ring-closure products, and a reversal of diastereoselectivity was observed through epimerization of the benzosulfonamide products under continuous irradiation. On the basis of the control experiments, the role of the additive LiNTf2 in achieving high stereoselectivity was elucidated. This PEM reaction was proposed to undergo a direct nucleophilic addition mechanism rather than a hetero-Diels-Alder/ring-opening sequence. A possible transition state model with a photoenolization process was proposed to explain the origin of the high level of stereoinduction.",,918
1649,35968125,Does improved oleic acid content due to marker-assisted introgression of ahFAD2 mutant alleles in peanuts alter its mineral and vitamin composition?,"Peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) with high oleic acid content have extended shelf life and several health benefits. Oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acid contents in peanuts are regulated by ahFAD2A and ahFAD2B mutant alleles. In the present study, ahFAD2A and ahFAD2B mutant alleles from SunOleic 95R were introgressed into two popular peanut cultivars, GG-7 and TKG19A, followed by markers-assisted selection (MAS) and backcrossing (MABC). A total of 22 MAS and three MABC derived lines were developed with increased oleic acid (78-80%) compared to those of GG 7 (40%) and TKG 19A (50%). Peanut kernel mineral and vitamin composition remained unchanged, while potassium content was altered in high oleic ingression lines. Two introgression lines, HOMS Nos. 37 and 113 had over 10% higher pooled pod yield than respective best check varieties. More than 70% recurrent parent genome recovery was observed in HOMS-37 and HOMS-113 through recombination breeding. However, the absence of recombination in the vicinity of the target locus resulted in its precise introgression along with ample background genome recovery. Selected introgression lines could be released for commercial cultivation based on potential pod yield and oleic acid content.",,919
2220,35967298,Case report: bullous pemphigoid development underlies dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa disease worsening.,"Autoimmune response to cutaneous basement membrane components superimposed on a genetic skin fragility disease, hereditary epidermolysis bullosa (EB), has been described, but its effects on disease course remain unclear. We report a 69-year-old individual with congenital skin fragility and acral trauma-induced blistering that had suddenly worsened with the onset of severe itch and diffuse spontaneous inflammatory blisters. Next-generation sequencing identified compound heterozygous null and missense COL7A1 mutations, allowing the diagnosis of recessive dystrophic EB. However, the patient's clinical history prompted us to investigate whether he might have developed a pathological autoimmune response against basement membrane components. Tissue-bound and circulating IgG antibodies to the major bullous pemphigoid (BP) antigen, BP180, were detected in the patient's skin and serum, respectively, consistent with a diagnosis of BP. Corticosteroid therapy was initiated resulting in remission of BP manifestations. EB patients presenting rapid disease worsening should be investigated for the development of a concomitant autoimmune blistering disease.",,920
2143,35967375,Necroptosis throws novel insights on patient classification and treatment strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Necroptosis is a novel pattern of immunogenic cell death and has triggered an emerging wave in antitumor therapy. More evidence has suggested the potential associations between necroptosis and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Currently, the underlying role of necroptosis remains elusive in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at antitumor immunity and inter-tumoral heterogeneity. This study enrolled a total of 728 HCC patients and 139 immunotherapy patients from eight public datasets. The consensus clustering approach was employed to depict tumor heterogeneity of cancer necroptosis. Subsequently, our study further decoded the heterogeneous clinical outcomes, genomic landscape, biological behaviors, and immune characteristics in necroptosis subtypes. For each patient, providing curative clinical recommendations and developing potential therapeutic drugs were used to promote precise medicine. With the use of the weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm, necroptosis-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (NALRs) were identified in HCC. Based on the NALR expression, two heterogeneous subtypes were decoded with distinct clinical outcomes. Compared to patients in C1, patients in C2 harbored superior pathological stage and presented more unfavorable overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Then, the robustness and reproducibility of necroptosis subtypes were further validated via the nearest template prediction (NTP) approach and classical immune phenotypes. Through comprehensive explorations, C1 was characterized by enriched immune-inflammatory and abundant immune infiltration, while C2 possessed elevated proliferative and metabolic activities and highly genomic instability. Moreover, our results indicated that C1 was more prone to obtain desirable benefits from immunotherapy. For patients in C2, numerous underlying therapeutic agents were developed, which might produce significant efficacy. This study identified two necroptosis subtypes with distinct characteristics, decoding the tumor heterogeneity. For an individualized patient, our work tailored corresponding treatment strategies to improve clinical management.",,921
1640,35968135,Effects of water levels on plant traits and nitrogen use efficiency in monoculture and intercropped artificial grasslands.,"Water availability is the main factor affecting the forage productivity of artificial grasslands, particularly in semi-arid regions. Generally, intercropping of gramineous grass and leguminous grass can achieve high productivity. However, how different water availability levels affect the productivity of intercropping system remains unclear. Here, we conducted a 3-year (2015-2017) study by manipulating the water conditions (CK equivalent to the annual precipitation, +50% treatment equivalent to 50% increase over the average precipitation, and -50% treatment equivalent to 50% decrease over the average precipitation) to explore the responses of plant traits, nitrogen use efficiency, and biomass of the monoculture of Medicago sativa (a leguminous grass, M.s), monoculture of Elymus nutans (a gramineous grass, E.n), and intercropping of M.s and E.n in a semi-arid region in Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that the biomass obtained by intercropping of M.s and E.n decreased by 24.4% in -50% treatment compared to the CK treatment, while that of the monoculture of M.s decreased by 34.4% under the -50% treatment compared to the CK treatment. However, there was no significant difference in the biomass between intercropping artificial grassland and monoculture M. sativa under +50% treatment. Compared to monoculture, M.s can obtain more nitrogen by biological nitrogen fixation and decrease the proportion of nitrogen absorbed from soils under intercropping in the same water conditions. Under the intercropping system, the proportions of nitrogen absorbed from soils by M.s were 87.4%, 85.1, and 76.9% in -50%, CK, and +50% treatments, respectively. Under monoculture, these proportions were 91.9, 89.3, and 82.3% in -50%, CK, and +50% treatments, respectively. Plant trait, but not soil nitrogen content, was the main regulator for the productivity responses to water level changes. Our results highlight that intercropping can achieve higher productivity in both dry and wet conditions. Therefore, considering the fluctuating rainfall events in the future, it might be useful to alter the proportions of intercropped forage species in an artificial grassland to obtain optimal productivity by reducing the limitations of nitrogen availability. However, the economic viability of intercropping M. sativa and E. nutans should be evaluated in the future.",,922
728,35975152,Engineering living cells with cucurbit[7]uril-based supramolecular polymer chemistry: from cell surface engineering to manipulation of subcellular organelles.,"Supramolecular polymer chemistry, which closely integrates noncovalent interactions with polymeric structures, is a promising toolbox for living cell engineering. Here, we report our recent progress in exploring the applications of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])-based supramolecular polymer chemistry for engineering living cells. First, a modular polymer-analogous approach was established to prepare multifunctional polymers that contain CB[7]-based supramolecular recognition motifs. The supramolecular polymeric systems were successfully applied to cell surface engineering and subcellular organelle manipulation. By anchoring polymers on the cell membranes, cell-cell interactions were established by CB[7]-based host-guest recognition, which further facilitated heterogeneous cell fusion. In addition to cell surface engineering, placing the multifunctional polymers on specific subcellular organelles, including the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, has led to enhanced physical contact between subcellular organelles. It is highly anticipated that the CB[7]-based supramolecular polymer chemistry will provide a new strategy for living cell engineering to advance the development of cell-based therapeutic materials.",,923
610,35977789,Male Adaptive Plasticity Can Explain the Evolution of Sexual Perception Costs.,"AbstractSensory perception of environmental cues has been shown to trigger plastic responses that can induce important fitness costs, including the dramatic modulation of aging across distant taxa. For example, male Drosophila melanogaster suffer a marked decrease in fitness, characterized by faster reproductive and actuarial aging, if they perceive female cues but fail to mate shortly after (aging via sexual perception). While this has been a breakthrough for our understanding of the mechanisms of aging, it raises the question of why such plastic responses evolved. Here, we used D. melanogaster to ask whether sexual perception costs may be a by-product of adaptive plastic responses to female cues. We found that (a) short-term perception (1 day) of female cues before mating opportunities increases male relative lifetime reproductive success in a competitive environment, (b) medium-term perception (3-7 days) is neutral, and (c) long-term perception (15 days) leads to reproductive costs. We then ran mathematical simulations under a wide range of sociosexual and demographic scenarios to show that such plastic male responses can be adaptive whenever mating rates fluctuate within the range experienced by D. melanogaster and other insects in the wild, suggesting that this may be a widespread strategy in nature. Finally, we show that, because the short-term benefits of plastic responses will be acquired mostly by high-quality males while long-term costs will be paid mostly by low-quality males, sexual perception can significantly magnify sexual selection (15%-27% average increase in the opportunity for selection).",,924
953,35974726,Dislocation substructures in pure aluminium after creep deformation as studied by electron backscatter diffraction.,"In the present work, electron backscatter diffraction was used to determine the microscopic dislocation structures generated during creep (with tests interrupted at the steady state) in pure 99.8% aluminium. This material was investigated at two different stress levels, corresponding to the power-law and power-law breakdown regimes. The results show that the formation of subgrain cellular structures occurs independently of the crystallographic orientation. However, the density of these cellular structures strongly depends on the grain crystallographic orientation with respect to the tensile axis direction, with 〈111〉 grains exhibiting the highest densities at both stress levels. It is proposed that this behaviour is due to the influence of intergranular stresses, which is different in 〈111〉 and 〈001〉 grains.",,925
2327,35967051,Preparation of Water-Based Alkyl Ketene Dimer (AKD) Nanoparticles and Their Use in Superhydrophobic Treatments of Value-Added Teakwood Products.,"A process for preparing emulsions of alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) nanoparticles via a nanoemulsion template (emulsion/evaporation) method has been developed. The effects of types and contents of stabilizing agents, i.e., anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS), cationic (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB), amphoteric (phosphatidylcholine, PC), and polymeric (poly(vinyl alcohol), PVA), on the colloidal stability and hydrodynamic size of the AKD nanoparticles are investigated. The use of 0.1 wt % anionic SDS as a stabilizer generates nanoparticles with high stability and the smallest average size of 148 ± 5 nm. The environmentally friendly water-based emulsion prepared without halogenated compounds and harsh organic solvents is then applied to enhance the hydrophobicity of teakwood products by a simple dipping process. The properties and structures of the resulting treated woods are examined by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and water contact angle (WCA) measurements. The treated woods show superhydrophobicity with a WCA value of 150 ± 2°, as the emulsion generates a hydrophobic layer covering the wood surfaces due to the β-ketoester bond formation and the arrangement of AKD hydrophobic tails. The nanosized nanoparticles can penetrate the dense structure of the teakwood and form similar bonding for up to a 0.8 mm depth, generating a protective water-repellent layer in the wood structure. The emulsion has high potential for use in the commercial production of value-added teakwood products, with excellent water-resistant properties and high dimensional instability, without altering their physical appearances.",,926

Clinical features of graft-versus-host-disease are non-specific, which may lead to delayed diagnosis as more common conditions including infections or drug reactions are considered. We describe a 54-year-old male patient who underwent liver transplantation for alcohol use disorder-related cirrhosis and developed acute graft-versus-host disease. Initial clinical presentation included dermatitis, bone marrow failure and enteritis. Results of skin biopsy and cytogenetic studies were consistent with liver transplant-associated acute graft-versus-host disease. The importance of this case is to highlight to transplant physicians and surgeons the challenges of diagnosing graft-versus-host-disease. In our case, pre-existing partnerships among the liver and hematopoietic stem cell transplant teams, transfusion medicine specialists, critical care specialists and facilitated timely communication relevant to confirming graft-versus-host disease. We propose an algorithm to assist in the workup of suspected graft-versus-host disease. Because this condition is characterized by high mortality, a high index of suspicion is imperative for prompt diagnosis and optimal management of the donor-recipient immune interaction when patients present with classic clinical features.",,927
185,35982898,Interplay of LncRNAs NEAT1 and TUG1 in Incidence of Cytokine Storm in Appraisal of COVID-19 Infection.,"Background: In 2019, the coronavirus pandemic emerged, resulting in the highest mortality and morbidity rate globally. It has a prevailing transmission rate and continues to be a global burden. There is a paucity of data regarding the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in COVID-19. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate lncRNAs, particularly NEAT1 and TUG1, and their association with IL-6, CCL2, and TNF-α in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe disease. Methods: The study was conducted on 80 COVID-19 patients (35 with severe and 45 with moderate infection) and 40 control subjects. Complete blood count (CBC), D-dimer assay, serum ferritin, and CRP were assayed. qRT-PCR was used to measure RNAs and lncRNAs. Results: NEAT1 and TUG1 expression levels were higher in COVID-19 patients compared with controls (P<0.001). Furthermore, CCL2, IL-6, and TNF-α expressions were higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (P<0.001). CCL2 and IL-6 expression levels were significantly higher in patients with severe compared to those with moderate COVID-19 infection (P<0.001). IL-6 had the highest accuracy in distinguishing COVID-19 patients (AUC=1, P<0.001 at a cutoff of 0.359), followed by TUG1 (AUC=0.999, P<0.001 at a cutoff of 2.28). NEAT1 and TUG1 had significant correlations with the measured cytokines, and based on the multivariate regression analysis, NEAT1 is the independent predictor for survival in COVID-19 patients (P=0.02). Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients, significant overexpression of NEAT1 and TUG1 was observed, consistent with cytokine storm. TUG1 could be an efficient diagnostic biomarker, whereas NEAT1 was an independent predictor for overall survival.",,928
353,35979321,Delayed-release oral mesalamine tablet mimicking a small jejunal gastrointestinal stromal tumor: A case report.,"Enteric-coated medications are supposed to pass intact through the gastric environment and to release the drug content into the small intestine or the colon. Before dissolution of the enteric coating, they may appear hyperdense on computed tomography (CT). Unfortunately, few reports have been published on this topic so far. In this case report, the hyperdense appearance on contrast-enhanced CT of an enteric-coated mesalamine tablet was initially misinterpreted as a jejunal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). An asymptomatic 81-year-old male patient, who had undergone laparoscopic right nephrectomy four years earlier for stage 1 renal carcinoma, was diagnosed with a jejunal GIST at the 4-year follow-up thoraco-abdominal CT scan. He was referred to our hub hospital for gastroenterological evaluation, and subsequently underwent 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, and video capsule endoscopy. None of these examinations detected any lesion of the small intestine. After reviewing all the CT images in a multidisciplinary setting, the panel estimated that the hyperdense jejunal image was consistent with a tablet rather than a GIST. The tablet was an 800 mg delayed-release enteric-coated oral mesalamine tablet (Asacol®), which had been prescribed for non-specific colitis, while not informing the hospital physicians. Delayed-release oral mesalamine (Asacol®), like other enteric-coated medications, can appear as a hyperdense image on a CT scan, mimicking a small intestinal GIST. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of the patients' medications and a multidisciplinary review of the images are essential.",,929
219,35982801,Recurrent Intra Articular Osteochondroma of Left 4th Finger.,Osteochondromas are common benign bone tumors arising from metaphyseal region of long bones. They are notorious for undergoing malignant transformation. We present a case of a middle aged woman with recurrent episodes of swelling in the middle of left 4th finger post excision. Bone scan was performed to look for any malignant transformation of finger lesion and also to rule out skeletal metastases due to recent onset bone pains. 99m Tc MDP (Technetium methylene diphosphonate) bone scan demonstrated a focal hot spot in middle of left 4th finger along the radial side. There was no evidence of skeletal metastases. Surgery is usually curative (70-90%). Limb sparing wide local excision is treatment of choice.,,930
520,35978739,Establishing the Role of Neurogenic Inflammation in the Pathogenesis of Periodontitis: A Systematic Review.,"The role of neurogenic inflammation in various systemic diseases has been well established, but there is a dearth of studies and evidence regarding its role in periodontitis. This study aimed to systematically review the evidence in establishing the role of neurogenic inflammation in chronic periodontitis. Databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were reviewed. We analyzed studies of any design that compared and evaluated the presence of neuropeptides such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, neurokinin A, neuropeptide Y, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in systemically healthy patients with and without periodontitis. We screened 2,495 articles and abstracts electronically and manually, which yielded 191 articles relevant to our study. Full-text examination of these 191 articles led to the final inclusion of 14 publications. Most studies here confirmed an association between various neuropeptides and periodontitis, but there is a high heterogeneity between the studies, making it necessary to clarify the mechanism between these two. Although most studies included in this review found a positive association between neurogenic inflammation and periodontitis, the evidence is of moderate to low quality.",,931
362,35979312,Chidamide and sintilimab combination in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma progressing after chimeric antigen receptor T therapy.,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is curable with first-line chemoimmunotherapy but patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL still face a poor prognosis. For patients with R/R DLBCL, the complete response rate to traditional next-line therapy is only 7% and the median overall survival is 6.3 mo. Recently, CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) have shown promise in clinical trials. However, approximately 50% of patients treated with CAR-T cells ultimately progress and few salvage therapies are effective. Here, we report on 7 patients with R/R DLBCL whose disease progressed after CAR-T infusion. They received a PD-1 inhibitor (sintilimab) and a histone deacetylase inhibitor (chidamide). Five of the 7 patients tolerated the treatment without any serious adverse events. Two patients discontinued the treatment due to lung infection and rash. At the 20-mo follow-up, the median overall survival of these 7 patients was 6 mo. Of note, there were 2 complete response rates (CRs) and 2 partial response rates (PRs) during this novel therapy, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 57.1%, and one patient had a durable CR that lasted at least 20 mo. In conclusion, chidamide combined with sintilimab may be a choice for DLBCL patients progressing after CD19-targeting CAR-T therapy.",,932
2409,35966904,Clustering-based iterative heuristic framework for a non-emergency patients transportation problem.,"Non-emergency patient transportation (NEPT) services are particularly important nowadays due to the aging population and contagious disease outbreaks (e.g., Covid-19 and SARS). In this work, we study a NEPT problem with a case study of patient transportation services in Hong Kong. The purpose of this work is to study the discomfort and inconvenience measures (e.g., waiting time and extra ride time) associated with the transportation of non-emergency patients while optimizing the operational costs and utilization of NEPT ambulances. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is developed to model the NEPT problem. This MILP model contributes to the existing literature by not only including the patient inconvenience measures in the objective function but also illustrating a better trade-off among different performance measures through its specially customized formulation and real-life characteristics. CPLEX is used to find the optimal solutions for the test instances. To overcome the computational complexity of the problem, a clustering-based iterative heuristic framework is designed to solve problems of practical sizes. The proposed framework distinctively exploits the problem-specific structure of the considered NEPT problem in a novel way to enhance and improve the clustering mechanism by repeatedly updating cluster centers. The computational experiments on 19 realistic problem instances show the effective execution of the solution method and demonstrate the applicability of our approach. Our heuristic framework observes an optimality gap of less than 5% for all those instances where CPLEX delivered the result. The weighted objective function of the proposed model supports the analysis of different performance measures by setting different preferences for these measures. An extensive sensitivity analysis performed to observe the behavior of the MILP model shows that when operating costs are given a weightage of 0.05 in the objective function, the penalty value for user inconvenience measures is the lowest; when the weightage value for operating costs varies between 0.8 and 1.0, the penalty value for the same measures is the highest. This research can assist decision-makers in improving service quality by balancing operational costs and patient discomfort during transportation.",,933
1591,35968293,Predictors of ischemic events in patients with unilateral extracranial vertebral artery dissection: A single-center exploratory study.,"Extracranial vertebral artery dissection (EVAD) is one of the main causes of stroke in young and middle-aged patients. However, the diagnosis is challenging. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of EVAD on color duplex ultrasonography (CDU) and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (hrMRI), hoping to improve the accuracy and determine the relative contribution of vessel findings and clinical factors to acute ischemic events. Patients with unilateral EVAD were recruited and divided into ischemia and non-ischemia groups. Clinical features of patients and the lesion location; a variety of signs which indicate dissection, including the presence of an intimal flap, double lumen, intramural hematoma, dissecting aneurysm, intraluminal thrombus, and irregular lumen; and other quantitative parameters of each dissected segment on CDU and hrMRI were reviewed, respectively. Multiple logistic regression was performed to explore the association between clinical, imaging characteristics, and ischemic events in patients with unilateral EVAD. Ninety-six patients with unilateral EVAD who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled during a six-year period. Overall, 41 cases (42.7%) were confirmed as ischemic stroke (n = 40) or transient ischemic attack (n = 1) during the 48 h after the onset of symptoms. Men, infections during the last week, and smoking were more common in the ischemia group. Intraluminal thrombus and occlusion on CDU were more prevalent in patients with cerebral ischemia than in those without (36.6 vs. 5.5%; p < 0.001, and 39.0 vs. 9.1%; p = 0.001, respectively). On hrMRI, intraluminal thrombus and occlusion were also more frequent in the ischemia group than in the non-ischemia group (34.1 vs. 5.5%; p < 0.001, and 34.1 vs. 9.1%; p = 0.003, respectively). In addition, lesion length on hrMRI was significantly longer for patients with ischemia (81.5 ± 41.7 vs. 64.7 ± 30.8 mm; p = 0.025). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, male gender, infections during the last week, and the presence of intraluminal thrombus on CDU and hrMRI were independently associated with acute ischemic events. Male sex, infections during the last week, and the presence of intraluminal thrombus due to dissection are associated with an increased risk of ischemic events in patients with unilateral EVAD.",,934
760,35975077,Greatly enhanced hole collection of MoO x with top sub-10 nm thick silver films for gridless and flexible crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells.,"Greatly enhanced hole collection of MoO x is demonstrated experimentally with a top sub-10 nm thick Ag film, allowing for an efficient dopant-free contacted crystalline silicon (c-Si) heterojunction solar cell without a front grid electrode. With the removal of shadows induced by the front grid electrode, the gridless solar cell with the MoO x /Ag hole-selective contact (HSC) shows an increment of ∼8% in its power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the greatly improved short-circuit current density (J sc) as well as the almost undiminished fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (V oc), while the gridless solar cells with the conventional MoO x /ITO and pure MoO x HSCs exhibit ∼20% and ∼43% degradations in PCE due to the overwhelming decrease in their FF and J sc, respectively. Through systematic characterizations and analyses, it is found that the ultrathin Ag film (more conductive than ITO) provides an additional channel for photogenerated holes to transport on MoO x , contributing to the great enhancement in the hole collection and the great suppression of the shunt loss in the gridless solar cells. A 50 μm thick gridless c-Si heterojunction solar cell with the MoO x /Ag HSC is 75% thinner but is 86% efficient compared to its 200 μm thick counterpart (while the 50 μm thick gridless solar cell with the MoO x /ITO HSC is much less efficient). It is over 82% efficient after being bent to a curvature radius as small as 4 mm, also showing superior mechanical flexibility to its counterpart with the MoO x /ITO HSC. Our MoO x /Ag double-layer HSC can be easily fabricated through thermal evaporation without breaking the vacuum, saving both the time and cost of the fabrication of the whole device. Therefore, this work provides a guide for the design of efficient HSCs for high-efficiency, low-cost, and flexible solar cells.",,935
1154,35973765,"Profile of commercialized aphicides on the survivorship and feeding behavior of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii.","The cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is one of the most destructive agricultural pests due to photosynthate removal and horizontal transmission of plant viruses. Horizontal transmission of plant viruses by aphids occurs during distinct feeding behavioral events, such as probing for non-persistent viruses or phloem feeding for persistent viruses. We employed toxicity bioassays and electrical penetration graph (EPG) methodology to compare toxicity and quantify changes to feeding behavior and toxicity of A. gossypii after exposure to commercialized aphicides. Commercialized aphicides containing flupyradifurone, sulfoxaflor, thiamethoxam, thiamethoxam + lambda cyhalothrin, and bifenthrin induced >90% aphid mortality within 4 h of exposure. Flupyradifurone was the most acutely toxic aphicide studied with an LT50 of 8.9 min after exposure, which was approximately 3-fold lower than bifenthrin and thiamethoxam + lambda cyhalothrin. This was supported by our EPG results that showed a significant reduction in the proportion of aphids that continued to probe on cotton 4 h after exposure to flonicamid, thiamethoxam, flupyradifurone, bifenthrin, and thiamethoxam + lambda cyhalothrin. The commercialized aphicides containing spirotetramat, flonicamid, thiamethoxam, flupyradifurone, bifenthrin, sulfoxaflor, and pymetrozine significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the time to first probe when compared to the untreated control. Lastly, E1 (phloem salivation) and E2 (phloem ingestion) waveforms were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced for flupyradifurone, flonicamid, thiamethoxam, sulfoxaflor, and thiamethoxam. These data provide a comparative study for the development of new aphicides aiming to induce acute lethality and reduce aphid transmission of plant viruses.",,936
1135,35973886,The association of vitamin D deficiency with hemogram-derived inflammatory biomarkers in children.,"One of the extraosseous effects of vitamin D is that it is a potent modulator of inflammatory processes. Many studies have demonstrated the inverse association between vitamin D and inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that vitamin D deficiency may affect the inflammatory markers derived from hemogram parameters [neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet distribution width (PDW), red blood cell distribution width (RDW)] in healthy children. We conducted a retrospective study on healthy children. From 2015 to 2020, 16,321 children with simultaneous vitamin D and hemogram measurements were identified from electronic records. Participants were divided into 2 groups according to whether they had vitamin D deficiency or not. The relationship between vitamin D status and the levels of inflammatory markers was analyzed. All inflammatory markers showed statistically significant differences between vitamin D status (p < 0.001 for all). Vitamin D levels were significantly negatively correlated with NLR (r = -0.285), PLR (r = -0.257), PDW (r = -0.181), and positively correlated with LMR (r = 0.218), and RDW (r = 0.057). In logistic regression analysis, age (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.14-1.16), gender (OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.54-1.78), LMR (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95-0.98), PLR (OR = 1.003, 95% CI: 1.001-1.004), and RDW (OR = 1.10, 95%CI: 1.07-1.13) were found to be independent predictors for vitamin D deficiency. Statistically significant differences were detected between vitamin D status and inflammatory parameters. However, the difference between the median values of vitamin D groups was very small and the degree of correlation was very weak. Therefore, the clinical significance of the difference should be questioned.",,937
126,35983281,Luminogenic HiBiT Peptide-Based NanoBRET Ligand Binding Assays for Melatonin Receptors.,"The two human melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2, which belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, are important drug targets with approved indications for circadian rhythm- and sleep-related disorders and major depression. Currently, most of the pharmacological studies were performed using [3H]melatonin and 2-[125I]iodomelatonin (2-[125I]-MLT) radioligands. Recently, NanoLuc-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) monitoring competitive binding between fluorescent tracers and unmodified test compounds has emerged as a sensitive, nonradioactive alternative for quantifying GPCR ligand engagement on the surface of living cells in equilibrium and real time. However, developing such assays for the two melatonin receptors depends on the availability of fluorescent tracers, which has been challenging predominantly owing to their narrow ligand entry channel and small ligand binding pocket. Here, we generated a set of melatonergic fluorescent tracers and used NanoBRET to evaluate their engagement with MT1 and MT2 receptors that are genetically fused to an N-terminal luminogenic HiBiT-peptide. We identified several nonselective and subtype-selective tracers. Among the selective tracers, PBI-8238 exhibited high nanomolar affinity to MT1, and PBI-8192 exhibited low nanomolar affinity to MT2. The pharmacological profiles of both tracers were in good agreement with those obtained with the current standard 2-[125I]-MLT radioligand. Molecular docking and mutagenesis studies suggested the binding mode of PBI-8192 in MT2 and its selectivity over MT1. In conclusion, we describe the development of the first nonradioactive, real-time binding assays for melatonin receptors expressed at the cell surface of living cells that are likely to accelerate drug discovery for melatonin receptors.",,938
772,35975065,"Design, synthesis, bio-evaluation, and in silico studies of some N-substituted 6-(chloro/nitro)-1H-benzimidazole derivatives as antimicrobial and anticancer agents.","A new series of 6-substituted 1H-benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized by reacting various substituted aromatic aldehydes with 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine and 4-chloro-o-phenylenediamine through condensation using sodium metabisulfite as the oxidative reagent. The N-substituted 6-(chloro/nitro)-1H-benzimidazole derivatives were prepared from the 6-substituted 1H-benzimidazole derivatives and substituted halides using potassium carbonate by conventional methods as well as by exposure to microwave irradiation. Seventy-six 1H-benzimidazole derivatives have been synthesized in moderate to excellent yields with the microwave-assisted method (40 to 99%). Compounds 1d, 2d, 3s, 4b, and 4k showed potent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, MSSA (methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus), and MRSA (methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus) with MIC (the minimum inhibitory concentration) ranging between 2 and 16 μg mL-1 as compared to ciprofloxacin (MIC = 8-16 μg mL-1), in particular compound 4k exhibits potent fungal activity against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger with MIC ranging between 8 and 16 μg mL-1 compared with the standard drug fluconazole (MIC = 4-128 μg mL-1). In addition, compounds 1d, 2d, 3s, 4b, and 4k also showed the strongest anticancer activity among the synthesized compounds against five tested cell lines with IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) ranging between 1.84 and 10.28 μg mL-1, comparable to paclitaxel (IC50 = 1.38-6.13 μM). Furthermore, the five most active compounds showed a good ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profile in comparison to ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, and paclitaxel as reference drugs. Molecular docking predicted that dihydrofolate reductase protein from Staphylococcus aureus is the most suitable target for both antimicrobial and anticancer activities, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and histone deacetylase 6 are the most suitable targets for anticancer activity of these potent compounds.",,939
189,35982853,Two Kinesin-14A Motors Oligomerize to Drive Poleward Microtubule Convergence for Acentrosomal Spindle Morphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Plant cells form acentrosomal spindles with microtubules (MTs) converged toward two structurally undefined poles by employing MT minus end-directed Kinesin-14 motors. To date, it is unclear whether the convergent bipolar MT array assumes unified poles in plant spindles, and if so, how such a goal is achieved. Among six classes of Kinesin-14 motors in Arabidopsis thaliana, the Kinesin-14A motors ATK1 (KatA) and ATK5 share the essential function in spindle morphogenesis. To understand how the two functionally redundant Kinesin-14A motors contributed to the spindle assembly, we had ATK1-GFP and ATK5-GFP fusion proteins expressed in their corresponding null mutants and found that they were functionally comparable to their native forms. Although ATK1 was a nuclear protein and ATK5 cytoplasmic prior to nuclear envelop breakdown, at later mitotic stages, the two motors shared similar localization patterns of uniform association with both spindle and phragmoplast MTs. We found that ATK1 and ATK5 were rapidly concentrated toward unified polar foci when cells were under hyperosmotic conditions. Concomitantly, spindle poles became perfectly focused as if there were centrosome-like MT-organizing centers where ATK1 and ATK5 were highly enriched and at which kinetochore fibers pointed. The separation of ATK1/ATK5-highlighted MTs from those of kinetochore fibers suggested that the motors translocated interpolar MTs. Our protein purification and live-cell imaging results showed that ATK1 and ATK5 are associated with each other in vivo. The stress-induced spindle pole convergence was also accompanied by poleward accumulation of the MT nucleator γ-tubulin. These results led to the conclusion that the two Kinesin-14A motors formed oligomeric motor complexes that drove MT translocation toward the spindle pole to establish acentrosomal spindles with convergent poles.",,940
2338,35967039,"Geological Characteristics of Lower Paleozoic Shale Gas Accumulation in the Yuxi Region, Southern Sichuan Basin: In View of High-Density Methane Inclusions.","Twelve shale fracture veins and forty-nine fluid inclusion assemblages within the veins of 3800-4200 m in three wells located in different tectonic zones in the Yuxi Region, southern Sichuan Basin were selected in this study. The burial and thermal histories of single wells were reconstructed, and time-temperature-pressure of oil and gas filling were clarified using microscopy observation, Raman microprobe analyses, geochemical tests, and fluid inclusion microtemperature measurement. The shale fracture veins of the Wufeng-Longmaxi Formation in the Yuxi Region are mainly formed vertically and horizontally, where the vein-forming fluids are derived from endogenous fluids. A large number of methane inclusions, bituminous inclusions, and methane-bearing bituminous inclusions within the veins confirm the process of oil cracking gas and kerogen cracking gas. The homogeneous temperature (Th) of the aqueous inclusions contemporaneous with the bituminous inclusions ranges from 109.3 to 174.1 °C, which were trapped during 220 to 250 Ma. The homogeneous temperature of the aqueous inclusions contemporaneous with the methane inclusions ranges from 137.3 to 226.8 °C, which were trapped during 160 to 195 Ma and 51 to 56 Ma. The trapped pressure calculated by high-density methane inclusions (0.246-0.293 g/cm3) is between 82.9 and 140.1 MPa, with a pressure coefficient between 1.64 and 2.07. The formation pressure coefficient is nearly two, indicating that the current overpressure is inherited from the overpressure at the maximum burial depth. The earlier the fracture vein opening, the less the damage to the shale gas accumulation, and the more opening-closing phases, the lower the homogeneous temperature of the gas-liquid two-phase aqueous inclusions coeval with the high-density methane inclusions and the greater the degree of damage to the shale gas accumulation. The results provide a basis for further study on the genesis of overpressure and the migration of shale gas.",,941
432,35979152,The influence of contrast enhancement and experience of observers on the assessment of mediastinal lymph nodes in sarcoidosis patients.,"The aim of this study was to assess the influence of contrast enhancement (CE) and experience of observers on the assessment of chest lymph nodes in patients with sarcoidosis. A retrospective analysis of chest lymph nodes on computed tomography (CT) examinations, including CE and non-contrast-enhanced (non-CE) phase, was performed on 40 patients with proven diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Phases were separated, anonymized, and randomized. The assessment was performed by 5 observers: 2 general radiologists, 2 residents, and a senior chest CT expert. There were no significant differences between radiologists and residents, apart from the determination of the 4R node short diameter on CE images. Agreement between the reference observer and both residents and specialists was equally high, without any significant difference in the assessment all chest nodes and hilar nodes, and between non-CE and CE images. There was a significant difference between all observers in the determination of the largest 4R node short diameter on non-CE images, but not on CE images. The number of affected node levels was found to be significantly higher when evaluated on CE images than on non-CE images. Compared to CE images, non-CE computed tomography has sensitivity of 0.94-1.00 and specificity of 0.98-1.00, depending on the observer. The application of contrast medium has a limited impact on the quality of assessment of the chest lymph nodes in patients with sarcoidosis, regardless of the experience of the observer.",,942
860,35974863,"Management of Psychosis in the Setting of Binge Eating, Mania, and Extrapyramidal Side Effects.","Psychosis is a mental disorder in which an individual exhibits a loss of contact with reality; this definition, however, often fails to convey the broadness and complexity behind the diagnosis. While studies agree that it is best practice to address psychosis by treating its underlying cause, manifestations of psychosis do vary widely and may be challenging to identify in some clinical scenarios, such as the one presented here. Binge eating in the setting of psychosis has been observed in instances where alterations of the gut microbiota in response to an eating disorder trigger psychotic episodes. However, instances in which the manifestation of psychosis itself is the catalytic factor for the presentation of a binge-eating event with aggression and delusions are seldom observed in the current medical literature. Of note, many of the drugs used to treat mental illness have been associated with regulating food intake. We aim to further expand on the association between psychosis, eating disorders, and management thereof in the setting of polypharmacy and undesired side effects. Here, we present the case and management of a 71-year-old male Hispanic patient with a significant history of mental illness who was admitted to the hospital due to acute gastroenteritis precipitated by binge eating during a psychotic episode.",,943
1076,35974543,One-component plasma of a million particles via angular-averaged Ewald potential: A Monte Carlo study.,"In this work we derive a correct expression for the one-component plasma (OCP) energy via the angular-averaged Ewald potential (AAEP). Unlike Yakub and Ronchi [J. Low Temp. Phys. 139, 633 (2005)0022-229110.1007/s10909-005-5451-5], who had tried to obtain the same energy expression from a two-component plasma model, we used the original Ewald potential for an OCP. A constant in the AAEP was determined using the cluster expansion in the limit of weak coupling. The potential has a simple form suitable for effective numerical simulations. To demonstrate the advantages of the AAEP, we performed a number of Monte Carlo simulations for an OCP with up to a million particles in a wide range of the coupling parameter. Our computations turned out at least two orders of magnitude more effective than those with a traditional Ewald potential. A unified approach is offered for the determination of the thermodynamic limit in the whole investigated range. Our results are in good agreement with both theoretical data for a weakly coupled OCP and previous numerical simulations. We hope that the AAEP will be useful in path integral Monte Carlo simulations of the uniform electron gas.",,944
1960,35967647,The Effects of Teacher Feedback and Automated Feedback on Cognitive and Psychological Aspects of Foreign Language Writing: A Mixed-Methods Research.,"Feedback plays a crucial role in the writing processes. However, in the literature on foreign language (FL) writing, there is a dearth of studies that compare the effects of teacher feedback and automated feedback on both cognitive and psychological aspects of FL writing. To fill this gap, the current study compared the effects of teacher feedback and automated feedback on both revision quality and writing proficiency development (i.e., the cognitive aspects), and perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the feedback (i.e., the psychological aspects) in English writing among English learners as an FL (EFLs) in China. It also investigated students' perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the two types of feedback. The study adopted a mixed-methods design. The quantitative method collected the data through (1) a pre-test and a post-test, which measured the participants' English writing proficiency development; (2) a writing task, which received either teacher feedback or automated feedback; and (3) a close-ended questionnaire, which examined students' perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the feedback. The qualitative method collected the data through an open-ended questionnaire, which examined the participants' perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of teacher feedback or automated feedback depending on the type of feedback they received. Chinese university EFLs in two English classes (n = 35 in each class) taught by the same English teacher participated in the study: one class received teacher feedback while the other received automated feedback using Pigaiwang. While the students in the two classes did not differ significantly on the pre-test of students' writing proficiency, students who received teacher feedback scored significantly higher on revision than those who received automated feedback. Students in the teacher feedback class also had significantly higher ratings on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the feedback than those in the automated feedback class. However, students in the automated feedback class obtained significantly higher scores on the post-test of the writing proficiency. The qualitative results identified three themes of strengths and two themes of weaknesses for the teacher feedback and the automated feedback, respectively. The results suggest that while teacher feedback has a more positive effect on the psychological aspect of FL writing, automated feedback may be more effective in developing FL writing proficiency in the long run.",,945
1601,35968283,"Net water uptake, a neuroimaging marker of early brain edema, as a predictor of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage after acute ischemic stroke.","We hypothesized that quantitative net water uptake (NWU), a novel neuroimaging marker of early brain edema, can predict symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We enrolled patients with AIS who completed admission multimodal computed tomography (CT) within 24 h after stroke onset. NWU within the ischemic core and penumbra was calculated based on admission CT, namely NWU-core and NWU-penumbra. sICH was defined as the presence of ICH in the infarct area within 7 days after stroke onset, accompanied by clinical deterioration. The predictive value of NWU-core and NWU-penumbra on sICH was evaluated by logistic regression analyses and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A pure neuroimaging prediction model was built considering imaging markers, which has the potential to be automatically quantified with an artificial algorithm on image workstation. 154 patients were included, of which 93 underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT). The median time from symptom onset to admission CT was 262 min (interquartile range, 198-368). In patients with MT, NWU-penumbra (OR =1.442; 95% CI = 1.177-1.766; P < 0.001) and NWU-core (OR = 1.155; 95% CI = 1.027-1.299; P = 0.016) were independently associated with sICH with adjustments for age, sex, time from symptom onset to CT, hypertension, lesion volume, and admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. ROC curve showed that NWU-penumbra had better predictive performance than NWU-core on sICH [area under the curve (AUC): 0.773 vs. 0.673]. The diagnostic efficiency of the predictive model was improved with the containing of NWU-penumbra (AUC: 0.853 vs. 0.760). A pure imaging model also presented stable predictive power (AUC = 0.812). In patients without MT, however, only admission NIHSS score (OR = 1.440; 95% CI = 1.055-1.965; P = 0.022) showed significance in predicting sICH in multivariate analyses. NWU-penumbra may have better predictive performance than NWU-core on sICH after MT. A pure imaging model showed potential value to automatically screen patients with sICH risk by image recognition, which may optimize treatment strategy.",,946
1364,35969099,Reconstitution of Septin Assembly at Membranes to Study Biophysical Properties and Functions.,"Most cells can sense and change their shape to carry out fundamental cell processes. In many eukaryotes, the septin cytoskeleton is an integral component in coordinating shape changes like cytokinesis, polarized growth, and migration. Septins are filament-forming proteins that assemble to form diverse higher-order structures and, in many cases, are found in different areas of the plasma membrane, most notably in regions of micron-scale positive curvature. Monitoring the process of septin assembly in vivo is hindered by the limitations of light microscopy in cells, as well as the complexity of interactions with both membranes and cytoskeletal elements, making it difficult to quantify septin dynamics in living systems. Fortunately, there has been substantial progress in the past decade in reconstituting the septin cytoskeleton in a cell-free system to dissect the mechanisms controlling septin assembly at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The core steps of septin assembly include septin heterooligomer association and dissociation with the membrane, polymerization into filaments, and the formation of higher-order structures through interactions between filaments. Here, we present three methods to observe septin assembly in different contexts: planar bilayers, spherical supports, and rod supports. These methods can be used to determine the biophysical parameters of septins at different stages of assembly: as single octamers binding the membrane, as filaments, and as assemblies of filaments. We use these parameters paired with measurements of curvature sampling and preferential adsorption to understand how curvature sensing operates at a variety of length and time scales.",,947
485,35978870,Multiple roles for cholinergic signaling in pancreatic diseases.,"Cholinergic nerves are widely distributed throughout the human body and participate in various physiological activities, including sensory, motor, and visceral activities, through cholinergic signaling. Cholinergic signaling plays an important role in pancreatic exocrine secretion. A large number of studies have found that cholinergic signaling overstimulates pancreatic acinar cells through muscarinic receptors, participates in the onset of pancreatic diseases such as acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis, and can also inhibit the progression of pancreatic cancer. However, cholinergic signaling plays a role in reducing pain and inflammation through nicotinic receptors, but enhances the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic tumor cells. This review focuses on the progression of cholinergic signaling and pancreatic diseases in recent years and reveals the role of cholinergic signaling in pancreatic diseases.",,948
1920,35967689,Intersubjectivity as an antidote to stress: Using dyadic active inference model of intersubjectivity to predict the efficacy of parenting interventions in reducing stress-through the lens of dependent origination in Buddhist Madhyamaka philosophy.,"Intersubjectivity refers to one person's awareness in relation to another person's awareness. It is key to well-being and human development. From infancy to adulthood, human interactions ceaselessly contribute to the flourishing or impairment of intersubjectivity. In this work, we first describe intersubjectivity as a hallmark of quality dyadic processes. Then, using parent-child relationship as an example, we propose a dyadic active inference model to elucidate an inverse relation between stress and intersubjectivity. We postulate that impaired intersubjectivity is a manifestation of underlying problems of deficient relational benevolence, misattributing another person's intentions (over-mentalizing), and neglecting the effects of one's own actions on the other person (under-coupling). These problems can exacerbate stress due to excessive variational free energy in a person's active inference engine when that person feels threatened and holds on to his/her invalid (mis)beliefs. In support of this dyadic model, we briefly describe relevant neuroimaging literature to elucidate brain networks underlying the effects of an intersubjectivity-oriented parenting intervention on parenting stress. Using the active inference dyadic model, we identified critical interventional strategies necessary to rectify these problems and hereby developed a coding system in reference to these strategies. In a theory-guided quantitative review, we used this coding system to code 35 clinical trials of parenting interventions published between 2016 and 2020, based on PubMed database, to predict their efficacy for reducing parenting stress. The results of this theory-guided analysis corroborated our hypothesis that parenting intervention can effectively reduce parenting stress if the intervention is designed to mitigate the problems of deficient relational benevolence, under-coupling, and over-mentalizing. We integrated our work with several dyadic concepts identified in the literature. Finally, inspired by Arya Nagarjuna's Buddhist Madhyamaka Philosophy, we described abstract expressions of Dependent Origination as a relational worldview to reflect on the normality, impairment, and rehabilitation of intersubjectivity.",,949
1213,35971516,Learning through mess: Sensemaking visual communication practices in a UK multidisciplinary applied health study.,"This article addresses the challenges and opportunities associated with the development of new visual communication practices and outputs, using an example of such work conducted in a UK interdisciplinary applied health project. Reflecting on his role as co-researcher and practice as a visual ethnographer in the study, the author argues that new visual communication practices may emerge from 'mess' and even ugliness. In the case discussed, the author comes to terms with mess and elements of failure as potential phenomena of learning through a process of Sensemaking (see Weick's Sensemaking in Organizations, 1995), by applying innovative visual methods to the approach. Through his version of visual Sensemaking, the author identifies a set of principles to inform innovation in collaborative, interdisciplinary visual communication.",,950
1327,35969974,"Bridging the functional gap between reactivity and inhibition in dehaloperoxidase B from Amphitrite ornata: Mechanistic and structural studies with 2,4- and 2,6-dihalophenols.","The multifunctional catalytic globin dehaloperoxidase (DHP) from the marine worm Amphitrite ornata was shown to catalyze the H2O2-dependent oxidation of 2,4- and 2,6-dihalophenols (DXP; X = F, Cl, Br). Product identification by LC-MS revealed multiple monomeric products with varying degrees of oxidation and/or dehalogenation, as well as oligomers with n up to 6. Mechanistic and 18O-labeling studies demonstrated sequential dihalophenol oxidation via peroxidase and peroxygenase activities. Binding studies established that 2,4-DXP (X = Cl, Br) have the highest affinities of any known DHP substrate. X-ray crystallography identified different binding positions for 2,4- and 2,6-DXP substrates in the hydrophobic distal pocket of DHP. Correlation between the number of halogens and the substrate binding orientation revealed a halogen-dependent binding motif for mono- (4-halophenol), di- (2,4- and 2,6-dihalophenol) and trihalophenols (2,4,6-trihalopenol). Taken together, the findings here on dihalophenol reactivity with DHP advance our understanding of how these compounds bridge the inhibitory and oxidative functions of their mono- and trihalophenol counterparts, respectively, and provide further insight into the protein structure-function paradigm relevant to multifunctional catalytic globins in comparison to their monofunctional analogs.",,951
273,35982551,Modelling hydrological strength and alteration in moribund deltaic India.,"The Ganga-Brahmaputra moribund deltaic floodplain region hosted many socio-ecologically precious freshwater wetland ecosystems experiencing hydrological alteration. The present study aimed to model hydrological strength (HS) to show the spatial difference and account for the degree and direction of hydrological alteration of Indian moribund deltaic wetland in three phases e.g. (1) phase I (1988-1997), (2) phase II (1998-2007) and phase III (2008-2017). Three key hydrological parameters, such as Water Presence Frequency (WPF), water depth, and hydro-period were considered for hydrological strength modelling using two ensemble Machine Learning (ML) techniques (Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost). Image algebra was employed for phasal change detection. Hydrological strength models show that around 75% of the wetland area was lost in-between phases I to III and the loss was found more intensive in moderate and weak HS zones. Existing wetland shows a clear spatial difference of HS between wetland core and periphery and river linked and delinked or not linked wetlands. Regarding the suitability of the ML models, both are acceptable, however, the XGBoost outperformed in reference to applied 15 statistical validation techniques and field evidence. HS models based on change detection clarified that more than 22% and 55% of the weak HS zone in phases II and III respectively were turned into non-wetland. The degree of alteration revealed that about 40% of wetland areas experienced a negative alteration during phases I to II, and this proportion increased to 63% in between phases II to III. Since the study figured out the spatial nature of HS, degree and direction of alteration at a spatial scale, these findings would be instrumental for adopting rational planning towards wetland conservation and restoration.",,952
1864,35967776,Taste peptides derived from Stropharia rugosoannulata fermentation mycelium and molecular docking to the taste receptor T1R1/T1R3.,"This study identified the peptides in the fermentation mycelia of Stropharia rugosoannulata. The molecular weight of the peptides was below 3,000 Da. Heptapeptides to decapeptides were the main peptides in the fermentation mycelia of S. rugosoannulata. More than 50% of the peptides had salty and umami taste characteristics, and the long-chain peptides (decapeptides to 24 peptides) also played an essential role in the pleasant taste characteristics of mycelium. In the salty and umami peptide of S. rugosoannulata, the distribution of non-polar hydrophobic amino acids and polar-uncharged amino acids accounted for a relatively high proportion, and the proportion of polar-uncharged amino acids further increased, with the extension of the peptide chain. P, F, I, l, V, G, S, T, and D were the amino acids with a high proportion in the peptides. The taste peptides can bind to more than 60% of the active amino acid residues in the cavity-binding domain of the T1R1/T1R3 receptors. Hydrogen bond interaction was the primary mode of interaction between the peptides and the receptor. The first and second amino acid residues (such as S, V, E, K, G, and A) at the C-terminal and N-terminal of the peptides were easy to bind to T1R1/T1R3 receptors. Asp108, Asn150, Asp147, Glu301, Asp219, Asp243, Glu70, Asp218 in T1R1, and Glu45, Glu148, Glu301, Glu48, and Ala46 in TIR3 were the key active amino acid sites of taste peptides binding to T1R1/T1R3 receptors.",,953
1806,35967849,Role of HPV16 E1 in cervical carcinogenesis.,"Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. More than 90% of cases are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Vaccines developed only guard against a few HPV types and do not protect people who have already been infected. HPV is a small DNA virus that infects the basal layer of the stratified epithelium of the skin and mucosa through small breaks and replicates as the cells differentiate. The mucosal types of HPV can be classified into low-risk and high-risk groups, based on their association with cancer. Among HPV types in high-risk group, HPV type 16 (HPV-16) is the most common, causing 50% of all cancer cases. HPV infection can occur as transient or persistent infections, based on the ability of immune system to clear the virus. Persistent infection is characterized by the integration of HPV genome. HPV-16 exhibits a different integration pattern, with only 50% reported to be integrated at the carcinoma stage. Replication of the HPV genome depends on protein E1, an ATP-dependent helicase. E1 is essential for the amplification of the viral episome in infected cells. Previous studies have shown that E1 does not only act as a helicase protein but is also involved in recruiting and interacting with other host proteins. E1 has also been deemed to drive host cell proliferation. Recent studies have emphasized the emerging role of HPV E1 in cervical carcinogenesis. In this review, a possible mechanism by which E1 drives cell proliferation and oncogenesis will be discussed.",,954
807,35975018,Transcatheter interventions for severe tricuspid regurgitation: a literature review.,"The prevalence of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) increases with age, affecting 65%-85% of adults. Primary TR is caused by a congenital or acquired abnormality of the tricuspid valve apparatus (leaflets, chordae, papillary muscles, or annulus). Secondary TR is due to insufficient coaptation from dilation of tricuspid valve annulus due to the right ventricle (RV) or right atrium (RA) remodeling and increased RV pressures. Isolated TR is without increased RV pressures and is associated with atrial fibrillation. Mild TR is a benign disease. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation has independently been associated with increased mortality. Most of these patients are treated medically due to poor outcomes with surgical repair of isolated TR. The in-hospital mortality rate is 8.8%, and the median length of stay in hospital is 11 days resulting in higher healthcare costs. Even if the patients undergo surgical repair or replacement, available data do not show improvement in survival. With a more detailed understanding of the complex anatomy and physiology of the tricuspid valve and significant complications from untreated tricuspid valve disease, the approach to the management of TR has shifted from a conservative approach to a process of prevention and intervention. In the past decade, transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions and tricuspid annuloplasty rings have been developed, contributing to decreased mortality from surgical repair. Transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention techniques have improved survival, quality of life, and reduced heart failure rehospitalization. This review summarizes normal anatomy, types of TR, etiology and different mechanisms of TR, echocardiographic assessment of the severe TR, and highlights various percutaneous transcatheter techniques for tricuspid valve repair.",,955

The lower critical dimension is determined between 3.81<d_{c}<4. When the random field is scaled with q, a line segment of zero-temperature criticality is found in d=3. When the random field is scaled with q^{2}, a universal phase diagram is found at intermediate temperatures in d=3.",,956
1101,35974518,"Towards lattice-gas description of low-temperature properties above the Haldane and cluster-based Haldane ground states of a mixed spin-(1,1/2) Heisenberg octahedral chain.","The rich ground-state phase diagram of the mixed spin-(1,1/2) Heisenberg octahedral chain was previously elaborated from effective mixed-spin Heisenberg chains, which were derived by employing a local conservation of a total spin on square plaquettes of an octahedral chain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the thermodynamic properties of this model. In the highly frustrated parameter region the lowest-energy eigenstates of the mixed-spin Heisenberg octahedral chain belong to flat bands, which allow a precise description of low-temperature magnetic properties within the localized-magnon approach exploiting a classical lattice-gas model of hard-core monomers. The present article provides a more comprehensive version of the localized-magnon approach, which extends the range of its validity down to a less frustrated parameter region involving the Haldane and cluster-based Haldane ground states. A comparison between results of the developed localized-magnon theory and accurate numerical methods such as full exact diagonalization and finite-temperature Lanczos technique convincingly evidence that the low-temperature magnetic properties above the Haldane and the cluster-based Haldane ground states can be extracted from a classical lattice-gas model of hard-core monomers and dimers, which is additionally supplemented by a hard-core particle spanned over the whole lattice representing the gapped Haldane phase.",,957
1361,35969104,The Immersive Cleveland Clinic Virtual Reality Shopping Platform for the Assessment of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living.,"A decline in the performance of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) has been proposed as a prodromal marker of neurological disease. Existing clinical and performance-based IADL assessments are not feasible for integration into clinical medicine. Virtual reality (VR) is a powerful yet underutilized tool that could advance the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disease. An impediment to the adoption and scaling of VR in clinical neurology is VR-related sickness resulting from sensory inconsistencies between the visual and vestibular systems (i.e., locomotion problem). The Cleveland Clinic Virtual Reality Shopping (CC-VRS) platform attempts to solve the locomotion problem by coupling an omnidirectional treadmill with high-resolution VR content, enabling the user to physically navigate a virtual grocery store to simulate shopping. The CC-VRS consists of Basic and Complex shopping experiences; both require walking 150 m and retrieving five items. The Complex experience has additional scenarios that increase the cognitive and motor demands of the task to better represent the continuum of activities associated with real-world shopping. The CC-VRS platform provides objective and quantitative biomechanical and cognitive outcomes related to the user's IADL performance. Initial data indicate that the CC-VRS results in minimal VR-sickness and is feasible and tolerable for older adults and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The considerations underlying the development, design, and hardware and software technology are reviewed, and initial models of integration into primary care and neurology are provided.",,958
1738,35968004,The anatomical relationship between the mandibular first molar roots and the mandibular canal based on breed size and skull type.,"The first molar is the largest tooth in the dog mandible with roots often extending to the level of the mandibular canal (MC). The anatomical relationship between the roots and MC is variable and the normal relationship between those structures in a diverse population of dogs has not been established. The lingual location of the roots relative to the MC poses a risk for iatrogenic trauma during dentoalveolar surgery, and it is unknown if certain skull conformations are predisposed to this relationship. This study aimed to identify associations between patient weight and skull type with molar tooth root location. CT scans performed for reasons unrelated to the study were retrospectively analyzed. Subjects were sorted into one of 12 groups (n=16 per group) based on skull type (brachycephalic, mesaticephalic, and dolichocephalic) and weight (extra small: ≤ 6.8 kg, small: >6.8 to ≤ 13.6 kg, medium: >13.6 to ≤ 25 kg, and large >25 to ≤ 38.6 kg). The mandibular first molar roots were categorized as lingual, buccal, or dorsal relative to the MC. Lingual root location was diagnosed in 50.0% of all roots evaluated, and 64.2% of all dogs assessed had at least one root in the lingual position. The size was shown to be protective, with lingual root location being significantly less likely as size increased. The exception to this was in large brachycephalic patients, which had rates of lingual roots similar to smaller dogs. Buccal roots were rarest, diagnosed in only 9.7% of all roots, and were most common in brachycephalic patients, which had 83.8% of all buccal roots. Additional caution should be employed when removing alveolar bone during surgical extraction in dogs ≤ 13.6 kg and in large brachycephalic patients (boxers) to avoid iatrogenic trauma to the neurovascular bundle.",,959
2358,35967018,Obtaining a Fraction of Sugarcane Wax Rich in Policosanol by Using Ethanol as Solvent: Results Interpretation through Hansen's Solubility Theory.,"Determination of the best condition for fractionation of degreased sugarcane wax for policosanol production using ethanol was investigated in this paper. The optimal conditions related to the dispersion time of wax in the solvent, ethanol degree, and solvent/wax ratio were 30 min, 90.03% v/v, and 14:1 v/w, respectively. The results were evaluated by measuring six response variables: higher fatty alcohol concentration, octacosanol concentration, impurity concentration (measured as α,β unsaturated aldehydes), yield, cost indicator, and the ratio of octacosanol vs other higher fatty alcohols (C30 + C32 + C34). Optimal extraction conditions were determined with the desirability function. The complexity of separation of the higher alcohols fraction from impurities, mainly α,β unsaturated aldehydes, is explained with the aid of Hansen's solubility parameters theory and its variation with temperature.",,960
2452,35966840,Impact of Time-Varying Intensity of Mechanical Ventilation on 28-Day Mortality Depends on Fluid Balance in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Recent studies have mainly focused on the association between baseline intensity of mechanical ventilation (driving pressure or mechanical power) and mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is unclear whether the association between the time-varying intensity of mechanical ventilation and mortality is significant and varies according to the fluid balance trajectories. We conducted a secondary analysis based on the NHLBI ARDS Network's Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was employed to identify phenotypes based on fluid balance trajectories. Bayesian joint models were used to account for informative censoring due to death during follow-up. A total of 1,000 patients with ARDS were included in the analysis. Our study identified two phenotypes of ARDS, and compared patients with Early Negative Fluid Balance (Early NFB) and patients with Persistent-Positive Fluid Balance (Persistent-PFB) accompanied by higher tidal volume, higher static driving pressure, higher mechanical power, and lower PaO2/FiO2, over time during mechanical ventilation. The 28-day mortality was 14.8% in Early NFB and 49.6% in Persistent-PFB (p < 0.001). In the Bayesian joint models, the hazard ratio (HR) of 28-day death for time-varying static driving pressure [HR 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.05; p < 0.001)] and mechanical power [HR 1.01 (95% CI 1.002-1.02; p = 0.01)] was significant in patients with Early NFB, but not in patients with Persistent-PFB. Time-varying intensity of mechanical ventilation was associated with a 28-day mortality of ARDS in a patient with Early NFB but not in patients with Persistent-PFB.",,961
2265,35967166,Infective Endocarditis With Secondary Headache: A Case Report.,"Secondary headache is a symptom of an underlying disease. Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious infection of the heart tissue. Herein, we present a rare case of IE, with a secondary headache. The patient presented with persistent headache, fever of 39°C, myalgia, and painful erythema of the plantar surface of the foot. The headache progressively worsened over a few weeks. She was diagnosed with secondary headache, and sepsis was suspected. Blood culture revealed the presence of Streptococcus viridans, leading to a diagnosis of IE. Postoperatively, the patient recuperated without any complications. Headaches can be secondary to other conditions. Therefore, comprehensive assessment and accurate diagnosis are essential. Dentists must be aware that headache is a concomitant symptom of IE.",,962
1083,35974536,Anisotropic viscous effects of local flow by a rotating microparticle in nematic liquid crystal.,"The presented study opens a perspective to investigate the effects of local flow on nematic liquid crystals. A particle rotated in nematic fluids typically generates a rotationally symmetric local flow, which causes a change in the director orientation. The director above the threshold velocity has a particular angle determined by the ratio of Leslie coefficients, α_{2}/α_{3}. In 5CB liquid crystals, this director angle with respect to the flow is approximately 13^{∘}. The angle is calculated through Ericksen-Leslie theory. The angle is not dependent on rotation frequency or particle size but temperature. The area of the influenced region increases with the rotation frequency and particle size. The changes in radius of the influenced region are calculated theoretically using Ericksen number. Further, an interference pattern appears at the edge of the influenced region by the refractive indexes mismatch between the influenced region and the rest. We experimentally obtain the thickness of the influenced region analyzing intervals of the pattern.",,963
2007,35967580,An outbreak of infection due to severe acute respiratory corona virus-2 in a neonatal unit from a low and middle income setting.,"The provision of kangaroo mother care (KMC) involving continuous skin-to-skin care (SSC) is an important intervention in neonatal care, which is recommended even when women are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). We report on a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a KMC ward. Contact tracing was conducted following the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in a mother lodging in the KMC ward. All mother-newborn dyads in the KMC and healthcare workers (HCW) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 within 24-72 h of diagnosing the index case. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained and tested from contacts, with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) assay. Next-generation sequencing was done on positive samples. The secondary attack rate (SAR) was calculated assuming that the mother who presented with symptoms was the source of infection. Twelve (70.6%) of 17 mothers and 8 (42.1%) of 19 neonates who were in the KMC ward with the index case were found to be positive with SARS-CoV-2. Seven (87.5%) of the 8 neonates who tested positive had mothers who also tested positive. Seventy-five percent (9/12) of the mothers and 62.5% (5/8) of the neonates who tested positive were asymptomatic. Eight (27.6%) of 29 HCW were found to be positive and were all asymptomatic. One neonate died from Acinetobacter baumannii sepsis, and his post-mortem lung histopathology showed features compatible with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The sequencing of 13 specimens, which included 1 mother-newborn dyad, indicated clustering to the same phylogenetic lineage with identical mutations. In assessing for factors contributing to this outbreak, it was found that spaces between beds were less than 1 m and mothers had their meals around the same table at the same time. We report on a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in a KMC ward, affecting a high number of mothers and neonates, and to a lesser extent HCWs. Although it is difficult to point to the index case as the source of this outbreak, as asymptomatic individuals can spread infection, the inadequate adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions was assessed to have contributed to the spread of infection. This highlights the need for awareness and adherence to mitigation strategies to avoid SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.",,964
2497,35966713,Comparative analysis of the microbiotas and physicochemical properties inside and outside medium-temperature Daqu during the fermentation and storage.,"Medium-temperature Daqu (MT-Daqu), a saccharification-fermentation agent and aroma-producing agent, is used to produce Chinese strong-flavor Baijiu. Many related studies have been published; however, less is known about microbial community and quality properties inside and outside the MT-Daqu from fermentation to storage. Here, along with determining the physicochemical index, the microbial community of MT-Daqu was investigated using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods during 31 days of fermentation and 4 months of storage. Volatile compounds of mature MT-Daqu were analyzed using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results indicated obvious variation in the microbial community due to the changes in environmental conditions, and the physicochemical indices shifted from fluctuations in the fermentation period to relative stability after storage for 3 months. Moreover, the microbial counts and physicochemical indices of the inner layers of MT-Daqu differed from those of the outer layers. The dominant communities, including the bacterial phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria and the fungal phyla Ascomycota and Mucoromycota, showed different abundances in the two parts of the mature MT-Daqu, and different microbial communities were enriched in both parts. Additionally, pyrazines and alcohols were the most abundant volatile aroma compounds in the mature MT-Daqu.",,965
1902,35967707,How empowering leadership influences medical workers' work-family conflict in the post-pandemic era: A moderated mediation model of leadership black box.,"After experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, the status and mechanisms of leadership, and the challenges for medical workers in terms of family-work conflicts, have caused widespread concern. In the post-pandemic era, based on role theory and the stressor-detachment model, this paper seeks to break the black box of negative effects that can be caused by leadership, research the mechanism and boundary conditions of those negative effects, and explore factors to reduce those negative effects. We recruited 1,010 Chinese medical workers fighting COVID-19 on the frontline. Our study results showed that there was a significant negative correlation between empowering leadership and work-family conflict, and this relationship was completely mediated by role stress, while psychological detachment moderated the relationship between role stress and work-family conflict. Moreover, psychological detachment moderated the mediating effect of empowering leadership on work-family conflict through role stress. Therefore, higher levels of psychological detachment were less conducive to medical workers' family-work conflict. This study has important theoretical significance and practical value for revealing the negative effects and mechanisms of empowering leadership and for medical workers to better deal with work-family relations.",,966
463,35978922,Cardiac hydatid cysts in a young man: A case report and a literature review.,"Cystic hydatid disease commonly affects the liver and lungs. Cardiac hydatid cysts are a rare occurrence and can cause fatal complications, including anaphylactic shock, systemic or pulmonary embolism, dissemination, arrhythmias, valvular dysfunction or sudden death. The case of a 19-year-old male from a rural area who was admitted to the emergency room with anaphylactic shock is presented in the current study. The patient was subsequently referred to the Department of Pneumology due to a mild fever, a dry cough and thoracic pain. Pneumonia was suspected and antibiotics were administered. As the patient didn't respond to the antibiotics, a pulmonary CT-scan was performed, which demonstrated a bilateral pulmonary embolism of the segmental arteries and the patient was referred to the Department of Cardiology. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated the presence of a right ventricular mass of ~25x18 mm, attached to its free wall, adjacent to the tricuspid valve causing no tricuspid inflow obstruction. Blood tests were positive for echinococcal infection. Considering that previous reviews had included cases published up until 2018, the present study also included a short literature review of the studies published between 2018 and 2021. The review showed that cardiac hydatid cysts are diagnosed more often in underdeveloped countries, especially in men. Transthoracic echocardiography is the most useful non-invasive imaging technique for diagnosis. Surgery is the treatment of choice, but consideration must be given to the risk-benefit ratio and the shared decision-making approach. The complete surgical removal of the cyst(s) is the major prognosis factor of the cardiac manifestation. This study emphasizes the importance of considering cardiac echinococcosis as a potential diagnosis in patients from endemic or farming areas.",,967
2483,35966775,Age-Related Changes in Interaural-Level-Difference-Based Across-Frequency Binaural Interference.,"Low-frequency interaural time differences and high-frequency interaural level differences (ILDs) are used to localize sounds in the horizontal plane. Older listeners appear to be worse at horizontal-plane sound localization to compared younger listeners, but little is understood about age-related changes to across-frequency binaural processing. This study investigated if the frequency dependence of across-frequency ILD processing is altered for older compared to younger listeners, which was done by using an across-frequency binaural interference task (when the interaural difference sensitivity for a target sound is decreased by a spectrally remote interfering sound with zero interaural differences). It was hypothesized that as listeners experience advancing age and age-related high-frequency hearing loss (i.e., presbycusis), they will demonstrate worse binaural performance and experience more across-channel binaural interference (because of age-related temporal processing deficits), and will increasingly be affected by interferers at lower frequencies (because of age-related hearing loss) when compared to younger listeners. There were 11 older (>65 yrs) and 20 younger (<30 yrs) listeners with normal to near-normal audiometric thresholds up to 2 kHz. They were tested using a left-right ILD lateralization discrimination task. Single-tone ILD discrimination thresholds and across-frequency binaural interference were measured at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz. ILD thresholds and interference were about twice as large for older compared to younger listeners. Interferers ≤1 kHz produced 2-3 times as much across-frequency binaural interference for older compared to younger listeners. Hearing thresholds were significant predictors of single-tone ILD thresholds; in addition, both target and interferer hearing thresholds were significant predictors of binaural interference. The results suggest a reweighting of binaural information that occurs with advancing age and age-related high-frequency hearing loss. This evidence of plasticity may help explain some of the age-related changes in spatial-hearing abilities.",,968
1257,35971358,A Comparative Study of Analgesic Efficacy of Epidural Ropivacaine With Dexmedetomidine Versus Ropivacaine With Ketamine in Adult Patients Undergoing Elective Lower Limb Surgery.,"Adjuvating of the epidural block with local anaesthetics during lower limb surgeries improves Intraoperative as well as postoperative analgesia. A comparison of epidural ropivacaine plus dexmedetomidine (RD) versus ropivacaine plus ketamine (RK) was done in terms of quality of the motor and sensory blockade, changes in hemodynamic parameters, and efficacy of analgesia.  A prospective randomized parallel double-blind study was conducted on 68 patients of the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade 1 and 2, ages 18 to 75 years, which were divided into two groups (RD and RK; 34 patients in each group). After receiving a loading dose through an epidural catheter consisting of 20ml of 0.5% ropivacaine, the epidural infusion was started after an hour of surgery at 5ml/hrs of 0.2% ropivacaine with 1µg/ml dexmedetomidine in Group RD and at 5ml/hrs of 0.2% ropivacaine with 0.5mg/ml ketamine in Group RK for 48 hours. Both groups were compared regarding the onset of sensory and motor block, resolution of sensory and motor block, hemodynamic parameters, analgesic efficacy, and total rescue analgesic requirement in 48 hours. A significant difference was observed in the time of resolution of sensory blockade which was 9.77±2.38 hrs in the RD group as compared to 7.79±1.82 hrs in the RK group (p-value 0.0003) and the time of resolution of motor block was 6.53±2.44 hrs in the RD group compared to 4.58±0.83 hrs in the RK group (p-value 0.001). Epidural dexmedetomidine significantly increases the duration of analgesia and duration of the motor blockade in comparison to ketamine.",,969
351,35979323,Delayed-onset endophthalmitis associated with Achromobacter species developed in acute form several months after cataract surgery: Three case reports.,"Achromobacter species-associated endophthalmitis is rare and may present as either acute or chronic postoperative endophthalmitis. Delayed-onset Achromobacter species endophthalmitis appearing in acute presentation that develops more than several months after cataract surgery is very rare. Intraocular lens (IOL) removal is commonly recommended to treat Achromobacter species endophthalmitis, which is based on previous studies. Here, we report the results of surgery without IOL removal when treating patients with delayed-onset postoperative Achromobacter species endophthalmitis that developed in an acute form. Three patients visited our ophthalmology clinic due to visual impairment that began 2-3 d earlier. They had undergone cataract surgery 5-18 mo prior. Best-corrected visual acuity of the diseased eye was between counting fingers at 30 cm to non-light perception. They showed conjunctival injection, inflammation in the anterior chamber (cell reaction 4+) and hypopyon formation. The patients were diagnosed with infectious endophthalmitis and immediately underwent pars plana vitrectomy, anterior chamber irrigation and intravitreal injection of ceftazidime and vancomycin. Before fluid infusion, a vitreous specimen was obtained. In all cases, the IOLs were not removed. Achromobacter species was detected on vitreous specimen culture. After surgery, the vitreous opacity decreased gradually and there was little retinal damage. At 1 mo after treatment, the best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/50 and 20/40. Delayed onset postoperative endophthalmitis caused by Achromobacter species can appear in an acute form. All patients responded well to early vitrectomy and administration of empirical antibiotics including ceftazidime. There was no need for IOL removal during surgery.",,970
1051,35974568,Emergence of quantum spin frustration in spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg model on a decorated honeycomb lattice.,"We study the spin-1/2 Ising-XXZ model on a decorated honeycomb lattice composed of five spins per unit cell, one Ising spin, and four Heisenberg spins. This model involving the Heisenberg exchange interaction is one of the few models that can be exactly solvable through the generalized star-triangle transformation. The significance of this model is its close relationship to the fully decorated quantum Heisenberg honeycomb lattice since 4/5 of the particles are Heisenberg spins. We investigate the phase diagram at zero temperature and identify a relevant quantum spin frustrated phase resulting from the contribution of quantum Heisenberg exchange interaction. We obtain an exact residual entropy for the quantum spin frustrated phase, which coincides with the residual entropy of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Ising model on a triangular lattice. We also thoroughly explore its thermodynamic properties, focusing mainly on the frustrated region such as entropy, specific heat, spontaneous magnetization, and critical temperature under several conditions.",,971
853,35974870,"Postpartum Use of Shavari Bar® Improves Breast Milk Output: A Double-Blind, Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Clinical Study.","Background and objectives Appropriate nutrition, along with the establishment of lactation, is of paramount importance for the feeding mother and the growing neonate. Asparagus racemosus, a common name for Shatavari, is a well-known herb that has been used as a galactagogue in traditional Indian culture. It is also referenced in Ayurvedic medicine. Despite multiple formulations available, palatability has been a concern always as Shatavari is very bitter. We have devised a palatable and nutritionally rich formulation of Shatavari with no artificial ingredients. To understand the efficacy, we have conducted this double-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effect of oral Shatavari formulation (Shavari Bar®) on breast milk output in postpartum women. Methods A prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at two centers in women with gestational age 37 weeks or more who intended to breastfeed. Hundred and four women were screened, of which 78 were randomized to receive either bar containing Shatavari and oats (n=39, study) or an identical placebo bar (n=39, control). All 78 women completed the study, 61 delivered by a lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS), and 17 had a full-term normal vaginal delivery. Time to first noticeable breast fullness was measured and expressed milk volume measurements were done 72 hours after delivery or after consumption of four bars, whichever was later using a standardized breast pump. Comparison between the two groups was analyzed using a t-test. Results Demography and baseline data of patients enrolled were similar in the two groups. The mean total milk volume expressed was higher (p=0.008) with Shavari (64.74 ml) compared to placebo (49.69 ml). The time to breast fullness was shorter (p=0.024) with Shavari (30.49 hours) compared to placebo (38.09 hours). No adverse events were noted in either of the study groups. Global assessment of the satisfaction of mothers with lactation, the well-being of the child, taste, and ease of use was better in the treatment arm than in the placebo arm. Conclusion The use of the Shavari bar can be an effective option in postpartum women to establish early lactation and build confidence in breastfeeding along with nonpharmacological intervention.",,972
685,35975526,Association between Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin and Platelet Distribution Width Ratio and Knee Osteoarthritis Severity.,"The goal was to simply and efficiently predict the indicators of disease severity in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) patients. One hundred eighty-four patients with KOA and 126 healthy subjects were included. WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) was used as a reference index for disease severity in KOA patients, in which WOMAC < 80 was classified as mild and WOMAC ≥ 80 as moderate and severe. Blood routine parameters of the KOA and the healthy groups were analyzed by the Mann Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of mean corpuscular hemoglobin and platelet distribution width ratio (MPR) and monocyte and hemoglobin ratio (MHR) indicators. The correlation between MPR and MHR and disease severity of KOA was determined by bivariate regression analysis. Independent predictors of disease severity in patients with KOA were assessed by multivariate regression analysis. MPR, MHR, and WOMAC were significantly higher in the KOA group. The ROC curve indicated that the cutoff values of MPR and MHR were 2.09 and 0.0030, respectively, with sensitivity of 86.4% and 68.5% and specificity of 99.2% and 79.4%. Bivariate regression analysis found that MPR was better correlated with disease severity than MHR. The results of multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the MPR values of moderate and severe patients were more than 19 times that of mild patients, and the OR values were 21.695 and 19.558, respectively. MPR and MHR demonstrated a good correlation with disease severity in patients with KOA. MPR is a potential independent predictor of disease severity in patients with KOA.",,973
1587,35968297,Botulinum toxin injection combined with traditional swallowing rehabilitation improved cricopharyngeal dysfunction in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: A case report.,"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system, and often influence optic nerve and medulla oblongata. Previous studies found out that brain abnormalities were not rare in these patients. Medulla oblongata (MO) was commonly involved and usually located at dorsal part. Patients who diagnosed NMOSD with MO lesions were more likely to have dysphagia. Previous reports indicated that the symptoms and signs of NMOSD patients could be controlled after immunosuppressive therapy. This patient was a 49-year-old Asian woman presented with recurrent vomiting and diagnosed NMOSD with MO involvement. However, after immunotherapy in other hospital, she still suffered from dysphagia. She then came to our department and completed videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) and high-resolution pharyngeal manometry (HRPM). Her UES was not opening with aspiration and the UES residue pressure was higher than normal range, we figured that she had cricopharyngeal (CP) dysfunction. Then the SLP gave her traditional treatment, including catheter balloon dilation. But she failed improvement after treatment for 2 weeks. Then the clinicians decided to inject botulinum toxin (BTX) into her CP muscles, which needed specific location and appropriate dosage. Her UES residue pressure decreased after three times BTX injection. During this time, her SLP adjusted the treatment strategies based on her VFSS and HRM results. Combined BTX injection with traditional treatment, she can now eat food orally without restrictions. This case report we presented can provide treatment strategies for similar patients with dysphagia.",,974
2340,35967037,Quality-Relevant Process Monitoring with Concurrent Locality-Preserving Dynamic Latent Variable Method.,"A concurrent locality-preserving dynamic latent variable (CLDLV) method is proposed to extract the correlation between process variables and quality variables for quality-related dynamic process monitoring. Given that dynamic process data can easily be contaminated by noise and outliers and conventional dynamic latent variable models lack robustness, a low-rank autoregressive model is developed to deal with autocorrelation and cross-correlation properties among the data. Then neighborhood structure information is integrated into the partial least squares model, which can better reveal the essential structure of the data. The final concurrent projection of the latent structures is employed to monitor output-related faults and input-related process faults that affect quality. The Tennessee Eastman process and hot strip mill process are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of CLDLV-based detection and diagnostic methods.",,975
1077,35974542,Fock-space approach to stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered models.,"We investigate the stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model of infectious disease dynamics in the Fock-space approach. In contrast to conventional SIR models based on ordinary differential equations for the subpopulation sizes of S, I, and R individuals, the stochastic SIR model is driven by a master equation governing the transition probabilities among the system's states defined by SIR occupation numbers. In the Fock-space approach the master equation is recast in the form of a real-valued Schrödinger-type equation with a second quantization Hamiltonian-like operator describing the infection and recovery processes. We find exact analytic expressions for the Hamiltonian eigenvalues for any population size N. We present small- and large-N results for the average numbers of SIR individuals and basic reproduction number. For small N we also obtain the probability distributions of SIR states, epidemic sizes and durations, which cannot be found from deterministic SIR models. Our Fock-space approach to stochastic SIR models introduces a powerful set of tools to calculate central quantities of epidemic processes, especially for relatively small populations where statistical fluctuations not captured by conventional deterministic SIR models play a crucial role.",,976
1171,35973364,Longitudinal survey of humoral and cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.,"Data regarding humoral and cellular response against SARS-CoV-2 in children are scarce. We analysed seroconversion rate, decrease of anti-RBD IgG antibodies over time and T-cell response in paediatric patients who suffered COVID-19. Longitudinal study of paediatric patients COVID-19 diagnosed by positive molecular assay in nasopharyngeal swabs. Blood samples were drawn 1-2 months and 6-7 months after acute infection. Anti-RBD IgG were determined using the Alinity® SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay (Abbott). Cellular immune response was analysed by T-SPOT® SARS-CoV-2 assay kit (Oxford Immunotec Ltd.). 27/39 (69,2%) patients seroconverted. Despite a significant decrease in antibody levels over time (p < 0,01), no children seroreverted between first and second visits. Only 6/16 (37,2%) children under 6 years-old were seropositive compared to 21/23 (91,3%) over 6 years-old (p < 0,01). Highest antibody levels were found in seropositive younger children (p = 0,036). Thirteen (33,3%) children showed T-cell response. Among participants showing humoral response, no cellular response was detected in 14 (51,9%). Anti-RBD IgG antibodies persistence at 6-7-months after SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed. A different IgG response was found depending on age. As measured by T-SPOT, most patients did not display cellular response 6-7 months after infection.",,977
2356,35967020,Toward the Integration of a Silicon/Graphite Anode-Based Lithium-Ion Battery in Photovoltaic Charging Battery Systems.,"Solar photovoltaic (PV) energy generation is highly dependent on weather conditions and only applicable when the sun is shining during the daytime, leading to a mismatch between demand and supply. Merging PVs with battery storage is the straightforward route to counteract the intermittent nature of solar generation. Capacity (or energy density), overall efficiency, and stability at elevated temperatures are among key battery performance metrics for an integrated PV-battery system. The performance of high-capacity silicon (Si)/graphite (Gr) anode and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) cathode cells at room temperature, 45, and 60 °C working temperatures for PV modules are explored. The electrochemical performance of both half and full cells are tested using a specially formulated electrolyte, 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate: diethyl carbonate, with 5 wt % fluoroethylene carbonate, 2 wt % vinylene carbonate, and 1 wt % (2-cyanoethyl)triethoxysilane. To demonstrate solar charging, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are coupled to the developed batteries, following the evaluation of each device. An overall efficiency of 8.74% under standard PV test conditions is obtained for the PSC charged lithium-ion battery via the direct-current-direct-current converter, showing the promising applicability of silicon/graphite-based anodes in the PV-battery integrated system.",,978
1575,35968311,Predicting the rupture status of small middle cerebral artery aneurysms using random forest modeling.,"Small intracranial aneurysms are increasingly being detected; however, a prediction model for their rupture is rare. Random forest modeling was used to predict the rupture status of small middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms with morphological features. From January 2009 to June 2020, we retrospectively reviewed patients with small MCA aneurysms (<7 mm). The aneurysms were randomly split into training (70%) and internal validation (30%) cohorts. Additional independent datasets were used for the external validation of 78 small MCA aneurysms from another four hospitals. Aneurysm morphology was determined using computed tomography angiography (CTA). Prediction models were developed using the random forest and multivariate logistic regression. A total of 426 consecutive patients with 454 small MCA aneurysms (<7 mm) were included. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that size ratio (SR), aspect ratio (AR), and daughter dome were associated with aneurysm rupture, whereas aneurysm angle and multiplicity were inversely associated with aneurysm rupture. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) of random forest models using the five independent risk factors in the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts were 0.922, 0.889, and 0.92, respectively. The random forest model outperformed the logistic regression model (p = 0.048). A nomogram was developed to assess the rupture of small MCA aneurysms. Random forest modeling is a good tool for evaluating the rupture status of small MCA aneurysms and may be considered for the management of small aneurysms.",,979
1074,35974545,Perturbative expansion of irreversible work in symmetric and asymmetric processes.,"The systematic expansion method of the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is developed by generalizing the formulation proposed in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50, 325001 (2017)10.1088/1751-8121/aa7af4]. Using this method, we obtain an alternative formula to calculate the mean work perturbatively which is applicable to systems with degeneracy in the eigenvalues of the Fokker-Planck operator. This method enables us to study how the geometrical symmetry affects thermodynamic description of a Brownian particle. To illustrate the application of the derived theory, we consider the Fokker-Planck equation with a two-dimensional harmonic potential. To investigate the effect of symmetry of the potential, we study thermodynamic properties in symmetric and asymmetric deformation processes of the potential: the rotational symmetry of the harmonic potential is held in the former, but it is broken in the latter. Optimized deformations in these processes are defined by minimizing mean work. Comparing these optimized processes, we find that the difference between the symmetric and asymmetric processes is maximized when the deformation time of the potential is given by a critical time which is characterized by the relaxation time of the Fokker-Planck equation. This critical time in the mean work is smaller than that of the change of the mean energy because of the hysteresis effect in the irreversible processes.",,980
375,35979299,Acute methanol poisoning with bilateral diffuse cerebral hemorrhage: A case report.,"Acute methanol poisoning (AMP) is a systemic disease that mainly affects the central nervous system and is characterized by ocular damage and metabolic acidosis. If appropriate treatments are inadequate or delayed, the mortality can exceed 40%. As the most serious complication, cerebral hemorrhage is rare with reported prevalence of 7%-19%. A 62-year-old man drank liquor mixed with 45% methanol and 35% alcohol. His vision blurred 10 h later and he fell into coma in another 9 h. Serum toxicological tests were performed immediately, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was carried out as the lactic acid exceeded 15 mmol/L and blood pH was 6.78. In addition, the toxicological report revealed 1300.5 μg/mL of methanol in serum and 1500.2 μg/mL in urine. After 59 h of CRRT, the methanol level decreased to 126.0 μg/mL in serum and 151.0 μg/mL in urine. However, the patient was still unconscious and his pupillary light reflex was slow. Computed tomography showed hemorrhage in the left putamen. After 16 d of life support treatment, putamen hemorrhage developed into diffuse symmetric intracerebral hemorrhage. In the end, his family gave up and the patient was discharged, and died in a local hospital. Cerebral hemorrhage requires constant vigilance during the full course of treatment for severe cases of AMP.",,981
1267,35971348,Comparative Evaluation of Solubility of Gutta-Percha in Three Different Solvents: A Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) Study.,"Background Gutta-percha is the most frequently used filling material for root canal obturation. This thermoplastic material fulfills the primary requisites for root canal filling, one of which is easily removable material in cases of endodontic retreatment. The most commonly used solvents were chloroform, xylene, and orange oil due to their effectiveness in dissolving and removing maximum gutta-percha in a minimum time. Aims The aim is to evaluate and compare the solubility of gutta-percha in three different organic solvents, i.e., orange oil, xylene, and chloroform. Methods and material Forty extracted mandibular second premolars with a single canal were selected. The sample was categorized into control, orange oil, xylene, and chloroform. Access cavity preparations with cleaning and shaping were performed by k files and rotary files, followed by obturation. Two drops of assigned solvent were placed on the orifices of the obturated canal, and corona-gutta-percha ha was removed by gates glidden drills. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were taken before and after the gutta-percha removal, and the solvents' efficacy was assessed. Statistical analysis The statistical test applied for the analysis was one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The confidence interval and p-value were set for this test at 95% and < 0.05, respectively. Results Gutta-percha Removal was found to be maximum with orange oil (Group II) followed by xylene (Group III) >Chloroform (Group IV) >Control Group. The Statistical Analysis by ANOVA revealed a significant difference between the four groups with a p-value of less than 0.05. Furthermore, the pair-wise comparison revealed that the amount of gutta-percha removal with orange oil significantly differs from xylene and chloroform, with a significance level of less than 0.021,001. However, there was no difference observed between control and chloroform. Conclusions Within the limitations of this in vitro study, it can be concluded that the maximum amount of gutta-percha removal was found in the orange oil group. The amount of gutta-percha removal with orange oil significantly differs from xylene and chloroform, with a significance level of less than 0.02,001. Hence there was no difference observed between Control and Chloroform groups.",,982
1852,35967788,The effects of whey protein fibrils on the linear and non-linear rheological properties of a gluten-free dough.,"The increasing awareness of the celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder caused by the consumption of products containing gluten, has led to a growing interest in the development of gluten-free bakery products. In this study, whey protein fibrils (WPFs) were incorporated to mimic the fibrous network of gluten. The rheological properties and microstructure of the developed gluten-free doughs were evaluated and compared with gluten doughs. Protein fibrils were prepared by heating a whey protein isolate (WPI) solution at 80°C in an acidic environment with low salt concentration, and then the fibril lengths were adjusted by leveling up the solution pH to 3.5 and 7. The dimensions of the fibrils were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Rice and potato starches were mixed with fibrils, WPI, gluten, or without protein, to form different doughs for further investigation. Shear tests, including stress sweep, frequency sweep, and creep recovery, were performed to study the viscoelastic properties of doughs under small or large deformation. The strain-hardening properties of doughs under biaxial extension were studied by the lubricated squeezing flow method. The microstructure of the doughs was characterized by cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM). Compared with doughs prepared with WPI and no proteins, doughs incorporating fibrils showed comparable linear viscoelasticity to gluten dough tested with stress sweep, frequency sweep, and creep recovery in the linear viscoelastic region. More differences between the protein fibril doughs were revealed in the rheological properties in the non-linear region. Creep recovery parameters, such as compliance, elastic moduli during the creep, and recovery stages of gluten dough, were like those of WPF pH7 dough, but significantly different from those of the WPF pH3.5 dough. Strain-hardening properties were found in the WPF pH7 dough, although not in WPF pH3.5 dough. Microstructural characterization showed that both fibrils prepared with the different conditions formed a continuous protein phase for the improvement of dough cohesiveness, but the structure of the phase was different between the two fibrils. To summarize, whey protein fibril at pH 7 seemed to have the potential of being used as an ingredient with similar functions to gluten in gluten-free bakery products.",,983
1766,35967958,Potential Process Control Issues with Pemetrexed.,"Pemetrexed is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor used in treatment of locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer and for mesothelioma. Intra-lot and inter-lot variability in the spectra of ALIMTA® was detected in the Drug Quality Study (DQS) using Fourier transform near-infrared spectrometry (FTNIR). One vial of 12 (8%) sampled from lot S20I013A appeared 3.0 multidimensional SDs from the other vials, suggesting that it represents a different material. Consequently, additional spectra from other lots were analyzed. Spectra of 147 vials from 23 lots in the spectral library contained 14 vials that were outside the main group (26.4 SDs using a subcluster detection test), suggesting that the 14 library vials (9.5% of the total) also contain differing materials.",,984
237,35982776,Recruitment and Retention of Urban Pregnant Women to a Clinical Study Administering an Oral Isotope Dietary Tracer.,"Pregnant women are a vulnerable population that are difficult to engage in clinical research. We report successful recruitment and retention strategies used in a longitudinal pilot study of urban racially/ethnically diverse pregnant women that involved administration of an orally ingested isotope tracer, multiple venipunctures, biopsy of placenta after delivery, and cord or placental blood collection. We used direct strategies to recruit English-speaking obese and nonobese pregnant women aged 17-45 years, who were in the third trimester of pregnancy. The study required data collection at 32-34 and 34-36 gestational weeks and delivery. Strategies included frequent personal engagement with participants and staff to build relationships and trust, tangible appreciation, and the study team being present at delivery. In addition, leveraging hospital information technology (IT) services was critical to ensure retention through labor and delivery (LD). A racially (52% Black, 23% White, and 10% other) and ethnically (15% Hispanic or Latinx) diverse sample of pregnant women was enrolled. Of the 52 women enrolled, 85% of women completed all procedures. This is the first report of successful strategies for recruitment and retention of racially/ethnically diverse pregnant women in a longitudinal study requiring oral administration of an isotope tracer. Personal engagement with multiple touch points, starting with recruitment and continuing regularly throughout the third trimester, was the most successful strategy. Creating and maintaining relationships with the LD providers and staff and utilizing hospital IT, including targeted electronic medical record alerts, ensured successful retention for the duration of the study. Not applicable.",,985

In the present study, it is demonstrated that birefringence image contrast variation in off-axis SiC wafers corresponds to the in-plane shear stress under conditions slightly deviating from crossed Nicols according to both theoretical consideration and experimental observation. The current results indicate that the characterization of defects in SiC wafers is possible to achieve by birefringence imaging.",,986
40,35983691,Role of Genes in Regulating Host Plants Expansion in Tephritid Fruit Flies (Diptera) and Potential for RNAi-Based Control.,"Host plant expansion is an important survival strategy for tephritids as they expand their range. Successful host expansion requires tephritids to adapt to the chemical and nonchemical properties of a novel host fruit, such as fruit color, phenology, and phytochemicals. These plant properties trigger a series of processes in tephritids, with each process having its own genetic basis, which means that various genes are involved in regulating host plant expansion by tephritids. This review summarizes current knowledge on the categories and roles of genes involved in host plant expansion in several important tephritid species, including genes related to chemoreception (olfactory and gustation), vision, digestion, detoxification, development, ribosomal and energy metabolism. Chemoreception- and detoxification- and digestion-related genes are stimulated by volatile chemicals and secondary chemicals of different hosts, respectively, which are involved in the regulation of nervous signal transduction that triggers behavioral, physical, and chemical responses to the novel host fruit. Vision-, nerve-, and development-related genes and metabolism-associated genes are activated in response to nonchemical stimuli from different hosts, such as color and phenology, to regulate a comprehensive adaptation of the extending host for tephritids. The chemical and nonchemical signals of hosts activate ribosomal and energy-related genes that result in the basic regulation of many processes of host expansion, including detoxification and development. These genes do not regulate novel host use individually, but multiple genes regulate multilevel adaptation to novel host fruits via multiple mechanisms. These genes may also be potential target genes for RNAi-based control of tephritid pests.",,987
2299,35967132,Food Aspiration Induced Hypoxic Encephalopathy Leading to Status Epilepticus.,"Cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) is an emergency that can easily lead to death without appropriate life support. Even if the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved, survivors of sudden cardiac arrest have sustained various degrees of hypoxic encephalopathy. In Japan, rural community hospitals tend to provide care to patients with status epilepticus caused by hypoxic encephalopathy after CPA without sufficient resources. These hospitals neither have enough staff or equipment nor can they perform all the tests required to accurately estimate the prognosis. However, simple methods can be used for better estimation, including reviewing information on arrival, physical examinations, and imaging tests. Herein, we report a case of status epilepticus caused by hypoxic encephalopathy due to food aspiration in a 72-year-old man. For the sake of patients and their families, hospitals without sufficient staff or equipment should try to estimate the prognosis of patients in a manner similar to that described in this report.",,988
1384,35969056,Ensemble Force Spectroscopy by Shear Forces.,"Single-molecule techniques based on fluorescence and mechanochemical principles provide superior sensitivity in biological sensing. However, due to the lack of high throughput capabilities, the application of these techniques is limited in biophysics. Ensemble force spectroscopy (EFS) has demonstrated high throughput in the investigation of a massive set of molecular structures by converting mechanochemical studies of individual molecules into those of molecular ensembles. In this protocol, the DNA secondary structures (i-motifs) were unfolded in the shear flow between the rotor and stator of a homogenizer tip at shear rates up to 77796/s. The effects of flow rates and molecular sizes on the shear forces experienced by the i-motif were demonstrated. The EFS technique also revealed the binding affinity between DNA i-motifs and ligands. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a click chemistry reaction that can be actuated by shear force (i.e., mechano-click chemistry). These results establish the effectiveness of using shear force to control the conformation of molecular structures.",,989
854,35974869,Factors Explaining the Coincidence of Smoldering Multiple Myeloma and Primary Biliary Cholangitis: A Case Report.,"To date, there have been nine reported instances of coinciding smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). The term SMM was coined in 1980 to describe low-severity multiple myeloma cases, a hematologic neoplasia that involves the malignant proliferation of plasma cells. PBC is an autoimmune disorder targeting the intrahepatic bile ducts and is characterized by elevated anti-mitochondrial antibodies and often resulting in autoimmune liver cirrhosis. Currently, there is no plausible rationale for the coincidence of SMM and PBC in patients. This report investigates the relationship between SMM and PBC in a Hispanic 49-year-old female residing in the United States and attempts to determine the possible genetic and biochemical causes of this coincidence.",,990
1938,35967671,"Toward Sustainable Development: Unleashing the Mechanism Among International Technology Spillover, Institutional Quality, and Green Innovation Capability.","Under the background of sustainable development, China's economic growth engine becomes innovation-driven, and it is an important way for China to rapidly improve its green innovation capability by opening up to the outside world and utilizing the spillover effect of international technology. In this article, the system quality evaluation system is reconstructed by the method of fully arranged polygonal graphical indicators, and the provincial system quality in China is measured and added into the model as a regulating variable. The dynamic panel method and the dynamic threshold panel method are used to test the direct effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign trade on green innovation capability, the interaction effect of institutional quality, and the threshold effect. Empirical results show that the three technology spillovers have significantly promoted China's green innovation capability. System quality will affect the determining coefficient of international technology spillovers on China's green innovation capability. The positive promoting effects of FDI and foreign trade on China's green innovation capability, all increase with the improvement of China's system quality. Therefore, when utilizing FDI and foreign trade to promote green innovation in each region, each region should consider creating a good institutional environment for the emergence of international technological effects.",,991
924,35974766,Caged bulky organic dyes in a polyaromatic framework and their spectroscopic peculiarities.,"Host-guest structures and properties have been widely studied using relatively small dyes (<1 nm) without bulky groups, due to their smooth incorporation, efficient host-guest interactions, and high analytical accessibility. In this report, on the other hand, three types of sterically demanding organic dyes trapped by a polyaromatic cage were investigated by spectroscopic analyses on the basis of supramolecular interactions. Coumarins with two bulky substituents are bound by the cage in aqueous solution. The resultant caged dyes show unusual emission enhancement, depending on the difference of a single heteroatom in their substituents. The color of perylene bisimides with two bulky substituents is remarkably changed from yellow to red upon caging. This peculiarity stems from the twist of the substituents in the cage, revealed by the combination of absorption and theoretical studies. Furthermore, tetrasubstituted, bulky porphyrins are caught by the cage in aqueous solution. The caged bulky dyes also display altered color and absorption properties, which remain intact even under acidic conditions. In contrast to typical covalent functionalization and previous host-guest studies toward small and non-bulky dyes, the unusual, non-covalent spectroscopic modulation of the large and bulky dyes can be accomplished for the first time by the present cage, featuring a prolate polyaromatic framework with four openings.",,992

Advanced Chinese learners of English and native English-speaking controls performed an online acceptability judgment task to investigate how advanced L2 learners processed congruent (sharing the same meaning and structure in L1 language) collocations and English-only (not equivalent in L1 construction) collocations with the same node (right) word and a different collocate (left). The experimental materials included verb-noun (VN), adjective-noun (AN) collocations, free (less fixed), and restricted (more fixed) collocations chosen from BNC. The results revealed that (i) The non-native speakers were sensitive to L1-L2 congruency, but the native speakers were not. (ii) The native speakers were sensitive to collocation restriction, whereas the non-native speakers were not. These results lend initial support to the mapping hypothesis and open choice principle of L2 collocational processing for Chinese English learners.",,993
751,35975086,Synthesis and bioimaging of a BODIPY-based fluorescence quenching probe for Fe3.,"Iron is the main substance for maintaining life. Real-time determination of ferric ion (Fe3+) in living cells is of great significance for understanding the relationship of Fe3+ concentration changes with various physiological and pathological processes. Fluorescent probes are suitable for the detection of trace metal ions in cells due to their low toxicity and high sensitivity. In this work, a boron-dipyrromethene-based fluorescent probe (BODIPY-CL) for selective detection of Fe3+ was synthesized. The fluorescence emission of BODIPY-CL was determined at 516 nm. In a pH range of 1 to 10, the probe BODIPY-CL exhibits a quenching response to Fe3+. Meanwhile, BODIPY-CL showed a highly selective response to Fe3+ compared with 16 kinds of metal ions. The stoichiometry ratio of BODIPY-CL bound to Fe3+ was nearly 2 : 1. The fluorescence quenching response obtained by the sensor was linear with the Fe3+ concentration in the range of 0-400 μM, and the detection limit was 2.9 μM. BODIPY-CL was successfully applied to image Fe3+ in cells. This study provides a promising fluorescent imaging probe for further research on the physiological and pathological effects of Fe3+.",,994

1426,35968473,Evaluating the impact and cost-effectiveness of chlamydia management strategies in Hong Kong: A modeling study.,"To illustrate the epidemiologic and cost-effectiveness impact of shifting the focus from population-based screening toward a targeted management approach for genital chlamydia infection. Modeling study, implementing an individual-based, stochastic, dynamic network model. Hong Kong. A hypothetical sample network of 10,000 people with a partnership distribution based on Hong Kong's sexually active population of reproductive age (age 18-49 years). In this study, we present several scenarios with different implementations of universal vs. targeted screening (based on partner numbers). We also explored the impact of (1) screening only, (2) screening plus expedited partner therapy, and (3) screening plus partner testing. Change of chlamydia prevalence before and after implementing the different strategies. The cost-effectiveness analysis reports total direct cost from a health provider perspective, the QALYs gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). In comparing the effects of universal screening only and targeted screening of the high-risk population, the mean prevalence during the 10th year of intervention was 2.75 ± 0.30% and 2.35 ± 0.21%, respectively (compared with 3.24 ± 0.30% and 3.35 ± 0.21% before the interventions, respectively). The addition of contact tracing to the latter targeted screening scenario reduces the mean prevalence during the 10th year of intervention to 1.48 ± 0.13% (compared with 3.31 ± 0.33% at baseline) in the best-case of testing before treatment and maximal contact-tracing effectiveness (40%). Overall, the most effective scenarios were those for which interventions focused on the high-risk population defined by the number of partners, with contact tracing included. The ICER for targeted screening with contact tracing at 20% and 40% efficiency was $4,634 and $7,219 per QALY gained, respectively (10-year time horizon). Expedited partner therapy did not significantly impact overall chlamydia prevalence and caused overtreatment. Our study suggests that targeted screening with strengthened contact tracing efforts is the most cost-effective strategy to reduce the prevalence of chlamydia in Hong Kong.",,996
2417,35966879,Arterial and venous vascular complications in patients requiring peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of arterial and venous complications in patients requiring peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) and its risk factors at the time of cannulation and during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support and to assess vascular complications in association with decannulation. Between January 2010 to January 2020, out of 1,030 eligible patients requiring VA-ECMO, 427 with analyzable vascular screening were included. Duplex sonography and/or CT scan after decannulation were used to screen for thrombosis and pulmonary embolism as well as arterial complications. Near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) was established at the time of cannulation and was continuously monitored during the ECMO therapy. The prevalence of venous complications was 27%. Thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were observed in 21 and 7% of patients, respectively. Pulmonary embolism was more frequently diagnosed in patients with thrombosis (22 vs. 3%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, cannulation in the jugular vein was determined as a risk factor for venous thrombosis in contrast to the extent of anticoagulation. The prevalence of arterial complications was 37%, mainly ischemia followed by bleeding, dissection, and compartment syndrome. Vascular surgery was necessary for 19% of the patients, of whome 1% required major amputations. A distal perfusion cannula (DPC) was implanted at cannulation in 24% of patients and secondarily in 16% of patients after cannulation as required during ECMO support. In the multivariate analysis, risk factors for leg ischemia at the time of cannulation were elevated D-dimers, lower NIRS on the cannulated leg, and lack of a DPC. The best discriminative parameter was the difference in NIRS between the non-cannulated leg and the cannulated leg. In contrast, during ECMO support, only the lack of a DPC was associated with leg ischemia. A similar rate of complications associated with decannulation, mainly arterial thrombosis, ischemia, or bleeding, was seen with percutaneous and surgical approaches (18 vs. 17%, p = 0.295). Patients requiring VA ECMO should be routinely screened for vascular complications. The decision to insert a DPC should be evaluated individually. However, NIRS monitoring of the cannulated leg and the non-cannulated leg is essential to identify the legs at risk for critical ischemia. As complications associated with decannulation were equally distributed between percutaneous and surgical approaches, the applied method may be chosen according to local experience.",,997
1418,35968483,Intelligent automatic sleep staging model based on CNN and LSTM.,"Since electroencephalogram (EEG) is a significant basis to treat and diagnose somnipathy, sleep electroencephalogram automatic staging methods play important role in the treatment and diagnosis of sleep disorders. Due to the characteristics of weak signals, EEG needs accurate and efficient algorithms to extract feature information before applying it in the sleep stages. Conventional feature extraction methods have low efficiency and are difficult to meet the time validity of fast staging. In addition, it can easily lead to the omission of key features owing to insufficient a priori knowledge. Deep learning networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have powerful processing capabilities in data analysis and data mining. In this study, a deep learning network is introduced into the study of the sleep stage. In this study, the feature fusion method is presented, and long-term and short-term memory (LSTM) is selected as the classification network to improve the accuracy of sleep stage recognition. First, based on EEG and deep learning network, an automatic sleep phase method based on a multi-channel EGG is proposed. Second, CNN-LSTM is used to monitor EEG and EOG samples during sleep. In addition, without any signal preprocessing or feature extraction, data expansion (DA) can be realized for unbalanced data, and special data and non-general data can be deleted. Finally, the MIT-BIH dataset is used to train and evaluate the proposed model. The experimental results show that the EEG-based sleep phase method proposed in this paper provides an effective method for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, and hence has a practical application value.",,998
1939,35967670,Correlational study on cyberbullying and social abilities in intercultural teenagers.,"This article analyzes the relationship between cyberbullying profile by racist reasons and social abilities in a group of intercultural teenagers living in Spain (N = 1478). The study includes participants aged between 12 and 16 years old (M = 13.99; SD = 1.352). Of these, 738 were male (49.9%) and 740 were female (50.1%). A correlational study was carried out using online tools with suitable psychometrics parameters (content-construct validity and reliability). The first one was a scale that measured social abilities, and the second one evaluated racist or xenophobic cyberbullying, differentiating the victim and aggressor profiles. The results indicated five main findings: (1) generally, the participants analyzed present all their social abilities; (2) for the most part, these participants do not normally experience cyberbullying; (3) a positive correlation exists between the majority of social abilities analyzed and the cybervictim profile. It was also observed a negative correlation between the social ability associated with the ability of making requests and this profile; (4) there is a positive correlation among the six social abilities analyzed and the cyberaggressor profile; (5) the racist or xenophobic cyberbullying are driven not only by the absence of social abilities, but in some cases, they are also driven by socio-demographic variables (i.e., age and gender). Likewise, this work shows how the absence of some social abilities in some participants involve racist or xenophobic experiences as victims and as aggressors, which may be of interest for the analysis of teenagers' behavior in intercultural contexts, as well as according to age and gender. More transcultural research need to be carried out to know the global perspective of the link between social abilities and the different profiles of racist and xenophobic cyberbullying, framed in the context of social psychology and studies of mass communication.",,999
1088,35974531,Reconstructing the dynamical quantum phase transitions via dimensional expansion in a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model.,"We know that a one-dimensional (1D) modulated system can simulate 2D topological states by expanding the dimension. This scenario provides a justifiable avenue to test the dilatation of the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT). Through a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we have shown how the Loschmidt echo, Fisher zero, and Dynamical topological order parameter (DTOP) transit from one to two dimensions. Owing to the introduced pseudomomentum, the derivative of the return rate does not always capture the DQPT well, but the Fisher zero and the DTOP can be treated as faithful indicators. A topology-independent parameter will also affect the occurrence of the DQPTs for quenches inside a given phase. Moreover, a comparison with the Haldane model owning the same phase diagram implies that a pair of fixed points will lead to different critical momentum distributions, thus different robustness, further reminding us that the correspondences between the equilibrium and dynamical phases transitions are multifarious.",,1000
1073,35974546,Collective effects on the performance and stability of quantum heat engines.,"Recent predictions for quantum-mechanical enhancements in the operation of small heat engines have raised renewed interest in their study both from a fundamental perspective and in view of applications. One essential question is whether collective effects may help to carry enhancements over larger scales, when increasing the number of systems composing the working substance of the engine. Such enhancements may consider not only power and efficiency, that is, its performance, but, additionally, its constancy, that is, the stability of the engine with respect to unavoidable environmental fluctuations. We explore this issue by introducing a many-body quantum heat engine model composed by spin pairs working in continuous operation. We study how power, efficiency, and constancy scale with the number of spins composing the engine and introduce a well-defined macroscopic limit where analytical expressions are obtained. Our results predict power enhancements, in both finite-size and macroscopic cases, for a broad range of system parameters and temperatures, without compromising the engine efficiency, accompanied by coherence-enhanced constancy for finite sizes. We discuss these quantities in connection to thermodynamic uncertainty relations.",,1001
201,35982821,Evaluation of Reconstruction Algorithms to Validate the NEMA Phantom Results in Clinical Scenario - A Comparative Study Using Time-of-Flight versus Non-Time-of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography Imaging.,"The objective is to standardize the reconstruction parameters for the time-of-flight (TOF) versus non-TOF positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging data and validation of the same in a clinical setting. The four spheres (10.0/13.0/17.0/22.0 mm) of the PET phantom (NEMA IQ Nu 2-2001) were filled with four times higher activity of [18F]-NaF than the background (5.3kBq/mL). Imaging (image matrix - 128 × 128 × 47, 2 min, 3D model) was done using two different (TOF/non-TOF) PET scanners. Phantom data were reconstructed in TOF and non-TOF modes for lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate and non-TOF mode for bismuth germanate-based PET scanners. The reconstructed data (by varying iteration and subsets) that provided the best image contrast and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were evaluated. The whole-body [18F]-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT scans (7-8 frames; 2.0 min/frame) in 16 lymphoma patients were acquired at 60 min after injecting the radioactivity (370.0-444.0 MBq of [18F]-FDG. The clinical PET/CT data were reconstructed using phantom-derived reconstruction parameters and evaluated for image contrast and SNR of the detected lesions. TOF reconstruction at second iteration provided significantly (P ≤ 0.02) higher SNR (20.7) and contrast (contrast recovery coefficient/background variability = 3.21) for the smallest hot lesions (10.0 mm) in the phantom than the non-TOF system. Similarly, in patient data analysis for the selected FDG avid lesions, the SNR values were significantly (P = 0.02) higher (13.3 ± 6.49) in TOF than (11 ± 6.48) in non-TOF system. Further, the small (≤10.0 mm) lesions were seen more distinctly in TOF system. It is thus observed that TOF reconstruction converged faster than the non-TOF, and the applicability of the same may impact the image quality and interpretation in the clinical PET data. The validation of the phantom-based experimental reconstruction parameters to clinical PET imaging data is highly warranted.",,1002
997,35974622,"Discrete Boltzmann modeling of Rayleigh-Taylor instability: Effects of interfacial tension, viscosity, and heat conductivity.","The two-dimensional Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) in compressible flow with intermolecular interactions is probed via the discrete Boltzmann method. The effects of interfacial tension, viscosity, and heat conduction are investigated. It is found that the influences of interfacial tension on the perturbation amplitude, bubble velocity, and two kinds of entropy production rates all show differences at different stages of RTI evolution. It inhibits the RTI evolution at the bubble acceleration stage, while at the asymptotic velocity stage, it first promotes and then inhibits the RTI evolution. Viscosity and heat conduction inhibit the RTI evolution. Viscosity shows a suppressive effect on the entropy generation rate related to heat flow at the early stage but a first promotive and then suppressive effect on the entropy generation rate related to heat flow at a later stage. Heat conduction shows a promotive effect on the entropy generation rate related to heat flow at an early stage. Still, it offers a first promotive and then suppressive effect on the entropy generation rate related to heat flow at a later stage. By introducing the morphological boundary length, we find that the stage of exponential growth of the interface length with time corresponds to the bubble acceleration stage. The first maximum point of the interface length change rate and the first maximum point of the change rate of the entropy generation rate related to viscous stress can be used as a criterion for RTI to enter the asymptotic velocity stage.",,1003
1675,35968098,"Impact of Si on C, N, and P stoichiometric homeostasis favors nutrition and stem dry mass accumulation in sugarcane cultivated in tropical soils with different water regimes.","Studies with silicon (Si) in sugarcane indicate a greater response in productivity in plants under stress, and the underlying mechanisms of Si in the crop are poorly reported. In this context, the benefits of Si in the crop's stem production are expected to occur at the C:N:P stoichiometry level in plant tissues, benefiting plants with and without stress. However, the extension of this response may vary in different soils. Thus, this research aimed to evaluate if fertigation with Si modifies the C:N:P stoichiometry and if it can increase sugarcane's nutritional efficiency and vegetative and productive parameters. Therefore, three experiments were installed using pre-sprouted seedlings to cultivate sugarcane in tropical soils belonging to the Quartzarenic Neosol, Eutrophic Red Latosol, and Dystrophic Red Latosol classes. The treatments comprised a 2 × 2 factorial scheme in each soil. The first factor was composed without water restriction (water retention = 70%; AWD) and with water restriction (water retention = 35%; PWD). The second factor presented Si concentrations (0 mM and 1.8 mM) arranged in randomized blocks with five replications. Fertigation with Si increases the Si and P concentration, the C and N efficiency, the C:N ratio, and the dry mass production. However, it decreases the C and N concentration and the C:P, C:Si, and N:P ratios in sugarcane leaves and stems regardless of the water regime adopted in the three tropical soils. Cluster and principal components analysis indicated that the intensity of the beneficial effects of Si fertigation on sugarcane plants varies depending on the cultivation soil and water conditions. We found that Si can be used in sugarcane with and without water stress. It changes the C:N:P homeostasis enough to improve the nutritional efficiency of C, P, N, and, consequently, the dry mass accumulation on the stems, with variation in the different cultivated soils.",,1004
10,35985274,A portable clustering algorithm based on compact neighbors for face tagging.,"We focus on the following problem: Given a collection of unlabeled facial images, group them into the individual identities where the number of subjects is not known. To this end, a Portable clustering algorithm based on Compact Neighbors called PCN is proposed. (1) Benefiting from the compact neighbor, the local density of each sample can be determined automatically and only one user-specified parameter, the number of nearest neighbors k, is involved in our model. (2) More importantly, the performance of PCN is not sensitive to the number of nearest neighbors. Therefore this parameter is relatively easy to determine in practical applications. (3) The computational overhead of PCN is O(nk(k2+log(nk))) that is nearly linear with respect to the number of samples, which means it is easily scalable to large-scale problems. In order to verify the effectiveness of PCN on the face clustering problem, extensive experiments based on a two-stage framework (extracting features using a deep model and performing clustering in the feature space) have been conducted on 16 middle- and 5 large-scale benchmark datasets. The experimental results have shown the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, compared with state-of-the-art methods. [code].",,1005
1647,35968127,Development of multifunctional unmanned aerial vehicles versus ground seeding and outplanting: What is more effective for improving the growth and quality of rice culture?,"The agronomic processes are complex in rice production. The mechanization efficiency is low in seeding, fertilization, and pesticide application, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Currently, many kinds of research focus on the single operation of UAVs on rice, but there is a paucity of comprehensive applications for the whole process of seeding, fertilization, and pesticide application. Based on the previous research synthetically, a multifunctional unmanned aerial vehicle (mUAV) was designed for rice planting management based on the intelligent operation platform, which realized three functions of seeding, fertilizer spreading, and pesticide application on the same flight platform. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used for machine design. Field trials were used to measure operating parameters. Finally, a comparative experimental analysis of the whole process was conducted by comparing the cultivation patterns of mUAV seeding (T1) with mechanical rice direct seeder (T2), and mechanical rice transplanter (T3). The comprehensive benefit of different rice management processes was evaluated. The results showed that the downwash wind field of the mUAV fluctuated widely from 0 to 1.5 m, with the spreading height of 2.5 m, and the pesticide application height of 3 m, which meet the operational requirements. There was no significant difference in yield between T1, T2, and T3 test areas, while the differences in operational efficiency and input labor costs were large. In the sowing stage, T1 had obvious advantages since the working efficiency was 2.2 times higher than T2, and the labor cost was reduced by 68.5%. The advantages were more obvious compared to T3, the working efficiency was 4 times higher than in T3, and the labor cost was reduced by 82.5%. During the pesticide application, T1 still had an advantage, but it was not a significant increase in advantage relative to the seeding stage, in which operating efficiency increased by 1.3 times and labor costs were reduced by 25%. However, the fertilization of T1 was not advantageous due to load and other limitations. Compared to T2 and T3, operational efficiency was reduced by 80% and labor costs increased by 14.3%. It is hoped that this research will provide new equipment for rice cultivation patterns in different environments, while improving rice mechanization, reducing labor inputs, and lowering costs.",,1006

1000,35974619,Decoding polymer self-dynamics using a two-step approach.,"The self-correlation function and corresponding self-intermediate scattering function in Fourier space are important quantities for describing the molecular motions of liquids. This work draws attention to a largely overlooked issue concerning the analysis of these space-time density-density correlation functions of polymers. We show that the interpretation of non-Gaussian behavior of polymers is generally complicated by intrachain averaging of distinct self-dynamics of different segments. By the very nature of the mathematics involved, the averaging process not only conceals critical dynamical information, but also contributes to the observed non-Gaussian dynamics. To fully expose this issue and provide a thorough benchmark of polymer self-dynamics, we perform analyses of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of linear and ring polymer melts as well as several theoretical models using a two-step approach, where interchain and intrachain averagings of segmental self-dynamics are separated. While past investigations primarily focused on the average behavior, our results indicate that a more nuanced approach to polymer self-dynamics is clearly required.",,1008
785,35975052,Fabrication of a graphene-based sensor to detect the humidity and the temperature of a metal body with imprecise data analysis.,"Graphene is a 2D material with remarkable properties. The present study demonstrates the fabrication of a graphene-based sensor for measuring the temperature and humidity of a metal body. The graphene sensor was fabricated by depositing a thin film of graphene nanoparticles between silver electrodes (separated by ∼50 μm) on a glass substrate. The graphene thin film was characterized by XRD, Raman spectroscopy and UV-vis techniques. The capacitance and resistance for both the relative humidity (in the range of 0-100% RH) and temperature (in the range of 230-310 K) were measured using an LCR meter at 1 kHz in a controlled chamber. The graphene-based sensor expressed high sensitivity with fast response and recovery times for both humidity and temperature with long stability and low hysteresis curves. The sensor was also tested on a metal body, which expressed a good response time. Moreover, the measured data of capacitance and resistance was analyzed with classical and neutrosophic analysis as an application of modern material statistics. It was observed that neutrosophic analysis is more flexible for analyzing the capacitance and resistance of the fabricated sensor.",,1009
786,35975051,A turn-on fluorescent probe with high selectivity for Hg2+ and its applications in living cells.,"A novel fluorescent probe L with a rhodamine B lactam structure modified with 3-methyl-2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde has been prepared based on the thiophilicity of Hg2+. The probe L exhibits a unique response with an off-on-type mode towards Hg2+ among other biologically relevant metal cations. The limit of detection (LOD) for probe L is 1.5 ppb. In addition, in the presence of Hg2+, the probe L shows a colorimetric response from colorless to pink. The recognition behavior of probe L towards Hg2+ has been investigated by 1H NMR titration experiments, Job's plot, and MS and IR analyses. As a result, the ligation between the probe and Hg2+ leads to the scission of the spirolactam bond of free L and the restoration of its conjugated structure, which can give rise to the fluorescence enhancement of the probe L. Besides, it also can be used as a sensitivity probe in living cells for Hg2+ sensing, which can meet various needs in genetic and environmental samples.",,1010
868,35974855,Therapeutic Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin in Trigeminal Neuralgia.,"Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a unilateral, paroxysmal, sharp, shooting, or jabbing pain that occurs in the trigeminal nerve divisions, including the ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3) nerves. Typically, an episode is triggered by anything touching the face or teeth. TN is a clinical diagnosis with no specific diagnostic test; it is determined by the patient's medical history and pain description. Imaging is necessary to exclude secondary causes. The precise reason for TN is uncertain, but it is commonly believed to result from vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve root, typically near its origin in the pons. There are numerous surgical and medical treatment options available. The most frequently applied medical treatment therapies are carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. Surgical alternatives are reserved for patients who do not respond to medical treatment. Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) has emerged as a novel and promising alternative to surgery for individuals whose pain is unresponsive to medication. Multiple studies have established the safety and usefulness of BTX-A in treating TN, with the most significant benefits occurring between six weeks and three months after the surgery. This article reviews various studies published in the last 10 years regarding the therapeutic use of BTX-A in TN. These studies include various observational, clinical, pilot, and animal studies.",,1011

Demographic and CBC data were extracted from the electronic health system. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles were used to determine the reference intervals. Of a total of 1,388 participants, 53.82% were male. The majority 96% was less than 40 years old, and 85% were from the Central region. Gender-related differences were observed for the RBC count, Hb, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, and the platelet count. Age-related differences were observed for the RBC, Hb, HCT, and eosinophils. The WBC parameters did not differ by gender or age categories. Region-related differences were observed for the RBC, hemoglobin, HCT, MCV, WBC, and basophils. The platelet count was higher in the female group, the age group 40 years and above, and in the Western region. The prevalence of anemia was high in the female group and the Eastern region. The overall neutropenia rate was 12.8%. The data from this study provide hematological parameter reference ranges for the adult Saudi population by gender, age, and region. Gender and age-related differences were observed for the hematological parameters. Anemia was more frequent in the female group and the Eastern region. Caution must be taken when comparing or interpreting results from different age groups, gender, region of origin, and ethnicity.",,1012
2177,35967341,Identification of key interferon-stimulated genes for indicating the condition of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with highly heterogeneous clinical symptoms and severity. There is complex pathogenesis of SLE, one of which is IFNs overproduction and downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) upregulation. Identifying the key ISGs differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SLE and healthy people could help to further understand the role of the IFN pathway in SLE and discover potential diagnostic biomarkers. The differentially expressed ISGs (DEISG) in PBMCs of SLE patients and healthy persons were screened from two datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 67 DEISGs, including 6 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 61 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified by the DESeq2 R package. According to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, those DEISGs were mainly concentrated in the response to virus and immune system processes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showed that most of these DEISGs could interact strongly with each other. Then, IFIT1, RSAD2, IFIT3, USP18, ISG15, OASL, MX1, OAS2, OAS3, and IFI44 were considered to be hub ISGs in SLE by MCODE and Cytohubba plugins of Cytoscape, Moreover, the results of expression correlation suggested that 3 lncRNAs (NRIR, FAM225A, and LY6E-DT) were closely related to the IFN pathway. The lncRNA NRIR and mRNAs (RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15) were selected as candidate ISGs for verification. RT-qPCR results showed that PBMCs from SLE patients had substantially higher expression levels of 5 ISGs compared to healthy controls (HCs). Additionally, statistical analyses revealed that the expression levels of these ISGs were strongly associated to various clinical symptoms, including thrombocytopenia and facial erythema, as well as laboratory indications, including the white blood cell (WBC) count and levels of autoantibodies. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that the IFI44, USP18, RSAD2, and IFN score had good diagnostic capabilities of SLE. According to our study, SLE was associated with ISGs including NRIR, RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15, which may contribute to the future diagnosis and new personalized targeted therapies.",,1013
1324,35970009,Regional white matter hyperintensities in posterior cortical atrophy and logopenic progressive aphasia.,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are markers of cerebral small vessel disease and are associated with higher risk of typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease (tAD). Little is known about the frequency and distribution of WMH in atypical variants of AD, including logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). We investigated WMHs in 75 LPA, 39 PCA, and 50 tAD patients and associations with age, beta-amyloid PET burden, and cognition. PCA had greater subcortical WMHs in right occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes compared to LPA, and greater parieto-occipital subcortical and occipital periventricular WMHs than tAD. LPA had greater subcortical WMHs in left parietal lobe and deep white matter WMHs than PCA, and greater fronto-occipital subcortical and occipital periventricular WMHs than tAD. Total WMH increased with increasing age but was not related to beta-amyloid burden. Greater WMH was associated with visuoperceptual performance in LPA and PCA after correcting for atrophy. WMH topography differs across AD variants. Further work is needed to determine whether they reflect cerebrovascular disease or regionally specific neurodegenerative changes.",,1014
2120,35967398,The efficiency of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials.,"The objective of this study was to assess whether convalescent plasma therapy could offer survival advantages for patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An electronic search of Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library and MedRxiv was performed from January 1st, 2020 to April 1st, 2022. We included studies containing patients with COVID-19 and treated with CCP. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers and synthesized with a random-effect analysis model. The primary outcome was 28-d mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, ventilation-free days, 14-d mortality, improvements of symptoms, progression of diseases and requirements of mechanical ventilation. Safety outcomes included the incidence of all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool 2.0 was used to assess the potential risk of bias in eligible studies. The heterogeneity of results was assessed by I^2 test and Q statistic test. The possibility of publication bias was assessed by conducting Begg and Egger test. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method were used for quality of evidence. This study had been registered on PROSPERO, CRD42021273608. 32 RCTs comprising 21478 patients with Covid-19 were included. Compared to the control group, COVID-19 patients receiving CCP were not associated with significantly reduced 28-d mortality (CCP 20.0% vs control 20.8%; risk ratio 0.94; 95% CI 0.87-1.02; p = 0.16; I² = 8%). For all secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences between CCP group and control group. The incidence of AEs (26.9% vs 19.4%,; risk ratio 1.14; 95% CI 0.99-01.31; p = 0.06; I² = 38%) and SAEs (16.3% vs 13.5%; risk ratio 1.03; 95% CI 0.87-1.20; p = 0.76; I² = 42%) tended to be higher in the CCP group compared to the control group, while the differences did not reach statistical significance. In all, CCP therapy was not related to significantly improved 28-d mortality or symptoms recovery, and should not be viewed as a routine treatment for COVID-19 patients. CRD42021273608.

837,35974934,Hypophosphatemia after hemodialysis and its association with some clinical complications in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Beyond the adverse effects of hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD(, hypophosphatemia has also been proposed as a common challenge after dialysis. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the serum phosphate level immediately after hemodialysis (HD) and its association with some clinical complications in CKD patients. The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 54 eligible CKD patients undergoing regular hemodialysis. Blood samples were taken, prior to the start and immediately after the end of hemodialysis to determine the serum levels of urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, PTH, blood sugar and albumin. Moreover, the clinical complications of patients including muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, weakness and inability to speak are assessed by a questionnaire, before and after HD. As we expected, the mean of serum creatinine, urea and phosphate levels significantly decreased after dialysis. Post-dialysis hypophosphatemia was graded as mild (3.5 > P ≥ 2.5 mg/dl), moderate (2.5 > P ≥ 1 mg/dl), and severe (<1 mg/dl) based on serum phosphate levels. The frequency of mild and moderate hypophosphatemia was 39.2% and 45.1 %, respectively. None of the participants had severe hypophosphatemia and 13.7% had normal phosphate levels. There was a significant correlation between post-dialysis hypophosphatemia and incidence of nausea and confusion after adjusting for confounding factors. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the possible association of some of the post-dialysis clinical complications with hypophosphatemia was investigated. Future large-scale studies are required to confirm the association of post-dialysis hypophosphatemia with clinical complications.",,1017
618,35977781,Multimorph Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics in Structured Populations.,"AbstractOur understanding of the evolution of quantitative traits in nature is still limited by the challenge of including realistic trait distributions in the context of frequency-dependent selection and ecological feedbacks. We extend to class-structured populations a recently introduced oligomorphic approximation, which bridges the gap between adaptive dynamics and quantitative genetics approaches and allows for the joint description of the dynamics of ecological variables and of the moments of multimodal trait distributions. Our theoretical framework allows us to analyze the dynamics of populations composed of several morphs and structured into distinct classes (e.g., age, size, habitats, infection status, and species). We also introduce a new approximation to simplify the eco-evolutionary dynamics using reproductive values. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to the important conceptual case of two-habitat migration-selection models. In particular, we show that our approach allows us to predict both the long-term evolutionary end points and the short-term transient dynamics of the eco-evolutionary process, including fast evolution regimes. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our results and sketch perspectives for future work.",,1018
2203,35967315,The importance of taking ART appropriately in children and adolescents with HIV-1 to reach the highest capacity of immune function later in life.,"Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines recommend treating all children with HIV-1 infection. This has changed from the broader use of ART to treat children to improve morbidity and minimise mortality. However, prior to current recommendations, not everyone with HIV-1 received timely treatment. What happens to the paediatric immune system when HIV-1 replication is not appropriately supressed remains unclear. 11 samples from adolescents with HIV-1 on ART and uninfected controls in the UK, aged 12-25 years, were examined; overall, adolescents with CD4+ counts > 500/μl and a viral load < 50 copies/ml were compared with adolescents with CD4+ counts < 500/μl and a viral load > 50 copies/ml at time of sampling. Measurements of thymic output were combined with high throughput next generation sequencing and bioinformatics to systematically organize CD4+ and CD8+ T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. TCR repertoire diversity, clonal expansions, TCR sequence sharing, and formation of TCR clusters in HIV-1 infected adolescents with successful HIV-1 suppression were compared to adolescents with ineffective HIV-1 suppression. Thymic output and CD4+ T cell numbers were decreased in HIV-1 infected adolescents with poor HIV-1 suppression. A strong homeostatic TCR response, driven by the decreased CD4+ T cell compartment and reduced thymic output was observed in the virally uncontrolled HIV-1-infected adolescents. Formation of abundant robust TCR clusters and structurally related TCRs were found in the adolescents with effective HIV-1 suppression. Numerous CD4+ T cell numbers in the virally controlled adolescents emphasize the importance of high thymic output and formation of robust TCR clusters in the maintenance of HIV-1 suppression. While the profound capacity for immune recovery in children may allow better opportunity to deal with immunological stress, when ART is taken appropriately, this study demonstrates new insights into the unique paediatric immune system and the immunological changes when HIV-1 replication is ongoing.",,1019
733,35975145,Heterogeneous electron transfer reorganization energy at the inner Helmholtz plane in a polybromide redox-active ionic liquid.,"In ionic liquids (ILs), the electric double layer (EDL) is where heterogeneous electron transfer (ET) occurs. Nevertheless, the relationship between the EDL structure and its kinetics has been rarely studied, especially for ET taking place in the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). This is largely because of the lack of an appropriate model system for experiments. In this work, we determined the reorganization energy (λ) of Br2 reduction in a redox-active IL 1-ethyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium polybromide (MEPBr2n+1) based on the Marcus-Hush-Chidsey model. Exceptionally fast mass transport of Br2 in MEPBr2n+1 allows voltammograms to be obtained in which the current plateau is regulated by electron-transfer kinetics. This enables investigation of the microscopic environment in the IHP of the IL affecting electrocatalytic reactions through reorganization energy. As a demonstration, TiO2-modified Pt was employed to show pH-dependent reorganization energy, which suggests the switch of major ions at the IHP as a function of surface charges of electrodes.",,1020
1158,35973761,"Investigating resistance levels to cyhalofop-butyl and mechanisms involved in Chinese sprangletop (Leptochloa chinensis L.) from Anhui Province, China.","Chinese sprangletop (Leptochloa chinensis (L.) Nees) is a common grass species that severely threatens rice (Oryza sativa L.) cropping systems globally. Cyhalofop-butyl is a highly efficient acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase)-inhibiting herbicide widely used for control of this species in China. However, some L. chinensis populations have gradually evolved resistance to this herbicide in recent years. To better understand the cyhalofop-butyl resistance status of L. chinensis in the major rice planting area of the middle-lower Yangtze River basin, 73 populations collected from the rice fields across Anhui Province were investigated for cyhalofop-butyl susceptibility and potential herbicide resistance-conferring mutations. Single-dose testing indicated that of the 73 populations, 25 had evolved resistance to cyhalofop-butyl and were separately classified as RRR and RR populations according to their fresh weight reductions, 8 had a high risk of evolving cyhalofop-butyl resistance and were classified as R? populations, and 40 were susceptible and classified as S populations. Whole-plant dose-response experiments showed that the resistance index (RI) of these R?, RR, and RRR populations to cyhalofop-butyl ranged from 2.47 to 36.94. Target gene sequencing identified seven ACCase resistance mutations (I1781L, W1999C, W2027S, W2027L, W2027C, I2041N, and D2078G), with W1999C and W2027C the two most common detected in about three quarters of all the resistant populations. Seven populations including LASC3, BBHY1, AQQS1, HFFD3, HFFD4, AQWJ1, and HFLJ6 each carrying a specific ACCase mutation were tested for their cross- and multiple-resistance patterns. Compared with a standard susceptible population HFLY1, the seven resistant populations showed distinct cross-resistance. All had low- to high-level cross-resistance to metamifop (RIs ranging from 6.16 to 17.65), fenoxaprop-P-ethyl (RIs ranging from 6.39 to 24.08), and quizalofop-P-ethyl (RIs ranging from 2.20 to 10.25), but responded differently to clodinafop-propargyl and clethodim. Multiple-resistance testing suggested that the seven resistant populations were all susceptible to the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor tripyrasulfone, the protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor oxyfluorfen, and the auxin mimic herbicide florpyrauxifen. In conclusion, this study has shown that cyhalofop-butyl resistance was prevalent in L. chinensis in Anhui Province, China, and target site mutation was one of the most common resistance mechanisms.",,1021
9,35985651,Size and Quality of Drawings Made by Adults Under Visual and Haptic Control.,"The aim of this study was twofold. First, our objective was to test the influence of an object's actual size (size rank) on the drawn size of the depicted object. We tested the canonical size effect (i.e., drawing objects larger in the physical world as larger) in four drawing conditions - two perceptual conditions (blindfolded or sighted) crossed with two materials (paper or special foil for producing embossed drawings). Second, we investigated whether drawing quality (we analysed both the local and global criteria of quality) depends on drawing conditions. We predicted that drawing quality, unlike drawing size, would vary according to drawing conditions - namely, being higher when foil than paper was used for drawing production in the blindfolded condition. We tested these hypotheses with young adults who repeatedly drew eight different familiar objects (differentiated by size in the real world) in four drawing conditions. As expected, drawn size increased linearly with increasing size rank, whatever the drawing condition, thus replicating the canonical size effect and showing that this effect was not dependent on drawing conditions. In line with our hypothesis, in the blindfolded condition drawing quality was better when foil rather than paper was used, suggesting a benefit from haptic feedback on the trace produced. Besides, the quality of drawings produced was still higher in the sighted than the blindfolded condition. In conclusion, canonical size is present under different drawing conditions regardless of whether sight is involved or not, while perceptual control increases drawing quality in adults.",,1022
1056,35974563,Universal minimal cost of coherent biochemical oscillations.,"Biochemical clocks are essential for virtually all living systems. A biochemical clock that is isolated from an external periodic signal and subjected to fluctuations can oscillate coherently only for a finite number of oscillations. Furthermore, such an autonomous clock can oscillate only if it consumes free energy. What is the minimum amount of free-energy consumption required for a certain number of coherent oscillations? We conjecture a universal bound that answers this question. A system that oscillates coherently for N oscillations has a minimal free-energy cost per oscillation of 4π^{2}Nk_{B}T. Our bound is valid for general finite Markov processes, is conjectured based on extensive numerical evidence, is illustrated with numerical simulations of a known model for a biochemical oscillator, and applies to existing experimental data.",,1023

764,35975073,Determination of furfurals in baby food samples after extraction by a novel functionalized magnetic porous carbon.,"Herein, a novel polypyrrole-polyaniline functionalized magnetic porous carbon (MPC@PPy-PANI) composite material was fabricated and utilized for the separation/extraction of furfurals from baby food and dry milk samples. In this way, magnetite@silica nanoparticles were first synthesized, and then a magnetic metal-organic framework (MMIL-101(Fe)) was prepared. After that, the MMIL-101(Fe) was pyrolyzed in a neutral atmosphere to obtain MPC. Ultimately, the MPC was functionalized with a co-polymer of aniline-pyrrole via oxidation polymerization. The synthesis of MPC@PPy-PANI was confirmed with FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM, TEM, VSM, and XRD techniques. Furfural and hydroxymethyl furfural were selected as the model analytes, which were separated/quantified on an HPLC-UV instrument. The LODs, LOQs, and linear dynamic ranges (LDRs) were in the range of 0.3-0.7 μg kg-1, 1.0-2.5 μg kg-1, and 1.0-600 μg kg-1, respectively. Repeatability of the method was studied as an RSD parameter, and was located in the range of 5.5-6.8% (within-day, n = 5) and 8.2-9.4% (between-day, n = 3 days). The applicability of the proposed method was established by analyzing several baby food and dry milk samples. The relative recovery (RR%) and repeatability were located in the range of 86-111% and 3.3-10.1%, respectively, showing excellent accuracy and precision of the method.",,1025
2300,35967131,Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma With Histological Transformation to Hodgkin's Lymphoma.,"Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is a rare, slow-growing/indolent B cell lymphoid neoplasm accounting for 10.5% to 11.8% of all B cell lymphomas. MZL originates from the mature B lymphocytes, which are usually present in the marginal zone of the lymphoid follicle. Histological transformation (HT) is defined as sheets of large cells arising in an indolent lymphoma with morphological and immunophenotypic changes suggestive of a high-grade lymphoma such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), or Burkitt lymphoma. The median time of transformation ranges from one year to 15 years following the initial diagnosis of MZL. Studies reported that the deletion of TP53 and 7q and mutations in NOTCH2 are commonly associated with HT in MZL. This case report outlines the rare happening of an MZL transformation into a nodular subtype of Hodgkin's lymphoma in a 56-year-old female, which prompted further investigations and a different therapeutic approach. By reporting this case, we emphasize that HT changes the natural history and significantly affects the overall survival of patients with MZL. Hence, it is necessary to get a core needle or excisional biopsy whenever there is a clinical suspicion of HT in MZL for early diagnosis and a better therapeutic approach.",,1026
2259,35967172,Assessment of a Comparative Bayesian-Enhanced Population-Based Decision Model for COVID-19 Critical Care Prediction in the Dominican Republic Social Security Affiliates.,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a major health concern worldwide. This study aims to develop a Bayesian model to predict critical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Sensitivity and specificity were obtained from previous meta-analysis studies. The complex vulnerability index (IVC-COV2 index for its abbreviation in Spanish) was used to set the pretest probability. Likelihood ratios were integrated into a Fagan nomogram for posttest probabilities, and IVC-COV2 + National Early Warning Score (NEWS) values and CURB-65 scores were generated. Absolute and relative diagnostic gains (RDGs) were calculated based on pretest and posttest differences. The IVC-COV2 index was derived from a population of 1,055,746 individuals and was based on mortality in high-risk (71.97%), intermediate-risk (26.11%), and low-risk (1.91%) groups. The integration of models in which IVC-COV2 intermediate + NEWS ≥ 5 and CURB-65 > 2 led to a number needed to (NNT) diagnose that was slightly improved in the CURB-65 model (2 vs. 3). A comparison of diagnostic gains revealed that neither the positive likelihood ratio (P = 0.62) nor the negative likelihood ratio (P = 0.95) differed significantly between the IVC-COV2 NEWS model and the CURB-65 model. According to the proposed mathematical model, the combination of the IVC-COV2 intermediate score and NEWS or CURB-65 score yields superior results and a greater predictive value for the severity of illness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-based/mathematical model developed for use in COVID-19 critical care decision-making.",,1027
21,35985132,Advanced imaging findings in a cat with left ventricular apical aneurysm.,"An eight-year-old, male neutered, domestic shorthair cat presented with severe anemia. Two-dimensional echocardiography identified severe left ventricular apical dilation with wall thinning and akinesia. The basal portion of the left ventricle showed equivocal hypertrophy and subjective hyperkinesis. Speckle tracking echocardiography showed marked abnormalities in all deformation planes (longitudinal, circumferential, radial strain) and twist. Three-dimensional Bull's eye plot reconstruction was also performed. Post-mortem evaluation showed a pale and paper-thin left ventricular apex, and histopathology confirmed full-thickness cardiomyocytes loss with fibrous replacement. Left ventricular-acquired apical aneurysms are the result of chronic damage of the myocardium and are associated with many disease conditions in people, including coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy. The exact pathophysiological mechanism could not be determined with certainty in the cat of the present report, but advanced echocardiographic evaluation added some fine details into the characterization of this infrequently reported abnormality.",,1028
1856,35967784,Nutrient Profiling of Japanese Dishes: The Development of a Novel Ajinomoto Group Nutrient Profiling System.,"Government agencies and private companies have supported the development of nutrient profiling (NP) systems to facilitate the selection of nutrient-dense foods by consumers, promote nutritious food development, and limit excessive advertising of products with low nutritional value. While most NP models were developed to assess individual foods, the Ajinomoto Group Nutrient Profiling System (ANPS) was developed to assess the overall nutritional value of cooked dishes that are culturally specific to Japan. Based on the national dietary recommendations and nutritional surveys, target values were created for 13 dish categories, while considering the combinations of meal units. For the ANPS, the four evaluating elements were protein and vegetables, which should be encouraged, and sodium and saturated fatty acids, which should be limited. The ANPS algorithm for dishes was the sum of the scores of individual elements, with a maximum of 10 points per serving. The sum of scores was then multiplied by 2.5 to convert to the 100-point scale. Convergent validity was tested using the nutrient-rich food index (NRF) score of 6.3. In total, 1,089 popular Japanese dishes were evaluated using the ANPS, and the median score of ANPS was 70.0 points (interquartile range, 55-78.8), and the average score was 67.7 (standard deviation, 16.5) points. Since salt intake is a major health risk in Japan, this tool was designed to evaluate sodium content with high sensitivity, and low-salt dishes significantly improved sodium and ANPS scores compared with regular dishes. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the total score of NRF 6.3 and ANPS in 1,089 dishes was r = 0.452 (p < 0.0001). This newly developed ANPS could be used to evaluate culture-specific cooked dishes per serving size. It can determine the nutritional values of dishes, with a high sensitivity to sodium content, a major Japanese nutritional issue. Further research is needed to determine the accuracy and usefulness of the ANPS as a system that would lead to changes in eating behavior nationwide.",,1029
611,35977788,Stochasticity Leads to Coexistence of Generalists and Specialists in Assembling Mutualistic Communities.,"AbstractSpecies interaction networks are subject to natural and anthropogenic disturbances that lead to their disassembly, while natural regeneration or restoration efforts facilitate their reassembly. Previous models for assembling ecological networks did not include stochasticity at the level of population dynamics (e.g., demographic noise, environmental noise) and focused mainly on food webs. Here, we present a model for the assembly of mutualistic bipartite networks, such as plant-pollinator networks, and examine the influence of demographic noise on the trajectory of species and strategy diversity, that is, the range of present strategies from specialism to generalism. We find that assembled communities show at intermediate assembly stages a maximum of species diversity and of average generalization. Our model thus provides a mechanism for nonlinear, hump-shaped diversity trajectories at intermediate succession, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Long-term coexistence of specialists and generalists emerges only in the presence of demographic noise and is due to a persistent species turnover. These findings highlight the importance of stochasticity for maintaining long-term diversity.",,1030

Employing a procedure with slow variation of temperature, we manage to obtain regions of periodic focal conic structure with two-dimensional square ordering in the plane of the cell. Using ordered samples and materials with selective reflection in the visible spectral range, we obtain spectral and microscopic optical data which deepen our knowledge of the focal conic structure.",,1031
283,35981805,Influence of Age on Magnitude and Timing of Vasodepression and Cardioinhibition in Tilt-Induced Vasovagal Syncope.,"Cardioinhibition may diminish with age, but the changing balance of cardioinhibition and vasodepression with age has not been quantified, leaving the mechanism of vasovagal syncope (VVS) in old age unclear. This study sought to quantify age-related changes of vasodepression and cardioinhibition in tilt-induced VVS. We studied 163 cases of tilt-induced VVS, evoked using the Italian protocol with blood pressure, heart rate, and video-electroencephalographic monitoring. Presyncope was excluded. Cardioinhibition was defined as the heart rate decrease before syncope; asystolic pauses (≥3 seconds) were divided into early and late asystole, ie, beginning early enough to or too late to be the major cause of loss of consciousness. The log-ratio method was used to quantify contributions of cardioinhibition and vasodepression, assessed in 2 10-second periods before the onset of cardioinhibition and before syncope. With increasing age, cardioinhibition decreased, ie, heart rate decreased less and more slowly near syncope (P < 0.0001), while vasodepression increased. Asystolic pauses were less frequent in the older one-half of the group than the younger one-half (26% vs 57%; P < 0.00001), but when it did, late asystole occurred more often (58% vs 15%; P < 0.001). The shift toward less cardioinhibition and more vasodepression with increased age probably reflects a physiological shift in circulatory control. The weakening of cardioinhibition with age may detract from the efficacy of pacing in older patients with VVS. Cardioinhibition-vasodepression balance should be considered in pacing decisions in older subjects with VVS.",,1032
1905,35967704,The effect of schizotypy on spatial learning in an environment with a distinctive shape.,"In two experiments, participants completed the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences measuring schizotypal traits across four dimensions (unusual experiences, cognitive disorganization, introvertive anhedonia, and impulsive non-conformity). They then took part in a virtual navigation task where they were required to learn about the position of a hidden goal with reference to geometric cues of a rectangular arena or rely on colored wall panels to find the hidden goal in a square-shaped arena. Unusual experience and cognitive disorganization were significant predictors of the use of geometric cues, but no significant predictors were found for the use of wall panels. Implications to hippocampal function and the clinical domain are considered.",,1033
1292,35970684,Effect of pharmacological interventions and placebo on liver Histology in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: A network meta-analysis.,"The aims of this study were to quantify the histological improvement and its risk factors in patients with NASH enrolled in the placebo arms of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and to indirectly compare the effect of several investigational drugs for NASH on validated histological outcomes. A comprehensive search was conducted to detect phase 2 and 3 RCTs comparing pharmacological interventions in patients with NASH. According to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations, primary outcomes included: 1) NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis; 2) At least 1-point reduction in fibrosis without worsening of NASH. Meta-analysis and meta-regressions were conducted on placebo arms, while network meta-analysis was performed on intervention arms. A total of 15 RCTs met the eligibility criteria. The meta-analysis on placebo arms showed a pooled estimate rate of 17% (95%C.I. 12%-23%;I2 = 86%; p < 0.01) for NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis and of 21% (95%C.I. 13%-31%;I2 = 84%; p < 0.01) for ≥1stage improvement of fibrosis without worsening of NASH. Phase 3 (vs Phase 2)RCTs, older age and higher AST levels were significantly associated with progression of liver disease by univariate meta-regression. At network meta-analysis, Semaglutide (P-score 0.906), Pioglitazione alone (score 0.890) and plus Vitamin E (0.826) had the highest probability of being ranked the most effective intervention for NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis, while Aldafermin (0.776), Lanifibranor (0.773) and Obeticholic acid (0.771) had the highest probability to achieve ≥1 stage of fibrosis improvement without worsening of NASH. This study confirms the heterogeneity of histological progression of untreated patients with NASH and provides evidence to stratify patients according to identified risk factors in future RCTs of combination therapies.

386,35979288,Neoadjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy for the treatment of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver in children.,"Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver (UESL) is a rare and aggressive mesenchymal tumor in children. Herein, we describe our experience in neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and subsequent surgery for the treatment of UESL in children. To evaluate the efficacy of NAT and explore a new choice for successful operation of UESL in children. We retrospectively analyzed six patients newly diagnosed with unresectable UESL who received NAT and then surgery at our center between January 2004 and December 2019. The tumor was considered unresectable if it involved a large part of both lobes of the liver or had invaded the main hepatic vessels or inferior vena cava. The NAT included preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and systemic chemotherapy. The patients were 4 boys and 2 girls with a mean age of 7 years. The longest tumor at presentation ranged from 8.6 to 14.8 cm (mean, 12 cm). Extrahepatic metastases were present in 2 cases. Preoperative systemic chemotherapy was administered 3 wk after TACE. Tumor resection was performed 3 wk after one or two cycles of NAT. The patients received systemic chemotherapy after surgery. All patients successfully underwent NAT and complete resection. The tumor volumes decreased by 18.2%-68.7%, with a mean decrease of 36% after 1 cycle of NAT (t = 3.524, P = 0.017). According to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria, 4 patients had a partial response and underwent surgery, while 2 had stable disease and received another cycle of NAT before surgery. Massive tumor necrosis was seen on pathological examination of the surgical specimen: > 90% necrosis in two, > 50% necrosis in three, and 25% necrosis in 1, with an average of 71.8%. Post-NAT complications included fever, nausea and vomiting, and mild bone marrow suppression. Elevated alanine transaminase levels occurred in all patients, which returned to normal within 7-10 d after treatment. No cardiac or renal toxicity, severe hepatic dysfunction, bleeding and non-target embolization were observed in the patients. The median follow-up period was 8 years with an overall survival of 100%. NAT effectively reduced tumor volume, cleared the tumor margin, and caused massive tumor necrosis. This may be a promising choice for successful surgery of UESL in children.",,1035
2104,35967414,Classification of colon adenocarcinoma based on immunological characterizations: Implications for prognosis and immunotherapy.,"Accurate immune molecular typing is pivotal for screening out patients with colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) who may benefit from immunotherapy and whose tumor microenvironment (TME) was needed for reprogramming to beneficial immune-mediated responses. However, little is known about the immune characteristic of COAD. Here, by calculating the enrichment score of immune characteristics in three online COAD datasets (TCGA-COAD, GSE39582, and GSE17538), we identified 17 prognostic-related immune characteristics that overlapped in at least two datasets. We determined that COADs could be stratified into three immune subtypes (IS1-IS3), based on consensus clustering of these 17 immune characteristics. Each of the three ISs was associated with distinct clinicopathological characteristics, genetic aberrations, tumor-infiltrating immune cell composition, immunophenotyping (immune hot and immune cold), and cytokine profiles, as well as different clinical outcomes and immunotherapy/therapeutic response. Patients with the IS1 tumor had high immune infiltration but immunosuppressive phenotype, IS3 tumor is an immune hot phenotype, whereas those with the IS2 tumor had an immune cold phenotype. We further verified the distinct immune phenotype of IS1 and IS3 by an in-house COAD cohort. We propose that the immune subtyping can be utilized to identify COAD patients who will be affected by the tumor immune microenvironment. Furthermore, the ISs may provide a guide for personalized cancer immunotherapy and for tumor prognosis.",,1036
302,35980780,"Relationships between serum cortisol, RAGE-associated s100A8/A9 levels, and self-reported cancer-related distress in women with non-metastatic breast cancer.","Elevated inflammation and psychological distress in patients with breast cancer (BCa) have been related to poorer health outcomes. Regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and signaling of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) are important in the inflammatory response and have been associated with increased stress and poorer health outcomes in patients with cancer. This study examined relationships among circulating cortisol, a measure of HPA axis activity and physiological stress; s100A8/A9, a RAGE ligand and emerging cancer-related biological measure; and self-reported cancer-related distress. Patients with BCa (N = 183, stage 0-IIIb) were recruited 2-10 weeks post-surgery but prior to receiving adjuvant therapies. Participants provided blood samples, from which serum cortisol and s100A8/A9 levels were determined, and completed a psychosocial questionnaire. Regression analyses, adjusting for age, cancer stage, time since surgery, race, and menopausal status, were conducted examining the relationships between cortisol, s100A8/A9, and cancer-related distress (Impact of Event Scale [IES]-Revised). Cortisol and s100A8/A9 levels were positively related (β = .218, t(112) = 2.332, p = .021), although the overall model was not significant. Cortisol levels were also positively associated with IES-Intrusions (β = .192, t(163) = 2.659, p = .009) and IES-Hyperarousal subscale scores (β = .171, t(163) = 2.304, p = .022). Patients with higher cortisol levels also reported higher s100A8/A9 levels and more cancer-related distress. The relationship between cortisol and s100A8/A9 supports a link between the stress response and pro-inflammatory physiological processes known to predict greater metastatic risk in BCa. Stress processes implicated in cancer biology are complex and replication and extension of these initial findings is important.",,1037
1184,35973266,Safety evaluation and comparative genomics analysis of the industrial strain Aspergillus flavus SU-16 used for huangjiu brewing.,"Huangjiu is a popular Chinese traditional alcoholic beverage, while its brewing processes have rarely been explored. We herein report the first gapless, near-finished genome assembly of the industrial strain Aspergillus flavus SU-16 for huangjiu brewing. This work provides insights and supports for the further industrial applications of A. flavus isolates by comprehensively studying of the safety and genomic variations of SU-16. We demonstrated that SU-16 is a non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus at both molecular and metabolic levels. Using of nanopore sequencing technology resulted in a complete genome sequence for all 8 A. flavus chromosomes, as well as the mitochondrion. Genome comparisons of SU-16 with reference strains identified the chromosomal rearrangements, revealed the adaption mechanism of SU-16 to huangjiu ecological niche, and found that SU-16 is a good repository for CAZymes and some bioactive secondary metabolites. The results will help to develop more scientific huangjiu fermentation processes, and explore metabolism pathways of desired or harmful components in huangjiu to improve its quality.",,1038
154,35983229,Heterozygosity and homozygosity regions affect reproductive success and the loss of reproduction: A case study with litter traits in pigs.,"Runs of heterozygosity (ROHet) and homozygosity (ROH) harbor useful information related to traits of interest. There is a lack of investigating the effect of ROHet and ROH on reproductive success and the loss of reproduction in mammals. Here, we detected and characterized the ROHet and ROH patterns in the genomes of Chinese indigenous pigs (i.e., Jinhua, Chun'an, Longyou Black, and Shengxian Spotted pigs), revealing the similar genetic characteristics of indigenous pigs. Later, we highlighted the underlying litter traits-related ROHet and ROH using association analysis with linear model in these four indigenous pig breeds. To pinpoint the promising candidate genes associated with litter traits, we further in-depth explore the selection patterns of other five pig breeds (i.e., Erhualian, Meishan, Minzhu, Rongchang, and Diqing pigs) with different levels of reproduction performance at the underlying litter traits-related ROHet and ROH using F ST and genetic diversity ratio. Then, we identified a set of known and novel candidate genes associated with reproductive performance in pigs. For the novel candidate genes (i.e., CCDC91, SASH1, SAMD5, MACF1, MFSD2A, EPC2, and MBD5), we obtained public available datasets and performed multi-omics analyses integrating transcriptome-wide association studies and comparative single-cell RNA-seq analyses to uncover the roles of them in mammalian reproductive performance. The genes have not been widely reported to be fertility-related genes and can be complementally considered as prior biological information to modify genomic selections models that benefits pig genetic improvement of litter traits. Besides, our findings provide new insights into the function of ROHet and ROH in mammals.",,1039
89,35983394,An Atypical Case of Prolonged COVID-19 Infection.,"Immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 can have prolonged disease courses that require escalation in care to inpatient or ICU settings. We report a case of a prolonged, active COVID-19 infection in an immunocompromised 61-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. During her hospitalization, her cycle thresholds (CT) continued to worsen despite clinical improvement. We compared our patient's course and CTs to other reported cases in immunocompromised patients, investigating the efficacy of CTs and their use in evaluating disease progression and severity. RT-PCR tests targeting specific types of replicative viral RNA may have more utility in assessing disease severity and infectivity in immunocompromised patients. Our patient's disease course, similar to other reported cases, illustrates the need for improved treatment protocols and infection prevention for the immunocompromised population against SARS-CoV-2.",,1040
814,35974984,Factors Associated with Self-Reported Chronic Diseases of Syrian Refugees in Turkey.,"Syria's civil conflict, which began in 2011, led millions of Syrians to migrate to countries all over the world, including Turkey. Considering the fact that war-caused migrations may affect the citizens of the host countries and immigrants from diverse perspectives, It is important to make scientific research on the outcomes of migration after the Syrian civil war. This paper investigates the relationship between chronic diseases, such as, cardiac disease, diabetes, and hypertension, and covariates, including socioeconomic status, war-related conditions, risky health behaviours, health services use, and health literacy, using survey data on 7 202 Syrian refugees from 4 068 households living out of camp settlements in Turkey. Logistic regressions were employed to examine the relationship between the chronic diseases and covariates, which include socioeconomic status, war-related conditions, risky health behaviours, health services use, and health literacy. The results reveal that pre-migration income, health behaviours, such as, tobacco consumption, body mass index, daily activity, health-care use, and health literacy are the most important factors for one or more chronic diseases. Considering the effects of risk factors on chronic diseases among Syrian refugees, it is critical to take preventive steps for negative outcomes.",,1041

Conclusions Data collected from our needs assessment has defined our audience allowing us to design our long-term goals and strategies.",,1042
2032,35967554,Case report: Effectiveness of sirolimus in a de novo FAS mutation leading to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome-FAS and elevated DNT/Treg ratio.,"The autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a rare disease characterized by defective function of the FAS death receptor, which results in chronic, non-malignant lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity accompanied by elevated numbers of double-negative (DN) T cells (T-cell receptor α/β + CD4-CD8-) and an increased risk of developing malignancies later in life. Here, we report a patient with a de novo FAS mutation with a severe phenotype of ALPS-FAS. The FAS gene identified as a novel spontaneous germline heterozygous missense mutation (c.857G > A, p.G286E) in exon 9, causing an amino acid exchange and difference in hydrogen bond formation. Consequently, the treatment with sirolimus was initiated. Subsequently, the patient's clinical condition improved rapidly. Moreover, DNT ratio continuously decreased during sirolimus application. We described a novel germline FAS mutation (c.857G > A, p.G286E) associated with a severe clinical phenotype of ALPS-FAS. Sirolimus effectively improved the patient clinical manifestations with obvious reduction of the DNT ratio.",,1043
1896,35967714,The Impact of e-Learning Systems on Motivating Students and Enhancing Their Outcomes During COVID-19: A Mixed-Method Approach.,"e-Learning is a key strategy in the course of higher education to improve the results of the educational process and stimulate student motivation. The COVID-19 pandemic imposed on Algerian universities to adopt e-Learning systems to search for effectiveness and efficiency of academic approaches. This paper seeks to remedy these problems by analyzing the impact of e-Learning systems on student motivation and outcomes. A mixed-method approach was used in the data analysis. We conducted the study as a survey, with data being gathered via questionnaires distributed to 398 students. The questionnaire includes open questions that were qualitatively analyzed using content analysis with Nvivo, besides Likert scale questions were quantitatively analyzed and modeled using Structural equation modeling (SEM) with Amos to accomplish the path analysis of the research model. The results of the study showed that student motivation (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction) and student outcomes (knowledge, skills, and attitudes) are significantly affected by e-Learning systems (Technical and electronic requirements, personal requirements, perceived value, and credibility of e-Learning). The key findings are discussed, and they provide recommendations for future research.",,1044
540,35978685,Identification of RAD51-BRCA2 Inhibitors Using N-Acylhydrazone-Based Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry.,"RAD51 is an ATP-dependent recombinase, recruited by BRCA2 to mediate DNA double-strand breaks repair through homologous recombination and represents an attractive cancer drug target. Herein, we applied for the first-time protein-templated dynamic combinatorial chemistry on RAD51 as a hit identification strategy. Upon design of N-acylhydrazone-based dynamic combinatorial libraries, RAD51 showed a clear templating effect, amplifying 19 N-acylhydrazones. Screening against the RAD51-BRCA2 protein-protein interaction via ELISA assay afforded 10 inhibitors in the micromolar range. Further 19F NMR experiments revealed that 7 could bind RAD51 and be displaced by BRC4, suggesting an interaction in the same binding pocket of BRCA2. These results proved not only that ptDCC could be successfully applied on full-length oligomeric RAD51, but also that it could address the need of alternative strategies toward the identification of small-molecule PPI inhibitors.",,1045
2311,35967068,Self-Assembling Oligo(2-oxazoline) Organogelators for the Encapsulation and Slow Release of Bioactive Volatiles.,"Herein, we report a class of distinctive supramolecular nanostructures in situ-generated from the cationic ring-opening polymerization of a particular 2-oxazoline monomer, i.e., 2-(N-tert-butyloxycarbonylaminomethyl)-2-oxazoline (Ox1). Driven by side-chain hydrogen bonding between neighboring molecules and van der Waals interactions, the growing oligomers of Ox1 precipitate in the form of macroscopic platelets when the degree of polymerization reaches 5-7. A similar self-assembly occurred in the block copolymerization of 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline (EtOx) or 2-pentyl-2-oxazoline (PeOx) and Ox1 as the second monomer. These polymeric aggregates were found to disassemble into rod-like nanoparticles under appropriate conditions, and to form stable organogels in some polar solvents like dimethylformamide as well as in natural liquid fragrances such as (R)-carvone, citronellal, and (R)-limonene. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the morphology of their xerogels was solvent-dependent, mainly with a lamellar or fibrous structure. The rheology measurements confirmed the as-obtained organogels feature an obvious thixotropic character. The storage modulus was about 7-10 times higher than the loss modulus, indicating the physical crosslinking in the gel. The fragrance release profiles showed that the presented supramolecular gel system exhibits good sustained-release effect for the loaded bioactive volatiles.",,1046
123,35983303,Use of Debye-Hückel-Henry charge measurements in early antibody development elucidates effects of non-specific association.,"The diffusion interaction parameter (kD ) has been demonstrated to be a high-throughput technique for characterizing interactions between proteins in solution. kD reflects both attractive and repulsive interactions, including long-ranged electrostatic repulsions. Here, we plot the mutual diffusion coefficient (Dm ) as a function of the experimentally determined Debye-Hückel-Henry surface charge (ZDHH ) for seven human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in 15 mM histidine at pH 6. We find that graphs of Dm versus ZDHH intersect at ZDHH, ~ 2.6, independent of protein concentration. The same data plotted as kD versus ZDHH show a transition from net attractive to net repulsive interactions in the same region of the ZDHH intersection point. These data suggest that there is a minimum surface charge necessary on these mAbs needed to overcome attractive interactions.",,1047
773,35975064,"Two-dimensional MXO/MoX2 (M = Hf, Ti and X = S, Se) van der Waals heterostructure: a promising photovoltaic material.","Nanoscale materials with multifunctional properties are necessary for the quick development of high-performance devices for a wide range of applications, hence theoretical research into new two-dimensional (2D) materials is encouraged. 2D materials have a distinct crystalline structure that leads to intriguing occurrences. Stacking diverse two-dimensional (2D) materials has shown to be an efficient way for producing high-performance semiconductor materials. We explored a 2D nanomaterial family, an MXO/MoX2 heterostructure (M = Hf, Ti and X = S, Se), for their various applications using first-principles calculations. We discovered that all of the heterostructure materials utilized are direct band gap semiconductors with band gaps ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 eV, with the exception of hexagonal HfSeO/MoSe2, which has a band gap of 0.525 eV. The influence of strain on the band gap of this HfSeO/MoSe2 material was investigated. In the visible range, we obtained promising optical responses with a high-power conversion efficiency. With fill factors of 0.5, MXO/MoX2 photovoltaic cells showed great PCE of up to 17.8%. The tunable electronic characteristics of these two-dimensional materials would aid in the development of energy conversion devices. According to our findings, the 2D Janus heterostructure of MXO/MoX2 (M = Hf, Ti and X = S, Se) material is an excellent choice for photovoltaic solar cells.",,1048
983,35974636,Nematic order condensation and topological defects in inertial active nematics.,"Living materials at different length scales manifest active nematic features such as orientational order, nematic topological defects, and active nematic turbulence. Using numerical simulations we investigate the impact of fluid inertia on the collective pattern formation in active nematics. We show that an incremental increase in inertial effects due to reduced viscosity results in gradual melting of nematic order with an increase in topological defect density before a discontinuous transition to a vortex-condensate state. The emergent vortex-condensate state at low enough viscosities coincides with nematic order condensation within the giant vortices and the drop in the density of topological defects. We further show flow field around topological defects is substantially affected by inertial effects. Moreover, we demonstrate the strong dependence of the kinetic energy spectrum on the inertial effects, recover the Kolmogorov scaling within the vortex-condensate phase, but find no evidence of universal scaling at higher viscosities. The findings reveal complexities in active nematic turbulence and emphasize the important cross-talk between active and inertial effects in setting flow and orientational organization of active particles.",,1049
1402,35968615,Predictive factors associated with thirty-day mortality in geriatric patients with hip fractures.,"This study aimed to determine the predictive factors affecting the 30-day mortality in geriatric hip fractures, investigate the effect of the timing of surgery, and thus determine the optimum cut-off time in delaying the surgery. A total of 596 patients(205 men, 391 women; mean age = 78.3 years) were included in this retrospective study. All possible predictive factors encountered in the literature review, including age, sex, fracture type, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, surgical delay time, anaesthesia type, surgery type, need for erythrocyte replacement, postoperative complications, and the need for postoperative intensive care were analyzed. The predictive factors that were found to be significant as a result of the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The reason for surgery was an extracapsular fracture in 359 patients (60.2%) and an intracapsular fracture in 237 (39.8%). Arthroplasty was performed in 256 patients (43%), while proximal femoral nails were used in 251 (42.1%), dynamic hips screws in 68 (11.4%), and cannulated screws in 21 (3.5%). 523 (87.8%) of the patients had an ASA score of 1 or 2, and 73 (12.2%) had an ASA score of 3 or 4. General anaesthesia was performed on 35.2% of the patients, while regional anaesthesia was administered to 64.8%. Major complications developed in 42 patients (7%), while minor complications were observed in 143 (24%). The mean surgical delay time was 3.21 days (1-9 days). The ASA score (P <0.001, OR: 56.83, CI: 5.26-2.820), anesthesia type (P = 0.036, OR: 3.225, CI: 0.079-2.264), surgical delay time (P <0.001, OR: 2.006, CI: 1.02-0.372) and major complication (P = 0.002, OR: 6.41, CI: 0.661-3.053) were determined to be predictive factors of 30-day mortality. This study found the median surgical delay time as three days in surviving patients and five days in deceased ones. Thus, a 3-day surgical delay may be acceptable and sufficient for medical optimization and the consensus of the multidisciplinary team. Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",,1050
1285,35970734,The Association Between Somatic Symptom Disorders and Neurocognitive Disorders: A Systematic Review.,"Onset Onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms in older adults may represent prodromal manifestations of neurodegenerative disorders. The association between the onset of somatic symptom and related disorders (SSRD) and the subsequent development of neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear. A critical review of studies describing the association between SSRD and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia was performed. To critically review studies describing the association between SSRD and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia. A systematic review of Web of Science Core databases was carried out from inception of databases up to May 2021 to identify observational studies pertaining to both SSRD and neurodegenerative disorders. Data was extracted and compiled regarding subjects enrolled, age at onset of the SSRD and at onset of the neurodegenerative disorders, and specific SSRD manifestations and underlying neuropathologies reported. Thirteen articles were included. Of the 123 identified subjects with SSRD at baseline, 34.1% developed a neurodegenerative disorder, with 80.9% of these being a Lewy body spectrum disorder. The interval between onset of SSRD manifestations and subsequent development of a neurodegenerative disorder was less than 3 years for half of the cases. Of the 1,494 subjects with a neurodegenerative disorder at baseline retrieved, SSRD manifestations were reported in 33.4% of Lewy body spectrum disorders cases. Onset of SSRD manifestations antedated or was concomitant to the diagnosis of the Lewy body spectrum disorder in 65.6% of cases. While limited, current evidence suggests a possible association between late-onset SSRD and the subsequent development of neurodegenerative disorders, notably Lewy body spectrum disorders.",,1051
215,35982805,The Changes in the 18F FDG Metabolism in the Muscles by the Use of Cuboid Support Insoles.,"Healthy men aged 55,39, 23.45 years were administered 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) after fasting for over 5 h; then, a 30-min self-paced walking (6-min walk and 2-min rest + 6-min walk and 2-min rest + 6-min walk and 2-min rest + 6-min walk) session was performed. While walking, the same athletic shoes were used, same with walking supports, flat insoles, and cuboid support insoles (BMZ Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The walking test was performed with eye open. The examination was performed over 30 days apart. 18F-FDG accumulation within the gastrocnemius muscle was higher, the walking speed was improved. These results suggest that the use of cuboid support insoles may improve the cadence of the lower leg muscles.",,1052
1705,35968065,Oral Hygiene practices and Oral Health Related Quality of Life observed in patients reporting to Dental Institution in North India during COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The purpose of the study was to ascertain Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQOL) and evaluate oralhygiene practices in patients visiting a dental institution during COVID-19 time. Face-to face interviews were conducted using a semi-structured close-ended questionnaire,assessing oral hygiene practices and self-reported oral problems perceived in last 6 months, using both Hindi and English version of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) Questionnaire. Frequency distribution of oral hygiene practices were obtained, and Descriptive statistics computed the scores of OHIP-14. Kruskal-wallis test and Independent t-test were used to match the association of OHIP-14 with demographic variables. Multiple linear regression analysis was utilized to compute the association of OHIP-14 with independent variables, age and gender. Subjective evaluation of OHRQOL (Oral Health Related Quality of Life) using OHIP-14 Porforma resulted in high score for physical pain and psychological discomfort but subjects expressed less discomfort in connection to functional limitation, physical disability, psychological discomfort, social disability and handicap domains of OHIP-14. With progressive increase in age OHRQOL worsened. Females had poor OHRQOL, with significant difference as compared to males. Gender and marital status observed variance in OHIP-14 with statistically significant difference (P <0.000). More than two-third subjects preferred cleaning their teeth using toothbrush and toothpaste. Therefore, COVID-19 consequently impacted OHRQOL of the general population.",,1053
1978,35967629,Design of Blended Teaching Model Based on Emotion Recognition and Language Learning.,"With the vigorous development of Internet technology, great changes have taken place in all aspects of human society. This change is also having an increasingly significant impact on the education sector. It is even a trend to subvert the tradition. This also makes the student's identity a passive recipient of knowledge. At the same time, the final orientation of China's education model is the result of examinations, and there is little guidance for students' interest. Of course, traditional teaching also has the ability to enable students' subject knowledge to be systematically established, and to communicate with teachers in the teaching process, which can improve students' learning efficiency in the classroom. In the face of the information explosion in today's society and the rapid development of the above-mentioned technologies, the change of students' learning mode of knowledge has also ushered in an opportunity to change. The purpose of this paper is to study the establishment of a blended teaching model that combines traditional classrooms with network applications. With the help of the characteristics of network big data, it transforms students' passive learning identities, and combines offline traditional learning classrooms with online learning. In addition to the advantages mentioned above, the advantage of online learning is that some network science and technology can be used for the online learning platform to serve the entire teaching process. Therefore, this paper proposes a blended teaching model based on the network platform for students' emotion recognition and language learning result analysis. And from the experimental results in this paper, it can be seen that the recognition evaluation rate of HTMC, the feature of emotion recognition, is 71.52% and the recognition frequency of ETMC is 73.89%. The above two recognition parameters can better reflect the emotional changes in the mixed teaching process.",,1054
370,35979304,Giant retroperitoneal liposarcoma treated with radical conservative surgery: A case report and review of literature.,"Retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RLPS) is a rare malignant tumor of the connective tissue and usually grows to a large size, undetected. Diagnosis is currently based on collective findings from clinical examinations and computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, the latter of which show a fat density mass and possible surrounding organ involvement. Surgical resection is the main therapeutic strategy. The efficacy and safety of further therapeutic choices, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are still controversial. A 61-year-old man presented with complaint of a large left inguinal mass that had appeared suddenly, after a slight exertion. Ultrasonography revealed an omental inguinal hernia. During further clinical examination, an enormous palpable abdominal mass, continuing from the left inguinal location, was observed. CT revealed a giant RLPS, with remarkable mass effect and wide visceral dislocation. After multidisciplinary consultation, surgical intervention was performed. Subsequent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy were precluded by the mass' large size and retroperitoneal localization, features typically associated with non-response to these types of treatment. Instead, the patient underwent conservative treatment via radical surgical excision. After 1 year, his clinical condition remained good, with no radiological signs of recurrence. Conservative treatment via surgery resulted in a successful outcome for a large RLPS.",,1055
262,35982567,Groundwater depth regulates assembly processes of abundant and rare bacterial communities across arid inland river basin.,"Although numerous studies on bacterial biogeographic patterns in dryland have been conducted, bacterial community assembly across arid inland river basins is unclear. Here, we assessed the ecological drivers that regulate the assembly processes of abundant (ABS) and rare (RBS) bacterial subcommunities based on 162 soil samples collected in an arid inland river basin of China. The results showed that: (1) ABS exhibited a steeper distance-decay slope, and were more strongly affected by dispersal limitation (75.5% and 84.5%), than RBS in surface and subsurface soil. RBS were predominantly controlled by variable selection (54.6% and 50.2%). (2) Soil electric conductivity played a decisive role in mediating the balance between deterministic and stochastic processes of ABS and RBS in surface soil, increasing soil electric conductivity increased the importance of deterministic process. For subsurface soil, soil available phosphorus (SAP) and soil pH drove the balance in the assembly processes of ABS and RBS, respectively. The RBS shifted from determinism to stochasticity with decreased pH, while the dominance of deterministic processes was higher in low-SAP sites. (3) Groundwater depth seasonality had substantial effects on the assembly processes of ABS and RBS, but groundwater depth seasonality affected them indirectly mainly by regulating soil properties. Collectively, our study provides robust evidence that groundwater-driven variations in soil properties mediates the community assembly process of soil bacteria in arid inland river basins.

Inspired by the unique geometric structure of the spindle knot on spider silk, artificial fibers with periodic structures have been fabricated for water collection, which can effectively alleviate the problem of water shortage in arid areas. Traditional manufacturing methods are difficult to replicate the true shape of the spindle knot, and related research has encountered a bottleneck in improving water collection efficiency. 3D printing technology, which is different from traditional subtractive manufacturing, can directly replicate spider silk with periodic knots, making it possible to study water collection by artificial spider webs of various designs. Here, 3D printing technology is used to fabricate artificial spider webs with different geometric structures for efficient transportation and collection of water. In addition, the artificial spider web is treated with hydrophilic surfaces. In the humid environment for 2 h, the spider web with convex-concave multi-size spindle knots and multi-curvature connections has a maximum water collection capacity of 6.2g, and the mass of water collection is 35% higher than the existing best water collection artificial fibers. This work provides a sustainable and environmentally friendly route for the effective collection of humid air, and has certain reference value for the development of environmentally friendly water collection equipment.",,1057
556,35978578,Maximizing the Rod Outer Segment Yield in Retinas Extracted from Cattle Eyes.,"The retina is a thin neuronal multilayer responsible for the detection of visual information. The first step in visual transduction occurs in the photoreceptor outer segment. The studies on photoreception and visual biochemistry have often utilized rod outer segments (OS) or OS disks purified from mammalian eyes. Literature reports several OS and disk purification procedures that rarely specify the procedure utilized to collect the retina from the eye. Some reports suggest the use of scissors, while others do not mention the issue as they declare to utilize frozen retinas. Because the OS are deeply embedded in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the detachment of the retina by a harsh pull-out can cause the fracture of the photoreceptor cilium. Here, we present a protocol maximizing OS yield. Eye semi-cups, obtained by hemisecting the eyeball and discarding the anterior chamber structures and the vitreous, are filled with Mammalian Ringer. After 10-15 min of incubation, the retinas spontaneously detach with their wealth of OS almost intact. The impressive ability of the present protocol to minimize the number of OS stuck inside the RPE, and therefore lost, compared with the classic procedure, is shown by confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of samples stained ex vivo with a dye (MitoTracker deep red) that stains both retinal mitochondria and OS. Total protein assay of OS disks purified by either procedure also shows a 300% total protein yield improvement. The advantage of the protocol presented is its higher yield of photoreceptor OS for subsequent purification procedures, while maintaining the physiological features of the retina.",,1058
2170,35967348,The efficacy and safety of IL-13 inhibitors in atopic dermatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Several clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of interleukin-13 (IL-13) with lebrikizumab and tralokinumab in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the safety and efficacy of IL-13 inhibitors as a potent biologic for AD remain elusive. To assess the efficacy and safety of IL-13 inhibitors in moderate to severe AD. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs), comparing IL-13 inhibitors vs placebo treatment in patients with moderate to severe AD, were identified from public database from its inception to November 9th, 2021. The study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021254920). Six studies reporting 7 RCTs involving 2946 patients with moderate-to-severe AD were included for the pooled analysis. Compared with placebo, antagonizing IL-13 with lebrikizumab and tralokinumab showed a greater improvement in percentage change of EASI (MD -20.37, 95%CI -32.28, -8.47), and a larger proportion of patients achieving numerical rating scale (NRS) with more than 4-points improvement (RR 1.59, 95%CI 1.23, 2.05). Additionally, IL-13 inhibitors also improved impaired dermatology life quality index (DLQI) (MD -14.49, 95%CI -19.23, -9.75). In terms of safety, both lebrikizumab and tralokinumab were well tolerated, with the except that they were linked to an increased risk of conjunctivitis compared to placebo treatment. Antagonizing IL-13 with lebrikizumab and tralokinumab have demonstrated encouraging clinical efficacy against moderate-to-severe AD with excellent safety profile, albeit they did come with a higher risk of conjunctivitis than placebo treatment. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier ID=CRD42021254920.",,1059

1635,35968142,Dissecting photosynthetic electron transport and photosystems performance in Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) under salt stress.,"Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.), a vegetable with medical applications, has a strong adaptability to marginal barren land, but the suitability as planting material in saline land remains to be evaluated. This study was envisaged to examine salt tolerance in Jerusalem artichoke from the angle of photosynthetic apparatus stability by dissecting the photosynthetic electron transport process. Potted plants were exposed to salt stress by watering with a nutrient solution supplemented with NaCl. Photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) photoinhibition appeared under salt stress, according to the significant decrease in the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSI (△MR/MR0) and PSII. Consistently, leaf hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and lipid peroxidation were remarkably elevated after 8 days of salt stress, confirming salt-induced oxidative stress. Besides photoinhibition of the PSII reaction center, the PSII donor side was also impaired under salt stress, as a K step emerged in the prompt chlorophyll transient, but the PSII acceptor side was more vulnerable, considering the decreased probability of an electron movement beyond the primary quinone (ETo/TRo) upon depressed upstream electron donation. The declined performance of entire PSII components inhibited electron inflow to PSI, but severe PSI photoinhibition was not averted. Notably, PSI photoinhibition elevated the excitation pressure of PSII (1-qP) by inhibiting the PSII acceptor side due to the negative and positive correlation of △MR/MR0 with 1-qP and ETo/TRo, respectively. Furthermore, excessive reduction of PSII acceptors side due to PSI photoinhibition was simulated by applying a specific inhibitor blocking electron transport beyond primary quinone, demonstrating that PSII photoinhibition was actually accelerated by PSI photoinhibition under salt stress. In conclusion, PSII and PSI vulnerabilities were proven in Jerusalem artichoke under salt stress, and PSII inactivation, which was a passive consequence of PSI photoinhibition, hardly helped protect PSI. As a salt-sensitive species, Jerusalem artichoke was recommended to be planted in non-saline marginal land or mild saline land with soil desalination measures.",,1061
753,35975084,Selective reaction monitoring approach using structure-defined synthetic glycopeptides for validating glycopeptide biomarkers pre-determined by bottom-up glycoproteomics.,"Clusterin is a heavily glycosylated protein that is upregulated in various cancer and neurological diseases. The findings by the Hancock and Iliopoulos group that levels of the tryptic glycopeptide derived from plasma clusterin, 372Leu-Ala-Asn-Leu-Thr-Gln-Gly-Glu-Asp-Gln-Tyr-Tyr-Leu-Arg385 with a biantennary disialyl N-glycan (A2G2S2 or FA2G2S2) at Asn374 differed significantly prior to and after curative nephrectomy for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients motivated us to verify the feasibility of this glycopeptide as a novel biomarker of RCC. To determine the precise N-glycan structure attached to Asn374, whether A2G2S2 is composed of the Neu5Acα2,3Gal or/and the Neu5Acα2,6Gal moiety, we synthesized key glycopeptides having one of the two putative isomers. Selective reaction monitoring assay using synthetic glycopeptides as calibration standards allowed top-down glycopeptidomics for the absolute quantitation of targeted label-free glycopeptides in a range from 313.3 to 697.5 nM in the complex tryptic digests derived from serum samples of RCC patients and healthy controls. Our results provided evidence that the Asn374 residue of human clusterin is modified dominantly with the Neu5Acα2,6Gal structure and the levels of clusterin bearing an A2G2S2 with homo Neu5Acα2,6Gal terminals at Asn374 decrease significantly in RCC patients as compared with healthy controls. The present study elicits that a new strategy integrating the bottom-up glycoproteomics with top-down glycopeptidomics using structure-defined synthetic glycopeptides enables the confident identification and quantitation of the glycopeptide targets pre-determined by the existing methods for intact glycopeptide profiling.",,1062
788,35975049,One-step and room-temperature fabrication of carbon nanocomposites including Ni nanoparticles for supercapacitor electrodes.,"With the increasing importance of power storage devices, demand for the development of supercapacitors possessing both rapid reversible chargeability and high energy density is accelerating. Here we propose a simple process for the room temperature fabrication of pseudocapacitor electrodes consisting of a faradaic redox reaction layer on a metallic electrode with an enhanced surface area. As a model metallic electrode, an Au foil was irradiated with Ar+ ions with a simultaneous supply of C and Ni at room temperature, resulting in fine metallic Ni nanoparticles dispersed in the carbon matrix with local graphitization on the ion-induced roughened Au surface. A carbon layer including fine Ni nanoparticles acted as an excellent faradaic redox reaction layer and the roughened surface contributed to an increase in surface area. The fabricated electrode, which included only 14 μg cm-2 of Ni, showed a stored charge ability three times as large as that of the bulky Ni foil. Thus, it is believed that a carbon layer including Ni nanoparticles fabricated on the charge collective electrode with an ion-irradiation method is promising for the development of supercapacitors from the viewpoints of the reduced use of rare metal and excellent supercapacitor performance.",,1063
445,35978983,Neuromechanical Integration of Pelvic-Thoracic Rotation among Youth Baseball Throwers.,"The kinetic sequencing involved in the overhead throw anticipates an orchestration of body movement in which the more proximal segments of the body initiate movement prior to the more distal segment. This investigation explored neuromuscular and kinematic characteristics associated with one aspect of this kinetic sequencing, pelvic-to-thoracic rotation. Neuromuscular activation was recorded using surface electromyography and kinematic data was acquired using 3D videography. Specific objectives included 1) to describe the maximum angulation between the pelvic and thoracic body segments (X max angle ), 2) to test the hypothesis that glove-side external oblique peak neuromuscular activation (GEOPA) occurs before X max angle , 3) to test the hypothesis that throwing-side external oblique peak neuromuscular activation (TEOPA) occurs following X max angle . Results show the mean X max angle to be 45.96 degrees (±10.83). The time of mean GEOPA (2.3653 sec±0.9094) occurred following the time of mean X max angle (2.2793 sec,±0.9026, p<0.01), thus refuting the first hypothesis. The time of mean TEOPA (2.3658 sec,±0.8978) occurred following the time of mean X max angle (2.2793 sec,±0.9026, p<0.01), thus confirming the second hypothesis. Results suggest that youth baseball participants may not adequately utilize the core of the body to fully benefit from the optimal kinetic sequencing postulated within the literature.",,1064
1331,35969955,Vertically co-distributed vanadium and microplastics drive distinct microbial community composition and assembly in soil.,"Vanadium (V) and microplastics in soils draw increasing attention considering their significant threats to ecosystems. However, little is known about the vertical co-distribution of V and microplastics in soil profile and their combined effects on microbial community dynamics and assembly. This study investigated the spatial distribution of V and microplastics in the soils at a V smelting site and the associated microbial community characteristics along the vertical gradient. Both V and microplastics were found in the 50 cm soil profile with average concentrations of 203.5 ± 314.4 mg/kg and 165.1 ± 124.8 item/kg, respectively. Topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (20-50 cm) displayed distinct microbial community compositions. Metal-tolerant (e.g., Spirochaeta, Rubellimicrobium) and organic-degrading (e.g., Bradyrhizobium, Pseudolabrys) taxa as biomarkers were more abundant in the topsoil layer. V and microplastics directly affected the microbial structure in the topsoil and had indirect influences in the subsoil, with direct impacts from organic matter. In topsoil, deterministic processes were more prevalent for community assembly, whereas stochastic processes governed the subsoil. The interspecific relationship was closer in topsoil with greater network complexity and higher modularity. These findings promote the understanding of distinct heterogeneity of microbial communities jointly driven by V and microplastics in soil environment.",,1065
2249,35967182,Malaria Falciparum: Relapse After a Decade.,"Malaria is an infection caused by the Plasmodium malaria (PM) parasite. There are still cases of malaria that are reported in the United States on an annual basis. All these cases were a result of travelers who did not receive or follow their prescribed chemoprophylaxis, recommendations for avoiding mosquito bites while traveling, or relapsed dormant plasmodium. The malaria parasite can be transmitted by the bite of an infected female mosquito, through contact with infected blood products, or from mother to child during pregnancy through the placenta. It can take anywhere from 12 to 20 days for symptoms to appear, but there are cases of delayed development and/or relapse that can occur up to 13 years after the infection. We report a 31-year-old female with a history of malarial infection in Liberia, which had been treated ten years prior to her arrival in the United States. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain, fever, and headache. She was eventually diagnosed with plasmodium malaria infection relapse and treated with a 14-day course of primaquine 300 mg daily, with the symptoms resolving a few days after. We believe her malarial infection was caused by a dormant malarial parasite that evaded the immune system and relapsed without having a risk factor for relapse or re-infection 10 years after her original infection.",,1066
620,35977444,Reacting to changing environment: Updating patterns in social anxiety.,"Social anxiety (SA) was associated with biases in the updating of self-related information. Whether and under which conditions such biases emerge with respect to other-related information remains under-explored. In a pre-registered study, online participants (n = 590) were randomly assigned to one of two structurally identical reversal-learning tasks with social (faces) or non-social (shapes) stimuli. In the initial phase of this task, stimulus-outcome associations were learned by trial and error. Next, in the updating phase of the task, these associations were modified. SA was associated with reduced negative-to-positive updating and enhanced positive-tonegative updating of social, but not non-social, information. The results extend previous studies suggesting that SA is associated not only with biased updating of selfrelated information but also with biased updating of other-related information. This bias is specific to social information and may contribute, along with other information processing biases, to the maintenance of SA.",,1067
1684,35968088,Comparative chloroplast genome and transcriptome analysis on the ancient genus Isoetes from China.,"Isoetes is a famous living fossil that plays a significant role in the evolutionary studies of the plant kingdom. To explore the adaptive evolution of the ancient genus Isoetes from China, we focused on Isoetes yunguiensis (Q.F. Wang and W.C. Taylor), I. shangrilaensis (X. Li, Y.Q. Huang, X.K. Dai & X. Liu), I. taiwanensis (DeVol), I. sinensis (T.C. Palmer), I. hypsophila_GHC (Handel-Mazzetti), and I. hypsophila_HZS in this study. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated six individuals' chloroplast genomes and transcriptomes, and performed a series of analyses to investigate their chloroplast genome structures, RNA editing events, and adaptive evolution. The six chloroplast genomes of Isoetes exhibited a typical quadripartite structure with conserved genome sequence and structure. Comparative analyses of Isoetes species demonstrated that the gene organization, genome size, and GC contents of the chloroplast genome are highly conserved across the genus. Besides, our positive selection analyses suggested that one positively selected gene was statistically supported in Isoetes chloroplast genomes using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) based on branch-site models. Moreover, we detected positive selection signals using transcriptome data, suggesting that nuclear-encoded genes involved in the adaption of Isoetes species to the extreme environment of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). In addition, we identified 291-579 RNA editing sites in the chloroplast genomes of six Isoetes based on transcriptome data, well above the average of angiosperms. RNA editing in protein-coding transcripts results from amino acid changes to increase their hydrophobicity and conservation in Isoetes, which may help proteins form functional three-dimensional structure. Overall, the results of this study provide comprehensive transcriptome and chloroplast genome resources and contribute to a better understanding of adaptive evolutionary and molecular biology in Isoetes.",,1068
2423,35966873,"High secondary attack rate and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in household transmission study participants, Finland 2020-2021.","Household transmission studies offer the opportunity to assess both secondary attack rate (SAR) and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over time. In Spring 2020, we invited confirmed COVID-19 cases and their household members to four visits, where we collected nasopharyngeal and serum samples over 28 days after index case onset. We calculated SAR based on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAb) and assessed the persistence of NAb and IgG antibodies (Ab) against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleoprotein. SAR was 45% (39/87), including 35 symptomatic secondary cases. During the initial 28-day follow-up, 62% (80/129) of participants developed NAb. Of those that seroconverted, 90% (63/70), 85% (63/74), and 78% (45/58) still had NAb to early B-lineage SARS-CoV-2 3, 6, and 12 months after the onset of the index case. Anti-spike IgG Ab persisted in 100% (69/69), 97% (72/74), and 93% (55/59) of seroconverted participants after 3, 6, and 12 months, while anti-nucleoprotein IgG Ab levels waned faster, persisting in 99% (68/69), 78% (58/74), and 55% (39/71) of participants, respectively. Following detection of a COVID-19 case in a household, other members had a high risk of becoming infected. NAb to early B-lineage SARS-CoV-2 persisted for at least a year in most cases.",,1069
616,35977783,Effects of Plasticity on Elevational Range Size and Species Richness.,"AbstractElevational ranges within many taxa are greater in the north temperate region than the tropics. Two hypotheses to explain the pattern are, first, that large elevational ranges in the temperate region arise because species have evolved broad tolerance curves in response to seasonality and, second, that a low diversification rate in the temperate region (speciation minus extinction) has led to relatively few species, each of which occupies a large elevational range in the absence of competitors (character release). We build a quantitative genetic model of selection on a phenotypic trait, whereby increased tolerance is modeled as arising from plasticity in the trait. We show that broad tolerances result in evolution of large elevational ranges because they induce shallower genotypic clines and hence reduced maladaptive gene flow. The evolution of large elevational ranges results in relatively few competing species arranged along the elevational gradient at a species carrying capacity. In such saturated communities, species have much elevational overlap. In contrast, in similar-sized communities that could accommodate many more species, the resulting character release is associated with smaller elevational overlaps. Empirical assessment of these predictions should contribute to assessing any role for ecological limits in driving the latitudinal diversity gradient in species richness.",,1070
840,35974931,Cameron lesion with severe iron deficiency anemia and review of literature.,"Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in many developing countries including India. Inadequate iron in diet, poor iron absorption, excessive bleeding, or chronic blood loss in the stool/ urine may be the cause. Cameron lesions are mucosa injuries of gastric body or fundus in the background of hiatal hernia. Here we describe a case report of a 50-year-old female who presented to hospital with pain in abdomen. During laboratory workup she had severe anemia due to iron deficiency. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a large hiatal hernia with a superficial ulcer present in the hiatal pouch, the GE junction being 35 cm from the incisors. So, a hiatus hernia with a Cameron ulcer was identified as the culprit of iron deficiency anemia. The diagnosis of a Cameron lesion is difficult and sometimes ignored. In patients with anemia/bleeding, thorough surveillance of all stomach folds is essential, especially if a significant hiatal hernia is present.",,1071
2242,35967189,The Effect of Video-Based Preanaesthetic Preparation Versus Conventional Approach on Parental Anxiety in Paediatric Dental Procedures: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"Background Parental anxiety has been identified as a risk factor affecting the behaviour of children before operative intervention. A preanaesthetic visit is a standard component of preoperative preparation, which may reduce parental anxiety. The use of audiovisual aids to demonstrate the conduct of anaesthesia may help improve parental education and reduce anxiety. Patient and methods We analysed data from a prospective randomised trial conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Parents of children posted for day care dental procedures were enrolled in the study. Children could be of either gender, aged 2-6 years, and categorised as American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) 1 or 2. Parents' anxiety regarding the surgical and anaesthesia procedure was assessed using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS). The first APAIS scoring was recorded on arrival in the preoperative holding area. Thereafter, the participants were randomly allocated into two groups; one group was shown a short video on a smartphone of a dental operating theatre (OT), dental chair and anaesthesia equipment (SPG group), while the other group was verbally explained the dental procedure (conventional management or CM group). The second APAIS scoring was done in the postoperative recovery area one hour after the procedure. Demographic characteristics, socio-economic conditions and history were recorded. Anxiety scores were compared between the two groups, and any change was analysed. Results Seventy parents were included in the study, with 36 randomised to the SPG group and 34 to the CM group. Both groups were comparable in terms of demographic characteristics. There was a statistically significant decrease in anxiety scores in the SPG group, from a mean of 25.47 at the preoperative assessment to 14.92 at the postoperative timepoint (p<0.001). In the CM group, the mean APAIS score decreased from 25.26 to 24.56 (p=0.059). Conclusion There was a significant reduction in anxiety scores in the postoperative period among parents who were shown an operating room video in the preoperative period.",,1072
1296,35970675,Factors affecting stress levels in parents of surgical neonates: A prospective observational study.,"There is a paucity of research focusing on the stress levels in parents of newborns undergoing surgery. Resource challenged systems have to deal with overcrowding, a shortage of workforce along with demographic and socioeconomic issues like delayed presentations and out of pocket expenses. The primary objective of this study was to understand the factors associated with stress in the parents of these congenitally malformed neonates. This was a prospective cohort study, which was conducted in a neonatal surgical ICU of a tertiary care teaching hospital. Factors affecting stress levels in parents of surgical neonates were studied in 100 participants. A multi-dimensional questionnaire - The PSS: NICU score was utilized in the study. The parents were interviewed on Day 3-5 after surgery. 59% of the respondents were fathers. The majority of the parents were in the age bracket of 24 to 35 years. The mean scores for the subscales sights and sounds, looks and behavior and alteration in the parental role were 3.24±0.8, 3.52±0.63, 3.55±0.8 and 2.8 ± 0.9 respectively. The highest level of stress was found in the domains of alteration of parental role and infant appearance and behavior. Comparisons showed significantly higher maternal scores in all the domains. Overall stress scores were highest for abdominal wall defects. Parents of neonates undergoing surgery suffer from significant stress levels and appropriate counseling targeted towards specific stressors is required to allay this important parental issue.",,1073
990,35974629,Statistical properties of large data sets with linear latent features.,"Analytical understanding of how low-dimensional latent features reveal themselves in large-dimensional data is still lacking. We study this by defining a probabilistic linear latent features model with additive noise and by analytically and numerically computing the statistical distributions of pairwise correlations and eigenvalues of the data correlation matrix. This allows us to resolve the latent feature structure across a wide range of data regimes set by the number of recorded variables, observations, latent features, and the signal-to-noise ratio. We find a characteristic imprint of latent features in the distribution of correlations and eigenvalues and provide an analytic estimate for the boundary between signal and noise, even in the absence of a spectral gap.",,1074
1002,35974617,Structural properties of liquids in extreme confinement.,"We simulate a hard-sphere liquid in confined geometry where the separation of the two parallel, hard walls is smaller than two particle diameters. By systematically reducing the wall separation we analyze the behavior of structural and thermodynamic properties, such as inhomogeneous density profiles, structure factors, and compressibilities when approaching the two-dimensional limit. In agreement with asymptotic predictions, we find for quasi-two-dimensional fluids that the density profile becomes parabolic and the structure factor converges toward its two-dimensional counterpart. To extract the compressibility in polydisperse samples a perturbative expression is used which qualitatively influences the observed nonmonotonic dependence of the compressibility with wall separation. We also present theoretical calculations based on fundamental-measure theory and integral-equation theory, which are in very good agreement with the simulation results.",,1075
2310,35967070,Elucidating Sensitivity and Stability Relationship of Gold-Carbon Hybrid LSPR Sensors Using Principal Component Analysis.,"Sensitive localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensing is achieved using nanostructured geometries of noble metals which typically have dimensions less than 100 nm. Among the plethora of geometries and materials, the spherical geometries of gold (Au) are widely used to develop sensitive bio/chemical sensors due to ease of manufacturing and biofunctionlization. One major limitation of spherical-shaped geometries of Au, used for LSPR sensing, is their low refractive index (RI) sensitivity which is commonly addressed by adding another material to the Au nanostructures. However, the process of addition of new material on Au nanostructures, while retaining the LSPR of Au, often comes with a trade-off which is associated with the instability of the developed composite, especially in harsh chemical environments. Addressing this challenge, we develop a Au-graphene-layered hybrid (Au-G) with high stability (studied up to 2 weeks here) and enhanced RI sensitivity (a maximum of 180.1 nm/RIU) for generic LSPR sensing applications using spherical Au nanostructures in harsh chemical environments, involving organic solvents. Additionally, by virtue of principal component analysis, we correlate stability and sensitivity of the developed system. The relationship suggests that the shelf life of the material is proportional to its sensitivity, while the stability of the sensor during the measurement in liquid environment decreases when the sensitivity of the material is increased. Though we uncover this relationship for the LSPR sensor, it remains evasive to explore similar relationships within other optical and electrochemical transduction techniques. Therefore, our work serves as a benchmark report in understanding/establishing new correlations between sensing parameters.",,1076
2075,35967443,Toll-like receptor-mediated innate immunity orchestrates adaptive immune responses in HBV infection.,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains to be a substantial global burden, especially for end-stage liver diseases. It is well accepted that HBV-specific T and B cells are essential for controlling HBV infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent one of the major first-line antiviral defenses through intracellular signaling pathways that induce antiviral inflammatory cytokines and interferons, thereby shaping adaptive immunity. However, HBV has evolved strategies to counter TLR responses by suppressing the expression of TLRs and blocking the downstream signaling pathways, thus limiting HBV-specific adaptive immunity and facilitating viral persistence. Recent studies have stated that stimulation of the TLR signaling pathway by different TLR agonists strengthens host innate immune responses and results in suppression of HBV replication. In this review, we will discuss how TLR-mediated responses shape HBV-specific adaptive immunity as demonstrated in different experimental models. This information may provide important insight for HBV functional cure based on TLR agonists as immunomodulators.",,1077
1990,35967616,The Effectiveness of a Mindfulness Training Program on Selected Psychological Indices and Sports Performance of Sub-Elite Squash Athletes.,"Mindfulness Acceptance Commitment (MAC) programs have garnered much support in enhancing sport performance through present-moment focus and non-judgmental thoughts. Expanding on previous studies conducted in collegiate and professional settings, the current study investigates the application of MAC amongst national sub-elite athletes. The study was conducted utilizing a single case A-B design, with a total of six sub-elite Malaysian Squash athletes (2 males, 3 females; Mage = 15 ± 2 years) purposively sampled from the Malaysian national squash team. Participants underwent 6 weeks of baseline testing, 7 weeks of program intervention, and a retention test 4 weeks post-intervention. The intervention consisted of psycho-education, centering and cognitive defusion among other aspects as purported in MAC programs. Changes in proficiency of mindful practice was observed through the Mindfulness Awareness Acceptance Scale (MAAS), experiential avoidance through the Acceptance Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), stress levels through the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and sport performance through both coach- and self-rated scales. Overall, visual analysis revealed improvements in MAAS levels (M = 1.15 ± 0.15), with no marked changes in AAQ-II (M = -0.002 ± 1.12) and PSS (M = 0.7 ± 0.93) after 7 weeks of intervention. Coach-rated sport performance also improved across the phases (M = 0.86 ± 0.93), with mixed responses for self-rated improvements (M = 0.01 ± 1.19). Overall, the benefits of MAC program were well-maintained past the post-intervention phase. The current study supported the implementation of an MAC program for sub-elite athletes in real-world settings.",,1078
1162,35973709,"An eHealth self-management intervention for adults with chronic kidney disease, My Kidneys My Health: a mixed-methods study.","There is limited research of electronic tools for self-management for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We sought to evaluate participant engagement, perceived self-efficacy and website usage in a preliminary evaluation of My Kidneys My Health, a patient-facing eHealth tool in Canada. We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study of adults with CKD who were not on kidney replacement therapy and who had access to My Kidneys My Health for 8 weeks. Outcomes included acceptance (measured by the Technology Acceptance Model), self-efficacy (measured by the Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale [CDSES]) and website usage patterns (captured using Google Analytics). We analyzed participant interviews using qualitative content analysis. Twenty-nine participants with CKD completed baseline questionnaires, of whom 22 completed end-of-study questionnaires; data saturation was achieved with 15 telephone interviews. Acceptance was high, with more than 70% of participants agreeing or strongly agreeing that the website was easy to use and useful. Of the 22 who completed end-of-study questionnaires, 18 (82%) indicated they would recommend its use to others and 16 (73%) stated they would use the website in the future. Average scores for website satisfaction and look and feel were 7.7 (standard deviation [SD] 2.0) and 8.2 (SD 2.0) out of 10, respectively. The CDSES indicated that participants gained an increase in CKD information. Interviewed participants reported that the website offered valuable information and interactive tools for patients with early or newly diagnosed CKD, or for those experiencing changes in health status. Popular website pages and interactive features included Food and Diet, What is CKD, My Question List and the Depression Screener. Participants indicated that the My Kidneys My Health website provided accessible content and tools that may improve self-efficacy and support in CKD self-management. Further evaluation of the website's effectiveness in supporting self-management among a larger, more heterogenous population is warranted.",,1079
1671,35968103,Recognition of a translocation motif in the regulator HpaA from Xanthomonas euvesicatoria is controlled by the type III secretion chaperone HpaB.,"The Gram-negative plant-pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas euvesicatoria is the causal agent of bacterial spot disease in pepper and tomato plants. Pathogenicity of X. euvesicatoria depends on a type III secretion (T3S) system which translocates effector proteins into plant cells and is associated with an extracellular pilus and a translocon in the plant plasma membrane. Effector protein translocation is activated by the cytoplasmic T3S chaperone HpaB which presumably targets effectors to the T3S system. We previously reported that HpaB is controlled by the translocated regulator HpaA which binds to and inactivates HpaB during the assembly of the T3S system. In the present study, we show that translocation of HpaA depends on the T3S substrate specificity switch protein HpaC and likely occurs after pilus and translocon assembly. Translocation of HpaA requires the presence of a translocation motif (TrM) in the N-terminal region. The TrM consists of an arginine-and proline-rich amino acid sequence and is also essential for the in vivo function of HpaA. Mutation of the TrM allowed the translocation of HpaA in hpaB mutant strains but not in the wild-type strain, suggesting that the recognition of the TrM depends on HpaB. Strikingly, the contribution of HpaB to the TrM-dependent translocation of HpaA was independent of the presence of the C-terminal HpaB-binding site in HpaA. We propose that HpaB generates a recognition site for the TrM at the T3S system and thus restricts the access to the secretion channel to effector proteins. Possible docking sites for HpaA at the T3S system were identified by in vivo and in vitro interaction studies and include the ATPase HrcN and components of the predicted cytoplasmic sorting platform of the T3S system. Notably, the TrM interfered with the efficient interaction of HpaA with several T3S system components, suggesting that it prevents premature binding of HpaA. Taken together, our data highlight a yet unknown contribution of the TrM and HpaB to substrate recognition and suggest that the TrM increases the binding specificity between HpaA and T3S system components.",,1080
902,35974820,"Ba3[Sn(OH)6][SeO4]2·3H2O, a hydrated 1:2 double salt of barium hexa-hydroxidostannate(IV) and barium selenate(VI).","Single crystals of tribarium hexa-hydroxidostannate(IV) bis-[selenate(VI)] trihydrate, Ba3H12O17Se2Sn or Ba3[Sn(OH)6][SeO4]2·3H2O, prepared from solid BaSnO3 and aqueous Na2[SeO4] solutions have hexa-gonal (P63) symmetry. The structure consists of four different primary building units: a hexa-hydroxidostannate(IV) ion, two different selenate(VI) ions, all three of point group symmetry C 3, and a mono-capped {BaO9}-square anti-prism of point group symmetry C 1. The secondary building units result from three of the barium coordination polyhedra linked together via common edges. While one of the two tetra-hedral voids formed from these trimeric units is filled by one bidentate, chelating μ2-selenate ion, the other one remains unoccupied as the corresponding second selenate ion only acts as a monodentate, μ1-ligand. SBUs are completed by hexa-hydroxidostannate(IV) ions sharing adjacent edges on the uncapped faces of the three, mono-capped square anti-prisms. These SBUs are arranged into layers via common edges on the uncapped, square faces of the {BaO9} coordination polyhedra in a way that the hexa-hydroxidostannate(IV) ions act as linkage between two neighboring layers.",,1081
1105,35974514,Forced symmetry breaking as a mechanism for rogue bursts in a dissipative nonlinear dynamical lattice.,"We propose an alternative to the standard mechanisms for the formation of rogue waves in a nonconservative, nonlinear lattice dynamical system. We consider an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system that features regular periodic bursting arising from forced symmetry breaking. We then connect such potentially exploding units via a diffusive lattice coupling and investigate the resulting spatiotemporal dynamics for different types of initial conditions (localized or extended). We find that in both cases, particular oscillators undergo extremely fast and large amplitude excursions, resembling a rogue wave burst. Furthermore, the probability distribution of different amplitudes exhibits bimodality, with peaks at both vanishing and very large amplitude. While this phenomenology arises over a range of coupling strengths, for large values thereof the system eventually synchronizes and the above phenomenology is suppressed. We use both distributed (such as a synchronization order parameter) and individual oscillator diagnostics to monitor the dynamics and identify potential precursors to large amplitude excursions. We also examine similar behavior with amplitude-dependent diffusive coupling.",,1082
1431,35968468,Spatiotemporal variations of public opinion on social distancing in the Netherlands: Comparison of Twitter and longitudinal survey data.,"Social distancing has been implemented by many countries to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding public support for this policy calls for effective and efficient methods of monitoring public opinion on social distancing. Twitter analysis has been suggested as a cheaper and faster-responding alternative to traditional survey methods. The current empirical evidence is mixed in terms of the correspondence between the two methods. We aim to compare the two methods in the context of monitoring the Dutch public's opinion on social distancing. For this comparison, we quantified the temporal and spatial variations in public opinion and their sensitivities to critical events using data from both Dutch Twitter users and respondents from a longitudinal survey. A longitudinal survey on a representative Dutch sample (n = 1,200) was conducted between July and November 2020 to measure opinions on social distancing weekly. From the same period, near 100,000 Dutch tweets were categorized as supporting or rejecting social distancing based on a model trained with annotated data. Average stances for the 12 Dutch provinces and over the 20 weeks were computed from the two data sources and were compared through visualizations and statistical analyses. Both data sources suggested strong support for social distancing, but public opinion was much more varied among tweets than survey responses. Both data sources showed an increase in public support for social distancing over time, and a strong temporal correspondence between them was found for most of the provinces. In addition, the survey but not Twitter data revealed structured differences among the 12 provinces, while the two data sources did not correspond much spatially. Finally, stances estimated from tweets were more sensitive to critical events happened during the study period. Our findings indicate consistencies between Twitter data analysis and survey methods in describing the overall stance on social distancing and temporal trends. The lack of spatial correspondence may imply limitations in the data collections and calls for surveys with larger regional samples. For public health management, Twitter analysis can be used to complement survey methods, especially for capturing public's reactivities to critical events amid the current pandemic.",,1083
731,35975148,SrO-layer insertion in Ruddlesden-Popper Sn-based perovskite enables efficient CO2 electroreduction towards formate.,"Tin (Sn)-based oxides have been proved to be promising catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate (HCOO-). However, their performance is limited by their reductive transformation into metallic derivatives during the cathodic reaction. This paper describes the catalytic chemistry of a Sr2SnO4 electrocatalyst with a Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite structure for the CO2RR. The Sr2SnO4 electrocatalyst exhibits a faradaic efficiency of 83.7% for HCOO- at -1.08 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode with stability for over 24 h. The insertion of the SrO-layer in the RP structure of Sr2SnO4 leads to a change in the filling status of the anti-bonding orbitals of the Sn active sites, which optimizes the binding energy of *OCHO and results in high selectivity for HCOO-. At the same time, the interlayer interaction between interfacial octahedral layers and the SrO-layers makes the crystalline structure stable during the CO2RR. This study would provide fundamental guidelines for the exploration of perovskite-based electrocatalysts to achieve consistently high selectivity in the CO2RR.",,1084
2157,35967361,Fc engineered ACE2-Fc is a potent multifunctional agent targeting SARS-CoV2.,"Joining a function-enhanced Fc-portion of human IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 produces an antiviral decoy with strain transcending virus neutralizing activity. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and Fc-effector functions of ACE2-Fc decoy proteins, formatted with or without the ACE2 collectrin domain, were optimized by Fc-modification. The different Fc-modifications resulted in distinct effects on neutralization and effector functions. H429Y, a point mutation outside the binding sites for FcγRs or complement caused non-covalent oligomerization of the ACE2-Fc decoy proteins, abrogated FcγR interaction and enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Another Fc mutation, H429F did not improve virus neutralization but resulted in increased C5b-C9 fixation and transformed ACE2-Fc to a potent mediator of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) expressing cells. Furthermore, modification of the Fc-glycan enhanced cell activation via FcγRIIIa. These different immune profiles demonstrate the capacity of Fc-based agents to be engineered to optimize different mechanisms of protection for SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other viral pathogens.",,1085
970,35974649,Derivation of a statistical model for classical systems obeying the fractional exclusion principle.,"The violation of the Pauli principle has been surmised in several models of the fractional exclusion statistics and successfully applied to several quantum systems. In this paper, a classical alternative of the exclusion statistics is studied using the maximum entropy methods. The difference between the Bose-Einstein statistics and the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is understood in terms of a separable quantity, namely the degree of indistinguishability. Starting from the usual Maxwell-Boltzmann microstate counting formula, a special restriction related to the degree of indistinguishability is incorporated using Lagrange multipliers to derive the probability distribution function at equilibrium under NVE conditions. It is found that the resulting probability distribution function generates real positive values within the permissible range of parameters. For a dilute system, the probability distribution function is intermediate between the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics and follows the exclusion principle. Properties of various variables of this novel statistical model are studied and possible application to classical thermodynamics is discussed.",,1086
1879,35967734,Metonymy Processing in Chinese: A Linguistic Context-Sensitive Eye-Tracking Preliminary Study.,"Current cognitively oriented research on metaphor proposes that understanding metaphorical expressions is a process of building embodied simulations, which are constrained by past and present bodily experiences. However, it has also been shown that metaphor processing is also constrained by the linguistic context but, to our knowledge, there is no comparable work in the domain of metonymy. As an initial attempt to fill this gap, the present study uses eye-tracking experimentation to explore this aspect of Chinese metonymy processing. It complements previous work on how the length of preceding linguistic context influences metonymic processing by focusing on: (1) the contextual information of both the preceding target words; (2) the immediate spillover after the target words; and (3) whether the logical relationship between the preceding contextual information and the target word is strong or weak (a 2 × 2 between-subject experiment with target words of literal/metonymy and logic of strong/weak). Results show that readers take longer to arrive at a literal interpretation than at a metonymic one when the preceding information is in a weak logic relationship with target words, although this disparity can disappear when the logic is strong. Another finding is that both the preceding and the spillover contextual information contribute to metonymy processing when the spillover information does more to the metonymy than it does to the literal meaning. This study further complements cognitive and pragmatic approaches to metonymy, which are centered on its conceptual nature and its role in interpretation, by drawing attention to how the components of sentences contribute to the metonymic processing of target words. Based on an experiment, a contextual model of Chinese metonymy processing is proposed.",,1087
443,35979038,Overtransfusion of packed red blood cells during massive transfusion activation: a potential quality metric for trauma resuscitation.,"The goal of this study was to explore the incidence of overtransfusion in trauma patients requiring massive transfusion protocol (MTP) activation and identify modifiable risk factors. We hypothesized that overtransfusion is common after MTP activation. Patients admitted to a level I trauma center from July 2016 to December 2019 and who required MTP activation were selected. The primary outcome was overtransfusion, defined as a hemoglobin (Hg) ≥11 g/dL at 24 hours (±2 hours). A Cox regression model was used to identify independent risk factors for overtransfusion. 140 patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 39.0 years, with the majority (74.3%) being male. The median (IQR) Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 24.0 (58.0) and 38.4% had a penetrating mechanism. The median (IQR) admission Hg was 12.6 (11.7) g/dL. Overall, 71.4% of patients were overtransfused by the conclusion of MTP, 43.6% 24 hours later, and 29.5% at discharge. Overtransfusion did not correlate with the number of units of blood transfused nor with the duration of MTP. Overtransfused patients at 24 hours after the conclusion of MTP were significantly more likely to present with a penetrating injury (52.5% vs. 27.3%, p=0.003) and have a significantly lower ISS (median (IQR) 18.5 (44.0) vs. 26.0 (58.0), p=0.035.) In a Cox regression model, penetrating mechanism (adjusted HR (AHR): 2.93; adjusted p=0.004) and admission base excess (BE) (AHR: 1.15; adjusted p=0.001) were the only variables independently associated with overtransfusion. Overtransfusion of trauma patients requiring MTP activation is highly common, leading to overutilization of a limited resource. Penetrating trauma and BE may be modifiable risk factors that can help limit overtransfusion. Overtransfusion should be tracked as a data point by blood banks and trauma centers and be further studied as a potential quality metric for the resuscitation of massively transfused trauma patients.

278,35981946,The closing survival gap after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States.,"Socio-economic inequalities among different racial/ethnic groups have increased in many high-income countries. It is unclear, however, whether increasing socio-economic inequalities are associated with increasing differences in survival in liver transplant (LT) recipients. Adults undergoing first time LT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between 2002 and 2017 recorded in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) were included and grouped into three cohorts. Patient survival and graft survival stratified by race/ethnicity were compared among the cohorts using unadjusted and adjusted analyses. White/Caucasians comprised the largest group (n=9,006, 64.9%), followed by Hispanic/Latinos (n=2,018, 14.5%), Black/African Americans (n=1,379, 9.9%), Asians (n=1,265, 9.1%) and other ethnic/racial groups (n=188, 1.3%). Compared to Cohort I (2002-2007), the 5-year survival of Cohort III (2012-2017) increased by 18% for Black/African Americans, by 13% for Whites/Caucasians, by 10% for Hispanic/Latinos, by 9% for patients of other racial/ethnic groups and by 8% for Asians (All P values<0.05). Despite Black/African Americans experienced the highest survival improvement, their overall outcomes remained significantly lower than other ethnic∕racial groups (adjusted HR for death=1.20; 95%CI 1.05-1.36; P=0.005; adjusted HR for graft loss=1.21; 95%CI 1.08-1.37; P=0.002). The survival gap between Black/African Americans and other ethnic/racial groups undergoing LT for HCC has significantly decreased over time. However, Black/African Americans continue to have the lowest survival among all racial/ethnic groups.",,1089
593,35977904,Antithymocyte globulin versus basiliximab induction for kidney transplantation in elderly patients: matched analysis within the Korean multicentric registry.,"Basiliximab (BSX) and antithymocyte globulins (ATGs), are two major immunosuppressive agents commonly used as induction therapy for kidney transplant (KT) recipients. The superiority of ATG over BSX has not been well established, especially in elderly KT recipients with low immunological risk. A total of 847 elderly (≥60 years old), low-risk KT patients in the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry were propensity score-matched at a 1:2 ratio and compared according to ATG or BSX induction therapy. The primary outcome was patient and graft survival and biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection. The secondary outcome was graft function, BK virus nephropathy, infection, cancer, new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT), and delayed graft function. In total, 165 patients in the ATG group were matched with 298 patients in the BSX group with average ages of 64.3 and 64.2 years, respectively. During a follow-up of 28.5 ± 10.4 months, the cumulative probabilities of death-censored graft failure at 3 years posttransplantation were 1.3% and 1.4% in ATG and BSX groups, respectively, without a significant difference (p = 0.72). The cumulative probability of NODAT at 3 years posttransplantation was significantly higher in the BSX group (35.6% vs. 21.6%, p = 0.02). The median tacrolimus trough level was significantly lower at 6 months after KT in the ATG group (5.7 ng/mL vs. 6.4 ng/mL, p = 0.001). There were no differences in the other evaluated outcomes. Compared with BSX, in elderly, low-risk KT patients, ATG reduced tacrolimus and steroid requirements without differences in all-cause mortality, rejection, or infection, resulting in a reduced NODAT incidence.",,1090
1116,35974503,Interface collisions with diffusive mass transport.,"We report on a linear Langevin model that describes the evolution of the roughness of two interfaces that move towards each other and are coupled by a diffusion field. This model aims at describing the closing of the gap between two 2D material domains during growth, and the subsequent formation of a rough grain boundary. We assume that deposition occurs in the gap between the two domains and that the growth units diffuse and may attach to the edges of the domains. These units can also detach from edges, diffuse, and reattach elsewhere. For slow growth, the edge roughness increases monotonously and then saturates at some equilibrium value. For fast growth, the roughness exhibits a maximum just before the collision between the two interfaces, which is followed by a minimum. The peak of the roughness can be dominated by statistical fluctuations or by edge instabilities. A phase diagram with three regimes is obtained: Slow growth without peak, peak dominated by statistical fluctuations, and peak dominated by instabilities. These results reproduce the main features observed in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.",,1091
758,35975079,Electronic effects on the mechanism of the NAD+ coenzyme reduction catalysed by a non-organometallic ruthenium(ii) polypyridyl amine complex in the presence of formate.,"In the present study, electronic effects on the mechanism of the NAD+ coenzyme reduction in the presence of formate, catalysed by a non-organometallic ruthenium(ii) polypyridyl amine complex, were investigated. The [RuII(terpy)(ampy)Cl]Cl (terpy = 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine, ampy = 2-(aminomethyl)pyridine) complex was employed as the catalyst. The reactions were studied in a water/ethanol mixture as a function of formate, catalyst, and NAD+ concentrations at 37 °C. The overall process was found to be 11 to 18 times slower than for the corresponding ethylenediamine (en) complex as the result of π-back bonding effects of the ampy ligand. The mechanistic studies revealed a complete set of reactions that accounted for the overall catalytic cycle based on a formate-induced hydride transfer reaction to form the reduced coenzyme, NADH. The geometries of the ruthenium(ii)-ampy complexes involved in the catalytic cycle and free energy changes for the main steps were predicted by DFT calculations. Similar calculations were also performed for the analogues ruthenium(ii)-en and ruthenium(ii)-bipy complexes (bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine). The DFT calculated energies show that both the solvent-formato exchange and the formato-hydrido conversion reactions have negative (favourable) energies to proceed spontaneously. The reactions involving the en complex have the more negative (favourable) reaction energies, followed by the ampy complex, in agreement with faster reactions for en complexes and slower reactions for bipy complexes than for ampy complexes.",,1092
1455,35968443,Mental health status of children with disorders of sexual development and their correlates.,"Disorders of sexual development (DSD) refer to the congenital abnormalities of chromosomes, gonads, or gender anatomy. Children with DSD usually experience more stress. The present study aims to evaluate the mental health status of children with DSD, and to explore the potential relevant factors. We included 30 children with DSD and 30 age- and gender-matched children without DSD as the control group. All the children and their parents completed the scales of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Children over 8 years old (n = 22) completed the Screen Scale for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), the Depression Self-rating Scale for Children (DSRSC), and the Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran-own memories of parental rearing practices in childhood. DSD children had significantly higher somatic anxiety, mental anxiety, and total anxiety scores than the control group (p < 0.001). The scores of the SCARED, anxiety, and depression subscales of DSD children were higher than those of control children (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). The correlation analysis showed that the score of generalized anxiety was positively related to age and entertainment. The regression analysis showed that age was a major factor that affected generalized anxiety in DSD children, and neuroticism was a major factor of anxiety disorder and separation anxiety in DSD children. Children with DSD have obvious anxiety problems, which are associated with family environmental factors (entertainment, success, and conflicts) and age. It is important to focus emphasis on emotional stability in children with DSD for detecting anxiety-related emotional disorders early.",,1093
451,35978939,Moyamoya syndrome with ruptured aneurysm in α-thalassemia: A case report.,"Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) refers to the moyamoya vascular disease associated with various systemic diseases and conditions, including sickle cell anemia, Fanconi anemia and iron deficiency anemia. However, the association between MMS and other hemoglobinopathies is less frequently observed. MMS, like moyamoya disease, is a cerebrovascular condition that is characterized by chronic progressive stenosis or occlusion at the ends of the bilateral internal carotid arteries, anterior cerebral arteries and the beginning of the middle cerebral arteries, and is secondary to the formation of an abnormal vascular network at the base of the skull. Patients with MMS are prone to thrombosis, aneurysm and bleeding. The present study reports the case of a 43-year-old man with α-thalassemia who presented with moyamoya vessels with a ruptured aneurysm bleeding into the ventricle. α-thalassemia is considered as an extremely rare but potential cause of MMS. Since MMS is a progressive disease, early diagnosis and treatment is vital to prevent the disease from worsening.",,1094
1340,35969711,Influence of age and type of feed ingredients on apparent and standardized ileal amino acid digestibility in broiler chickens.,"Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of bird age on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) for 10-d-old Experiment (Exp. 1) and 22-d-old (Exp. 2) male broilers. This study investigated the effects of different broiler ages and feed ingredients on AID and SID of AA in corn and soybean meal (SBM). Four hundred and eighty (age = 7 d; initial body weight [BW] = 173.4 ± 12.65 g) and 192 (age = 18 d; initial BW = 772.2 ± 62.13 g) birds were allocated to three dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design with eight replicate cages per treatment. Two diets were formulated based on corn or SBM as the sole source of AA in the diet. A nitrogen-free diet was also formulated to measure basal endogenous losses of AA. Experimental diets were given for 3 and 4 days in Exps. 1 and 2, respectively. An interaction was observed (p < 0.05) between the age of birds and the type of ingredient for the AID of most AA, except for methionine, valine, cysteine (Cys), and tyrosine; however, the effects of age and type of ingredients were diminished in the SID of AA, except for histidine, isoleucine, leucine (Leu), phenylalanine, alanine (Ala), and glutamic acid (Glu). The AID of AA, except for Leu and Cys and the SID of AA, except for Leu, Ala, Glu, and Pro in SBM were greater (p < 0.05) than in corn. As the age of birds increased from 10 to 22 d, digestibility of all AA increased (p < 0.05), regardless of the expression of AA digestibility (i.e., AID and SID). In conclusion, the AID and SID of AA in both corn and SBM increased with increasing age, and the AID and SID of AA in SBM were greater than in corn.",,1095
609,35977790,The Relationship between Vector Species Richness and the Risk of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases.,"AbstractInfectious diseases can impact human welfare and impede wildlife management. Much recent research explores whether biodiversity increases or decreases infectious disease risk. Here, we theoretically study the relationship between vector species richness and the risk of vector-borne diseases using an epidemiological model of a single host and multiple vectors. The model considers that vectors are involved in interspecific feeding interference that causes transmission interference and in interspecific recruitment competition that mediates susceptible vector regulation. The model reveals three possible shapes of the vector richness-disease risk relationship: monotonic amplification, hump-shaped, and monotonic dilution patterns. The monotonic amplification pattern occurs across a wide parameter region. The hump-shaped and monotonic dilution patterns are found when transmission interference is strong and recruitment competition is weak. Unexpectedly, susceptible vector regulation not only promotes dilution but can strengthen amplification if coupled with strong transmission interference. Our results suggest that vector richness might be more likely to cause amplification rather than dilution, and shifts in the community mean trait values of vectors could also affect disease risk along the vector richness gradient.",,1096
73,35983414,Evaluating the Implementation of a Digital Diabetes Prevention Program in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System Among Older Adults: Results of a Natural Experiment.,"The purpose of this natural experiment study was to assess the effectiveness of a 12-month digital Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for adults aged 65-75 years with prediabetes and obesity within a large, integrated health care system. Adjusting for propensity scores and covariates, patients who enrolled and participated in the digital DPP had a mean weight loss of 8.6 lb over 12 months and 5.7 lb by 24 months, compared with a steady, minimal weight loss of 1.3 lb over 12 months and 2.8 lb by 24 months among patients not enrolled. There was a significant difference in mean change in A1C between enrolled and nonenrolled patients over 12 months (-0.10%), but not by 24 months (-0.06%). Digital DPP appears to be an effective weight loss option and potential diabetes prevention intervention for older adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes.",,1097
122,35983310,Data-Driven Investigation of Tellurium-Containing Semiconductors for CO2 Reduction: Trends in Adsorption and Scaling Relations.,"Light-assisted conversion of CO2 into liquid fuels is one of several possible approaches to combating the rise of carbon dioxide emissions. Unfortunately, there are currently no known materials that are efficient, selective, or active enough to facilitate the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at an industrial scale. In this work, we employ density functional theory to explore potential tellurium-containing photocathodes for the CO2RR by observing trends in adsorption properties arising from over 350 *H, 200 *CO, and 110 *CHO surface-adsorbate structures spanning 39 surfaces of 11 materials. Our results reveal a scaling relationship between *CHO and *H chemisorption energies and charge transfer values, while the scaling relation (typically found in transition metals) between *CO and *CHO adsorption energies is absent. We hypothesize the scaling relation between *H and *CHO to be related to the lone electron located on the bonding carbon atom, while the lack of scaling relation in *CO we attribute to the ability of the lone pair on the C atom to form multiple bonding modes. We compute two predominant orbital-level interactions in the *CO-surface bonds (either using s or p orbitals) in addition to bonding modes involving both σ and π interactions using the Crystal Orbital Hamiltonian Population analysis. We demonstrate that bonds involving the C s orbital are more chemisorptive than the C p orbitals of CO. In general, chemisorption trends demonstrate decreased *H competition with respect to *CO adsorption and enhanced *CHO stability. Finally, we uncover simple element-specific design rules with Te, Se, and Ga sites showing increased competition and Zn, Yb, Rb, Br, and Cl sites showing decreased competition for hydrogen adsorption. We anticipate that these trends will help further screen these materials for potential CO2RR performance.",,1098
2352,35967024,Development of Mo-Modified Pseudoboehmite Supported Ni Catalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Production from Formic Acid.,"Formic acid (FA), as a safe and renewable liquid hydrogen storage material, has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, a series of Mo-modified pseudoboehmite supported Ni catalysts were developed and evaluated for efficient hydrogen production from formic acid. Pseudoboehmite (PB) as a catalyst carrier was used for the first time. Ni/PB and NiMo/PB possessed a mesostructure, and the pore size distribution was mainly concentrated between 2 and 20 nm. The oxygen vacancies caused by Mo enhanced Ni anchoring, thus inhibiting Ni sintering. Compared with Ni10/PB (7.62 nm), Ni10Mo1/PB had smaller Ni particles (5.08 nm). The Ni-O-Al solid solutions formed through the interaction of Ni with the PB improved the catalytic performance. Ni10Mo1/PB gave the highest conversion of 92.8% with a H2 selectivity of 98% at 300 °C, and the catalyst activity hardly decreased during the 50 h stability test. In short, Ni10Mo1/PB was a promising catalyst for hydrogen production from formic acid because of the oxygen vacancy anchoring effect as well as the formation of Ni-O-Al solid solutions which could effectively suppress the Ni sintering.",,1099
680,35975532,The Measurement of 25-Hydroxyvitamin-D in Chronic HBV Patients Using LC-MS/MS.,"Vitamin D deficiency is universal among patients with chronic liver disease. Vitamin D may be involved in the regulation of immune function of chronic hepatitis B and related to disease progression. The study was a cross-sectional study. The level of vitamin 25(OH)D was detected in patients with chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis B cirrhosis, hepatitis B cancer, and healthy groups by isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). At the same time, the clinical data, biochemical indexes, and T lymphocyte subsets were collected to study the relationship between vitamin 25(OH)D deficiency and clinical indexes of hepatitis B patients. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/mL) was higher in patients with liver cancer group (96.97%, 10.59 ± 3.06 ng/mL) and cirrhosis group (93.18%, 11.85 ± 2.66 ng/mL) than in the healthy group (76.92%, 16.38 ± 5.53 ng/mL) and chronic hepatitis B group (77.83%, 15.06 ± 4.91 ng/mL). There were significant differences in vitamin 25(OH)D levels between the cirrhosis groups and the healthy groups, the liver cancer groups and the healthy groups, the hepatitis B cirrhosis groups and the chronic hepatitis B groups, the liver cancer groups and the chronic hepatitis B groups (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in vitamin 25 (OH)D level between liver cancer group and hepatitis B cirrhosis group, healthy group and chronic hepatitis B group (p > 0.05). Vitamin 25(OH)D level was correlated with age (r = -0.24, p = 0.015), lymphocyte (r = 0.24, p = 0.015), hemoglobin (r = 0.28, p = 0.005), platelet (r = 0.27, p = 0.006), PTA (r = 0.33, p = 0.001), albumin (r = 0.30, p = 0.002), prealbumin (r = 0.39, p = 0.001), cholinesterase (r = 0.29, p = 0.003), CD3+ (r = 0.20, p = 0.04), CD3+ CD8+ (r = 0.20, p = 0.04), CD45+ (r = 0.24, p = 0.017), but none correlated with liver function and HBV-DNA. Vitamin D deficiency existed in patients with hepatitis B, which was related to the clinical progress of hepatitis B and may be involved in the regulation of immune function in patients with chronic HBV infection.",,1100
1039,35974580,Multiphase curved boundary condition in lattice Boltzmann method.,"The boundary treatment is fundamental for modeling fluid flows especially in the lattice Boltzmann method; the curved boundary conditions effectively improve the accuracy of single-phase simulations with complex-geometry boundaries. However, the conventional curved boundary conditions usually cause dramatic mass leakage or increase when they are directly used for multiphase flow simulations. We find that the principal reason for this is the absence of a nonideal effect in the curved boundary conditions, followed by a calculation error. In this paper, incorporating the nonideal effect into the linear interpolation scheme and compensating for the interpolating error, we propose a multiphase curved boundary condition to treat the wetting boundaries with complex geometries. A series of static and dynamic multiphase simulations with large density ratio verify that the present scheme is accurate and ensures mass conservation.",,1101
600,35977881,Efficacy and Safety of Concomitant Proton Pump Inhibitor and Nivolumab in Renal Cell Carcinoma: Results of the GETUG-AFU 26 NIVOREN Multicenter Phase II Study.,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) may influence the gut microbiome and thus impact the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). The effect of PPIs on the outcomes of ICI has not been fully explored and investigated in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). This retrospective analysis used prospectively collected data from the GETUG-AFU 26 NIVOREN (NCT03013335) phase II study which enrolled 729 mRCC patients of whom 720 were treated with nivolumab. The main objective of this analysis was to evaluate the impact of PPI on the efficacy and safety outcomes of mRCC patients. PPI use was defined as PPI administration on the day of ICI initiation. Of the 707 patients with mRCC analyzed in this study, 196 (27.7%) were PPI users. The majority of PPI users were males (80.6%), had an ECOG performance status of 0-1 (78.9%) and a nephrectomy (82.1%). Almost two-thirds of the patients had a favorable and intermediate IMDC risk category and 52% received nivolumab in the third line and beyond. PPI use did not correlate with PFS or OS (HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.74-1.08 and HR = 1.24; 95% CI, 0.98-1.58, respectively). Grade 3-5 nivolumab-related adverse events were more common among PPI users (25.5% vs. 15.3%). This real-world study suggests that PPI use in patients with mRCC does not impact the efficacy outcomes but may influence the safety of nivolumab which warrants further investigations.",,1102
2025,35967561,School assets and bullying in Chinese youth: A multiple mediation model of intentional self-regulation and internet gaming disorder.,"Bullying is a severe social problem affecting young people all over the world. Previous studies suggested that engagement in bullying had massive effects on teenagers' physical and psychological development. It is critical and necessary to investigate the antecedents and underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon among young generations. The present study, based on the positive youth development perspective and the developmental assets theory, attempts to explore the positive factors in the school subsystem that could effectively prevent adolescents from bullying, as well as the multiple mediation effects of intentional self-regulation (ISR) and internet gaming disorder (IGD). In this study, we adopted a two-wave design and recruited a sample of 768 Chinese adolescents using a randomized cluster sampling method in the post-pandemic era. The results revealed that T1 school assets significantly and negatively predicted T2 adolescent bullying. Furthermore, T2 ISR and T2 IGD mediated the association between T1 school assets and T2 bullying separately and sequentially. Overall, school resources play a protective role in adolescent development and could effectively prevent them from negative outcomes. These current findings contribute to the literature by providing a further understanding of the direct and indirect protective effects of school assets on adolescent bullying. Moreover, practitioners could also benefit from these findings in preventing and intervening in bullying in the school subsystem.",,1103
1885,35967726,Bias in measurement of autism symptoms by spoken language level and non-verbal mental age in minimally verbal children with neurodevelopmental disorders.,"Increasing numbers of children with known genetic conditions and/or intellectual disability are referred for evaluation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), highlighting the need to refine autism symptom measures to facilitate differential diagnoses in children with cognitive and language impairments. Previous studies have reported decreased specificity of ASD screening and diagnostic measures in children with intellectual disability. However, little is known about how cognitive and language abilities impact the measurement of specific ASD symptoms in this group. We aggregated a large sample of young children (N = 1196; aged 31-119 months) to examine measurement invariance of ASD symptoms among minimally verbal children within the context of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Module 1. Using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and moderated non-linear factor analysis (MNLFA), we examined how discrete behaviors were differentially associated with the latent symptom domains of social communication impairments (SCI) and restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB) across spoken language levels and non-verbal mental age groupings. While the two-factor structure of SCI and RRB held consistently across language and cognitive levels, only partial invariance was observed for both ASD symptom domains of SCI and RRB. Specifically, four out of the 15 SCI items and one out of the three RRB items examined showed differential item functioning between children with Few to No Words and those with Some Words; and one SCI item and one RRB item showed differential item functioning across non-verbal mental age groups. Moreover, even after adjusting for the differential item functioning to reduce measurement bias across groups, there were still differences in ASD symptom domain scores across spoken language levels. These findings further underscore the influence of spoken language level on measurement of ASD symptoms and the importance of measuring ASD symptoms within refined spoken language levels, even among those with minimal verbal abilities.",,1104
1001,35974618,Successive reintrusions in a granular medium.,"We measure and analyze the drag force experienced by a rigid rod that penetrates vertically into a granular medium and partially withdraws before sinking again. The drag during the successive reintrusions is observed to be significantly smaller than the force experienced in the first run. Two force regimes are evidenced depending on how the reintrusion depth compares with the withdrawal distance Δ. These two regimes are characterized by a force curve of positive and negative curvature and are separated by an inflection point, which is characterized experimentally. We approach the difference between the first intrusion and the following reintrusions by considering a modification in the stress field of the granular material after the partial extraction of the rod. A theoretical model for the stress modification is proposed and allows to rationalize all the experiments realized for different withdrawal distances Δ. This framework introduces a crossover length λ above which the stress modification in the granular medium is maintained and that is shown to depend linearly on Δ. Finally, the model provides a prediction for the location of the inflection points in reasonable agreement with observations.",,1105
1581,35968303,Incidence and characteristics of stroke in Zanzibar-a hospital-based prospective study in a low-income island population.,"Stroke in adults is a critical clinical condition and a leading cause of death and disability globally. Epidemiological data on stroke in sub-Saharan Africa are limited. This study describes incidence rates, stroke types and antecedent factors among patients hospitalized with stroke in Zanzibar. This was a prospective, observational study of stroke patients at hospitals in Unguja, Zanzibar. Socioeconomic and demographic data were recorded alongside relevant past medical history, medicine use and risk factors. The modified National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (mNIHSS) was used to assess admission stroke severity and, when possible, stroke was confirmed by neuroimaging. A total of 869 stroke admissions were observed from 1st October 2019 through 30th September 2020. Age-standardized to the World Health Organization global population, the yearly incidence was 286.8 per 100,000 adult population (95%CI: 272.4-301.9). Among these patients, 720 (82.9%) gave consent to participate in the study. Median age of participants was 62 years (53-70), 377 (52.2%) were women, and 463 (64.3%) had a first-ever stroke. Known stroke risk factors included hypertension in 503 (72.3%) patients, of whom 279 (55.5%) reported regularly using antihypertensive medication, of whom 161 (57.7%) had used this medication within the last week before stroke onset. A total of 460 (63.9%) participants had neuroimaging performed; among these there was evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in 140 (30.4%). Median stroke severity score using mNIHSS was 19 (10-27). Zanzibar has high incidence of hospitalization for stroke, indicating a very high population incidence of stroke. The proportion of strokes due to ICH is substantially higher than in high-income countries. Most stroke patients had been in contact with health care providers prior to stroke onset and been diagnosed with hypertension. However, few were using antihypertensive medication at the time of stroke onset.www.ClinicalTrial.gov registration NCT04095806.",,1106
954,35974725,Calculating temperature-dependent X-ray structure factors of α-quartz with an extensible Python 3 package.,"The design of X-ray optics based on diffraction from crystals depends on the accurate calculation of the structure factors of their Bragg reflections over a wide range of temperatures. In general, the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters, the atomic positions and the atomic thermal vibrations is both anisotropic and nonlinear. Implemented here is a software package for precise and flexible calculation of structure factors for dynamical diffraction. α-Quartz is used as an example because it presents the challenges mentioned above and because it is being considered for use in high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy. The package is designed to be extended easily to other crystals by adding new material files, which are kept separate from the package's stable core. Python 3 was chosen as the language to allow the easy integration of this code into existing packages. The importance of a correct anisotropic treatment of the atomic thermal vibrations is demonstrated by comparison with an isotropic Debye model. Discrepancies between the two models can be as much as 5% for strong reflections and considerably larger (even to the level of 100%) for weak reflections. A script for finding Bragg reflections that backscatter X-rays of a given energy within a given temperature range is demonstrated. The package and example scripts are available on request. Also discussed, in detail, are the various conventions related to the proper description of chiral quartz.",,1107
768,35975069,Study on the effect of solvent on cocrystallization of CL-20 and HMX through theoretical calculations and experiments.,"Cocrystallization is a helpful method for explosives design. However, lack of understanding of the cocrystallization mechanism leads to inefficiency in cocrystal preparation. Therefore, studying the effects of solvent on cocrystal is of great importance for the efficient application of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20). In this paper, the effect of solvent on cocrystallization is investigated by the CL-20/HMX cocrystal/solvent cluster model, the CL-20/HMX/solvent mixture model, the CL-20/HMX cocrystal/solvent interface model combined with quantum chemistry and molecular dynamic methods. The authors find that the hydrogen bond between CL-20 and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) is the strongest and the binding energy of cocrystal and solvent molecules is the weakest in ethyl acetate (EA) solvent, indicating that CL-20 and HMX tend to be combined together and there is less hindrance by solvent molecules. Analysis of the CL-20/HMX/solvent mixture and mass density distribution studies show that the solvent effect has a great influence on the crystal faces and the cocrystallization rate of CL-20 and HMX is the highest in EA solvent. The XRD and SEM characterization results are consistent with the theoretical calculations. The present work on the effects of solvent on CL-20/HMX cocrystals is beneficial for understanding the mechanism of the growth of energetic cocrystal materials. It is helpful in selecting more suitable theoretical and experimental conditions and makes access to excellent cocrystals more efficient.",,1108

2006,35967581,The value of interleukin-27 for differentiating tuberculous pleural effusion from Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonic effusion in children.,"The early diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) is challenging due to the difficulty of isolating Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and pleural biomarkers are an optional choice. Recent studies showed that interleukin-27 (IL-27) appears to be a new accurate biomarker for TPE in adults and no related studies were reported in children. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential value of IL-27 in pediatric tuberculous pleurisy by detecting its levels in pleural fluid and serum. A total of 48 children with TPE and 64 children with severe Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonic effusion (SMPPE) were enrolled in this study. IL-27 concentrations were measured in serum and pleural fluid. The diagnostic yield of IL-27 was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The level of p-IL-27 in TPE showed statistically no significant difference when compared with SMPPE (p > 0.05). However, pleural fluid IL-27 (p-IL-27) / serum IL-27 (s-IL-27) ratio in TPE were significantly much higher than those in SMPPE (p < 0.05). By the analysis of the ROC curves, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the p-IL-27/s-IL-27 ratio were 100% and 48.44%, respectively (cutoff value of 1.0280). The area under the ROC curve for p-IL-27/s-IL-27 was 0.7295. Pleural fluid IL-27 alone was not accurate in distinguishing pediatric TPE from SMPPE, which was different from the diagnostic value of IL-27 in adult studies due to the different disease spectra between children and adults. Our results implied that the p-IL-27/s-IL-27 ratio had a potential value in distinguishing TPE from SMPPE. However, the specificity of IL-27 was relatively lower and it is necessary to find a more specific marker in tuberculous pleurisy of children.",,1110
554,35978580,Durable Zn-ion hybrid capacitors using 3D printed carbon composites.,"Rechargeable Zn-ion hybrid capacitors (ZHCs) have gained considerable attention towards future energy storage applications owing to their non-flammable nature, high abundance of raw materials and remarkable energy storage performance. However, the uncontrolled growth of dendrites, interfacial corrosion of Zn anodes and limited mass loading of cathode materials, hinders their practical applicability. Herein, we demonstrate ZHCs with enhanced capacity and durability using a synergistic combination of a hybrid-ion electrolyte and a high-mass loading three-dimensionally (3D) printed graphene-carbon nanotube (Gr-C) cathode. The hybrid electrolyte composed of NaCl and ZnSO4, features higher ionic conductivity and lower pH compared with pristine ZnSO4, which enable uniform plating/stripping of Zn2+ ions on Zn anode, as demonstrated by in situ electrochemical and ex situ ToF-SIMs characterizations. Additionally, the multi-layered 3D Gr-C composite electrodes in ZHCs enable higher energy storage performance due to their porous architectures, high ion accessibility and dual-ion charge storage contributions. As a result, the 3D Gr-C//Zn cell unveiled a maximum capacity of 0.84 mA h cm-2 at 3 mA cm-2 with a high life cycle (78.7% at 20 mA cm-2) compared to the pristine electrolyte-based ZHCs (0.72 mA h cm-2 and 14.8%). The rapid rate measurements that we propose along with benchmarked energy density (0.87 mW h cm-2) and power density (31.7 mW cm-2) of hybrid electrolyte-based 3D Gr-C//Zn, pave the way for the development of dendrite-free and highly durable 3D energy storage devices.",,1111
2046,35967529,Acute Kidney Injury in COVID-19: Clinical Profile and Outcome.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) can be a severe complication of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Follow-up data of these AKI patients, including the rate of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD), is limited. COVID-19 patients with AKI, admitted from June 1, 2020, to August 25, 2020, were enrolled prospectively. Their clinical profile, biochemical investigations, urine analysis, treatment, and outcome in terms of mortality or discharge were analyzed. The discharged patients were followed up 3 months later to determine their renal recovery status. AKI was noted in 146 out of 4,613 COVID-19 patients with an incidence of 3.16%. The outcome was available for 111 patients. According to the KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) AKI criteria, 20 (18%) patients were in Stage 1, 16 (14%) in Stage 2, and 75 (68%) in Stage 3 AKI. Proteinuria and hematuria were present in 66% and 41%, respectively. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was required in 45 (40.5%) patients. A total of 53 (47.7%) patients turned RT-PCR negative and were discharged. The renal recovery at discharge was complete in 31 of 111 (28%), partial in 20 of 111 (18%), and none in two (2%) patients. At 3 months follow-up of discharged patients, total mortality rate was 55.85%. Twenty three of 53 (43%) recovered their renal functions to baseline and 26 of 53 (49%) had progressed to CKD. Diabetes mellitus, dyspnea, altered sensorium, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for RRT, lymphopenia, high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, hyperglycemia, raised inflammatory markers, and hematuria were associated with high mortality rate and reached statistical significance. AKI in COVID-19 patients has a high mortality rate (55.85%) with a high CKD progression rate among survivors (49%).",,1112
642,35976977,Online health management continuance and the moderating effect of service type and age difference: A meta-analysis.,"Numerous empirical studies have been carried out to explore factors of online health management continuance. However, results were not unified. We thus conducted a meta-analysis to identify influential factors and potential moderators. A systematic literature search was performed in nine databases (PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Ovid of JBI, CINAHL, Embase, CNKI, VIP, and CBM) published up to December 2020 in the English or Chinese language. Meta-analysis of combined effect size, heterogeneity, moderator analysis, publication bias assessment, and inter-rater reliability was conducted. Totally 41 studies and 12 pairwise relationships were identified. Confirmation, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, information quality, service quality, perceived ease of use, and trust were all critical predictors. Service type and age difference showed their moderating effects respectively. The perceived usefulness was more noteworthy in medical service than health and fitness service. The trust was more noteworthy in young adults. The results confirmed the validity and robustness of the Expectation Confirmation Model, Information Systems Success Model, and trust theory in online health management continuance. Moderators included but are not limited to age difference and service type. The elderly research in the healthcare context and other analytical methods such as qualitative comparative analysis should be applied in the future.",,1113
1930,35967679,Online assessment of narrative macrostructure in adult Irish-English multilinguals.,"Online assessment of narrative production and comprehension became an important component of language assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to establish quantitative measures of narrative macrostructure in the production and comprehension of adult Irish-English bilinguals in an online assessment. A total of 30 Irish-English bilingual adults participated in an online assessment of oral narrative production and comprehension. Narratives were elicited using LITMUS-MAIN for Irish and English. Story-tell elicitation method was used for all stories. Twenty participants produced Baby Birds and Baby Goats story pairs while 10 participants produced Cat and Dog story pairs. Quantitative measures of story structure, comprehension score, and the overall number of Internal State Terms (ISTs) in production and comprehension were compared across the story pairs, languages, and the output type (production vs. comprehension). A general linear model indicated no differences in either story structure or story comprehension scores across languages for both sets of stories. Combined analysis for all participants and stories indicated no difference in the story structure scores or comprehension scores across the languages or the story pairs. While the overall number of ISTs was the same across languages, a higher number of ISTs was observed in comprehension relative to production in both languages for Cat and Dog story pair only, but not for Baby birds and Baby goats' stories. The major benefit of using online assessment was the accessibility of participants. The major drawback was the inability to control the environment and the quality of the internet connection. While online assessment increased the availability of participants, which is a significant factor in rural Ireland characterized by low population density and the high percentage of Irish speakers, the availability of stable internet connection limited the applicability of online assessment. Measures of narrative macrostructure were stable across the languages and the story pairs. This is important because of high variability in exposure to Irish, frequent code-switching, and a high number of morphosyntactic errors due to rapid language change that characterizes Irish-English bilinguals. Identifying reliable measures of language performance for Irish-English adult speakers is an important step toward establishing developmental norms for Irish-English bilinguals.",,1114
2082,35967436,TCR-like antibodies targeting autoantigen-mhc complexes: a mini-review.,"T cell receptors (TCRs) recognize peptide antigens bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (p/MHC) that are expressed on cell surfaces; while B cell-derived antibodies (Abs) recognize soluble or cell surface native antigens of various types (proteins, carbohydrates, etc.). Immune surveillance by T and B cells thus inspects almost all formats of antigens to mount adaptive immune responses against cancer cells, infectious organisms and other foreign insults, while maintaining tolerance to self-tissues. With contributions from environmental triggers, the development of autoimmune disease is thought to be due to the expression of MHC risk alleles by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) presenting self-antigen (autoantigen), breaking through self-tolerance and activating autoreactive T cells, which orchestrate downstream pathologic events. Investigating and treating autoimmune diseases have been challenging, both because of the intrinsic complexity of these diseases and the need for tools targeting T cell epitopes (autoantigen-MHC). Naturally occurring TCRs with relatively low (micromolar) affinities to p/MHC are suboptimal for autoantigen-MHC targeting, whereas the use of engineered TCRs and their derivatives (e.g., TCR multimers and TCR-engineered T cells) are limited by unpredictable cross-reactivity. As Abs generally have nanomolar affinity, recent advances in engineering TCR-like (TCRL) Abs promise advantages over their TCR counterparts for autoantigen-MHC targeting. Here, we compare the p/MHC binding by TCRs and TCRL Abs, review the strategies for generation of TCRL Abs, highlight their application for identification of autoantigen-presenting APCs, and discuss future directions and limitations of TCRL Abs as immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases.",,1115
2187,35967331,Potential roles of non-lymphocytic cells in the pathogenesis of IgG4-related disease.,"Studies have confirmed the involvement of a variety of lymphocyte subsets, including type 2 helper T lymphocytes (Th2) and IgG4+ B lymphocytes, in the pathogenesis of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Those lymphocytes contribute to the major pathogenetic features of IgG4-RD. However, they are not the only cellular components in the immunoinflammatory environment of this mysterious disease entity. Recent studies have suggested that various non-lymphocytic components, including macrophages and fibroblasts, may also play an important role in the pathogenetic process of IgG4-RD in terms of contributing to the chronic and complex progress of the disease. Therefore, the potential role of non-lymphocyte in the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD is worth discussing.",,1116
918,35974772,"Chain end-group selectivity using an organometallic Al(iii)/K(i) ring-opening copolymerization catalyst delivers high molar mass, monodisperse polyesters.","Polyesters are important plastics, elastomers and fibres; efficient and selective polymerizations making predictable, high molar mass polymers are required. Here, a new type of catalyst for the ring-opening polymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides and anhydrides combines unusually high chain end-group selectivity, fast rates, and good molar mass control. The organometallic heterodinuclear Al(iii)/K(i) complex, applied with a diol, is tolerant to a range of epoxides/phthalic anhydride and produces only α,ω-hydroxyl telechelic polyesters with molar masses from 6-91 kg mol-1, in all cases with monomodal distributions. As proof of its potential, high molar mass poly(vinyl cyclohexene oxide-alt-phthalic anhydride) (91 kg mol-1) shows 5× greater flexural strain at break (ε b = 3.7%) and 9× higher maximum flexural stress (σ f = 72.3 MPa) than the previously accessed medium molar mass samples (24 kg mol-1). It is also enchains phthalic anhydride, vinyl cyclohexene oxide and ε-decalactone, via switchable catalysis, to make high molar mass triblock polyesters (81 kg mol-1, Đ = 1.04). This selective catalyst should be used in the future to qualify the properties of these ROCOP polyesters and to tune (multi)block polymer structures.",,1117

Compounds crystallize in four isostructural groups, each containing one to four structures. Single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed that molecules belonging to non-isostructural groups self-associate according to two schemes that describe also supramolecular architectures in crystals of glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives. Structural motifs arise as a result of van der Waals forces. Parameters introduced for the analysis of one- and two-dimensional assemblies allow the comparison of motifs in isostructural and non-isostructural crystals, including polymorphs, and a qualitative assessment of differences in molecular self-assembly. One-, two- or three-dimensional similarity has been confirmed by XPac calculations.",,1118
208,35982812,Renal Dynamic Scintigraphy as a Sensitive Tool for Detecting Small Volume Urinoma Following Live-Related Renal Transplant.,"Renal transplant (RT) is the preferred treatment modality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, it is associated with a significant rate of complications. Early diagnosis and management of these complications are essential to prevent graft loss. Herein, we describe a case of a 48-year-old male who developed ESRD due to underlying autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease and underwent an RT. A routine renal dynamic scintigraphy (RDS) performed on day 4 posttransplant showed a focal minute area of radiotracer accumulation on the delayed static images raising suspicion for urinoma. However, it was deemed normal considering the normal renogram curve and stable clinical condition of the patient. However, on day 9 posttransplant, in view of clinical deterioration marked by decreasing urine output and rising serum creatinine levels, ultrasonography - kidney, ureter, and bladder (USG-KUB) and a repeat RDS were performed. Although the USG-KUB described a peri-nephric fluid collection, the nature of the collection could not be determined. RDS confirmed that the collection was urinoma. On retrospective analysis, the focal area of increased radiotracer uptake corresponded to the site of initial suspicion, although there was an increase in the size of the same. In experienced hands, RDS thus proves to be a highly sensitive tool for the diagnosis of urinoma, much before the clinical complications set in.",,1119
1720,35968024,Prevalence characteristic of BVDV in some large scale dairy farms in Western China.,"The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence characteristic of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in some large scale dairy farms in Western China. BVDV was detected in 30 samples of bulk tank milk (BTM) collected from 30 large dairy farms in 7 provinces of western China, 93.33% (28/30) of the farms were infected with BVDV, and S/P ratio was over 0.3 in 28 positive farms. The individual status was further estimated in the dairy farm (No. 10) with the highest positive rate (S/P ratio = 1.37) and the dairy farm (No. 17) with the lowest positive rate (S/P ratio = 0.39). Two hundred cows were, respectively, selected from calf, young cows and lactating cows in farm No. 10 and farm No. 17 and the serum sample of each enrolled cow was collected. The individual positive rate of serum antibody (Ab) was 87.17% (523/600) in farm No. 10 and 31.33% (188/600) in farm No. 17. The individual positive ratio of serum antibody in calves, young cows and lactating cows were 41.75 % (167/400), 58.75% (235/400) and 77.25% (309/400), respectively. BTM Ab of farm No. 10 has an S/P ratio more than 1.0, which indicated there were emergent or persistent infection (PI) cases, and further test showed that PI cases were 0.51% in farm No. 10. Pathogens were positive in 42.34% (163/385) of nasal mucus samples collected from cows with respiratory symptom, and BVDV cases were 57 in 163 positive samples. Three strains of NCP BVDV-1, one strain of CP BVDV-1, one strain of NCP BVDV-2 and one strain of CP BVDV-2 were successfully isolated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the subtypes of BVDV currently prevalent in western China were BVDV-1a, BVDV-1m, BVDV-1q and BVDV-2. The findings suggested that the BVDV infection is serious in some Large Scale Dairy Farms in Western China.",,1120
736,35975140,Comparison between High-Power Short-Duration and Conventional Ablation Strategy in Atrial Fibrillation: An Updated Meta-Analysis.,"High-power short-duration (HPSD) setting during radiofrequency ablation has become an attempt to improve atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment outcomes. This study ought to compare the efficacy, safety, and effectiveness between HPSD and conventional settings. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched. Studies that compared HPSD and conventional radiofrequency ablation settings in AF patients were included while studies performed additional ablations on nonpulmonary vein targets without clear recording were excluded. Data were pooled with random-effect model. Efficacy endpoints include first-pass pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), acute pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection, free from AF, and free from atrial tachycardia (AT) during follow-up. Safety endpoints include esophagus injury rate and major complication rate. Effectiveness endpoints include complete PVI rate, total procedure time, PVI time, and PVI radiofrequency ablation (PVI RF) time. We included 22 studies with 3867 atrial fibrillation patients in total (2393 patients received HPSD radiofrequency ablation). Perioperatively, the HPSD group showed a higher first-pass PVI rate (risk ratio, RR = 1.10, P = 0.0001) and less acute PV reconnection rate (RR = 0.56, P = 0.0004) than the conventional group. During follow-up, free from AF (RR = 1.11, P = 0.16) or AT (RR = 1.06, P = 0.24) rate did not differ between HPSD and conventional groups 6-month postsurgery. However, the HPSD group showed both higher free from AF (RR = 1.17, P = 0.0003) and AT (RR = 1.11, P < 0.0001) rate than the conventional group 12-month postsurgery. The esophagus injury (RR = 0.99, P = 0.98) and major complications (RR = 0.76, P = 0.70) rates did not differ between the two groups. The HPSD group took shorter total procedure time (MD = -33.71 95% CI: -43.10 to -24.33, P < 0.00001), PVI time (MD = -21.60 95% CI: -25.00 to -18.21, P < 0.00001), and PVI RF time (MD = -13.72, 95% CI: -14.45 to -13.00, P < 0.00001) than conventional groups while complete procedure rate did not differ between two groups (RR = 1.00, P = 0.93). HPSD setting during AF radiofrequency ablation has better effectiveness, efficacy, and similar safety compared with the conventional setting.",,1121
1723,35968021,"Influence of acetate- vs. lactate-containing fluid bolus therapy on acid-base status, electrolytes, and plasma lactate in dogs.","Acetate- and lactate-containing fluids influence the acid-base and electrolyte status. This prospective, randomized, clinical study compared two balanced crystalloid solutions regarding their influence on acid-base status, electrolytes, and lactate values, when given to dogs as a resuscitation bolus of 30 mL/kg. One hundred client-owned dogs presenting to the emergency service with signs of fluid deficits were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous bolus of 30 mL/kg of either a lactate- (LAC), or an acetate-containing solution (ACET). Before and after the bolus, vital parameters were assessed, and a venous blood gas analysis was performed. Both solutions performed equally well in decreasing the heart rate (ACET: -10 ± 27 bpm, LAC: -12 ± 30 bpm; p = 0.737). The acetate-containing solution caused a significant decrease in plasma lactate levels (p = 0.016), anion gap (p < 0.001), and potassium (p < 0.001), and a significant increase in chloride (p < 0.001), and ionized calcium (p = 0.014). The lactate-containing solution caused a significant decrease in anion gap (p < 0.001), sodium (p = 0.016), and potassium (p = 0.001), and a significant increase in chloride (p < 0.001). ACET causes a stronger decrease in plasma lactate (p = 0.015), sodium (p = 0.039), potassium (p = 0.006), and an increase in chloride (p < 0.001), and ionized calcium (p = 0.016) compared to LAC. Both solutions caused mild changes in electrolyte concentrations and had minor influence on acid-base status when used for bolus therapy in dogs with fluid deficits. Further studies are needed to evaluate their influence on acid-base status, lactate, and electrolytes when used in larger volumes and for a longer time span.",,1122
1146,35973820,Defensive medicine and the influence of litigation on doctors.,"The term defensive medicine is used to describe the behavior of healthcare providers motivated by fear of litigation due to malpractice. It includes both avoidance behavior when the physician is unwilling to perform high risk procedures, as well as excessive ordering of extra tests and procedures. This leads to unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions which may be invasive and costly. Additionally, such a setting causes harms the patient-doctor relationship. A more specific legal framework, developed with respect to the innate nature of medicine, may improve the situation.",,1123
1983,35967624,Preparatory routines for emotional regulation in performance enhancement.,"Preparatory routines (PR) are a necessary tool for achieving optimal emotional states and effective performance, especially in self-paced motor skills. Numerous studies in the area of applied sport psychology have found a positive effect of PR on blocking out distractions and regulating performance thoughts, actions, and emotions. PR contain behavioral and mental components that can be applied in different time periods before and after the event itself: pre-competitive activity routines (PCA-R), pre-performance routines (PP-R), and post-performance activity routines (PPA-R). The aim of this manuscript is to present an effective way to practice psychological techniques and their combinations as part of the PR. The periodization principle and the Learning-Modification-Application (LMA) model with biofeedback training can provide a conceptual framework and means of application for performance enhancement. It will allow the transfer of psychological skills from lab to field and the integration of PR into the athlete's preparations for peak performance.",,1124
1614,35968258,"An analysis of 30 years of surface ozone concentrations in Austria: temporal evolution, changes in precursor emissions and chemical regimes, temperature dependence, and lessons for the future.","Despite substantial reductions in anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) in Austria over the 30 year time period 1990-2019, summertime surface ozone (O3) concentrations still exceed frequently and over wide areas the ozone maximum 8 hour mean target value for the protection of human health. We present a detailed analysis of in situ observations of O3 and NO x to (1) disentangle the main processes propelling O3 formation such as precursor emissions and meteorology and (2) quantify the impact of NO x reductions and (3) estimate the effect of climate warming. The temperature sensitivity of surface O3 production is assessed separately for NO x and VOC limited regimes. The temperature sensitivity of ozone increases with temperature in spring and summer. On average, the evaluated absolute values of the sensitivities are a factor of 2.5 larger in summer than in spring. The analysis of ambient O3 burdens during hot summers indicates that rising temperatures in a warming climate might largely offset the benefit of future emission reductions. MAX-DOAS formaldehyde (HCHO) measurements in Vienna from 2017 to 2019 are used as a proxy for VOC emissions. The seasonal and the temperature dependence of the observed HCHO mixing ratios indicate that biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) are the dominant source of hydrocarbons in the urban setting during the ozone season. The result agrees well with VOC emission estimates that show BVOCs to be the dominant VOC source in Austria since the early 2000s. Accordingly, anthropogenic NO x emission reductions remain, outside of urban cores, the most effective instrument for policymakers to lower surface ozone concentrations in the short term.",,1125
662,35975825,"Synthesis, chiral crystal structure, and magnetic properties of Ba3Ga2O5Cl2.","A new compound, Ba3Ga2O5Cl2, isostructural with Ba3Fe2O5Cl2, was synthesized by solid-state reaction in air. Through single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction analysis, the crystal structure was determined to be cubic with chiral space group I213 and unit-cell parameter a = 9.928 (1) Å. The Ga3+ ions in Ba3Ga2O5Cl2 are coordinated by O atoms and form GaO4 tetrahedra. Ten neighboring GaO4 tetrahedra are further bridged through corner sharing and rotation along the body diagonal, producing the chiral structure. Magnetization measurements indicate temperature-independent diamagnetic behavior, which is qualitatively consistent with core diamagnetism from all the constituent elements.",,1126
612,35977787,New Evidence Suggests No Sex Bias in Herbivory or Plant Defense.,"AbstractDioecious plants can exhibit sexual dimorphism across a suite of plant traits, including susceptibility to herbivory and secondary chemistry. One hypothesis is that because of greater costs of reproduction in females, males should grow faster and invest less in defense, resulting in male-biased herbivory. Indeed, a series of articles and a prominent meta-analysis have established male-biased herbivory as a rule. However, more recent reviews have raised questions about how general the pattern is, citing the low breadth of taxon sampling. The literature on this topic has not been formally quantified by meta-analysis in over 15 years. Here, we report the results of a meta-analysis of studies that measured sex bias in either herbivory and/or secondary defense in 71 dioecious plant species. We added 58 observations of herbivory and 41 of secondary chemistry to the original. We control for nonindependence of effects from the same study and taxonomic group to address critiques of earlier studies. For secondary chemistry, we found no support for any consistent difference between male and female plants. For herbivory, results are directionally similar to earlier reports, although not statistically significant once we accounted for taxonomic group and study. We also found that earlier studies reported stronger male bias than more recent studies. We discuss our results in light of the decline effect, where the magnitude of a described effect declines as the number of observations increases, and consider whether the data sets exhibit signs of evidence of the type(s) of biases that can result in declining effect sizes over time.",,1127
689,35975519,Pseudoleukocytopenia: a Case Report.,"Hematology analyzers provide quick and accurate results in most situations. However, spurious results related to the parameters from the complete blood count (CBC) may be observed in several instances. False increases in WBC count can occur for many reasons, including erythroblasts, insufficiently lysed red blood cells (RBC), platelet aggregates, lipids, and cryoglobulins. However, cases of pseudoleukocytopenia due to plasma related factors are rare. Here, we report a case of pseudoleukocytopenia in CBC test. It was identified by the peripheral blood smears and different scatter plots of WNR and WDF channel. The interference from plasma was con-firmed by simulating the state of blood in the WBC channel and plasma exchange. It was confirmed that the interference of pseudoleukocytopenia was from the plasma. This may be due to the high amount of albumin and other therapeutic drug reactions. Observation of peripheral blood smears and scatter plots can identify this interference.",,1128
2322,35967056,Generalization on Entropy-Ruled Charge and Energy Transport for Organic Solids and Biomolecular Aggregates.,"Herein, a generalized version of the entropy-ruled charge and energy transport mechanism for organic solids and biomolecular aggregates is presented. The effects of thermal disorder and electric field on electronic transport in molecular solids have been quantified by entropy, which eventually varies with respect to the typical disorder (static or dynamic). Based on our previous differential entropy (h s )-driven charge transport method, we explore the nonsteady carrier energy flux principle for soft matter systems from small organic solids to macrobiomolecular aggregates. Through this principle, the synergic nature of charge and energy transport in different organic systems is addressed. In this work, entropy is the key parameter to classify whether the carrier dynamics is in a nonsteady or steady state. Besides that, we also propose the formulation for unifying the hopping and band transport, which provides the relaxation time-hopping rate relation and the relaxation time-effective mass ratio. The calculated disorder drift time (or entropy-weighted carrier drift time) for hole transport in an alkyl-substituted triphenylamine (TPA) molecular device is 9.3 × 10-7 s, which illustrates nuclear dynamics-coupled charge transfer kinetics. The existence of nonequilibrium transport is anticipated while the carrier dynamics is in the nonsteady state, which is further examined from the rate of traversing potential in octupolar molecules. Our entropy-ruled Einstein model connects the adiabatic band and nonadiabatic hopping transport mechanisms. The logarithmic current density at different electric field-assisted site energy differences provides information about the typical transport (whether trap-free diffusion or trap-assisted recombination) in molecular devices, which reflects in the Navamani-Shockley diode equation.",,1129
2227,35967267,Testing for COVID-19 is Much More Effective When Performed Immediately Prior to Social Mixing.,"Objective: To quantify the utility of RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests in preventing post-arrival transmission based on timing of the pre-departure test. Methods: We derived analytical expressions to compute post-arrival transmission when no test is performed, and when either an RT-PCR or any of 18 rapid antigen tests is performed at specified times before arrival. We determined the diagnostic sensitivity of the rapid antigen tests by propagating their RT-PCR percent positive agreement onto known RT-PCR diagnostic sensitivity. Results: Depending on the rapid antigen test used, conducting a rapid antigen test immediately before departure reduces post-arrival transmission between 37.4% (95% CrI: 28.2%-40.7%) and 46.7% (95% CrI:40.0%-49.3%), compared to a 31.1% (95% CrI: 26.3%-33.5%) reduction using an RT-PCR 12 h before arrival. Performance of each rapid antigen test differed by diagnostic sensitivity over the course of disease. However, these differences were smaller than those engendered by testing too early. Conclusion: Testing closer to arrival-ideally on the day of arrival-is more effective at reducing post-arrival transmission than testing earlier. Rapid antigen tests perform the best in this application due to their short turnaround time.",,1130

Two macroscopic currents are identified, with the corresponding affinities determined using Schnakenberg's graph analysis. We also investigate full counting statistics of the two currents and show that fluctuation theorem holds for their joint probability distribution. Moreover, fluctuation-dissipation relation, Onsager reciprocal relation and their nonlinear generalizations are numerically shown to be satisfied in this model.",,1131
778,35975059,Fluoride-bridged dinuclear dysprosium complex showing single-molecule magnetic behavior: supramolecular approach to isolate magnetic molecules.,"Using Na-encapsulated benzo[18]crown-6 (Na)(B18C6) as a counter cation, we successfully magnetically isolated a fluoride-bridging Dy dinuclear complex {[(PW11O39)Dy(H2O)2]2F} (Dy2POM) with lacunary Keggin ligands. (Na)(B18C6) formed two types of tetramers through C-H⋯O, π⋯π and C-H⋯π interactions, and each tetramer aligned in one dimension along the c-axis to form two types of channels. One channel was partially penetrated by a supramolecular cation from the ±a-axis direction, dividing the channel in the form of a bamboo node. Dy2POM was spatially divided by this bamboo node, which magnetically isolated one portion from the other. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility indicated a weak ferromagnetic interaction between the Dy ions bridged by fluoride. Dy2POM exhibited the magnetic relaxation characteristics of a single-molecule magnet, including the dependence of AC magnetic susceptibility on temperature and frequency. Magnetic relaxation can be described by the combination of thermally active Orbach and temperature-independent quantum tunneling processes. The application of a static magnetic field effectively suppressed the relaxation due to quantum tunneling.",,1132
1231,35971455,A Warhead Substitution Study on the Coronavirus Main Protease Inhibitor Nirmatrelvir.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is currently causing an unprecedented global health emergency since its emergence in December 2019. In December 2021, the FDA granted emergency use authorization to nirmatrelvir, a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor, for treating infected patients. This peptidomimetic is designed with a nitrile warhead, which forms a covalent bond to the viral protease. Herein, we investigate nirmatrelvir analogs with different warheads and their inhibitory activities. In addition, antiviral activities against human alphacoronavirus 229E was also investigated along with a cell-based assay. We discovered that the hydroxymethylketone and ketobenzothiazole warheads were equipotent to the nitrile warhead, suggesting that these analogs can also be used for treating coronavirus infections.",,1133
134,35983271,Matrix Metalloproteinase-14 as an Instigator of Fibrosis in Human Pterygium and Its Pharmacological Intervention.,"There exists a paucity of information on the pathogenesis of pterygium, a benign ocular tumor that scars the cornea and can lead to vision loss. The main recourse for pterygium is surgery; however, recurrence is observed. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the pathology of pterygium. The determination of the specific MMP involved among the 24 human enzymes has not been established due to challenges in MMP profiling. We used an affinity resin that binds specifically to the active forms of MMPs in the complex mixture of the cellular proteome. The proteomics analysis identified active MMP-14 and three related metalloproteinases, ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17, in human pterygia. Inhibition of MMP-14 with the small-molecule inhibitor (R)-ND-336 was assessed in cell migration and collagen contraction assays. (R)-ND-336 attenuated human conjunctiva fibroblast migration and mitigated collagen contraction, both activities required for the formation of pterygium. (R)-ND-336 holds the promise of a therapeutic recourse for pterygium as an orphan disease.",,1134
1043,35974576,Estimation of drift and diffusion functions from unevenly sampled time-series data.,"Complex systems can often be modeled as stochastic processes. However, physical observations of such systems are often irregularly spaced in time, leading to difficulties in estimating appropriate models from data. Here we present extensions of two methods for estimating drift and diffusion functions from irregularly sampled time-series data. Our methods are flexible and applicable to a variety of stochastic systems, including non-Markov processes or systems contaminated with measurement noise. To demonstrate applicability, we use this approach to analyze an irregularly sampled paleoclimatological isotope record, giving insights into underlying physical processes.",,1135
1517,35968369,"Cerebral blood flow in adolescents with drug-naive, first-episode major depressive disorder: An arterial spin labeling study based on voxel-level whole-brain analysis.","The major depressive disorder (MDD) can be a threat to the health of people all over the world. Although governments have developed and implemented evidence-based interventions and prevention programs to prevent MDD and maintain mental health in adolescents, the number of adolescents with this condition has been on the rise for the past 10 years. A total of 60 adolescents were recruited, including 32 drug-naive adolescents with first-episode MDD and 28 healthy controls (HCs). Alterations in the intrinsic cerebral activity of the adolescents with MDD were explored using arterial spin labeling (ASL) while differences in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the two groups were assessed based on voxel-based whole-brain analysis. Finally, correlations between the regional functional abnormalities and clinical variables were investigated for adolescents with MDD. Compared with HCs, MDD patients had a lower rCBF in the left triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFGtriang) but a higher one in the right Precental gyrus (PreCG). Negative correlations were also noted between the CBF in the left IFGtriang and the Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) scores of MDD patients. Elucidating the neurobiological features of adolescent patients with MDD is important to adequately develop methods that can assist in early diagnosis, precaution and intervention.",,1136
784,35975053,Regulated synthesis of Zr-metal-organic frameworks with variable hole size and its influence on the performance of novel MOF-based heterogeneous amino acid-thiourea catalysts.,"We present an efficient and easy synthesis method for incorporating organocatalytic moieties into Zr-metal organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs). The catalytic activity and selectivity of the new chiral catalysts were improved by adjusting the aperture of the MOF cavities. The hole size of the Zr-MOF was modulated by adding acid and replacing bridge ligands during synthesis. The difunctional chiral units of amino acid-thiourea are anchored onto the Zr-MOF by a mild synthesis method from an isothiocyanate intermediate which could effectively avoid the racemization of chiral moieties in the synthesis process. By means of specific surface area measurement (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD), it was confirmed that Zr-MOFs with different pore sizes were synthesized without breaking the basic octahedral structure of the MOF. Finally, good yields (up to 83%) and ee values (up to 73%) were achieved with the new heterogeneous catalysts in 48 hours for the aldol reaction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone. By contrast, using the catalyst support without modulating the synthesis, the yield (30%) and the ee-value (26%) were both low. Experiments have confirmed the important influence on the reaction selectivity of providing a suitable reaction environment by controlling the aperture of MOF cavities.",,1137
76,35983410,Genome-Wide Association and Genomic Prediction of Growth Traits in the European Flat Oyster (Ostrea edulis).,"The European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) is a bivalve mollusc that was once widely distributed across Europe and represented an important food resource for humans for centuries. Populations of O. edulis experienced a severe decline across their biogeographic range mainly due to overexploitation and disease outbreaks. To restore the economic and ecological benefits of European flat oyster populations, extensive protection and restoration efforts are in place within Europe. In line with the increasing interest in supporting restoration and oyster farming through the breeding of stocks with enhanced performance, the present study aimed to evaluate the potential of genomic selection for improving growth traits in a European flat oyster population obtained from successive mass-spawning events. Four growth-related traits were evaluated: total weight (TW), shell height (SH), shell width (SW) and shell length (SL). The heritability of the growth traits was in the low-moderate range, with estimates of 0.45, 0.37, 0.22, and 0.32 for TW, SH, SW and SL, respectively. A genome-wide association analysis revealed a largely polygenic architecture for the four growth traits, with two distinct QTLs detected on chromosome 4. To investigate whether genomic selection can be implemented in flat oyster breeding at a reduced cost, the utility of low-density SNP panels was assessed. Genomic prediction accuracies using the full density panel were high (> 0.83 for all traits). The evaluation of the effect of reducing the number of markers used to predict genomic breeding values revealed that similar selection accuracies could be achieved for all traits with 2K SNPs as for a full panel containing 4,577 SNPs. Only slight reductions in accuracies were observed at the lowest SNP density tested (i.e., 100 SNPs), likely due to a high relatedness between individuals being included in the training and validation sets during cross-validation. Overall, our results suggest that the genetic improvement of growth traits in oysters is feasible. Nevertheless, and although low-density SNP panels appear as a promising strategy for applying GS at a reduced cost, additional populations with different degrees of genetic relatedness should be assessed to derive estimates of prediction accuracies to be expected in practical breeding programmes.",,1138
104,35983369,Material research from the viewpoint of functional motifs.,"As early as 2001, the need for the 'functional motif theory' was pointed out, to assist the rational design of functional materials. The properties of materials are determined by their functional motifs and how they are arranged in the materials. Uncovering functional motifs and their arrangements is crucial in understanding the properties of materials and rationally designing new materials of desired properties. The functional motifs of materials are the critical microstructural units (e.g. constituent components and building blocks) that play a decisive role in generating certain material functions, and can not be replaced with other structural units without the loss, or significant suppression, of relevant functions. The role of functional motifs and their arrangement in materials, with representative examples, is presented. The microscopic structures of these examples can be classified into six types on a length scale smaller than ∼10 nm with maximum subatomic resolution, i.e. crystal, magnetic, aperiodic, defect, local and electronic structures. Functional motif analysis can be employed in the function-oriented design of materials, as elucidated by taking infrared non-linear optical materials as an example. Machine learning is more efficient in predicting material properties and screening materials with high efficiency than high-throughput experimentation and high-throughput calculations. In order to extract functional motifs and find their quantitative relationships, the development of sufficiently reliable databases for material structures and properties is imperative.",,1139
493,35978794,Corporate Co-Agglomeration and Green Economy Efficiency in China.,"This paper uses panel OLS, IV, and system GMM methods to empirically study the effects of manufacturing and producer service corporate co-agglomeration on green economy efficiency (GEE) in China. Chinese panel data from 2000 to 2019 are collected to assess the GEE and co-agglomeration degrees. The regression results show that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between co-agglomeration and GEE. However, regional heterogeneity is found in the effects of corporate co-agglomeration on GEE. The mediating analysis indicates that corporate co-agglomeration could increase GEE through business entrepreneurship and innovation entrepreneurship. Variables such as transportation infrastructure, human capital, foreign direct investment, and environmental regulations are also found to have an elevating effect on GEE, whereas local fiscal expenditure on environmental protection has little effect. The findings in this paper indicate that entrepreneurship plays an important role in the process of co-agglomeration impacting GEE which differs in different regions and thus provide references for corporate and regional sustainable development.",,1140
2276,35967155,Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome: Delayed Diagnosis of a Rare Clinical Entity With a Common Clinical Presentation.,"Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome, also known as Wilkie's syndrome, is an uncommon disorder that involves a set of symptoms that primarily includes postprandial pain at times associated with intestinal obstruction. Although a rare disease in the general population, SMA syndrome has a high probability of occurrence in patients who are severely malnourished or have certain debilitating conditions leading to a loss of retroperitoneal fat. Here, we present the case of a 16-year-old male with a one-year history of postprandial abdominal pain associated with nausea, multiple episodes of vomiting, and abdominal distension. Amid a delayed diagnosis and multiple hospital visits, the patient's condition further deteriorated. Thereafter, computed tomography of the abdomen confirmed this rare diagnosis. Because the patient could not be further managed conservatively, laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy was planned and done. This case report highlights the various challenges in diagnosing this disease and highlights the importance of an early diagnosis so that patients can be managed effectively and timely.",,1141
197,35982825,Observation of intermolecular Coulombic decay and shake-up satellites in liquid ammonia.,"We report the first nitrogen 1s Auger-Meitner electron spectrum from a liquid ammonia microjet at a temperature of ∼223 K (-50 °C) and compare it with the simultaneously measured spectrum for gas-phase ammonia. The spectra from both phases are interpreted with the assistance of high-level electronic structure and ab initio molecular dynamics calculations. In addition to the regular Auger-Meitner-electron features, we observe electron emission at kinetic energies of 374-388 eV, above the leading Auger-Meitner peak (3a1 2). Based on the electronic structure calculations, we assign this peak to a shake-up satellite in the gas phase, i.e., Auger-Meitner emission from an intermediate state with additional valence excitation present. The high-energy contribution is significantly enhanced in the liquid phase. We consider various mechanisms contributing to this feature. First, in analogy with other hydrogen-bonded liquids (noticeably water), the high-energy signal may be a signature for an ultrafast proton transfer taking place before the electronic decay (proton transfer mediated charge separation). The ab initio dynamical calculations show, however, that such a process is much slower than electronic decay and is, thus, very unlikely. Next, we consider a non-local version of the Auger-Meitner decay, the Intermolecular Coulombic Decay. The electronic structure calculations support an important contribution of this purely electronic mechanism. Finally, we discuss a non-local enhancement of the shake-up processes.",,1142
2429,35966867,Increase in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and serological evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection: Is there a connection?,"Several studies have investigated the correlation between the COVID-19 pandemic and the onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in children, reporting an increased incidence of T1D and severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This study aimed to investigate the infection by SARS-CoV-2 in children with newly-diagnosed T1D to explore a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 infection, T1D and DKA. Thirty-nine children with a T1D new onset between October 15, 2020, and April 15, 2021, were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 infection was investigated through a polymerase chain reaction on the nasal swab, dosage of specific antibodies, and an anamnestic question form. Nine (23%) of them had antibodies directed toward SARS-CoV-2, and five (12%) had a history of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection in themselves or in their family. No molecular swabs were positive. Compared to the general pediatric population, the overall incidence of COVID-19 was 5.6 times higher in the T1D patients' group (p < 0.00001). Referring only to the cases in the metropolitan area, we find a net increase in the incidence of T1D compared to the 5 years preceding our study, by 50% compared to the same months in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018, by 69% compared to 2018/2019 and by 77% compared to 2019/2020. The same trend was observed regarding DKA cases. The attributable risk of the pandemic cohort compared to the previous year is 44%. The abnormal disproportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection between children with T1D and the pediatric reference population, with a ratio of 5.6, appears to support the causative role of SARS-CoV-2 in triggering the immune response underlying diabetes, as often described for other viral infections. The difficulty accessing care services during the pandemic, with a consequent diagnosis delay, does not justify the increase in observed T1D cases, which could to be directly linked to the pandemic. The acceleration of the immune process provoked by SARS-CoV-2 may play a suggestive role in the development of T1D with DKA. Multicenter studies are needed to deepen and fully understand the pathophysiological link between SARS-CoV-2 and the onset of T1D in children.",,1143
57,35983472,Comorbidities in Patients with Lichen Planopilaris: A Case-Control Study.,"Lichen planopilaris (LPP) is a lymphocyte-mediated type of scarring alopecia and considered to have autoimmune etiology. Studies about systemic comorbid conditions are limited. Our goal is to identify the prevalence of medical comorbidities in patients with LPP. In a retrospective case-control study, the medical records of 208 LPP patients and 208 controls were reviewed for existing comorbidities such as thyroid diseases, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lupus erythematous. Hyperlipidemia was found in 41.8% of all patients with LPP and in 17.3% of controls (p value <0.001, OR = 4.167). Chances of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders were lower in the LPP group in comparison to controls (p value = 0.009). Thyroid disorders were more prevalent in LPP patients, but the difference was not statistically significant (p value = 0.277). Our study further emphasizes that LPP patients should be screened for medical comorbidities, especially lipid profile abnormalities.",,1144
2144,35967374,Snowflake: A deep learning-based human leukocyte antigen matching algorithm considering allele-specific surface accessibility.,"Histocompatibility in solid-organ transplantation has a strong impact on long-term graft survival. Although recent advances in matching of both B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes have improved understanding of allorecognition, the immunogenic determinants are still not fully understood. We hypothesized that HLA solvent accessibility is allele-specific, thus supporting refinement of HLA B-cell epitope prediction. We developed a computational pipeline named Snowflake to calculate solvent accessibility of HLA Class I proteins for deposited HLA crystal structures, supplemented by constructed HLA structures through the AlphaFold protein folding predictor and peptide binding predictions of the APE-Gen docking framework. This dataset trained a four-layer long short-term memory bidirectional recurrent neural network, which in turn inferred solvent accessibility of all known HLA Class I proteins. We extracted 676 HLA Class-I experimental structures from the Protein Data Bank and supplemented it by 37 Class-I alleles for which structures were predicted. For each of the predicted structures, 10 known binding peptides as reported by the Immune Epitope DataBase were rendered into the binding groove. Although HLA Class I proteins predominantly are folded similarly, we found higher variation in root mean square difference of solvent accessibility between experimental structures of different HLAs compared to structures with identical amino acid sequence, suggesting HLA's solvent accessible surface is protein specific. Hence, residues may be surface-accessible on e.g. HLA-A*02:01, but not on HLA-A*01:01. Mapping these data to antibody-verified epitopes as defined by the HLA Epitope Registry reveals patterns of (1) consistently accessible residues, (2) only subsets of an epitope's residues being consistently accessible and (3) varying surface accessibility of residues of epitopes. Our data suggest B-cell epitope definitions can be refined by considering allele-specific solvent-accessibility, rather than aggregating HLA protein surface maps by HLA class or locus. To support studies on epitope analyses in organ transplantation, the calculation of donor-allele-specific solvent-accessible amino acid mismatches was implemented as a cloud-based web service.",,1145
706,35975239,Study on the effects of combined tea drinking and mental activity after dinner on smokers in China.,"Cigarette and tobacco use is a leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and other malignant tumors. In China, people prefer to engage in mental activities (gambling, overtime work, playing video games, or other mental activities) on the weekends or during spare time, especially in the evening before they prepare for bed. In China, smokers frequently consume tea while smoking. The relationship between smokers who consume tea, engage in mental activities after dinner, or both (drinking tea and engaging in cognitive activities after dinner together), and daily cigarette smoking or nicotine addiction must be clarified. A total of 438 smokers were included in the study. Age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking habits, Fagerström test for nicotine dependence scores, and behaviors, were recorded. The study excluded smokers with a Fagerström score <1 or with a mental disorder diagnosis. The smokers were divided into four groups based on their behaviors: those who did not drink tea, did not engage in mental activities after dinner, those who drank tea only, those who engaged in mental activities only, and those who engaged in both. Only drinking tea or doing mental activities after dinner cannot increase cigarettes per day (22.20 ± 10.143 vs 23.49 ± 11.966, p=0.362; 22.20 ± 10.143 vs 22.66 ± 1.192, p=0.750) or FTND scores [6.0 (4.0; 7.0) vs 6.0 (4.0; 7.75), p=0.941; 6.0 (4.0; 7.0) vs 6.0 (4.25; 7.75), p=0.980]. People who drink tea and engage in mental activities after dinner smoke more (22.20 ± 10.143 vs 30.75 ± 17.264, p<0.0001) and have higher nicotine dependence levels [6.0 (4.0; 7.0) vs 7.0 (5.0; 8.0), p=0.015]. The consumption of tea or a mental activity after dinner is not associated with daily smoking or nicotine dependence. There is an association between the combined behaviors (tea drinking and mental activity after dinner) and the daily consumption of cigarettes, and the degree of nicotine dependence.",,1146
1899,35967710,Impact of brand hate on consumer well-being for technology products through the lens of stimulus organism response approach.,"Consumer well-being is a micromarketing concept that emphasizes on contributions of marketing activities in social welfare. The major objective of the current study is to analyze the impact of self-incongruence on brand dissatisfaction, brand hate, and consumer well-being. This study has utilized the Self-incongruity Theory and the Stimulus-Organism-Response model to test the impact of self-incongruity on anti-consumption and consumer voice behaviors, and subsequent effects on consumer well-being. Data were collected from young consumers of technology products from major cities of Pakistan. A total of 592 consumers answered a paper-and-pencil questionnaire using purposive sampling technique. The data were analyzed by partial least square structural equation modeling. The findings of this study reveal that functional and symbolic incongruity predict brand hate and dissatisfaction, which is positively related with brand retaliation. Brand retaliation is negatively related with consumer well-being. This study offers implications for product designers, marketers, advertisers and other stakeholders to improve congruence between what young consumers of technology products expect and what brands are offering to mitigate negative attitudes and behaviors and increase consumer well-being.",,1147
1123,35974496,Testing wave turbulence theory for the Gross-Pitaevskii system.,"We test the predictions of the theory of weak wave turbulence by performing numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and the associated wave-kinetic equation (WKE). We consider an initial state localized in Fourier space, and we confront the solutions of the WKE obtained numerically with GPE data for both the wave-action spectrum and the probability density functions (PDFs) of the Fourier mode intensities. We find that the temporal evolution of the GPE data is accurately predicted by the WKE, with no adjustable parameters, for about two nonlinear kinetic times. Qualitative agreement between the GPE and the WKE persists also for longer times with some quantitative deviations that may be attributed to the combination of a breakdown of the theoretical assumptions underlying the WKE as well as numerical issues. Furthermore, we study how the wave statistics evolves toward Gaussianity in a timescale of the order of the kinetic time. The excellent agreement between direct numerical simulations of the GPE and the WKE provides a solid foundation to the theory of weak wave turbulence.",,1148
669,35975543,Monoclonal Immunoglobulin Associated with Monoclonal Free Light Chains Invisible on Capillary Electrophoresis.,"We report the case of a monoclonal immunoglobulin of IgM Lambda isotype associated with monoclonal lambda-type free light chains not detected by capillary electrophoresis but identified by immunofixation. Capillary electrophoresis showed hypoproteinemia and an inflammatory syndrome. The IF realized on Hydrasys 2 Scan Focusing Sebia® reveals an IgM monoclonal band and two monoclonal bands in the total lambda. A second IF is performed using anti IgM, anti IgD, anti IgE and anti-total and -free lambda light chains as antisera. It reveals the presence of a monoclonal protein isotype IgM Lambda with free light chains. In view of these discordant results, an immunosubtraction was performed on the same sample showing no abnormality. Our patient has a monoclonal IgM Lambda with lambda monoclonal free light chains all masked on capillary electrophoresis and therefore not detected. Capillary electrophoresis techniques are incrementally becoming the techniques of choice in medical laboratories as a replacement for gel electrophoresis, due to their automation and better sensitivity. However, in some cases, a monoclonal immunoglobulin may not be detected by capillary technique and may cause an inaccurate interpretation.",,1149
1130,35973919,Use and misuse of opioid after gynecologic surgery.,"Postoperative opioid use following gynecologic surgery may be necessary for effective treatment of pain; however, it can result in significant side effects, adverse reactions, and negative health consequences, including prolonged problematic use. Surgeons and healthcare providers of patients recovering from gynecologic procedures should be aware of effective strategies that can decrease the need for opioid use, while providing high-quality pain management. These include adherence to Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocols, particularly the use of multimodal analgesia management. When prescribing opioids, providers should adhere to responsible prescribing practices to minimize the risk of inappropriate and/or long-term opioid use.",,1150
1241,35971374,An Integrative Comparative Study Between Digoxin and Amiodarone as an Emergency Treatment for Patients With Atrial Fibrillation With Evidence of Heart Failure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The emergency treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) involves utilizing two strategies. The first strategy normally involves permitting the atrial fibrillation to persevere as the ventricular rate is controlled. The other method involves utilizing anti-arrhythmic drugs in cardioversion and attempting to maintain sinus rhythm. Different pharmacological treatments, including digoxin and amiodarone, have been used to manage AF. A literature review on amiodarone and digoxin in the treatment of AF among patients with heart failure (HF) has shown that both drugs have potential risks. Therefore, we are conducting this systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of amiodarone and digoxin in the treatment of AF among patients with evidence of HF. A literature search of relevant articles was conducted on six electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar) from 2000 to 2022. The search yielded seven studies that had met the inclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis of four studies showed that there was no significant difference in the reduction of heart rate after treatment with either amiodarone or digoxin (mean difference (MD): -5.44; 95% confidence interval (CI): -9.53 to -1.34; I2 = 25%; p = 0.26). On the other hand, the statistical analysis showed that amiodarone had a better effect on the conversion to sinus rhythm than digoxin (63% versus 35%, respectively). Based on evidence from our meta-analysis, the clinical effect of amiodarone and digoxin in the emergency treatment of AF on heart rate control was unclear. However, amiodarone has a significant impact on the restoration of sinus rhythm compared with digoxin and can be considered the first-line drug regimen in conversion to sinus rhythm for AF patients with evidence of heart failure. However, the use of amiodarone and digoxin is complicated by adverse events and all-cause mortality.",,1151
1962,35967645,Impact of absent crowds on technical and physical performances in the Chinese Soccer Super League.,"Spectators have a significant impact on match performances in soccer, but to what extent crowd support contributes to the technical and physical performances remains unclear. This study aimed to (1) investigate the differences in terms of technical and physical performances with and without spectators; and (2) identify the key factors differentiating between win and loss when playing with and without the presence of an audience. Our study examined 794 performance records from 397 matches during the 2019-2020 seasons in the Chinese Soccer Super League. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-logistic regression was utilized to select significant predictors. Using an independent t-test and the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test explores the difference between matches with and without spectators. Key factors between win and loss were explored using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Our study found that cross (p < 0.01, ES = -0.24), shots (p < 0.001, ES = -0.25), and shot accuracy (p < 0.05, ES = -0.18) displayed decreasing trends whereas sprint distances (p < 0.05, ES = 0.16) presented an increasing trend without spectators comparing with the crowd support. Moreover, the above three technical variables were the main factors differentiating between wins and losses. Similarly, team and opponent quality remained important potential factors affecting the match outcome. Match outcome or team performance is determined by a myriad of factors, but there are clear differences in technical and physical performances between matches with and without the presence of an audience. Similarly, our study provides a better explanation for the impact of crowd support on match performances whereby coaches can deploy players and adjust match strategies for ultimate success.",,1152
1928,35967681,Predictors of problem-solving skills among emergency medical services staff in Iran: A cross-sectional correlational study.,"Pre-hospital emergency technicians face many problems in the workplace daily, so the ability to solve or overcome them in the workplace is essential. This article aimed to assess the predictors of problem-solving skills among emergency medical services staff in Iran. This study was cross-sectional correlational research. Using convenience sampling methods, 140 emergency medical services (EMS) staff were enrolled in the study. Response time was assessed using ASAYAR software, problem-solving skills (PSS) were measured using the Hepner Petersen Problem Solving Questionnaire (PSI), and cognitive emotion regulation strategies were assessed using the Garnfsky Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson's r correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression analysis were applied using SPSS 14.0. The results of our study showed that the total mean score for problem-solving skills was 136.84 (14.65) (range, 175-107 points). Multiple linear regression indicated that refocusing on planning, positive evaluation, stress management courses, delays and their causes, positive refocusing, catastrophizing, and acceptance were effective predictors of problem-solving skills in emergency personnel, accounting for 54% of the total variances. This study is one of the first studies in this field. Based on our findings, individuals who consider their emotions and feelings when solving problems are better able to use the process of thinking and problem-solving skills. Therefore, by training people in the field of emotional regulation skills, the skills to solve problems technicians can be increased.",,1153

581,35978506,Role of Cancer-Associated fibroblast in the pathogenesis of ovarian Cancer: Focus on the latest therapeutic approaches.,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the seventh most common malignancy in women globally. This type of cancer can occur at any age, but it is more frequent in women over 50 and is usually diagnosed late. Despite platinum-based chemotherapy and optimal cytoreductive surgery, OC cells tend to metastasize, and patients with OC experience recurrent relapses and poor prognosis. Therefore, the emergence of novel therapies is essential for treating these patients. On the other hand, it has been shown that the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its components play an important role in the pathogenesis of OC. One of these components is cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), which is involved in the growth and development of tumor cells by inducing tumor cells growth, proliferation, angiogenesis and inhibiting anti-tumor responses. Due to the importance of these cells in the TME, various therapeutic approaches such as direct targeting of CAFs, reprogramming of CAFs, and CAF-associated genes and molecules targeting have been suggested for OC treatment. This review summarizes the role of CAFs in the pathogenesis of OC and therapeutic approaches based on the mentioned therapeutic approaches.",,1155

Sampling was conducted during the 1st quarter International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) on board the Danish R/V DANA (DTU Aqua Denmark) and the Swedish R/V Svea (SLU Sweden), as part of the ichthyoplankton investigation during night-time. A total of 147 stations were investigated in the western, central and eastern North Sea as well as the Skagerrak and Kattegat. Sampling was conducted with a 13 m long Midwater Ring Net (MIK net, Ø 2 m, mesh size 1.6 mm, cod end with smaller mesh size of 500 µm), equipped with a flow meter. The MIK net was deployed in double oblique hauls from the surface to c. 5 m above the sea floor [1,2]. Samples were visually analysed unpreserved on a light table and/or with a stereomicroscope or magnifying lamp within 2 hours after catch. A total of 13,510 individuals were counted/sized. Twelve gelatinous macrozooplankton species or genera were encountered, namely the hydrozoan Aequorea vitrina, Aglantha digitale, Clytia spp., Leuckartiara octona, Tima bairdii, Muggiaea atlantica; the scyphozoans Cyanea capillata and Cyanea lamarckii and the ctenophores Beroe spp., Bolinopsis infundibulum, Mnemiopsis leidyi, Pleurobrachia pileus. Abundance data are presented on a volume specific (m-3) and area specific (m-2) basis. Size data have been used to estimate wet weights based on published length-weight regressions (see Table 1). For the groups i) hydrozoan jellyfish, ii) scyphozoan jellyfish, iii) ctenophores, as well as iv) grouped gelatinous macrozooplankton, spatial weight specific distribution patterns are presented. This unpublished dataset contributes baseline information about the gelatinous macrozooplankton diversity and its specific distribution patterns in the extended North Sea area during winter (January-February) 2021. These data can be an important contribution to address global change impacts on marine systems, especially considering gelatinous macrozooplankton abundance changes in relation to anthropogenic stressors.",,1157
152,35983231,TF-COMB - Discovering grammar of transcription factor binding sites.,"Cooperativity between transcription factors is important to regulate target gene expression. In particular, the binding grammar of TFs in relation to each other, as well as in the context of other genomic elements, is crucial for TF functionality. However, tools to easily uncover co-occurrence between DNA-binding proteins, and investigate the regulatory modules of TFs, are limited. Here we present TF-COMB (Transcription Factor Co-Occurrence using Market Basket analysis) - a tool to investigate co-occurring TFs and binding grammar within regulatory regions. We found that TF-COMB can accurately identify known co-occurring TFs from ChIP-seq data, as well as uncover preferential localization to other genomic elements. With the use of ATAC-seq footprinting and TF motif locations, we found that TFs exhibit both preferred orientation and distance in relation to each other, and that these are biologically significant. Finally, we extended the analysis to not only investigate individual TF pairs, but also TF pairs in the context of networks, which enabled the investigation of TF complexes and TF hubs. In conclusion, TF-COMB is a flexible tool to investigate various aspects of TF binding grammar.",,1158
1923,35967686,School nurses' experiences of health-promoting work to prevent stress in Swedish adolescents.,"To investigate school nurses' experiences of health-promoting work to prevent stress in Swedish adolescents. Swedish school nurses (n = 225) responded to a web survey with open-ended questions. The results were subjected to a qualitative content analysis. Six categories were identified from the analysis: (1) Knowledge of body and soul, (2) Identifying stress and ill health, (3) Collaborative working within/outside school, (4) Make yourself (i.e., school nurses) visible to the students, (5) Support students' learning, and (6) Tools for stress management. One of the most important themes in preventing and counteracting stress in school-aged children and adolescents was promoting healthy living habits. That school nurses were easily accessible and visible were important for them to identify stress as early as possible. The close collaboration with the school health care team and building relationships with the students were emphasized. The stress in adolescents was largely linked to schoolwork and performance anxiety. To counteract this, the dialogue with the teachers was important to increase their knowledge of mental health problems and stress and influence the scheduling of school exams. The study contributes to increased knowledge in the field and provides concrete strategies for how school nurses can work to counteract stress in students.",,1159
693,35975515,Disparity Analysis of Clinicopathologic Hallmarks between Transformed DLBCL and Primary DLBCL.,"A variety of indolent lymphomas, particularly marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) can be histologically transformed to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Little is known about the disparity of clinicopathologic characteristics between transformed DLBCL (tDLBCL) and primary DLBCL (pDLBCL). This retrospective study analyzed the clinicopathological hallmarks of 10 tDLBCL (7 MZL and 3 FL) and 40 pDLBCL from the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University. Patients of tDLBCL had a higher ECOG score, more B-symptoms, and lower serum albumin level than those in pDLBCL (60.0% vs. 7.50%, 40.0% vs. 10.0%, and 90.0% vs. 10.0%, respectively, p < 0.01). Pathologically, tDLBCL had more c-Myc and BCL-2 dual-expression than that in pDLBCL (60.0% vs. 25.0%, p < 0.01). The positive rate of CD5 expression and the proportion of high Ki-67 score in tDLBCL were higher than those in pDLBCL (50.0% vs. 7.5%, 50.0% vs. 32.5%, respectively, p < 0.01). The median overall survival and progression-free survival were 14 months and 11 months in tDLBCL, 35 months and 28 months in pDLBCL (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001). Our results demonstrate that tDLBCL manifested aggressive clinical course and pathological features of Myc/BCL-2 expression, CD5 expression, and high Ki-67 score.",,1160
230,35982790,Detecting tandem repeat variants in coding regions using code-adVNTR.,"The human genome contains more than one million tandem repeats (TRs), DNA sequences containing multiple approximate copies of a motif repeated contiguously. TRs account for significant genetic variation, with 50 + diseases attributed to changes in motif number. A few diseases have been to be caused by small indels in variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) including poly-cystic kidney disease type 1 (MCKD1) and monogenic type 1 diabetes. However, small indels in VNTRs are largely unexplored mainly due to the long and complex structure of VNTRs with multiple motifs. We developed a method, code-adVNTR, that utilizes multi-motif hidden Markov models to detect both, motif count variation and small indels, within VNTRs. In simulated data, code-adVNTR outperformed GATK-HaplotypeCaller in calling small indels within large VNTRs. We used code-adVNTR to characterize coding VNTRs in the 1000 genomes data identifying many population-specific variants, and to reliably call MUC1 mutations for MCKD1.",,1161

It was established after Direct laryngoscopy surgery and biopsy, that it was a low-grade B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The primary lesion is resolved with Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisolone regimen. Four months later, patient presented with a discharge and maggots at the tracheostomy site. Ifosfamide, Etoposide, Carboplatin was started after a secondary recurrence of disease progression. Hereby we infer this is an unusual case presentation, myiasis with lymphoma recurrence and tough exacting to the otolaryngologist as there are more chances of misdiagnosing as squamous cell carcinoma..",,1162
861,35974862,"Efficacy of Preoperative Piroxicam, Diclofenac, Paracetamol With Tramadol and Placebo Tablets for Relief of Postoperative Pain After the Removal of Impacted Mandibular Third Molars: A Randomised Controlled Trial.","Aim We aimed to analyze the influence of preoperative piroxicam, diclofenac, paracetamol, tramadol, and placebo tablets as measured in the time required for rescue analgesia for postoperative pain relief after the extraction of impacted mandibular third molar. Materials & methods Forty-four patients who needed extraction of impacted mandibular third molar were arbitrarily categorized into four groups namely, piroxicam, diclofenac, paracetamol with tramadol, and placebo. The test medicine was given one hour preoperatively before the surgical removal. The pain was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale (VRS) scores preoperatively and at the third and 24th hours. The time required for escape analgesia was measured.  Results The mean VAS and VRS scores showed significant differences across the groups after 24 hours. The mean score was lowest for the patients taking piroxicam (1.30+1.95) and highest for patients taking tramadol + paracetamol (4.50+2.59). As far as escape analgesia is concerned piroxicam group was by far superior. Conclusion The pain scores and the rescue analgesic requirement suggested that piroxicam analgesic significantly reduced pain; moreover, it is a safe as well as an efficacious substitute to the conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for mandibular third molar impactions.",,1163

Each contains an intra-molecular N-H⋯O hydrogen bond. In the crystal, O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds form chains of mol-ecules, which are linked into corrugated sheets parallel to (03) plane by C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds together with π inter-actions between the carbonyl groups and the 2-hy-droxy-phenyl rings. The layers are linked by further C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds. The Hirshfeld surface analysis of the crystal structure indicates that the most important contributions for the crystal packing are from H⋯H (49.0%), H⋯O/O⋯H (28.3%) and H⋯C/C⋯H (10.9%) inter-actions. van der Waals inter-actions are the dominant inter-actions in the crystal packing. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) optimized structures at the B3LYP/ 6-311 G(d,p) level are compared with the experimentally determined mol-ecular structure in the solid state.

317,35980419,United States Emergency Department Screening for Drug Use Among Assault-Injured Individuals: A Systematic Review.,"The clinical model of screening, providing a brief psychosocial and/or pharmacological intervention, and directly referring patients to treatment (SBIRT) is a compelling model to address drug use among assault-injured individuals in the busy emergency department (ED) setting. Our objective in this study was to examine the current literature and determine ED-based strategies that have been reported that screen, directly refer to drug mis-use/addiction specialized treatment services, or initiate addiction treatment among individuals injured by non-partner assault in the United States. We conducted a systematic review of ED-based studies using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol. OVID, MEDLINE, OVID Embase, OVID AMED, Web of Science-Core Collection, Cochrane CENTRAL, and CINAHL were systematically searched using keywords and Medical Subject Heading terms. Studies were excluded if they only involved intimate partner assault-injury, tobacco, or alcohol use. We categorized ED-based strategies as screening, direct referral, or treatment initiation. Of the 2,076 non-duplicated studies identified, we included 26 full-text articles in the final analysis. Fourteen studies were cross-sectional, 11 were cohort, and one was case-control in design. The most common drug use screening instrument used was the National Institute on Drug Abuse Quick Screen Question. Cannabis was the most common drug detected upon screening. Drug use, while highly prevalent, is a modifiable risk factor for non-partner assault-injury. The paucity of scientific studies is evidence for the need to intentionally address this area that remains a major challenge for the public's health. Future research is needed to evaluate ED-based interventions for drug use in this population.",,1165
2052,35967523,IgA Nephropathy with Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy with Spinal Cord Involvement in a Young Male: A Case Report.,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinico-radiological phenomenon commonly associated with kidney diseases, especially chronic kidney disease. A consequence of endothelial dysfunction, PRES is usually associated with uncontrolled blood pressures and can rarely have atypical radiological findings involving the brain stem and spinal cord, called posterior reversible encephalopathy with spinal cord involvement (PRES-SCI). These atypical features may be confused with other etiologies causing a delay in diagnosis and management. We describe a young male patient who presented with neurological symptoms suggestive of PRES; however, the atypical radiological findings along with concomitant rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis led to a diagnostic dilemma. Repeat neuro-imaging after appropriate blood pressure control showed disappearance of the lesions confirming the diagnosis of PRES-SCI, and kidney biopsy showed advanced IgA nephropathy. Knowledge of atypical features of PRES is crucial amongst nephrologists as it is a common association with kidney disease and prompt identification and management avoid irreversible sequelae and unnecessary investigations.",,1166
921,35974769,Learning size-adaptive molecular substructures for explainable drug-drug interaction prediction by substructure-aware graph neural network.,"Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can trigger unexpected pharmacological effects on the body, and the causal mechanisms are often unknown. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed to better understand DDIs. However, identifying key substructures that contribute most to the DDI prediction is a challenge for GNNs. In this study, we presented a substructure-aware graph neural network, a message passing neural network equipped with a novel substructure attention mechanism and a substructure-substructure interaction module (SSIM) for DDI prediction (SA-DDI). Specifically, the substructure attention was designed to capture size- and shape-adaptive substructures based on the chemical intuition that the sizes and shapes are often irregular for functional groups in molecules. DDIs are fundamentally caused by chemical substructure interactions. Thus, the SSIM was used to model the substructure-substructure interactions by highlighting important substructures while de-emphasizing the minor ones for DDI prediction. We evaluated our approach in two real-world datasets and compared the proposed method with the state-of-the-art DDI prediction models. The SA-DDI surpassed other approaches on the two datasets. Moreover, the visual interpretation results showed that the SA-DDI was sensitive to the structure information of drugs and was able to detect the key substructures for DDIs. These advantages demonstrated that the proposed method improved the generalization and interpretation capability of DDI prediction modeling.",,1167
816,35974982,Assessment of the Timely Administration of Birth Dose Vaccines in Northern Nigeria and Associated Factors.,"Lack of a timely receipt of vaccines can cause uncertain immune response and under-vaccination. Hence, timely vaccination is crucial to ensure an infant's early protection. To identify the age of presentation for the birth dose vaccines, vaccine antigens received and factors associated with vaccination presentation by day one in Northern Nigeria. A descriptive cross-sectional study involving 1 952 mother-infant pairs enrolled from 5 different states in Northern Nigeria. Data was collected using a questionnaire including the socio-demographic, antenatal care (ANC), delivery details, birth dates, vaccination presentation and birth vaccine antigens received. Data analysis was done with the SPSS-21 software. The median age of the infants at presentation for birth vaccines was six (interquartile range 2-16) days. A total of 413 (21.2%) infants were brought by the day of birth (day 0) or the next day (Day one), while one-fifth (20.6%) presented after Day 28. The most frequently received antigen was the Bacille-Calmette-Guerin by 1 781 infants (91.2%), oral polio vaccine 1 703 (87.2%), and hepatitis B vaccine birth dose the lowest at 75.1% (1 565). The commonest reasons for delayed presentations were an ill baby (24.7%) and an ill mother (21.9%).Factors associated with presentation within Day one post-birth were hospital delivery (OR-1.67, 95% CI; 1.28-2.19), firstborn (OR-1.40; 95%CI; 1.02-1.93), Christianity (OR-2.14 95% CI; 1.63-2.81), and mother with tertiary education (OR-1.62, 95% CI; 1.05-2.48). Timely administration of the birth dose vaccines is low in Northern Nigeria. Furthermore, some babies do not get the required vaccines despite presenting for vaccination due to stockout. Strategies for early neonatal vaccination such as vaccination in hospital suites post-delivery and utilizing relatives/fathers to take the baby for vaccination when a mother is indisposed are imperative.",,1168

1995,35967610,Visual Performance of Psychological Factors in Interior Design Under the Background of Artificial Intelligence.,"Sensation (the reflection of past experience in the mind) is the reflection of the brain on the individual attributes of objective things that directly act on the sense organs. Feeling is the most elementary cognitive process and the simplest psychological phenomenon. Vision is a kind of sense, and sense is produced by objective things acting on the sense organs. But at present, it is rare to analyze interior design exhibition from the perspective of visual psychology, an emerging science, as an interdisciplinary attempt, only in interior design research. Therefore, the study of sensory process should start from its external stimuli, in order to first understand how it acts on the sensory organs to produce sensory phenomena. This paper mainly studies the visual performance of psychological factors in interior design under the background of artificial intelligence. This paper proposes a K-means clustering algorithm and a localization algorithm fused with visual and inertial navigation. The distance thresholds corresponding to the SIFT feature descriptors of threshold T1, 128D, 96D, 64D, and 32D are 170, 160, 150, and 90, respectively. This verifies that the candidate image with the highest number of matching points is considered the best matching image.",,1170
1308,35970110,Effect of mobile phase pH on liquid chromatography retention of mepartricin related compounds and impurities as support to the structural investigation by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.,"Mepartricin is a semisynthetic polyene macrolide with antifungal and anti-protozoal activities, and it is widely used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Mepartricin is produced by synthetic methyl esterification of the more toxic partricin, and its activity is due to a complex of related compounds. Among them, the main ones are mepartricin B and mepartricin A which are characterized by the presence of a primary and a secondary amine group, respectively. In this work a previously reported HPLC-UV method was properly modified to make it MS-compatible. The selected conditions entail the use of a C18 reverse phase column, and a mobile phase composed by ammonium formate and acetonitrile, with the addition of heptafluorobutyric acid as modifier. The developed method was applied to the characterization of a mepartricin reference standard and a mepartricin experimental batch. All the UV responding peaks, 30 for the standard and 21 for the experimental batch, were successfully detected by MS, allowing to define their m/z values and acquire their fragmentation spectra. For the structural elucidation of isobaric species and, in particular, the identification of toxic partricin-related impurities, the presence of differently ionisable chemical groups was considered, as partricins contain free caboxy-groups, while mepartricins represent their estherified counterparts. A deep study of the effect of mobile phase pH on the chromatographic retention of partricin and mepartricin related compounds was performed in the pH range 2.5-6.5. This study allowed to successfully cluster all the detected species and asses, in the considered batch, the absence of other partricin-related impurities in addition to partricin B and partricin A.",,1171
1954,35967653,Effects of Health Belief About COVID-19 on Knowledge Sharing: The Mediating Role of Self-Efficacy.,"While existing studies have explored factors that affect knowledge sharing among employees from different perspectives, there are still research gaps regarding whether health belief affects knowledge sharing among employees, specifically against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how such effects work. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effect of bank employees' health beliefs about COVID-19 on knowledge sharing mediated by their self-efficacy. From the perspective of social cognitive theory and the health belief model, this study investigates whether employees' perception of susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 affects formal as well as informal knowledge sharing through knowledge sharing self-efficacy. A sample of 407 bank employees (200 women and 207 men) in China was used for the study. The formulated hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping. The results showed that employees' perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 significantly undermines formal and informal knowledge sharing self-efficacy. However, there was no significant difference in the extent of its indirect effects on formal and informal knowledge sharing. Further, employees' perceived severity of COVID-19 had no effect on knowledge sharing self-efficacy and on formal and informal knowledge sharing, which could have resulted from the COVID-19 outbreak in China.",,1172
253,35982594,"Exploring the Health and Social Needs of Community Residents Using an Online Community Care Platform: Linkage to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health.","This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of the Comprehensive Health and Social Need Assessment (CHSNA) system, which identifies community residents' health and social needs, and to link these needs with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). Adult community residents in a metropolitan city in Korea were recruited. They were asked to assess their health and social needs via the CHSNA system, which was integrated into an online community-care platform. Three assessment steps (basic health assessment, needs for activities of daily living, and in-depth health assessment) associated with five ICF components were used to evaluate physical health impairment, difficulties in activities and participation, and environmental problems. The final list of health and social needs was systematically linked to the domains and categories of the ICF. Only data from participants who completed all three assessment steps were included. Wide ranges of impairments and difficulties regarding the daily living activities, physical health, and environmental status of the community were recorded from 190 people who completed assessments of their health and social needs by the CHSNA system. These participants reported various health and social needs for their community life; common needs corresponded to the ICF components of body functions and activities/participation. The ICF may be suitable for determining the health-related problems and needs of the general population. Possible improvements to the present system include providing support for completing all assessment steps and developing an ICF core set for an enhanced understanding of health and social needs.",,1173
1603,35968281,Efficacy and adverse reactions of perampanel in the treatment of epilepsy in children.,"To observe the clinical effect and adverse reactions of perampanel in the treatment of epilepsy in children. A retrospective analysis was performed on 83 children with epilepsy who were treated with perampanel in the Department of Pediatric Neurology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from April to August 2021. The treatment status, prognosis and adverse reactions were followed up. The effective rates of different age groups, different seizure types and epilepsy syndromes, and different treatment methods were statistically analyzed. The effective rate and adverse reactions of all patients were statistically analyzed. The overall effective rate of perampanel in the treatment of epilepsy was 62.03%, and there was no significant difference in the effective rate of perampanel in the treatment of epilepsy in patients of different ages (P > 0.05). The effective rates of perampanel in the treatment of focal seizures and generalized seizures were 60.38% and 65.38%, and the effective rates of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECT), BECT combined with electrical status epilepticus during sleep (ESES) and frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) were 88.89, 72.73, and 66.67%. The effective rates of monotherapy and combination therapy were 88.88 and 58.57%, respectively. The above statistical differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). In addition, the adverse reaction rate of perampanel treatment was 16.45%, including irritability, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and abnormal liver function. Perampanel has a high efficiency and controllable adverse reactions in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. This drug can be used as a reliable choice for long-term use in the treatment of epilepsy in children.",,1174
771,35975066,Optimized antibody immobilization on natural silica-based nanostructures for the selective detection of E. coli.,"This study reports for the first time the surface modification of fluorescent nanoparticles derived from geothermal silica precipitate with Escherichia coli (E. coli) antibody. The immobilization of biomolecules on the inorganic surface has been carried out using two different pathways, namely the silanization and hydrosilylation reactions. The former applied (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) as the crosslinker, while the latter used N-hydroxysuccinimide coupled with N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC/NHS). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (FESEM-EDX), and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to confirm the chemical, physical, and optical properties of the surface-modified fluorescent silica nanoparticles (FSNPs). Based on the results of the FTIR, fluorescence spectroscopy and stability tests, the modified FSNPs with EDC/NHS with a ratio of 4 : 1 were proven to provide the optimum results for further conjugation with antibodies, affording the FSNP-Ab2 sample. The FSNP-Ab2 sample was further tested as a nanoplatform for the fluorescence-quenching detection of E. coli, which provided a linear range of 102 to 107 CFU mL-1 for E. coli with a limit of detection (LoD) of 1.6 × 102 CFU mL-1. The selectivity of the biosensor was observed to be excellent for E. coli compared to that for P. aeruginosa and S. typhimurium, with reductions in the maximum fluorescence intensity at 588 nm of 89.22%, 26.23%, and 54.06%, respectively. The inorganic nanostructure-biomolecule conjugation with optimized coupling agents showed promising analytical performance as a selective nanoplatform for detecting E. coli bacteria.",,1175
254,35982593,Clinical Evaluation of Digital Therapeutics: Present and Future.,"Digital therapeutics (DTx) are software-based therapeutic interventions based on clinical evidence. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are often the source of clinical evidence, similar to conventional drugs or medical devices. However, novel approaches such as the use of real-world data or digital biomarkers are also utilized. This article aimed to review how DTx products have been clinically evaluated. DTx products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as of 2020 were reviewed and products with sufficient published information were selected. Pivotal clinical trials were analyzed according to the elements of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline. Case reviews were presented for other clinical evaluation strategies, considering the small number of publications. Most approved DTx products used RCTs for clinical evaluations. Similar to conventional RCTs, parallel-group designs with statistical hypothesis testing were adopted. However, DTx trials were often not blinded due to practical issues and involved various comparator groups. In addition, DTx products could be readily evaluated in home-based settings and delivered through the internet. Other evaluation approaches included retrospective analyses using insurance claims data or usage data, which enabled long-term evaluations of effectiveness. Digital biomarkers obtained from real-time and continuous log data were also used to improve the objectiveness of endpoints. RCTs accounted for the majority of DTx evaluations. The designs of DTx trials were comparable to those of drug or device trials, but blinding and comparator elements were often different. Furthermore, the use of real-world data and digital biomarkers are also being tried.",,1176
227,35982793,A complex interplay of evolutionary forces continues to shape ancient co-occurring symbiont genomes.,"Many insects depend on ancient associations with intracellular bacteria for essential nutrition. The genomes of these bacteria are often highly reduced. Although drift is a major driver of symbiont evolution, other evolutionary forces continue to influence them. To understand how ongoing molecular evolution and gene loss shape symbiont genomes, we sequenced two of the most ancient symbionts known, Sulcia and Nasuia, from 20 Hawaiian Nesophrosyne leafhoppers. We leveraged the parallel divergence of Nesophrosyne lineages throughout Hawaii as a natural experimental framework. Sulcia and Nasuia experience ongoing-but divergent-gene loss, often in a convergent fashion. Although some genes are under relaxed selection, purifying and positive selection are also important drivers of genome evolution, particularly in maintaining certain nutritional and cellular functions. Our results further demonstrate that symbionts experience dramatically different evolutionary environments, as evidenced by the finding that Sulcia and Nasuia have one of the slowest and fastest rates of molecular evolution known.",,1177
1033,35974586,Molecular hints of two-step transition to convective flow via streamline percolation.,"Convection is a key transport phenomenon important in many different areas, from hydrodynamics and ocean circulation to planetary atmospheres or stellar physics. However, its microscopic understanding still remains challenging. Here we numerically investigate the onset of convective flow in a compressible (non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq) hard disk fluid under a temperature gradient in a gravitational field. We uncover a surprising two-step transition scenario with two different critical temperatures. When the bottom plate temperature reaches a first threshold, convection kicks in (as shown by a structured velocity field) but gravity results in hindered heat transport as compared to the gravity-free case. It is at a second (higher) temperature that a percolation transition of advection zones connecting the hot and cold plates triggers efficient convective heat transport. Interestingly, this picture for the convection instability opens the door to unknown piecewise-continuous solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.",,1178
709,35975222,Interaction Studies Between Meloidogyne Javanica and Fusarium Oxysporum f. Sp. lycopersici (Fol) Race 3 on Different Isolines of Tomato Cv. Tasti Lee.,"The Mi gene in tomato confers resistance to Meloidogyne javanica, M. incognita, and M. arenaria, the most common tropical root-knot nematode (RKN) species found in Florida. Fusarium wilt (Fol) is another major problem in Florida tomatoes which may interact with RKN and cause more plant damage. To study the interactions between RKN, Fusarium, and Mi in tomato, two greenhouse experiments were conducted. Both experiments used different isolines (with and without I-3 and Mi genes) of the tomato cultivar Tasti Lee®. In the first experiment, all four isolines were subjected to two levels of RKN (~10,000 eggs/pot and no eggs) and two levels of Fol (1000 cc soil with 1,000 cfu/g at planting and no Fol), both applied at planting. In the second experiment, the two isolines without I-3 were exposed to the same two levels of RKN as described above and three levels of Fol (50 ml Fol with 1×106 cfu/m at planting, at 10 DAT, and no Fol). Fol reduced root-knot infection and reproduction when both Fol and RKN were inoculated at planting but not when Fol was inoculated 10 days later. Plant damage from Fol was exacerbated in the presence of RKN, especially when both pathogens were present at planting. Isolines with I-3 grew better in Fol-inoculated soil but had no effect when Fol and RKN were both present. Isolines with Mi gene reduced RKN infection and reproduction but did not affect plant damage caused by Fol. In summary, while RKN reproduction was reduced in the presence of Fol, the overall plant damage was more severe when both pathogens were present.",,1179
1040,35974579,Unified penetration depth of low-velocity intruders into granular packings.,"Penetration of intruders into granular packings is well described by separately considering the dry or wet case of granular environments in previous experiments and simulations; however, the unified description of such penetration depth in these two granular media remains elusive due to lacking clear explanations about its origins. Based on three-dimensional discrete element method simulations, we introduce a power-law fitting form of the final penetration depth of a spherical intruder with low velocity vertically penetrating into dry and wet granular packings, excellently expressed on a master curve as a power-law function of a dimensionless impact number that is defined as the square root of the ratio between the inertial stress of the intruder and the linear combination of the mean gravitational stress and the cohesive stress exerted on each grain in the packings, as a remarkable extension of the inertial number in dry granular flows. This scaling robustly provides physical insights inherent in the unified description of the material properties of granular packings and the impactor penetration conditions on the final penetration depth in the impact tests, providing evidence of impact properties in different disciplines and applications in science and engineering.",,1180
1625,35968153,Differential regulations of abscisic acid-induced desiccation tolerance and vegetative dormancy by group B3 Raf kinases in liverworts.,"Phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a key role in stomata closure, osmostress acclimation, and vegetative and embryonic dormancy. Group B3 Raf protein kinases (B3-Rafs) serve as positive regulators of ABA and osmostress signaling in the moss Physcomitrium patens and the angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana. While P. patens has a single B3-Raf called ARK, specific members of B3-Rafs among six paralogs regulate ABA and osmostress signaling in A. thaliana, indicating functional diversification of B3-Rafs in angiosperms. However, we found that the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, belonging to another class of bryophytes, has three paralogs of B3-Rafs, MpARK1, MpARK2, and MpARK3, with structural variations in the regulatory domains of the polypeptides. By reporter assays of the P. patens ark line and analysis of genome-editing lines of M. polymorpha, we found that these B3-Rafs are functionally redundant in ABA response, with respect to inhibition of growth, tolerance to desiccation and expression of stress-associated transcripts, the majority of which are under the control of the PYR/PYL/RCAR-like receptor MpPYL1. Interestingly, gemmae in gemma cups were germinating only in mutant lines associated with MpARK1, indicating that dormancy in the gametophyte is controlled by a specific B3-Raf paralog. These results indicated not only conservation of the role of B3-Rafs in ABA and osmostress response in liverworts but also functional diversification of B3-Rafs, which is likely to have occurred in the early stages of land plant evolution.",,1181
1596,35968288,Case report: First case of neuromelioidosis in Europe: CNS infection caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei.,"Neuromelioidosis is a rare CNS infection caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei and is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Our report presents the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of the first case of neuromelioidosis confirmed in Europe. A 47-year-old man with a medical history of recurrent otitis with otorrhea and fever after tympanoplasty and radical cavity revision operation on the left ear was admitted with headache, decreased level of consciousness, dysarthria, left-sided hemiparesis, and urinary incontinence. After extensive investigations including MRI, microbiological, serological, and CSF analyses, and, ultimately, brain biopsy, a diagnosis of neuromelioidosis was established. Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient showed no clinical improvement and remained in a severely compromised neurological state under mandatory mechanical ventilation. Neuromelioidosis can pose a diagnostic challenge requiring an extensive diagnostic evaluation because of its uncommon clinical and radiological presentations.",,1182
542,35978681,"Novel CA(1-7)M(2-9) Analogs: Synthesis, Characterization, and Antibacterial Evaluation.","Hybrid peptides from cecropin A and melittin have attracted the interest of the research community for decades. Here we synthesized several new analogs of the pentadecapeptide CA(1-7)M(2-9) and studied their antibacterial and hemolytic activity and tryptic stability. Single substitution of the Lys residues by Arg did not have a significant impact on the antibacterial activity of these analogs, but the substitution of the five Lys residues by Arg resulted in an increment in hemolytic activity. In contrast, the substitution of Lys residues by Orn conserved the antibacterial activity, with even lower hemolysis, and improved the enzymatic stability. The disulfide cyclic version of CA(1-7)M(2-9) was obtained by adding a Cys residue to each end of the peptide and carrying out a chemoselective thiol-disulfide interchange using sec-isoamylmecaptan as protecting group of one of these residues. This cyclic peptide showed good antibacterial activity with low hemolysis and improved enzymatic stability.",,1183
865,35974858,New-Onset Headache and Abnormal Eye Movements in a Four-Year-Old Child: Indicators of Increased Intracranial Pressure.,"A four-year-old previously healthy child presented with new-onset, diffuse, severe headache, and left sixth nerve palsy. The child was evaluated at several acute care facilities, at which the symptom of crossing eyes was not addressed specifically. At our emergency department, on day 6 of symptoms, a left cranial nerve 6 palsy was diagnosed; on brain MRI scan, there was evidence of increased intracranial pressure (distended optic nerve sheaths, flattened posterior sclerae), which was confirmed by lumbar puncture, which showed an opening pressure of >36 cm H2O. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) was diagnosed, and all symptoms abated with two months of treatment with acetazolamide. IIH should be considered in a child with headache and abnormal eye movements.",,1184
1608,35968276,Effect of atrial fibrillation on outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy and long-term ischemic recurrence in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion.,"According to the literature on anterior circulation, comorbid atrial fibrillation (AF) is not associated with a worse functional outcome, lower reperfusion rates, or higher rates of intracranial hemorrhage after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) compared to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) or treatment with supportive care. However, data are limited for the effect of comorbid AF on procedural and clinical outcomes of acute basilar artery occlusion (ABAO) after MT. This study aimed to investigate the effect of atrial fibrillation on outcomes after MT and long-term ischemic recurrence in patients with ABAO. We performed a registered study of the Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion Study (BASILAR, which is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, http://www.chictr.org.cn; ChiCTR1800014759) from January 2014 to May 2019, which included 647 patients who underwent MT for ABAO, 136 of whom had comorbid AF. Prospectively defined baseline characteristics, procedural outcomes, and clinical outcomes were reported and compared. On multivariate analysis, AF predicted a shorter puncture-to-recanalization time, higher first-pass effect rate, and lower incidence of angioplasty and/or stenting (p < 0.01). AF had no effect on intracranial hemorrhage incidence [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.093; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.451-2.652], 90-day functional outcomes (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.915; 95% CI, 0.588-1.424), or mortality (aOR, 0.851; 95% CI, 0.491-1.475) after MT. The main findings were robust in the subgroup and 1-year follow-up analyses. Comorbid AF was the remaining predictor of ischemic recurrence (aOR, 4.076; 95% CI, 1.137-14.612). The study revealed no significant difference in the safety and efficacy of MT for ABAO regardless of whether patients had comorbid AF. However, a higher proportion of patients with AF experienced ischemic recurrence within 1 year after MT.",,1185
1776,35967894,"White matter integrity in delinquent emerging adults and non-delinquent controls, and its relationship with aggression, psychopathic traits, and cannabis use.","Atypical white matter integrity may be one of the biological factors related to delinquency. In adults, decreased white matter integrity has been related to antisocial behavior, but findings from research in adolescent and young adult populations are either mixed or lacking. Here we investigated this association within a naturalistic sample of delinquent young adults (age 18-27). In a sample of 95 young adult, delinquent men and 22 age and gender matched controls, we assessed white matter integrity through fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity measures. We compared white matter integrity between the groups, and within the delinquent group assessed the association between white matter integrity and aggression, psychopathic traits, and cannabis use. We found no differences in fractional anisotropy or mean diffusivity between delinquent young adults and non-delinquent controls. Additionally, within the group of delinquent young adults, we found no associations between white matter integrity and aggression, psychopathic traits, or cannabis use. Our null findings suggest that white matter integrity differences may be unrelated to antisocial behavior in emerging adults, and/or that white matter differences between delinquent populations and controls may only arise later in life.",,1186
2325,35967053,Influences of Permeate Solution and Feed pH on Enhancement of Ammonia Recovery from Wastewater by Negatively Charged PTFE Membranes in Direct Contact Membrane Distillation Operation.,"This research investigated the feasibility of enhancing ammonia recovery from wastewater using a negatively charged poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) membrane in a direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) system. The influences of phosphate solution types (as the permeate solutions) and feed pH on ammonia recovery were analyzed. Three types of permeate solutions-DI water and two types of phosphate solutions (H3PO4 and KH2PO4)-were investigated for recovery of ammonia gas on the permeate side. From the obtained results, the H3PO4 solution was found to be the most suitable permeate solution to recover ammonia gas in the DCMD operation with the highest overall ammonia mass transfer coefficient of 7.4 × 10-5 m/s, compared to values of 1.2 × 10-5 and 2.4 × 10-5 m/s for DI water and KH2PO4 solution, respectively. Moreover, an increase in the H3PO4 concentration from 0.3 to 0.5 M in the permeate solution also could significantly enhance ammonia recovery. With an increase in the feed pH from 10.0 to 11.8, the ammonia recovery could be enhanced to 92.98% at a pH of 11.8. Liquid ammonium phosphate fertilizer could be produced by the DCMD system with the use of 0.5 M H3PO4 solution. Therefore, the DCMD process using a negatively charged PTFE membrane with an appropriate permeate solution is one of the challenging processes for ammonia recovery from wastewater to promote the circular economy concept.",,1187
1014,35974605,Statistical properties of the off-diagonal matrix elements of observables in eigenstates of integrable systems.,"We study the statistical properties of the off-diagonal matrix elements of observables in the energy eigenstates of integrable quantum systems. They have been found to be dense in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, while they are sparse in noninteracting systems. We focus on the quasimomentum occupation of hard-core bosons in one dimension and show that the distributions of the off-diagonal matrix elements are well described by generalized Gamma distributions, in both the presence and absence of translational invariance but not in the presence of localization. We also show that the results obtained for the off-diagonal matrix elements of observables in the spin-1/2 XXZ model are well described by a generalized Gamma distribution.",,1188
468,35978917,Preventive measures significantly reduced the risk of nosocomial infection in elderly inpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"In December 2019, there was an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown causes in Wuhan, China. The etiological pathogen was identified to be a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of infected patients has markedly increased since the 2019 outbreak and COVID-19 has also proven to be highly contagious. In particular, the elderly are among the group of patients who are the most susceptible to succumbing to COVID-19 within the general population. Cross-infection in the hospital is one important route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, where elderly patients are more susceptible to nosocomial infections due to reduced immunity. Therefore, the present study was conducted to search for ways to improve the medical management workflow in geriatric departments to ultimately reduce the risk of nosocomial infection in elderly inpatients. The present observational retrospective cohort study analysed elderly patients who were hospitalised in the Geriatric Department of the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China). A total of 4,066 elderly patients, who were admitted between January and March in 2019 and 2020 and then hospitalised for >48 h were selected. Among them, 3,073 (75.58%) patients hospitalised from January 2019 to March 2019 were allocated into the non-intervention group, whereas the remaining 933 (24.42%) patients hospitalised from January 2020 to March 2020 after the COVID-19 outbreak were allocated into the intervention group. Following multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk of nosocomial infections was found to be lower in the intervention group compared with that in the non-intervention group. After age stratification and adjustment for sex, chronic disease, presence of malignant tumour and trauma, both inverse probability treatment weighting and standardised mortality ratio revealed a lower risk of nosocomial infections in the intervention group compared with that in the non-intervention group. To rule out interference caused by changes in the community floating population and social environment during this 1-year study, 93 long-stay patients in stable condition were selected as a subgroup based on 4,066 patients. The so-called floating population refers to patients who have been in hospital for <2 years. Patients aged ≥65 years were included in the geriatrics program. The incidence of nosocomial infections during the epidemic prevention and control period (24 January 2020 to 24 March 2020) and the previous period of hospitalisation (24 January 2019 to 24 March 2019) was also analysed. In the subgroup analysis, a multivariate analysis was also performed on 93 elderly patients who experienced long-term hospitalisation. The risk of nosocomial and pulmonary infections was found to be lower in the intervention group compared with that in the non-intervention group. During the pandemic, the geriatric department took active preventative measures. However, whether these measures can be normalised to reduce the risk of nosocomial infections among elderly inpatients remain unclear. In addition, the present study found that the use of an indwelling gastric tube is an independent risk factor of nosocomial pulmonary infection in elderly inpatients. However, nutritional interventions are indispensable for the long-term wellbeing of patients, especially for those with dysphagia in whom an indwelling gastric tube is the most viable method of providing enteral nutrition. To conclude, the present retrospective analysis of the selected cases showed that enacting preventative and control measures resulted in the effective control of the incidence of nosocomial infections.",,1189

859,35974864,Iliopsoas Pyomyositis With Bacteremia at an Early Stage of Presentation in a Temperate Region.,"A psoas abscess, a collection of pus in the psoas muscle, is rare but the incidence is increasing with the use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pyomyositis, a muscular infection that does not lead to abscess formation, is well known as tropical pyomyositis because it is highly prevalent in tropical areas. We encountered a case of iliopsoas pyomyositis and bacteremia without abscess formation. The blood culture was positive despite the early stage of presentation and no abscess formation on MRI. Imaging is the gold standard for diagnosing iliopsoas abscesses. There are cases similar to ours wherein the blood culture is positive before the formation of an abscess. Regardless of whether an abscess is found on MRI or not, we need to consider the possibility of false negatives at the early stage of presentation. A suspicion of this disease is essential during a physical examination for early diagnosis and treatment, especially in rural areas, where medical resources are limited. Furthermore, pyomyositis is a common disease in tropical regions, but in recent years, case reports of occurrences in temperate regions have increased. This case indicates the need to consider pyomyositis as a differential diagnosis of fever and hip joint pain even in temperate regions.",,1191
329,35979714,Long-term follow-up and predictors of recurrence of Cushing's disease.,"Transsphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment for Cushing's disease to selectively remove the tumor. The rate of postoperative remission is estimated around 70%-80% in expert centers. However, the long-term remission rate is lower because of recurrence during follow-up that can be observed in 15% to 25% of the patients depending on the studies and duration of follow-up. There is no significant predictive factor of recurrence before surgery, but postoperative corticotroph insufficiency and its duration has been found to be a protective factor for recurrence in many studies. The persistence of a positive response to desmopressin after surgery is associated with a higher rate of recurrence. Long term monitoring for recurrence with annual clinical and hormonal investigations after the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis postoperative recovery is advised. The biological tests used for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome (24 h-urinary-free cortisol [UFC], late-night salivary or serum cortisol, 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test) can be used to screen for recurrence. Several studies report that increased late night cortisol and alterations of dynamic testing can be observed before the increased 24 h-UFC. For this reason it is suggested that late-night salivary cortisol would be a very sensitive tool to diagnose recurrence, pending the realization of several assays in case of borderline or discrepant result. This review will summarize the knowledge about recurrence of Cushing's disease after pituitary surgery and the current recommendations for its monitoring and diagnosis.",,1192
2404,35966949,The composite dataset of the present-day Infralittoral Prograding Wedges (IPWs) in the inner continental shelf of the Campania region (Central-Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea).,"This article reports on the dataset gathered following the census of 83 present-day Infralittoral Prograding Wedges (IPWs), surveyed on the inner continental shelf of the Central-Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea. The purpose of the census was to explore their bathymetric range and assess the observational laws governing this variability. The ensued dataset (Campania Region IPW Dataset, CRID) includes geographic, topographic and morpho-bathymetric indices, descriptive of each IPW and more, the exposure of each IPW to wave forcing (Geographical fetch, Effective fetch and extreme significant wave height, H S ). In this work, histograms contribute to describe all the variables and highlight the dominant features of each IPW. Location maps univocally links the geographic position of each IPW to the appropriate attribute record in the dataset. Further, thematic maps illustrate eight wave fields obtained by offshore-to-nearshore transformation by as many sea states scenarios with 200-year return period. Such wave fields are used as sources for significant wave height representing wave conditions over each IPW. This dataset could be implemented with new measures at a broader scale, by following analogue procedures for measurements, to enlarge the observational scale on IPWs and improve the numerical models which might eventually derive by the analysis of this dataset.",,1193
777,35975060,Ancillary ligand effects on α-olefin polymerization catalyzed by zirconium metallocene: a computational study.,"The polymerization of α-olefins catalyzed by zirconium metallocene catalyst was systematically studied through experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Having achieved an agreement between theory and experiment, it was found that the effect of the catalyst ligand on the C[double bond, length as m-dash]C insertion reaction was significantly greater than that on the β-H elimination reaction. Therefore, the molecular weight of polymers can be increased by improving the activity of the C[double bond, length as m-dash]C insertion. In addition, in comparison with propylene, the chain length of α-olefins can directly affect the stereotacticity of polymerization products, owing to steric hindrance between the polymer chain and monomer.",,1194
878,35974845,Platelet-to-Hemoglobin Ratio Is an Important Predictor of In-Hospital Mortality in Patients With ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.,"Despite effective interventional treatments, the mortality of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is still high. Several mortality predictors are known in STEMI. Platelet-to-hemoglobin ratio (PHR) is a recently used mortality parameter in cardiac or non-cardiac diseases. We aim to investigate the relationship of PHR with in-hospital mortality in patients with STEMI. Eight hundred eighty-four patients were included in the study. All of them underwent coronary intervention due to STEMI. Demographic characteristics, laboratory, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed from hospital records. A cut-off value for PHR was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Then, patients were divided into two groups PHR < 1.99 and PHR ≥ 1.99. The data of both groups were compared. The median age of the study population was 64 (54-75). Of these 633 (71.6 %) were male and 251 (28.4 %) were female. All cause mortality of the study population was 9.7% (n=86). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, PHR was independently associated with a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality for STEMI (OR: 2.645, CI: 1.641-4.263, p< 0.001). Also, age (OR: 1.044, CI: 1.021-1.067, p< 0.001), mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 87 mmHg (OR: 2.078, CI: 1.185-3.645, p= 0.011), prior coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR: 2.839, CI: 1.345-5.993, p= 0.006), anterior myocardial infarction (MI) (OR: 1.912, CI: 1.069-3.421, p= 0.029), creatinine (OR: 3.710, CI: 2.255-6.106, p<0.001), alanine transaminase (ALT) (OR: 1.004, CI: 1.001-1.007, p=0.002), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR: 1.122, CI: 1.014-1.242, p= 0.025) were determined as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. In conclusion, we found that PHR is an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with STEMI.",,1195
1643,35968131,Yield gap analysis of rainfed alfalfa in the United States.,"The United States (US) is the largest alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) producer in the world. More than 44% of the US alfalfa is produced under rainfed conditions, although it requires a relatively high amount of water compared to major field crops. Considering that yield and production of rainfed alfalfa have been relatively stagnant in the country for decades, there is a need to better understand the magnitude of yield loss due to water limitation and how far from yield potential current yields are. In this context, the main objective of this study was to estimate the current yield gap of rainfed alfalfa in the US. We collected 10 year (2009-2018) county-level government-reported yield and weather data from 393 counties within 12 major US rainfed alfalfa producing states and delineated alfalfa growing season using probabilistic approaches based on temperature thresholds for crop development. We then calculated county-level growing season rainfall (GSR), which was plotted against county-level yield to determine attainable yield (Ya) using frontier function analysis, and water-limited potential yield (Yw) using boundary function analysis. Average and potential water use efficiencies (WUE) were estimated, and associated yield gap referring to attainable (YGa) or water-limited yields (YGw) were calculated. Finally, we used conditional inference trees (CIT) to identify major weather-related yield-limiting factors to alfalfa forage yield. The frontier model predicted a mean Ya of 9.6 ± 1.5 Mg ha-1 and an associated optimum GSR of 670 mm, resulting in a mean YGa of 34%. The boundary function suggested a mean Yw of 15.3 ± 3 Mg ha-1 at the mean GSR of 672 ± 153 mm, resulting in a mean yield gap of 58%. The potential alfalfa WUE was 30 kg ha-1 mm-1 with associated minimum water losses of 24% of mean GSR, which was three times greater than the mean WUE of 10 kg ha-1 mm-1. The CIT suggested that GSR and minimum temperature in the season were the main yield-limiting weather variables in rainfed alfalfa production in the US. Our study also revealed that alfalfa was only limited by water availability in 21% of the environments. Thus, future research on management practices to narrow yield gaps at current levels of water supply is necessary.",,1196

We report a case of a young woman, who first presented to the ophthalmologist with the sudden appearance of floaters and vision reduction. Eventually, invasive haemodynamic assessment led to the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis leading to venous congestion.

448,35978942,X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy caused by maternal ABCD1 mutation and paternal X chromosome inactivation.,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the most common peroxisomal disorder. It is caused by defects in the ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) gene, resulting in impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). As an X-linked recessive disease, female X-ALD carriers are typically asymptomatic. In the present study, a 7-year-old girl was diagnosed with cerebral ALD. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed asymmetric demyelination of bilateral white matter. Plasma VLCFAs level showed a substantial increase. Whole exome and Sanger sequencing revealed an ABCD1 c.919C>T (p.Q307X) heterozygous pathogenic mutation, which was inherited from the asymptomatic mother. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) analysis revealed that the normal paternal X chromosome was almost completely inactivated. Thus, the maternal ABCD1 mutation and paternal XCI were responsible for causing the disease in the patient. XCI may be one reason female X-ALD carriers can be symptomatic.",,1199
1632,35968146,Determination of morpho-physiological and yield traits of maize inbred lines (Zea mays L.) under optimal and drought stress conditions.,"Globally, climate change could hinder future food security that concurrently implies the importance of investigating drought stress and genotype screening under stressed environments. Hence, the current study was performed to screen 45 diverse maize inbred lines for 18 studied traits comprising phenological, physiological, morphological, and yield characters under optimum and water stress conditions for two successive growing seasons (2018 and 2019). The results showed that growing seasons and water regimes significantly influenced (p < 0.01) most of the studied traits, while inbred lines had a significant effect (p < 0.01) on all of the studied traits. The findings also showed a significant increase in all studied characters under normal conditions compared to drought conditions, except chlorophyll content, transpiration rate, and proline content which exhibited higher levels under water stress conditions. Furthermore, the results of the principal component analysis indicated a notable distinction between the performance of the 45 maize inbred lines under normal and drought conditions. In terms of grain yield, the drought tolerance index (DTI) showed that Nub60 (1.56), followed by Nub32 (1.46), Nub66 (1.45), and GZ603 (1.44) were the highest drought-tolerant inbred lines, whereas Nub46 (0.38) was the lowest drought-tolerant inbred line. These drought-tolerant inbred lines were able to maintain a relatively high grain yield under normal and stress conditions, whereas those drought-sensitive inbred lines showed a decline in grain yield when exposed to drought conditions. The hierarchical clustering analysis based on DTI classified the forty-five maize inbred lines and eighteen measured traits into three column- and row-clusters, as inbred lines in cluster-3 followed by those in cluster-2 exhibited greater drought tolerance in most of the studied traits. Utilizing the multi-trait stability index (MTSI) criterion in this study identified nine inbred lines, including GZ603, as stable genotypes in terms of the eighteen studied traits across four environments. The findings of the current investigation motivate plant breeders to explore the genetic potential of the current maize germplasm, especially in water-stressed environments.",,1200
2468,35966790,Alterations of optic tract and retinal structure in patients after thalamic stroke.,"To investigate the association between degeneration of retinal structure and shrinkage of the optic tract in patients after thalamic stroke. Patients with unilateral thalamic stroke were included. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed to obtain parameters of optic tract shrinkage (lateral index) and retina structural thickness (retinal nerve fiber layer, RNFL; peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, pRNFL; ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer, GCIP), respectively. Visual acuity (VA) examination under illumination was conducted using Snellen charts and then converted to the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR). We investigated the association between LI and OCT parameters and their relationships with VA. A total of 33 patients and 23 age-sex matched stroke-free healthy controls were enrolled. Patients with thalamic stroke showed altered LI compared with control participants (P = 0.011) and a significantly increased value of LI in the subgroup of disease duration more than 6 months (P = 0.004). In these patients, LI were significantly associated with pRNFL thickness (β = 0.349, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.134-0.564, P = 0.002) after adjusting for confounders (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and lesion volume). LI and pRNFL were both significantly associated with VA in all patients (LI: β = -0.275, 95% CI: -0.539 to -0.011, P = 0.041; pRNFL: β = -0.023, 95% CI: -0.046 to -0.001, P = 0.040) and in subgroup of disease duration more than 6 months (LI: β = -0.290, 95% CI: -0.469 to -0.111, P = 0.002; pRNFL: β = -0.041, 95% CI: -0.065 to -0.017, P = 0.003). Shrinkage of the optic tract can be detected in patients with thalamic stroke, especially after 6 months of stroke onset. In these patients, the extent of optic tract atrophy is associated with pRNFL thickness, and they are both related to visual acuity changes.",,1201
118,35983314,Water Vapor and Alcohol Vapor Induced Healing of the Nanostructured KBr Surface.,"Using atomic force microscopy in the pressure range of 10-10 mbar to several tens of mbar at room temperature, we demonstrate the restructuring of nanostructured KBr surfaces assisted by the presence of water, methanol, and ethanol vapors and the formation of solvation islands. On a flat KBr surface, the two-dimensional solvation islands start nucleating at the step edges and grow with time and with increasing relative pressure. Solvation islands of water wet the terraces; however, solvation islands of methanol and ethanol are localized around the step edges and do not wet the terraces. Two processes are observed on nanostructured KBr surfaces: the movement of the atomic steps and the formation of solvation islands. The first process takes place at comparatively lower pressures at around 1% relative pressure, whereas the second process starts at higher pressures at around 25% relative pressure and above. Furthermore, the second process takes place only after the complete relocation of the step edges and thereby formation of a nearly flat surface. This implies that there is a competition between the restructuring of the atomic steps and solvation layer formation, as both processes require solvated ions. Unlike in the case of a flat surface, solvation islands of alcohols wet the restructured surface due to a higher density of low-coordination sites.",,1202
1984,35967623,Mediating and moderating effects of perceived social support on the relationship between discrimination and well-being: A study of South Koreans living in Japan.,"We examined the relationship between discrimination and mental wellbeing among South Korean residents (N = 181) in Japan. The roles of need for belonging (NTB) as a mediator and identification with one's group as a moderator of this relationship were examined. Perceived social support was also examined as both a potential moderator and mediator. We also included a measure of perceived in-group inclusion in the host society, the Circle of Ingroup Inclusion (CII), to examine its influence on the relationship between discrimination and wellbeing. Three types of coping styles-active constructive coping, passive constructive coping, and destructive coping-were controlled for in the analysis. Results showed that participants' educational level, socioeconomic status, and different coping styles predicted wellbeing; however, discrimination was the strongest (negative) predictor of wellbeing. Social support was both a moderator and mediator of the relationship between discrimination and wellbeing, suggesting that perceived social support not only buffers the negative effect of discrimination on wellbeing, but also partially explains the negative association between discrimination and wellbeing. NTB was not a significant mediator. Identification with one's ethnic group and perceived membership in one's group also did not affect the relationship. The results suggest that it is important to consider social support based on interpersonal relationships among members of minority groups in Japanese society. The psychological factors involved in acculturation processes may be different in different ethnic groups. This study calls for greater consideration of group-specific characteristics in understanding acculturation processes and interactions between groups in society.",,1203
1321,35970025,Mean-square stabilization of impulsive neural networks with mixed delays by non-fragile feedback involving random uncertainties.,"In this paper, we consider a class of neural networks with mixed delays and impulsive interferences. Firstly, a sufficient condition is given to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point of the proposed neural networks by employing the contraction mapping theorem. Secondly, we discuss the issue of the exponential stability in mean-square of the equilibrium point by a non-fragilely delayed output coupling feedback which involves stochastically occurring gain oscillations. The designed feedback input can be tolerant of limited stochastic fluctuations of control gains and be robust against potential errors caused by factors like round-off. By combining methods of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and free-weighting matrix, a delay-dependent output coupling feedback with stochastically occurring uncertainties is designed and linear-matrix-inequalities(LMIs)-based sufficient conditions for the exponential stabilization in mean square are derived. Finally, three numerical examples are presented to illustrate the feasibility of theoretical results with a benchmark real-world problem.",,1204
1586,35968298,Molecular and clinical characteristics of ATP1A3-related diseases.,"With detailed studies of ATP1A3-related diseases, the phenotypic spectrum of ATP1A3 has greatly expanded. This study aimed to potentially identify the mechanisms by which ATP1A3 caused neurological dysfunction by analyzing the clinical features and phenotypes of ATP1A3-related diseases, and exploring the distribution patterns of mutations in the subregions of the ATP1A3 protein, thus providing new and effective therapeutic approaches. Databases of PubMed, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, and Human Gene Mutation Database, Wanfang Data, and Embase were searched for case reports of ATP1A3-related diseases. Following case screening, we collected clinical information and genetic testing results of patients, and analyzed the disease characteristics on the clinical phenotype spectrum associated with mutations, genetic characteristics of mutations, and effects of drug therapy. We collected 902 clinical cases related to ATP1A3 gene. From the results of previous studies, we further clarified the clinical characteristics of ATP1A3-related diseases, such as alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC), rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism; cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss syndrome, and relapsing encephalopathy with cerebellar ataxia, frequency of mutations in different phenotypes and their distribution in gene and protein structures, and differences in mutations in different clinical phenotypes. Regarding the efficacy of drug treatment, 80 of the 124 patients with AHC were treated with flunarizine, with an effectiveness rate of ~64.5%. Nervous system dysfunction due to mutations of ATP1A3 gene was characterized by a group of genotypic-phenotypic interrelated disease pedigrees with multiple clinical manifestations. The presented results might help guide the diagnosis and treatment of ATP1A3-related diseases and provided new ideas for further exploring the mechanisms of nervous system diseases due to ATP1A3 mutations.",,1205

1579,35968306,The gesture imitation test in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease dementia.,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common type of neurodegenerative dementia following Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD). This study investigated the diagnostic role of the gesture imitation test in detecting DLB and differentiating DLB from ADD. A total of 63 patients with DLB, 93 patients with ADD, and 88 healthy controls were included in this study. All participants were administered the gesture imitation test, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the clock drawing test (CDT), and other neuropsychological tests. The patients with DLB performed worse than the healthy controls in the global scores and on every item of the gesture imitation test (p < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) for the global scores was 0.889 (p < 0.001) in differentiating the DLB and control groups. Item 4 was a better discriminator, with a sensitivity of 79.37% and a specificity of 79.55%. The AUC for the global scores decreased to 0.593 and the difference was marginal (p = 0.079) in differentiating the DLB and ADD groups. The patients with DLB performed worse on Items 1 and 4 compared with the patients with ADD (p = 0.040, 0.004). The gesture imitation test was positively correlated with the scores of the MMSE (r = 0.355, p = 0.017), the MoCA (r = 0.382, p = 0.010), and the CDT (r = 0.407, p = 0.005) in patients with DLB. The gesture imitation test is an easy, rapid tool for detecting DLB and has a role in differentiating DLB from ADD, especially in Items 1 and 4.",,1207
25,35985109,Evaluation of independent self-collected blood specimens for COVID-19 antibody detection among the US veteran population.,"Feasibility of home blood sample collection methods for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) participants was tested to determine COVID-19 infection or vaccination status. Participants (n = 312) were randomly assigned to self-collect blood specimens using the Neoteryx Mitra Clamshell (n = 136) or Tasso-SST (n = 176) and asked to rate their experience. Mitra tip blood was eluted and Tasso tubes were centrifuged. All samples were stored at -80 °C until tested with InBios SCoV-2 Detect™ IgG ELISA, BioRad Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab Assay, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assays. Participants rated both devices equally. The Abbott assay had the highest sensitivity (87% Mitra, 98% Tasso-SST) for detecting known COVID infection and/or vaccination. The InBios assay with Tasso-SST had the best sensitivity (97%) and specificity (80%) for detecting known COVID-19 infection and/or vaccination.

2407,35966943,Saudi Arabian road accident mortality and traffic safety interventions dataset (2010-2020).,"Increased traffic volumes worldwide have resulted in an increased number of road accident injuries and mortalities. This global phenomenon motivated the United Nations (UN) to initiate a decade-long global road safety plan in 2010. In response, Saudi Arabia concurrently initiated a comprehensive road safety program, supported by detailed and comprehensive road safety data for the Eastern Province (EP) of Saudi Arabia. The contributed EP-Traffic-Mortality-and-Policy-Interventions Dataset provides multidimensional road safety data for 2010-2020 via two primary and five secondary data subsets. The first primary subset provides road accident mortality data. The five secondary data subsets reflect road accident mortalities at different time scales and administrative (provincial or governorate) levels. The second primary subset provides details of traffic safety policy interventions implemented during the same period. Researchers and policymakers can use this comprehensive dataset to study accident mortality patterns across various geospatial and time scales and analyze the effectiveness of policies intended to mitigate road accident mortalities.",,1209
972,35974647,"Accuracy and performance of the lattice Boltzmann method with 64-bit, 32-bit, and customized 16-bit number formats.","Fluid dynamics simulations with the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) are very memory intensive. Alongside reduction in memory footprint, significant performance benefits can be achieved by using FP32 (single) precision compared to FP64 (double) precision, especially on GPUs. Here we evaluate the possibility to use even FP16 and posit16 (half) precision for storing fluid populations, while still carrying arithmetic operations in FP32. For this, we first show that the commonly occurring number range in the LBM is a lot smaller than the FP16 number range. Based on this observation, we develop customized 16-bit formats-based on a modified IEEE-754 and on a modified posit standard-that are specifically tailored to the needs of the LBM. We then carry out an in-depth characterization of LBM accuracy for six different test systems with increasing complexity: Poiseuille flow, Taylor-Green vortices, Karman vortex streets, lid-driven cavity, a microcapsule in shear flow (utilizing the immersed-boundary method), and, finally, the impact of a raindrop (based on a volume-of-fluid approach). We find that the difference in accuracy between FP64 and FP32 is negligible in almost all cases, and that for a large number of cases even 16-bit is sufficient. Finally, we provide a detailed performance analysis of all precision levels on a large number of hardware microarchitectures and show that significant speedup is achieved with mixed FP32/16-bit.",,1210
867,35974856,Oral Metronidazole Desensitization for Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-Mediated Hypersensitivity.,"Low efficacy has been reported for the treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis with antimicrobial agents other than the 5-nitroimidazole class. Patients with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reactions to drugs in this class, including metronidazole and tinidazole, may benefit from a desensitization treatment. We present two patients with past medical histories of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions to metronidazole who were successfully treated with metronidazole using a modified protocol. The first patient was a 39-year-old female diagnosed with trichomoniasis who had a previous reaction to metronidazole characterized by urticaria and pruritus. The second patient was a 53-year-old female who had a history of untreated trichomoniasis due to a previous anaphylactic reaction to metronidazole. Both patients were successfully treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) without signs and symptoms of the reaction. Physicians may use a desensitization protocol for patients with a presumed IgE-mediated hypersensitivity when only the 5-nitroimidazole class is efficacious for the treatment of trichomoniasis.",,1211
2057,35967507,Negative implicit in-group stereotypes of Chinese male drug abusers: evidence from ERP.,"Psychological dependence is the most important factor leading to relapse, few studies have examined whether in-group stereotypes exist in drug abusers, while it's helpful for drug abusers in getting rid of psychological dependence. To investigate the presence of in-group stereotypes and the neural mechanisms in drug abusers, two experiments were designed in this study. Experiment 1 used a classification-verification paradigm and Experiment 2 used The Extrinsic Affect Simon Task (EAST), simultaneous collection of EEG data from China. 18 and 17 males were analyzed respectively in Experiment 1 and 2. The results in Experiment 1 showed that (1) there was no significant difference in reaction times or N400 amplitude between the condition Drug abusers-Negative words and the condition Drug abusers-Positive words. In Experiment 2, we found that (2) participants in the condition Drug abusers-Negative words scored higher in accuracy rates than in the condition Drug abusers-Positive words. (3) Participants in the condition Drug abusers-Negative words were shorter than Drug abusers-Positive words in reaction times (RTs). (4) Participants in the condition Drug abusers-Negative words were lower than Drug abusers-Positive words in the peak of N400. The conclusion is that there are significant negative implicit in-group stereotypes among Chinese male drug abusers. The experimental results and the uniqueness of Chinese male drug abusers in this study were discussed.",,1212
1980,35967627,Toward a Holistic Communication Approach to an Automated Vehicle's Communication With Pedestrians: Combining Vehicle Kinematics With External Human-Machine Interfaces for Differently Sized Automated Vehicles.,"Future automated vehicles (AVs) of different sizes will share the same space with other road users, e. g., pedestrians. For a safe interaction, successful communication needs to be ensured, in particular, with vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians. Two possible communication means exist for AVs: vehicle kinematics for implicit communication and external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) for explicit communication. However, the exact interplay is not sufficiently studied yet for pedestrians' interactions with AVs. Additionally, very few other studies focused on the interplay of vehicle kinematics and eHMI for pedestrians' interaction with differently sized AVs, although the precise coordination is decisive to support the communication with pedestrians. Therefore, this study focused on how the interplay of vehicle kinematics and eHMI affects pedestrians' willingness to cross, trust and perceived safety for the interaction with two differently sized AVs (smaller AV vs. larger AV). In this experimental online study (N = 149), the participants interacted with the AVs in a shared space. Both AVs were equipped with a 360° LED light-band eHMI attached to the outer vehicle body. Three eHMI statuses (no eHMI, static eHMI, and dynamic eHMI) were displayed. The vehicle kinematics were varied at two levels (non-yielding vs. yielding). Moreover, non-matching conditions were included for both AVs in which the dynamic eHMI falsely communicated a yielding intent although the vehicle did not yield. Overall, results showed that pedestrians' willingness to cross was significantly higher for the smaller AV compared to the larger AV. Regarding the interplay of vehicle kinematics and eHMI, results indicated that a dynamic eHMI increased pedestrians' perceived safety when the vehicle yielded. When the vehicle did not yield, pedestrians' perceived safety still increased for the dynamic eHMI compared to the static eHMI and no eHMI. The findings of this study demonstrated possible negative effects of eHMIs when they did not match the vehicle kinematics. Further implications for a holistic communication strategy for differently sized AVs will be discussed.",,1213

1880,35967733,"Unleashing the mechanism among salesforce control system, salesforce ambidexterity, and emotional exhaustion to enhance the competitive advantage of organizations.","The service-sales interaction should be aligned within and outside the organization, but many companies are not harvesting the benefits of this technique. In line with the conservation of resources (COR) theory, the current research investigates the impact of the salesforce control system on salesforce ambidexterity (service and sales interface), which eventually leads to emotional exhaustion service-related performance outcomes. We assess the proposed model using cross-sectional data of 321 Pakistani salespeople from B2B organizations and employ structural equation modeling for data analysis purposes. First, the study results show that behavior-based control has an inverse influence on salesforce ambidexterity. On the other hand, outcome-based control is positively associated with salesforce ambidexterity. In addition, salesforce ambidexterity is positively linked with emotional exhaustion. However, emotional exhaustion has a negative impact on both service innovation implementation and service recovery performance. Finally, the results demonstrate the significant and positive moderating influence of self-efficacy and customer demandingness between exogenous and endogenous constructs. The study is particularly important to B2B sales organizations struggling with the difficulties of salesforce ambidexterity and how they control their sales representatives.",,1216
1685,35968087,Imaging the snorkel effect during submerged germination in rice: Oxygen supply via the coleoptile triggers seminal root emergence underwater.,"Submergence during germination impedes aerobic metabolisms and limits the growth of most higher plants. However, some wetland plants including rice can germinate under submerged conditions. It has long been hypothesized that the first elongating shoot tissue, the coleoptile, acts as a snorkel to acquire atmospheric oxygen (O2) to initiate the first leaf elongation and seminal root emergence. Here, we obtained direct evidence for this hypothesis by visualizing the spatiotemporal O2 dynamics during submerged germination in rice using a planar O2 optode system. In parallel with the O2 imaging, we tracked the anatomical development of shoot and root tissues in real-time using an automated flatbed scanner. Three hours after the coleoptile tip reached the water surface, O2 levels around the embryo transiently increased. At this time, the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an enzyme critical for anaerobic metabolism, was significantly reduced, and the coleorhiza covering the seminal roots in the embryo was broken. Approximately 10 h after the transient burst in O2, seminal roots emerged. A transient O2 burst around the embryo was shown to be essential for seminal root emergence during submerged rice germination. The parallel application of a planar O2 optode system and automated scanning system can be a powerful tool for examining how environmental conditions affect germination in rice and other plants.",,1217
2433,35966863,"Reliability, repeatability, and accordance between three different corneal diagnostic imaging devices for evaluating the ocular surface.","To evaluate repeatability, reproducibility, and accordance between ocular surface measurements within three different imaging devices. We performed an observational study on 66 healthy eyes. Tear meniscus height, non-invasive tear break-up time (NITBUT) and meibography were measured using three corneal imaging devices: Keratograph 5M (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany), Antares (Lumenis, Sidney, Australia), and LacryDiag (Quantel Medical, Cournon d'Auvergne, France). One-way ANOVAs with post hoc analyses were used to calculate accordance between the tear meniscus and NITBUT. Reproducibility was assessed through coefficients of variation and repeatability with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Reliability of meibography classification was analyzed by calculating Fleiss' Kappa Index and presented in Venn diagrams. Coefficients of variation were high and differed greatly depending on the device and measurement. ICCs showed moderate reliability of NITBUT and tear meniscus height measurements. We observed discordance between measurements of tear meniscus height between the three devices, F2, 195 = 15.24, p < 0.01. Measurements performed with Antares were higher; 0.365 ± 0.0851, than those with Keratograph 5M and LacryDiag; 0.293 ± 0.0790 and 0.306 ± 0.0731. NITBUT also showed discordance between devices, F2, 111 = 13.152, p < 0.01. Measurements performed with LacryDiag were lower (10.4 ± 1.82) compared to those of Keratograph 5M (12.6 ± 4.01) and Antares (12.6 ± 4.21). Fleiss' Kappa showed a value of -0.00487 for upper lid and 0.128 for inferior lid Meibography classification, suggesting discrete to poor agreement between measurements. Depending on the device used and parameter analyzed, measurements varied between each other, showing a difference in image processing.",,1218
1044,35974575,Decompaction wave propagation in a vibrated fine-powder bed.,"We experimentally study the crack formation and decompaction-wave propagating in a vibrated powder bed consisting of glass beads of 5 μm in diameter. The vibrated powder bed exhibits three distinct phases depending on the vibration conditions: consolidation (CS), static fracture (SF), and dynamic fracture (DF). Particularly, we found an upward wave propagation in the DF regime when the powder bed is strongly vibrated. As a remarkable feature, we found that in fine cohesive powders, the decompaction-wave propagation speed normalized to gravitational speed is independent of the shaking strength. This result implies that the wave propagation speed is governed by the balance between gravity and cohesion effect rather than vibration strength. We also explore the universality of wave propagation phenomenon in coarser and low-density granular powders.",,1219
875,35974848,Mediastinal Mass Caused by Granulomatous Reaction to Foreign Plant Material Following a Spontaneous Esophageal Rupture.,"The discovery of a mediastinal mass presents a wide array of differential diagnoses which largely depends on the boundaries of the mass and its contents. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest can determine radiologic compartmentalization to aid in diagnosis. Tissue biopsy for pathology, however, is necessary for final diagnosis. The establishment of a diagnosis should not be delayed, as mediastinal mass may be due to serious causes such as malignancy or infection. Here, we present a rare case of a 72-year-old male with a mediastinal mass that formed as a complication of traumatic esophageal perforation during cardiac arrest. Pathology revealed foreign plant material with granuloma formation secondary to food residue as the etiology of the mass.",,1220
1394,35968623,Treatment of the hook of hamate fracture with robot navigation: A note on technique.,"The aim of this study was to demonstrate a new robotic technique for the fixation of the fracture of the hook of hamate. In this retrospective study, six patients who had undergone treatment of the hook of hamate fracture with a new technique using robot navigation were included. Patients were evaluated postoperatively with flexion - extension and radial-ulnar range of wrist motion, and were measured using a goniometer. Grip strength and pinch strength were measured and compared with the contralateral wrist at the final follow-up. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Mayo Wrist Score were used to evaluate and record the recovery outcome of the wrist. Primarily, healing was achieved at 12.3 weeks postoperatively. At the final follow-up (5-22 months, average 13.1 months) the VAS score of the wrist was an average of 0.3 (0-2); the mean radial-ulnar deviation was 64.7°; the average of the flexion and extension range of motion was 141.9°; the average grip strength was 40.9 Kg; the average pinch strength was 11.8 Kg and the average Mayo Wrist Score was 95.8. This study has shown us that treatment of nondisplaced or minimal displaced fractures of the hook of the hamate with robot navigation is a viable technique with satisfactory clinical and radiological results.",,1221

714,35975182,"Peripheral artery disease: a comparison of urgent open and endovascular revascularizations on the public health system in Brazil, from 2010 to 2020.","Peripheral artery disease (PAD) has high prevalence and is associated with high risk of cardiovascular events. Surgical or endovascular intervention is necessary in chronic limb-threatening ischemia. To evaluate the distribution of open and endovascular revascularizations in different regions of Brazil, analyzing the health system costs and mortality related to these procedures. A descriptive, cross-sectional, observational, epidemiological study was carried out to evaluate open and endovascular surgeries performed on the SUS public healthcare system in Brazil, from 2010 to 2020. Data were collected from the SUS Department of Informatics (Datasus). Over the period analyzed, 83,218 admissions for open and endovascular surgeries were registered, with a total cost of R$ 333,989,523.17. There were more hospital admissions for percutaneous procedures (56,132) than for conventional surgery (27,086). Most of the procedures (83%) were performed in the country's Southeast and South regions, while the North region had the lowest number of procedures. Over the period evaluated, there was a decreasing trend for open procedures and an increasing trend for endovascular procedures. The average hospital stay was shorter for endovascular procedures (5.3 days) than for open surgery (10.2 days). The analysis of mortality related to these procedures revealed a higher rate of in-hospital mortality associated with open revascularization than with endovascular (5.24% vs. 1.56%). Endovascular techniques constituted the primary approach for revascularization treatment in critical limb-threatening ischemia, with a lower in-hospital mortality rate and shorter hospital stay when compared to open surgeries.",,1224
388,35979286,Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the liver: A case report.,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the liver is rare, and is more commonly found in the skin, rectum, cervical or inguinal lymph nodes. A 73-year-old man had been experiencing right upper quadrant discomfort for some weeks. He had a 50-year history of smoking and drinking. On average, he smoked 20 cigarettes and consumed 200 galcoholdaily. He didn't have a history of hepatitis or surgery. Fever, vomiting, jaundice, dysuria, chills, and abdominal distention were not observed at the time of admission. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant was found on physical examination, but there was no palpable abdominal mass. No obvious abnormalities in laboratory tests and tumor markers were found. The plasma retention rate of indocyanine green (ICG) at 15 min was 1.35%. Subsequent abdominal ultrasonography showed a mixed echoic mass approximately 3.8 cm diameter in the left caudate lobe of the liver. Abdominal computed tomography confirmed a 3.0 cm × 3.5 cm irregular mass with inhomogeneous density and moderate delayed enhancement in the left caudate lobe of the liver. Laparoscopic left caudate lobectomy was performed to remove the liver mass. Intra-operative findings confirmed a non-cirrhotic liver, with a 3 cm × 3.5 cm white tumor mass in the left caudate lobe with no tumor rupture and no hemoperitoneum. The resection margin was 1.0 cm in width. We describe the first case of SCC in the left caudate lobe of the liver, which was successfully treated by surgical resection and postoperative immunotherapy. No tumor recurrence was observed during the 8-mo follow-up.",,1225
1981,35967626,A global health model integrating psychological variables involved in cancer through a longitudinal study.,"The literature has shown the relevance of certain psychological variables in adjustment to cancer. However, there is a great variability, and these features could be modified through the disease process. The aim of this study is to provide an integrated and global perspective of the importance of variables such as coping, resilience, emotional control, social support, affect, and others in cancer patients through a longitudinal study, with the objective of exploring their associations and underlying interactions. The sample was composed of 71 people diagnosed with cancer who were attending psychological support at the Spanish Association Against Cancer (Biscay). We assessed the following variables in two periods of 6 months: perceived stress (PSS), emotional control (CECS), resilience (CD-RISC), coping strategies (CERQ), personality (NEOFFI), social support (MOSS), affect (PANAS), emotional distress (GHQ), quality of life (SF-12) and visual-analogic scales (EVA). Results showed predictive effects of perceived stress on physical health perception (β = -0.22; t = -3.26; p = 0.002). Mental health perception was influenced by almost all the psychological variables. Consciousness at baseline (βCo  = 0.15; p = 0.003), change in Extraversion (βEx  = 0.16; p = 0.001) and Resilience (βRe  = 0.15; p = 0.002) had significant effects on perceived mental health. This study provides a global health model that integrates and explores associations between psychological variables related to cancer disease. This information could be useful for guiding personalized psychotherapeutic interventions, with the aim of increasing adjustment to disease.",,1226
2305,35967075,Study of the Diffusion Law of Harmful Gases in Tunnel Construction on Plateaus and Optimization of Ventilation Parameters.,"To explore the diffusion law of harmful gases near the excavation face in tunnel construction on plateaus, select the optimal ventilation parameters, and improve the ventilation efficiency, Ansys Fluent was used to set the environmental parameters according to the highland, where the tunnel is located, and simulate and curve fit the diffusion phenomenon of CO and NO2 based on the fluid control equations and species transport model. The effects of air velocity, ventilation time, and duct position on the diffusion law of harmful gases were analyzed, from which the optimal ventilation conditions were selected, and the ventilation effects under the optimal conditions were compared with those under the original conditions. The study shows that after the fresh airflow passes through the outlet, part of it flows out along the tunnel wall toward the cave entrance, and the other part interacts with the return air to form a vortex; when the air supply speed is 10 m/s and the distance from the duct outlet to the excavation face is 25 m, the maximum concentration of harmful gases decreases by 92-99% after 20 min of ventilation compared with that before optimization and the smoke exhaust efficiency increases by 2.5% per minute.",,1227
1224,35971489,Applications of epithelial thickness mapping in corneal refractive surgery.,"In this review, we discuss the applications of epithelial thickness mapping in corneal refractive surgery. The review describes that the epithelial thickness profile is nonuniform in the normal eye, being thinner superiorly than inferiorly and thinner temporally than nasally. It is postulated that this is due to the eyelid forces and blinking action on the superior cornea. Changes in the epithelial thickness profile have been found to be highly predictable, responding to compensate for changes in the stromal curvature gradient, using the eyelid as an outer template. This leads to characteristic changes in the epithelial thickness profile that can be used for early screening in keratoconus, postoperative monitoring for early signs of corneal ectasia, and for determining whether further steepening can be performed without the risk of apical syndrome following primary hyperopic treatment. Compensatory epithelial thickness changes are also a critical part of diagnosis in irregular astigmatism as these partially mask the stromal surface irregularities. The epithelial thickness map can then be used to plan a trans-epithelial photorefractive keratectomy treatment for cases of irregularly irregular astigmatism.",,1228
765,35975072,Peptide therapeutics in the management of metastatic cancers.,"Cancer remains a leading health concern threatening lives of millions of patients worldwide. Peptide-based drugs provide a valuable alternative to chemotherapeutics as they are highly specific, cheap, less toxic and easier to synthesize compared to other drugs. In this review, we have discussed various modes in which peptides are being used to curb cancer. Our review highlights specially the various anti-metastatic peptide-based agents developed by targeting a plethora of cellular factors. Herein we have given a special focus on integrins as targets for peptide drugs, as these molecules play key roles in metastatic progression. The review also discusses use of peptides as anti-cancer vaccines and their efficiency as drug-delivery tools. We hope this work will give the reader a clear idea of the mechanisms of peptide-based anti-cancer therapeutics and encourage the development of superior drugs in the future.",,1229
2374,35966999,Non-adherence to psychiatric medication in adults experiencing homelessness is associated with incurred concussions.,"This study investigated the relationship between concussions and medication adherence among 247 adults experiencing homelessness in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, who were prescribed medication for a psychiatric disorder. Participants were asked whether they had ever experienced a blow to the head that caused a concussion, and medication adherence was measured by asking participants whether they had taken their psychiatric medication yesterday. The data were analyzed using univariate and multivariable logistic regressions. Results showed that more than half of the sample had a concussion history (61.9%), and homeless adults with a concussion history had higher odds of non-adherence to psychiatric medications compared with those who reported no concussion history [OR = 2.13 (95% CI = 1.08, 4.18)]. Findings suggest that medication non-adherence is associated with incurred concussions. Raising awareness among service providers of the relationship between traumatic brain injury and medication adherence may increase efforts to improve adherence in this underserved population.",,1230
213,35982807,Role of 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography in Predicting Residual Disease Posttreatment Completion in Retinoblastoma Patients.,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit and brain is the preferred imaging modality to diagnose and define extent of disease as well as to assess response to therapy. Sometimes, it may be difficult to differentiate the presence of active residual disease from therapy-related changes based on posttreatment completion MRI. RB patients who completed treatment between January 2017 and October 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. We evaluated the utility of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) to predict active disease in RB patients who continued to have residual disease on MRI at completion of treatment. Out of the 89 patients who completed treatment, dilemma regarding remission status was present in 11 children. All 11 patients underwent FDG-PET-CT. None of them had evidence of metabolically active disease in the orbit, optic nerve, brain, or rest of the body. After a median follow-up of 24 months, no children developed any evidence of disease progression in the form of local or distant relapse. Our results showed that in MRI doubtful cases, a nonavid FDG-PET is reassuring in avoiding further therapy as long as close follow-up can be ensured. FDG-PET-CT may emerge as a useful functional modality to predict disease activity in RB.",,1231
1790,35967865,Establishment of a rapid diagnosis method for Candida glabrata based on the ITS2 gene using recombinase polymerase amplification combined with lateral flow strips.,"Candida glabrata is the second or third most common Candida-associated species isolated from hospital-acquired infections, surpassing even C. albicans in some hospitals. With the rapid progression of the disease course of C. glabrata infections, there is an urgent need for a rapid and sensitive on-site assay for clinical diagnosis. Isothermal amplification is a recently developed method for rapid nucleic acid detection that is being increasingly used for on-site detection, especially recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). RPA combined with lateral flow strips (LFS) can rapidly amplify and visually detect the target gene within 20 min. The whole detection process can be controlled within 30-60 min by rapid sample pre-treatment. In this study, RPA-LFS was used to amplify the internal transcribed spacer region 2 gene of C. glabrata. The primer-probe design was optimized by introducing base mismatches (probe modification of one base) to obtain a highly specific and sensitive primer-probe combination for clinical sample detection. RPA-LFS was performed on 23 common clinical pathogens to determine the specificity of the assay system. The RPA-LFS system specifically detected C. glabrata without cross-reaction with other fungi or bacteria. Gradient dilutions of the template were tested to explore the lower limit of detection of this detection system and to determine the sensitivity of the assay. The sensitivity was 10 CFU/µL, without interference from genomic DNA of other species. The RPA-LFS and qPCR assays were performed on 227 clinical samples to evaluate the detection performance of the RPA-LFS system. Eighty-five samples were identified as C. glabrata, representing a detection rate of 37.5%. The results were consistent with qPCR and conventional culture methods. The collective findings indicate a reliable molecular diagnostic method for the detection of C. glabrata, and to meet the urgent need for rapid, specific, sensitive, and portable clinical field-testing.",,1232
1883,35967729,The relationship between distributed leadership and teacher innovativeness: Mediating roles of teacher autonomy and professional collaboration.,"Principals' distributed leadership plays a critical role in teacher innovativeness; however, research evidence regarding the relationship between them is limited. This study aims at examining the effect of distributed leadership on teacher innovativeness as well as the mediating roles of teacher autonomy and professional collaboration. Using the data of 132,376 teachers derived from the 2018 Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), the study applied a structural equation model (SEM) for analysis. The results revealed that distributed leadership had positive direct effects on teacher innovativeness, teacher autonomy, and professional collaboration. Meanwhile, teacher autonomy and professional collaboration significantly mediated the effect of distributed leadership on teacher innovativeness, respectively. Practical implications are discussed, school leaders are expected to adopt distributed leadership style and establish a supportive school environment, and individual teachers are supposed to cultivate a culture of collectivism and make effective use of autonomy in their teaching innovation.",,1233
1220,35971493,Effect of eyeliner and mascara use on tear film and meibomian glands.,"This study was conducted to see whether eyeliner, mascara, or combined eyeliner and mascara (EM) use affects tear production, tear film stability, and meibomian gland (MG) loss. Two hundred and twenty healthy women underwent noninvasive tear break-up time (NTBUT) measurement, meibography, and Schirmer testing. Study groups were no makeup (NM) group, eyeliner-only group, mascara-only group, and those who used both EM. The one-way analysis of variance test was used for group comparisons. Chi-square test was used for meiboscale comparison. NTBUT (seconds) results were 11.5 ± 4.8 (no makeup), 21.3 ± 69 (eyeliner only), 21.8 ± 6.5 (mascara only), and 22.5 ± 7.0 (eyeliner-mascara). The differences between groups were significant (P < 0.0001). All makeup groups (eyeliner only, mascara only, eyeliner-mascara) had significantly diminished values compared with NM group (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively). Schirmer test (millimeters) results were 22.7 ± 6.4 (NM group), 21.3 ± 6.9 (eyeliner only), 21.8 ± 6.5 (mascara only), and 22.5 ± 7.0 (eyeliner-mascara) with no significant differences between groups (P = 0.66). Meiboscale grading revealed that NM group had significantly lower values of MG loss compared with eyeliner-only (EO) (P = 0.01), mascara-only (MO) (P = 0.002), and eyeliner-mascara groups (P = 0.007). There were no significant differences between EO and MO (P = 0.31), EO and eyeliner-mascara (P = 0.39), or MO and eyeliner-mascara groups (P = 0.91). None of the makeup groups had changes in Schirmer wetting. All eye cosmetic groups have significant changes of NTBUT and meibography compared with NM subjects, and yet combined use of EM does not affect ocular surface more adversely than their separate use.",,1234

The genus Longidorus comprise a group of species, some of which are vectors of plant viruses. New sampling for needle nematodes was carried out in a grapevine area in Thessaloniki, northern Greece, and one nematode species of Longidorus (L. leptocephalus) was recovered. Nematodes were extracted from soil samples by modified sieving and a decanting method. Extracted specimens were processed using glycerol, mounted on permanent slides, and subsequently identified morphologically. Nematode DNA was extracted from individual, live specimens, and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) assays were performed for D2-D3 expansion segments of 28S rRNA, ITS1 rRNA, and partial mitochondrial COI regions. Morphology and morphometric data obtained from this population were consistent with the original description and reported populations of L. leptocephalus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of L. leptocephalus in Greece and the second in the Mediterranean Basin after the record of the species from Slovenia, extending the geographical distribution of this species in Europe.",,1235
622,35977442,Whole genome analysis in APOE4 homozygotes identifies the DAB1-RELN pathway in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.,"The APOE-ε4 allele is known to predispose to amyloid deposition and consequently is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. There is debate as to whether the APOE gene accounts for all genetic variation of the APOE locus. Another question which remains is whether APOE-ε4 carriers have other genetic factors influencing the progression of amyloid positive individuals to AD. We conducted a genome-wide association study in a sample of 5,390 APOE-ε4 homozygous (ε4ε4) individuals (288 cases and 5102 controls) aged 65 or over in the UK Biobank. We found no significant associations of SNPs in the APOE locus with AD in the sample of ε4ε4 individuals. However, we identified a novel genome-wide significant locus associated to AD, mapping to DAB1 (rs112437613, OR = 2.28, CI = 1.73-3.01, p = 5.4 × 10-9). This identification of DAB1 led us to investigate other components of the DAB1-RELN pathway for association. Analysis of the DAB1-RELN pathway indicated that the pathway itself was associated with AD, therefore suggesting an epistatic interaction between the APOE locus and the DAB1-RELN pathway.",,1236
1072,35974547,Bistability in orbital trajectories of a chiral self-propelled particle interacting with an external field.,"In this paper, the dynamics of a self-propelled stochastic particle under the influence of an axisymmetric light field is experimentally studied. The particle under consideration has the main characteristic of carrying a light sensor in an eccentric location. For the chosen experimental conditions, the emerging trajectories are orbital, and, more interestingly, they suggest the existence of bistability. A mathematical model incorporating the key experimental components is introduced. By means of numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, it is found that, in addition to the orbiting behavior, the sensor location could produce trapped or diffusive behaviors. Furthermore, the study reveals that stochastic perturbation and the eccentric location of the sensor are responsible for inducing bistability in the orbital trajectories, supporting experimental observations.",,1237
782,35975055,Manufacturing silica aerogel and cryogel through ambient pressure and freeze drying.,"Achieving a mesoporous structure in superinsulation materials is pivotal for guaranteeing a harmonious relationship between low thermal conductivity, high porosity, and low density. Herein, we report silica-based cryogel and aerogel materials by implementing freeze-drying and ambient-pressure-drying processes respectively. The obtained freeze-dried cryogels yield thermal conductivity of 23 mW m-1 K-1, with specific surface area of 369.4 m2 g-1, and porosity of 96.7%, whereas ambient-pressure-dried aerogels exhibit thermal conductivity of 23.6 mW m-1 K-1, specific surface area of 473.8 m2 g-1, and porosity of 97.4%. In addition, the fiber-reinforced nanocomposites obtained via freeze-drying feature a low thermal conductivity (28.0 mW m-1 K-1) and high mechanical properties (∼620 kPa maximum compressive stress and Young's modulus of 715 kPa), coupled with advanced flame-retardant capabilities, while the composite materials from the ambient pressure drying process have thermal conductivity of 28.8 mW m-1 K-1, ∼200 kPa maximum compressive stress and Young's modulus of 612 kPa respectively. The aforementioned results highlight the capabilities of both drying processes for the development of thermal insulation materials for energy-efficient applications.",,1238
969,35974650,Modulation instability of an electromagnetic wave interacting with a counterpropagating electron beam under condition of cyclotron resonance absorption.,"In this paper, transmission of a monochromatic wave through a counterpropagating electron beam under the condition of cyclotron resonance absorption is studied by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Conditions of the modulation instability (MI) are analyzed. The MI strongly affects the regimes of transmission. We also derive explicit periodic stationary solutions expressed in terms of elliptic Jacobi functions, as well as bright- and dark-soliton solutions. Analysis of these solutions allows obtaining threshold values of the driving power and frequency for the different regimes of transmission, such as cyclotron absorption, multifrequency self-modulation oscillations, and stationary single-frequency propagation. The theoretical predictions are verified by numerical simulation. In this way, we obtain the conditions at which a continuous-wave driving signal disintegrates into a close-to-periodic train of microwave soliton pulses.",,1239
2347,35967029,Facile and Controllable Synthesis of CuS@Ni-Co Layered Double Hydroxide Nanocages for Hybrid Supercapacitors.,"The synthesis of battery-type electrode materials with hollow nanostructures for high-performance hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) remains challenging. In this study, hollow CuS@Ni-Co layered double hydroxide (CuS-LDH) composites with distinguished compositions and structures are successfully synthesized by co-precipitation and the subsequent etching/ion-exchange reaction. CuS-LDH-10 with uniformly dispersed CuS prepared with the addition of 10 mg of CuS shows a unique hollow polyhedral structure constituted by loose nanosphere units, and these nanospheres are composed of interlaced fine nanosheets. The composite prepared with 30 mg of CuS addition (CuS-LDH-30) is composed of a hollow cubic morphology with vertically aligned nanosheets on the CuS shell. The CuS-LDH-10 and CuS-LDH-30 electrodes exhibit high specific capacity (765.1 and 659.6 C g-1 at 1 A g-1, respectively) and superior cycling performance. Additionally, the fabricated HSC delivers a prominent energy density of 52.7 Wh kg-1 at 804.5 W kg-1 and superior cycling performance of 87.9% capacity retention after 5000 cycles.

The global, regional, and national sex-specific YLD numbers, crude YLD rates, and age-standardized YLD rates of NPB-related moderate and severe vision loss and blindness were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The Wilcoxon test and linear regression were used to investigate the relationship between sex difference in age-standardized YLD rates and the Human Development Index (HDI). Between 1990 and 2019, the gender disparity in age-standardized YLD rates for NPB-related vision impairment remained stable, increasing from 10.2 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 6.7-14.6] to 10.4 (95% UI 6.9-15.0) for men and 10.3 (95% UI 6.8-14.7) to 10.7 (95% UI 7.2-15.1) for women, with women consistently having higher age-standardized YLD rates. Between the ages of 25 and 75, women had higher YLD rates than males, with the biggest disparity in the 60-64 age group. In 2019, sex difference in age-standardized YLD rates across 195 nations was statistically significant. Women had higher age-standardized YLD rates than men in both low ( Z = -3.53, p < 0.001) and very high HDI countries (Z = -4.75, p < 0.001). Additionally, age-standardized YLD rates were found to be adversely associated with HDI (male: Standardized β = -0.435, female: Standardized β = -0.440; p < 0.001). Despite advancements in worldwide NPB health care, sexual differences in NPB-related vision impairment burden showed little change. Female had higher burden than male, particularly in low and very high socioeconomic status countries.",,1241
1115,35974504,Tropical approximation to finish time of activity networks.,"We breakdown complex projects into activities and their logical dependencies. We estimate the project finish time based on the activity durations and relations. However, adverse events trigger delay cascades shifting the finish time. Here I derive a tropical algebraic equation for the finish time of activity networks, encapsulating the principle of linear superposition of exogenous perturbations in the tropical sense. From the tropical algebraic equation I derive the finish time distribution with explicit reference to the distribution of exogenous delays and the network topology and geometry.",,1242
1658,35968116,Multi-dimensional variables and feature parameter selection for aboveground biomass estimation of potato based on UAV multispectral imagery.,"Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an essential assessment of plant development and guiding agricultural production management in the field. Therefore, efficient and accurate access to crop AGB information can provide a timely and precise yield estimation, which is strong evidence for securing food supply and trade. In this study, the spectral, texture, geometric, and frequency-domain variables were extracted through multispectral imagery of drones, and each variable importance for different dimensional parameter combinations was computed by three feature parameter selection methods. The selected variables from the different combinations were used to perform potato AGB estimation. The results showed that compared with no feature parameter selection, the accuracy and robustness of the AGB prediction models were significantly improved after parameter selection. The random forest based on out-of-bag (RF-OOB) method was proved to be the most effective feature selection method, and in combination with RF regression, the coefficient of determination (R2) of the AGB validation model could reach 0.90, with root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and normalized RMSE (nRMSE) of 71.68 g/m2, 51.27 g/m2, and 11.56%, respectively. Meanwhile, the regression models of the RF-OOB method provided a good solution to the problem that high AGB values were underestimated with the variables of four dimensions. Moreover, the precision of AGB estimates was improved as the dimensionality of parameters increased. This present work can contribute to a rapid, efficient, and non-destructive means of obtaining AGB information for crops as well as provide technical support for high-throughput plant phenotypes screening.",,1243
1353,35969504,Intermediate Outcomes of Orbital Wall Reconstruction Using Different Alloplastic Materials: Which Is Ideal?,"Despite the popularity and superiority of resorbable alloplastic materials in orbital fracture reconstruction, it is unclear whether the reconstructed wall is maintained after implant resorption. Although unsintered hydroxyapatite/poly-L-lactide (u-HA/PLLA) is one such material, it is different from conventional materials for the replacement of natural bones. Therefore, this study investigated the intermediate-term safety and efficacy of u-HA/PLLA implants compared to those of implants made with other alloplastic materials. We retrospectively analyzed 240 eligible patients who underwent orbital fracture reconstruction with one alloplastic material between January 2006 and October 2018. Materials used for treatment were as follows: u-HA/PLLA sheet in 101 patients; u-HA/PLLA mesh in 38 patients; poly-L-lactic acid (PLA)/poly-glycolic acid (PGA) mesh in 47 patients; silicone sheet in 35 patients; and titanium mesh in 19 patients. Intermediate-term follow-up was performed for a median duration of 48.2 months. A chart review was performed. Postoperative complications and factors affecting them were studied. Reconstructed area deformities were assessed using computed tomography. Postoperative complications occurred significantly more frequently in patients reconstructed with the silicone sheet than in those reconstructed with the u-HA/PLLA sheet. Deformities were found for the silicone sheet (28.6%) and PLA/PGA mesh (31.9%). These deformity rates were significantly higher than those for the u-HA/PLLA sheet. Compared to other alloplastic materials, u-HA/PLLA has low rates of postoperative complications and reconstructed area deformities. Because of its complete absorption, clinicians should consider using u-HA/PLLA as an alloplastic material for orbital wall reconstruction.",,1244
1606,35968278,The pathophysiology of motor fatigue and fatigability in multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous immune mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Fatigue is one of the most common and disabling symptom of MS. It interferes with daily activities on the level of cognition and motor endurance. Motor fatigue can either result from lesions in cortical networks or motor pathways (primary fatigue) or it may be a consequence of detraining with subsequent adaptions of muscle and autonomic function. Programmed exercise interventions are used frequently to increase physical fitness in MS-patients. Studies investigating the effects of training on aerobic capacity, objective endurance and perceived fatigability have yielded heterogenous results, most likely due to the heterogeneity of interventions and patients, but probably also due to the non-uniform pathophysiology of fatigability among MS-patients. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the pathophysiology of motor fatigability with special reference to the basic exercise physiology that underlies our understanding of both pathogenesis and treatment interventions.",,1245
1913,35967696,Supporting the well-being of new university teachers through teacher professional development.,"Over the last decades, changes within higher education have created increased pressure and uncertainty for academics, increasing their risk for cognitive, behavioral, physical, as well as psychological issues due to high job demands. Specifically, for new academics in teaching roles, their lack of knowledge and skills can contribute to a negative effect of these job demands on their well-being. This study therefore explored how teaching-related professional development programs can enhance new university teachers' well-being, through semi-structured interviews with 10 university teachers participating in such a program at a mid-sized Dutch university. We pay special attention to the relationship between specific learning activities integrated in the program (such as learning communities, formal workshops, and reflecting) and various dimensions of the psychological model of well-being by Ryff and Keyes (such as self-acceptance, autonomy, environmental mastery, and positive relationships). Using co-occurrence analysis and content analysis, we found that different learning activities had distinct relationships with different well-being facets. For example, formal workshops were mainly related to environmental mastery, a purpose in life and personal growth, while reflecting seemed to be especially connected to teachers' self-acceptance, and participating in a learning community was mainly related to positive relations with others and personal growth. Our findings have implications for research on teacher well-being as well as for the design of professional development programs for higher education teaching staff.",,1246
261,35982568,Paired denitrifying bioreactors with wide orientation for increased drainage flow capacity.,"Denitrifying bioreactors are a conservation drainage practice for reducing nitrate loads in subsurface agricultural drainage. Bioreactor hydraulic capacity is limited by cross-sectional area perpendicular to flow through the woodchip bed, with excess bypass flow untreated. Paired bioreactors with wide orientations were built in 2017 in Illinois, USA, to treat drainage from a relatively large 29 ha field. The paired design consisted of: a larger, Main bioreactor (LWD: 6.1 × 18.3 × 0.9 m) for treating base flow, and 2) a smaller, Booster bioreactor (7.8 × 13.1 × 0.9 m) receiving bypass flow from the Main bioreactor during periods of high flow. Over three years of monitoring, the paired bioreactor captured 84-92% of the annual drainage discharge which demonstrated an expanded cross-sectional area could improve bioreactor flow capture, even for a large drainage area. However, the paired bioreactors removed 6-28% of the annual N load leaving the field (1.8-5.6 kg N ha-1 removed; 52-161 kg N), which was not a notable improvement compared to bioreactors treating smaller drainage areas. The design operated as intended at low annual flow-weighted hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of usually ≤2 h, but these short HRTs ultimately limited bioreactor nitrate removal efficiency. Daily HRTs of <2 h often resulted in nitrate flushing. The Main bioreactor had higher hydraulic loading as intended and was responsible for the majority of flow captured in each year although not always the most nitrate mass removal. The Booster bioreactor provided better nitrate removal than the Main at HRTs of 3.0-11.9 h, possibly due to its drying cycles which may have liberated more available carbon. This new design approach tested at the field-scale illustrated tradeoffs between greater flow capacity (via increased bioreactor width) and longer HRT (via increased length), given a consistent bioreactor surface footprint.",,1247
2449,35966843,Whole genome sequencing of the multidrug-resistant Chryseobacterium indologenes isolated from a patient in Brazil.,"Chryseobacterium indologenes is a non-glucose-fermenting Gram-negative bacillus. This emerging multidrug resistant opportunistic nosocomial pathogen can cause severe infections in neonates and immunocompromised patients. This study aimed to present the first detailed draft genome sequence of a multidrug-resistant C. indologenes strain isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of an infant hospitalized at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Brazilian Tertiary Hospital. We first analyzed the susceptibility of C. indologenes strain to different antibiotics using the VITEK 2 system. The strain demonstrated an outstanding resistance to all the antibiotic classes tested, including β-lactams, aminoglycosides, glycylcycline, and polymyxin. Next, C. indologenes was whole-genome-sequenced, annotated using Prokka and Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology (RAST), and screened for orthologous groups (EggNOG), gene ontology (GO), resistance genes, virulence genes, and mobile genetic elements using different software tools. The draft genome contained one circular chromosome of 4,836,765 bp with 37.32% GC content. The genomic features of the chromosome present numerous genes related to cellular processes that are essential to bacteria. The MDR C. indologenes revealed the presence of genes that corresponded to the resistance phenotypes, including genes to β-lactamases (bla IND-13, bla CIA-3, bla TEM-116, bla OXA-209, bla VEB-15), quinolone (mcbG), tigecycline (tet(X6)), and genes encoding efflux pumps which confer resistance to aminoglycosides (RanA/RanB), and colistin (HlyD/TolC). Amino acid substitutions related to quinolone resistance were observed in GyrA (S83Y) and GyrB (L425I and K473R). A mutation that may play a role in the development of colistin resistance was detected in lpxA (G68D). Chryseobacterium indologenes isolate harbored 19 virulence factors, most of which were involved in infection pathways. We identified 13 Genomic Islands (GIs) and some elements associated with one integrative and conjugative element (ICEs). Other elements linked to mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as insertion sequence (ISEIsp1), transposon (Tn5393), and integron (In31), were also present in the C. indologenes genome. Although plasmids were not detected, a ColRNAI replicon type and the most resistance genes detected in singletons were identified in unaligned scaffolds. We provided a wide range of information toward the understanding of the genomic diversity of C. indologenes, which can contribute to controlling the evolution and dissemination of this pathogen in healthcare settings.",,1248
1092,35974527,When stochasticity leads to cooperation.,"The evolution of cooperation has gained more attention after Smith introduced game theory in the study of evolutionary biology. Subsequent works have extensively explained this phenomenon, consistently showing the importance of spatial structure for the evolution of cooperation. Here we analyze the effect of stochasticity on the evolution of cooperation in group-structured populations. We find a simple formula for the fixation probability of cooperators and show that cooperation can be favored by selection if a condition similar to Hamilton's rule is satisfied, which is also valid for strong selection and high migration. In fact, cooperation can be favored even in the absence of population viscosity and in the limit of an infinite number of finite-size groups. We discuss the importance of stochastic fluctuations in helping cooperation. We argue that this may be a general principle because fluctuations favoring the cooperators are often much more impactful than those favoring the defectors.",,1249
674,35975538,Biochemical Factors Affecting Thrombosis Development in Permanent Tunneled Hemodialysis Catheter.,"It is critical to clarify the biochemical factors associated with thrombosis development following tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) insertion. The study involved retrospective analysis of charts of patients hospitalized for permanent TDC placement between 2013 and 2020 in a tertiary academic center. Patients undergoing a hemodialysis schedule with permanent TDC for more than three months were included in the study. To determine predictive factors associated with thrombosis development in permanent TDC, patients were assigned to one of two groups, according to the extent of thrombosis. The groups were compared in terms of demographic characteristics, blood test values, complication and length of follow-up period. A total of 350 patients (204 female, 146 male) were enrolled into the study. In patients with thrombosis the mean BMI was found significantly higher (p = 0.001) and presence of diabetes mellitus was significantly common (p = 0.014). Patients with thrombosis had significantly higher D-dimer (6.5 vs. 2.4 µg/mL, p = 0.001) and procalcitonin levels (4.1 vs. 1.4 ng/mL, p = 0.001). Additionally, patients with thrombosis had a significantly higher rate of infective complications (p = 0.014). Logistic regression analysis revealed that BMI > 30 kg/m2 and infective complications increased thrombosis risk 3.842 and 3.104 times (p = 0.004 and p = 0.038, respectively). Additionally, D-dimer level > 3 µg/mL and procalcitonin level > 2 ng/mL were significantly associated with the development of thrombosis (p = 0.001 and p = 0.007). The present study demonstrated that the presence of infection, higher BMI > 30 kg/m2, D-dimer level > 3 µg/mL and procalcitonin level > 2 ng/mL were found to increase the incidence of thrombosis.",,1250
1109,35974510,Shear viscosity and Stokes-Einstein violation in supercooled light and heavy water.,"We report shear viscosity of heavy water supercooled 33K below its melting point, revealing a 15-fold increase compared to room temperature. We also confirm our previous data for the viscosity of supercooled light water and reach a better accuracy. Our measurements, based on the spontaneous Brownian motion of 350nm spheres, disagree at the lowest temperature with the only other available data, based on Poiseuille flow in a narrow capillary, which may have been biased by electro-osmotic effects. Here we provide a detailed description of the experiment and its analysis. We review the literature data about dynamic properties of water (viscosity, self-diffusion coefficient, and rotational correlation time), discuss their temperature dependence, and compare their decoupling in the two isotopes.",,1251
2304,35967076,Enhanced Photocatalytic Degradation with Sustainable CaO Nanorods Doped with Ce and Cellulose Nanocrystals: In Silico Molecular Docking Studies.,"This research work intends to evaluate the photoactivity of calcium oxide (CaO) nanorods (NRs) doped with cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and cerium (Ce). CNC-doped CaO and Ce/CNC codoped CaO were synthesized via the sol-gel technique. Structural, optical, morphological, physiochemical, phase constitution, and functional group evaluations were performed. The photodegradation of the prepared nanostructures was analyzed by observing photodegradation of a mixture of methylene blue and ciprofloxacin dye under light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of the dye was drastically enhanced upon codoping in CaO. For both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, statistically significant inhibitory zones (p < 0.05) were achieved in the case of CNCs and pristine and codoped CaO. Furthermore, in silico molecular docking studies (MDS) were accomplished against DNA gyrase from nucleic acid biosynthesis and enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (FabI) from the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway to rationalize the possible mechanism behind these antibacterial activities.",,1252
1698,35968072,Political views and science literacy as indicators of vaccine confidence and COVID-19 concern.,"The distrust, delay and refusal of vaccinations represent serious threats to global public health. As demonstrated by the dramatic worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, adequate vaccine coverage against infectious diseases is essential towards the preservation and function of virtually every aspect of our society. While the determinants of vaccine hesitancy and pandemic concern have been widely investigated, conflicting evidence exists with regards to their association with education levels and political views. This study aimed to investigate whether science literacy levels and standpoint on social and economic matters are associated with different levels of vaccine confidence and COVID-19 concern. An online survey was circulated amongst participants recruited via convenience sampling, and data were analysed using non-parametric statistical tests. The survey (n = 389) highlighted that participants who studied Science at General Certificate of Secondary Education level have a lower vaccine confidence than those with both lower and higher levels of science education. Participants with neutral/centrist political views expressed lower confidence than those with a libertarian social stance or a left-wing economic stance. A higher concern with the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with lower levels of science education, libertarian social views, and left-wing economic views. The present study provides novel insight on the educational and political factors associated with vaccine hesitancy and pandemic concern within a British population sample.",,1253
1310,35970098,Applied nutritional investigation spatial variation and determinants of stunting among children aged less than 5 y in Ethiopia: A spatial and multilevel analysis of Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey 2019.,"Stunting is a major global public health problem, associated with physical and cognitive impairments. Spatial variations in childhood stunting were observed due to changes in contextual variables from area to area, implying that geography is a crucial component in the development of strategies against childhood stunting. However, to our knowledge, there are no up-to-date studies on the distribution of childhood stunting and its determinants in Ethiopia. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution and determinants of stunting among children aged <5 y in Ethiopia. Geospatial and multilevel analysis of the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2019 data was done to investigate the spatial distribution and determinants of stunting among children aged <5 y in Ethiopia. The analysis included 5753 weighted children aged <5. Spatial autocorrelations analysis was done to assess the spatial dependency of stunting. Hot spot and cluster outlier analysis was used to observe the spatial clustering of stunting. Kriging interpolation was used to predict stunting in an unsampled area. A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted to identify determinants of stunting. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated and variables having a P < 0.05 were declared statistically significant. The national prevalence of stunting was 36.81% (95% CI, 35.48%-38.15%), with significant spatial variations across Ethiopia. Spatial clustering of stunting was detected in the northern, northwestern, northeastern, and southwestern parts of Ethiopia. Age and sex of the child, birth interval, birth type, household wealth status, maternal education, region, and community-level illiteracy were factors significantly associated with stunting. Stunting significantly varies across Ethiopia, with the highest prevalence in Northern Ethiopia. Older age, poor family wealth, maternal illiteracy, and community illiteracy level were the significant determinants of stunting in children aged <5 y in this study. Policymakers should design interventions to reduce stunting among children aged <5 y through accessing education for women and applying economic empowerment strategies in the hot spot areas.",,1254
494,35978788,The Psychological Mechanisms Underlying Solomon's Paradox: Impact of Mood and Self-Transcendence.,"Solomon's paradox of wise reasoning, in which performance of wisdom differs when reasoning on an issue in one's own life vs. another's life, has been supported by robust evidence. However, the underlying psychological mechanism remains unclear. This asymmetry of wise reasoning may be explained by the different mindsets of self-transcendence when people reason about various conflicts (personal vs. others'), and mood should play a fundamental role. To explore this issue, three hundred ninety-nine participants were recruited to test a hypothesized model. The results supported the effect of Solomon's paradox-that is, participants endorsed wise-reasoning strategies more strongly when resolving others' social conflicts than their own. Further mediation analysis showed that the sequential mediation model was supported. Solomon's paradox can be explained by the difference in positive affect and self-transcendence when reasoning about the two conflicts. This study directly verifies the mediating role of self-transcendence in Solomon's paradox. At the same time, reasoning about personal affairs reduces individuals' self-transcendence mindset, and positive affect can explain the differences. These results are helpful for understanding and effectively avoiding Solomon's wisdom dilemma.",,1255

1447,35968451,Disease burden and long-term trends of urinary tract infections: A worldwide report.,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections worldwide, but little is known about their global scale and long-term trends. We aimed to estimate the spatiotemporal patterns of UTIs' burden along with its attributable risk factors at a global level, as well as the variations of the burdens according to socio-demographic status, regions, nations, sexes, and ages, which may be helpful in guiding targeted prevention and treatment programs. Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 were analyzed to depict the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of UTIs in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019 by socio-demographic status, nations, region, sex, and age. Globally, 404.61 million cases, 236,790 deaths, and 520,200 DALYs were estimated in 2019. In particular, 2.4 times growth in deaths from 1990 to 2019 was observed, along with an increasing age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) from 2.77/100,000 to 3.13/100,000. Age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) was consistently pronounced in regions with higher socio-demographic index (SDI), which presented remarkable upward trends in ASMR and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR). In contrast, countries with a low SDI or high baseline burden achieved a notable decline in burden rates over the past three decades. Although the ASIR was 3.6-fold higher in females than males, there was no sex-based difference in ASMR and ASDR. The burden rate typically increased with age, and the annual increasing trend was more obvious for people over 60 years, especially in higher SDI regions. The burden of UTIs showed variations according to socio-demographic status, nation, region, sex, and age in the last three decades. The overall increasing burden intimates that proper prevention and treatment efforts should be strengthened, especially in high-income regions and aging societies.",,1257
417,35979217,Emotional intelligence and self-esteem: Personal competencies necessary for physicians.,"Even though emotional intelligence and self-esteem are truly important variables in healthcare, the fact is that there are few studies on these constructs in Spanish physicians. The objective was to analyze the relationship between self-esteem and emotional intelligence in Spanish physicians, and their relationship with sociodemographic and employment variables. The study included a sample of 180 physicians with a mean age of 34.61, 76.7% of whom were women. The physician completed the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, the Brief Emotional Intelligence Inventory for Senior Citizens and a questionnaire on sociodemographic and work characteristics through a CAWI (Computer Assisted Web Interviewing). The results showed that the interpersonal factor of emotional intelligence diminished with age and number of children. Furthermore, women scored significantly higher in interpersonal emotional intelligence and men in adaptability. Physicians with stable contracts (46.1%) scored higher in all the emotional intelligence variables, with almost a small effect size. In the relationship between self-esteem and emotional intelligence, it was found that global self-esteem of physicians was positively related to the Stress Management, Adaptability and Mood dimensions. Physicians with high self-esteem (72.8%) showed better Stress Management and Mood than those with low self-esteem (6.1%), while in the Adaptability factor, physicians with high global self-esteem scored higher than those with medium levels (21.1%). The need for a stable employment strategy was demonstrated, since this has repercussions on personal competencies of physicians as well as training in developing those consequences, since they improve physicians' quality of care and leadership, especially women with temporary contracts or with medium or low self-esteem.",,1258
1916,35967693,Role of Self-Efficacy and Resistance to Innovation on the Demotivation and Insufficient Learning Capabilities of Preservice English Normal Students in China.,"Learning capabilities among students are the crucial element for the student's success in learning a particular language, and this phenomenon needs recent studies. The current study examines the impact of self-efficacy and resistance to innovation on the demotivation and insufficient learning capabilities of preservice English normal students in China. The current research also investigates the mediating impact of demotivation among self-efficacy, resistance to innovation, and insufficient learning capabilities. The questionnaires were employed by the researchers to gather the data from chosen respondents. The preservice English students are the respondents of the study. These are selected using purposive sampling. These questionnaires were forwarded to them by personal visits. The researchers have sent 690 surveys but only received 360 surveys and used them for analysis. These surveys represented a 52.17% response rate. The SPSS-AMOS was applied to test the relationships among variables and also test the hypotheses of the study. The results revealed that self-efficacy and resistance to innovation have a significant and a positive linkage with demotivation and insufficient learning capabilities. The findings also indicated that demotivation significantly mediates self-efficacy, resistance to innovation, and insufficient learning capabilities. The article helps the policymakers to establish the regulations related to the improvement of learning capabilities using innovation adoption and motivation of the students.",,1259
1333,35969937,On the microstructures of the bulk of P3HT amorphous films obtained from two protocols: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations.,"An influential factor for the microstructure of semiconductor polymer films is the solvent chosen for their processing and subsequent performance as an active layer in electronic and optical devices. In this paper, we address the solvent-polymer interplays by reporting a comparison between the microstructure of the bulk of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) films formed from two different simulation methodologies: using the o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) as an aggregation chain parameter and a solvent-free protocol. In comparison to the length of an ideal planar chain, the solvent caused an average reduction of 12% of oligomer chains. Whereas, in the other film, the reduction was around 30%. Furthermore, the solvent allowed pathways of π-interactions due to the cohesional-like distribution of the chains, indicating that the solvent also induces chain orientation affecting its microstructure.",,1260
263,35982565,"Effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on lake environmental dynamics: A case study in Lake Bosten Catchment, NW China.","Arid and semiarid regions account for ∼ 40% of the world's land area. Rivers and lakes in these regions provide sparse, but valuable, water resources for the fragile environments, and play a vital role in the development and sustainability of local societies. During the late 1980s, the climate of arid and semiarid northwest China dramatically changed from warm-dry to warm-wet. Understanding how these environmental changes and anthropogenic activities affect water quantity and quality is critically important for protecting aquatic ecosystems and determining the best use of freshwater resources. Lake Bosten is the largest inland freshwater lake in NW China and has experienced inter-conversion between freshwater and brackish status. Herein, we explored the long-term water level and salinity trends in Lake Bosten from 1958 to 2019. During the past 62 years, the water level and salinity of Lake Bosten exhibited inverse W-shaped and M-shaped patterns, respectively. Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) suggested that the decreasing water level and salinization during 1958-1986 were mainly caused by anthropogenic activities, while the variations in water level and salinity during 1987-2019 were mainly affected by climate change. The transformation of anthropogenic activities and climate change is beneficial for sustainable freshwater management in the Lake Bosten Catchment. Our findings highlight the benefit of monitoring aquatic environmental changes in arid and semi-arid regions over the long-term for the purpose of fostering a balance between socioeconomic development and ecological protection of the lake environment.",,1261
1878,35967735,"Multifactorial approaches to study bilingualism in the aging population: Past, present, future.","A better understanding and more reliable classification of bilinguals has been progressively achieved through the fine-tuning methodology and simultaneously optimizing the measurement tools. However, the current understanding is far from generalization to a larger population varying in different measures of bilingualism-L2 Age of acquisition (L2 AOA), L2 usage and exposure, and L2 proficiency. More recent studies have highlighted the importance of modeling bilingualism as a continuous variable. An in-depth look at the role of bilingualism, comparing groups, may be considered a reductionist approach, i.e., grouping based on one measure of bilingualism (e.g., L2 AOA) may not account for variability in other measures of bilingualism (L2 exposure, L2 use or L2 proficiency, amongst others) within and between groups. Similarly, a multifactorial dimension is associated with cognitive performance, where not all domains of cognition and subcomponents are equally influenced by bilingualism. In addition, socio-cultural and demographical factors may add another dimension to the impact of bilingualism on cognitive performance, especially in older adults. Nevertheless, not many studies have controlled or used the multiple socio-cultural and demographical factors as a covariate to understand the role of different aspects of bilingualism that may influence cognitive performance differently. Such an approach would fail to generalize the research findings to a larger group of bilinguals. In the present review paper, we illustrate that considering a multifactorial approach to different dimensions of bilingual study may lead to a better understanding of the role of bilingualism on cognitive performance. With the evolution of various fine-tuned methodological approaches, there is a greater need to study variability in bilingual profiles that can help generalize the result universally.",,1262
755,35975082,Electrochemical performance of CoSe2 with mixed phases decorated with N-doped rGO in potassium-ion batteries.,"Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have received much attention as next-generation energy storage systems because of their abundance, low cost, and slightly lower standard redox potential than lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Nevertheless, they still face great challenges in the design of the best electrode materials for applications. Herein, we have successfully synthesized nano-sized CoSe2 encapsulated by N-doped reduced graphene oxide (denoted as CoSe2@N-rGO) by a direct one-step hydrothermal method, including both orthorhombic and cubic CoSe2 phases. The CoSe2@N-rGO anodes exhibit a high reversible capacity of 599.3 mA h g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 in the initial cycle, and in particular, they also exhibit a cycling stability of 421 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g-1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that CoSe2 with N-doped carbon can greatly accelerate electron transfer and enhance the rate performance. In addition, the intrinsic causes of the higher electrochemical performance of orthorhombic CoSe2 than that of cubic CoSe2 are also discussed.",,1263
1201,35971796,Randomized clinical trials comparing antibiotic therapy with appendicectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis: meta-analysis.,"This aim of this study was to provide an updated meta-analysis comparing antibiotic therapy with appendicectomy in adults (16 years or older) with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. A search for randomized clinical trials comparing antibiotic therapy with appendicectomy in adults with uncomplicated acute appendicitis from inception to 3 October 2021 in MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL with no language constraints was performed. Studies were excluded if they included paediatric participants or those with complicated appendicitis. Data on complications of treatment, treatment efficacy (defined in the antibiotic group as not undergoing appendicectomy within 1 year of enrolment, versus surgery without complications or no negative histology in the appendicectomy group), readmissions, and length of stay (LOS) were presented. Eight RCTs involving 3203 participants (1613 antibiotics/1590 appendicectomy; 2041 males/1162 females) were included. There was no significant benefit of antibiotic treatment on complication rates (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95 per cent c.i. 0.41 to 1.04). Antibiotics had a reduced treatment efficacy compared with appendicectomy (RR 0.75, 95 per cent c.i. 0.63 to 0.89). Antibiotic treatment at 1 year was successful in 1016 of 1613 (62.9 per cent) participants. There was a six-fold increase in hospital readmissions within 1 year of enrolment in participants receiving antibiotic treatment (RR 6.28, 95 per cent c.i. 2.87 to 13.74). There was no difference in index admission LOS (mean difference 0.15 days (95 per cent c.i. -0.05 to 0.35)). Earlier optimism regarding the benefits of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis does not persist at the same level now that further, large trials have been included. If antibiotic treatment is to be offered routinely as first-line therapy, patients should be counselled appropriately.",,1264
803,35975022,Individual and joint effects of borderline ankle-brachial index and high plasma total homocysteine on all-cause death in hypertensive adults.,"The cardiovascular hazards of total homocysteine (tHcy) are long known. In addition, despite the acknowledgment on the importance of low ankle-brachial index (ABI) (< 0.9), borderline ABI (0.91-0.99) was once commonly overlooked. This study aims to explore the independent and joint effect of tHcy level and borderline ABI on all-cause death in hypertensive population. This study included 10,538 participants from China H-type Hypertension Registry Study. ABI was described into two groups: normal ABI (1.00-1.40) and borderline ABI. tHcy level was also divided into two groups: < 15.02 and ≥ 15.02 μmo/L. Four groups were analyzed, using COX proportional hazard regression model, separately and pairwise to observe the independent and joint effect on all-cause death. A total of 126 (1.2%) deaths were observed in the 1.7 years follow-up time. Borderline ABI has a higher predicted risk of death than normal ABI (HR = 1.87, 95%CI: 1.17-3.00) after adjusting for potential covariates. Compare with tHcy level < 15.02 μmo/L (low tHcy), those with tHcy ≥ 15.02 μmo/L (high tHcy) had higher risk to event outcome (HR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.30-3.05). According to the cumulative hazard curve, group with borderline ABI and high tHcy level has significantly higher altitude and larger increasing rate over follow-up period compare to other groups. Among those with borderline ABI, participants with high tHcy had higher death risk than those with low tHcy, nevertheless, no significant different between borderline and normal ABI among those with low tHcy levels. Borderline ABI and tHcy level both have independent predictive value on all-cause death. The combined group of borderline ABI and high tHcy has highest risk factor of outcomes, which suggested the mutual additive value of borderline ABI and tHcy. More attention should be given to the importance of borderline ABI in hypertensive population, especially with elevated tHcy level.",,1265
191,35982851,Autocrine/Paracrine Slit-Robo Signaling Controls Optic Lobe Development in Drosophila melanogaster.,"Cell segregation mechanisms play essential roles during the development of the central nervous system (CNS) to support its organization into distinct compartments. The Slit protein is a secreted signal, classically considered a paracrine repellent for axonal growth through Robo receptors. However, its function in the compartmentalization of CNS is less explored. In this work, we show that Slit and Robo3 are expressed in the same neuronal population of the Drosophila optic lobe, where they are required for the correct compartmentalization of optic lobe neuropils by the action of an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. We characterize the endocytic route followed by the Slit/Robo3 complex and detected genetic interactions with genes involved in endocytosis and actin dynamics. Thus, we report that the Slit-Robo3 pathway regulates the morphogenesis of the optic lobe through an atypical autocrine/paracrine mechanism in addition to its role in axon guidance, and in association with proteins of the endocytic pathway and small GTPases.",,1266
1342,35969707,Potential application of urease and nitrification inhibitors to mitigate emissions from the livestock sector: a review.,"Human activities have caused an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in climate change that affects many factors of human life including its effect on water and food quality in certain areas with implications for human health. CH4 and N2O are known as potent non-CO2 GHGs. The livestock industry contributes to direct emissions of CH4 (38.24%) and N2O (6.70%) through enteric fermentation and manure treatment, as well as indirect N2O emissions via NH3 volatilization. NH3 is also a secondary precursor of particulate matter. Several approaches have been proposed to address this issue, including dietary management, manure treatment, and the possibility of inhibitor usage. Inhibitors, including urease and nitrification inhibitors, are widely used in agricultural fields. The use of urease and nitrification inhibitors is known to be effective in reducing nitrogen loss from agricultural soil in the form of NH3 and N2O and can further reduce CH4 as a side effect. However, the effectiveness of inhibitors in livestock manure systems has not yet been explored. This review discusses the potential of inhibitor usage, specifically of N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide, dicyandiamide, and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate, to reduce emissions from livestock manure. This review focuses on the application of inhibitors to manure, as well as the association of these inhibitors with health, toxicity, and economic benefits.",,1267
1037,35974582,Inertial active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle in the presence of a magnetic field.,"We consider an inertial active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle in an athermal bath. The particle is charged, constrained to move in a two-dimensional harmonic trap, and a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane of motion. The steady-state correlations and the mean-square displacement are studied when the particle is confined as well as when it is set free from the trap. With the help of both numerical simulation and analytical calculations, we observe that inertia plays a crucial role in the dynamics in the presence of a magnetic field. In a highly viscous medium where the inertial effects are negligible, the magnetic field has no influence on the correlated behavior of position as well as velocity. In the time asymptotic limit, the overall displacement of the confined harmonic particle gets enhanced by the presence of a magnetic field and saturates for a stronger magnetic field. On the other hand, when the particle is set free, the overall displacement gets suppressed and approaches zero when the strength of the field is very high. Interestingly, it is seen that in the time asymptotic limit, the confined harmonic particle behaves like a passive particle and becomes independent of the activity, especially in the presence of a very strong magnetic field. Similarly, for a free particle the mean-square displacement in the long time limit becomes independent of activity even for a longer persistence of noise cor- relation in the dynamics.",,1268
1959,35967648,Healthy and sustainable development of sports economy based on artificial intelligence and mental model.,"In recent years, sports have achieved rapid development worldwide, and the global economy has been significantly improved and improved. With the in-depth development of the two, the connection between sports and the economy has also become closer. Sports economy is a new type of economic form bred by specialization of sports organization, participation in consumerization, and profit-oriented operation under the condition of market economy. And the development of sports economy cannot be developed at once; it needs healthy and sustainable development. In order to find a better way to study the healthy and sustainable development of sports economy, this paper uses deep learning network algorithm and supports vector machine learning algorithm to build a mental model. It then uses the model to analyze various indicators of the sports industry in a province in China. This article is looking for information and summarizes the province's sports data from 2017 to 2021. The sports indicators of this experiment include regional GDP, total output of sports industry, sports practitioners, local financial sports expenditures, the number of policies, the number of people participating in physical exercise, and fitness venues and facilities. The realization results show that these variables develop at a relatively small rate under normal conditions, and then predict the data in the next few years under the healthy and sustainable development of the next few years through the mental model. The growth rates of various indicators of the sports economy have increased significantly, and they have been optimized by about 20% compared with the normal development.",,1269
1045,35974574,Optimal charging of open spin-chain quantum batteries via homodyne-based feedback control.,"We study the problem of charging a dissipative one-dimensional XXX spin-chain quantum battery using local magnetic fields in the presence of spin decay. The introduction of quantum feedback control based on homodyne measurement contributes to improving various performances of the quantum battery, such as energy storage, ergotropy, and effective space utilization rate. For the zero-temperature environment, there is a set of optimal parameters to ensure that the spin-chain quantum battery can be fully charged and the energy stored in the battery can be fully extracted under the perfect measurement condition, which is found through the analytical calculation of a simple two-site spin-chain quantum battery and further verified by numerical simulation of a four-site spin-chain counterpart. For completeness, the adverse effects of imperfect measurement, anisotropic parameter, and finite temperature on the charging process of the quantum battery are also considered.",,1270
470,35978914,Sternum length norms in Han youngsters in central China.,"The sternum is one of the most important components of the chest wall. However, to the best of our knowledge, at present there is no reference value of the sternum length in normal Han Chinese children that has been published in the literature. The aim of the present study was therefore to establish the reference value of sternum length in a normal Han Chinese population of different ages and sex groups. Chest computed tomography scans and three-dimensional reconstruction images of 1,080 individuals who were younger than 18 years old and without congenital or acquired structural anomalies or congenital metabolic diseases were retrospectively reviewed. The length of the sternum was measured for each individual and comparisons of the sternum length according to sex were conducted using the Mann-Whitney test. Age or region group comparisons were performed using the ANOVA test, and the association between the length of the sternum and age was assessed by regression analysis. A significant association between the age (x) of the individual and the length of the sternum (y) was confirmed, although different regression patterns were identified for the sexes (the regression equation for males was y=5.616x+60.408; P<0.001; R2=0.890, whereas that for females was y=-0.134x2+6.543x+56.805; P<0.001, R2=0.890). No significant differences in sternum length were identified between the sexes for subjects aged 1-13 years old, whereas significant differences were observed comparing the sexes of the subjects aged 14-18 years old. In conclusion, the present study revealed that the length of the sternum in normal Han Chinese children can be precisely estimated by the age of the child using our formulae for the different sexes (where the most-fit formulae for the two sexes are different). This knowledge can be applied clinically in chest wall deformity assessment, and in surgery planning.",,1271
1015,35974604,Fluctuation properties of the eigenfrequencies and scattering matrix of closed and open unidirectional graphs with chaotic wave dynamics.,"We present experimental and numerical results for the fluctuation properties in the eigenfrequency spectra and of the scattering matrix of closed and open unidirectional quantum graphs, respectively. Unidirectional quantum graphs, that are composed of bonds connected by reflectionless vertices, were introduced by Akila and Gutkin [Akila and Gutkin, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 48, 345101 (2015)1751-811310.1088/1751-8113/48/34/345101]. The nearest-neighbor spacing distribution of their eigenvalues was shown to comply with random-matrix theory predictions for typical chaotic systems with completely violated time-reversal invariance. The occurrence of short periodic orbits confined to a fraction of the system, that lead in conventional quantum graphs to deviations of the long-range spectral correlations from the behavior expected for typical chaotic systems, is suppressed in unidirectional ones. Therefore, we pose the question whether such graphs may serve as a more appropriate model for closed and open chaotic systems with violated time-reversal invariance than conventional ones. We compare the fluctuation properties of their eigenvalues and scattering matrix elements and observe especially in the long-range correlations larger deviations from random-matrix theory predictions for the unidirectional graphs. These are attributed to a loss of complexity of the underlying dynamic, induced by the unidirectionality.",,1272
269,35982555,Assessing the synergies and trade-offs of development projects in response to climate change in an urban region.,"A synthesis of the complex relationships, including synergies and trade-offs, between urban development projects and climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives can ensure that all these relationships are taken into consideration. We used a systems approach and applied an impact matrix and chain effect analysis methods to projects in the highly urbanized Taipei metropolitan region to identify the influences and effects between urban development projects and climate change objectives. Three types of urban plans and projects were analyzed: flood control, transportation, and urban planning. The magnitudes of the influences and effects between these projects and plans were derived through interviews with experts familiar with Taipei's urban development. This pilot study found no synergy in the response to climate change mitigation and adaptation for the urban development projects analyzed. The current standalone policies and plans related to urbanization in Taipei have resulted in trade-offs for flood control and public transit projects because they contribute positively toward one climate objective but negatively impact another. A high-level policymaking mechanism that ensures coordination and collaboration between different sectors is needed to supervise sectoral policies. Prior to the approval and implementation of a plan, policymakers should request the assessment of synergies and trade-offs between plans and projects to ensure a synergistic effect to climate change issues. This study confirms that the strategy from individual sector in a metropolitan region will result in trade-off between climate change issues is a global problem. This paper also strengthens the concept that the assessment of synergy/trade-offs between policy and plans should be conducted using systemic approach.",,1273
267,35982557,"China 6 moving average window method for real driving emission evaluation: Challenges, causes, and impacts.","The light-duty moving average window (MAW) method, used for China 6 real driving emission (RDE) calculation, is quite complex with various boundaries. Previous research noticed that the MAW might underestimate the calculation results, while the reasons for this underestimation haven't been studied systematically. With 29 vehicles tested in 10 cities and different boundaries applied for calculation, this study quantitively analyzed the problem, causes, and impacts of the light-duty MAW method. The instantaneous utilization factor (IUF) is proposed for reason analysis. The current MAW method could weaken the supervision of real driving tests as more than 75% of the tests underestimated MAW results, with the largest underestimation being around 100%. The data exclusion could lead to biased MAW results. But without the exclusion, the MAW result couldn't always get an increase due to the IUF and window weighting factor variation. With the extended factors removed, the MAW result bias is significantly reduced. The MAW will lead to a lower IUF of the data at the start/end of the tests, and when the cold-start data is considered, this low utilization must be noticed. The effect from the data exclusion, extended factors, and the window characteristics are closely coupled and they should be taken into consideration simultaneously to consummate the calculation method. The current drift-check progress couldn't effectively monitor the portable emission measurement system (PEMS), especially during the tests. The MAW result might lead to unreasonable emission limits and the emission inventory. Relevant policy based on these results might be implausible.",,1274
1594,35968290,"Stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic: Case numbers, treatments, and mortality in two large German stroke registries.","At the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an alarming decline in hospitalizations for stroke was reported in several countries, including Germany. We assessed hospitalization numbers and indicators of the quality of stroke care in 2020 during the pandemic containment measures. The analysis was based on data of two large stroke quality assurance registries in the north and the south of Germany (Qualitätssicherung Schlaganfall Nordwestdeutschland and Bayerische Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Qualitätssicherung in der stationären Versorgung). We included 395 hospitals with 467,931 documented cases in 2018-2020. The time interval between admission and thrombolysis, frequency of systemic thrombolysis and intra-arterial therapy (IAT), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission and in-hospital mortality were assessed. Changes in the second (Q2) and fourth (Q4) quarters of 2020 were compared to corresponding quarters in 2019 by chi-squared tests. Hospitalization numbers decreased in the two stroke registries by 8% and 10% in Q2 of 2020 and by 5% and 15% in Q4 of 2020 compared to the same quarters in 2019, respectively. The decline was particularly seen in women and patients with transient ischemic attacks. In cases with cerebral infarction, no increase in NIHSS scores on admission was observed, and the proportion of patients with a time interval between admission and thrombolysis of ≤60 min was unchanged. No clear pattern was found in the frequency of systemic thrombolysis and IAT. In one of the registries, in-hospital mortality of patients with cerebral infarction increased in Q2 of 2020 compared to Q2 of 2019. Case numbers slightly decreased under pandemic conditions, while our quarterly analysis indicated that the quality of stroke care was largely unchanged throughout the year 2020.",,1275
770,35975067,Expedient approach for trans-esterification of β-keto esters under solvent free conditions using silica supported boric acid (SiO2-H3BO3) as a recyclable catalyst.,"A highly efficient trans-esterification of β-keto methyl/ethyl esters with primary, secondary, allylic, benzylic and chiral alcohols has been carried out in excellent yields under solvent-free conditions using silica supported boric acid as a heterogeneous catalyst. The surface morphology of the silica-boric acid catalyst (fresh and recycled) has been characterized by SEM and EDX techniques. This sustainable protocol resulted in a remarkable enhancement in the synthetic efficiency (87-95% yield) with high purity and eliminating the use of an environmentally toxic solvent. The work up procedure is very simple and the catalyst has been successfully recovered and recycled. The present methodology is also applicable for trans-esterification with chiral alcohols on a multi-gram scale without compromising the yield. Noteworthy features of this protocol are simple operational procedure, minimizing production of chemical waste, mild reaction conditions, easy preparation of the catalyst and its recyclability up to five cycles without any appreciable loss of catalytic activity.",,1276
2422,35966874,Selective endothelial removal: A case series of a phase I/II surgical trial with long-term follow up.,"Peters anomaly is a congenital condition which results in a central corneal opacity from birth. Selective Endothelial Removal (SER) is a novel surgical technique and a form of regenerative therapy, which encourages clearance of the central corneal opacity by the patient's own corneal endothelial cells, and it may potentially be beneficial for the treatment of Peters anomaly. We have performed a phase I/II surgical trial, evaluating the safety of SER in four eyes (three patients) with Peters Anomaly. These patients underwent SER at between 9 and 39 months of age, each demonstrating clearance of central corneal opacities and improvements in vision post-operatively. No complications occurred in any of these eyes, at a minimal post-operative follow-up duration of 48 months. We conclude that SER for Peters anomaly is a safe surgical procedure. While encouraging efficacy outcomes have been observed, these findings should be further evaluated in a larger scale Phase II/III surgical trial.",,1277
740,35975110,Radiology of the Mesentery.,"The recent description and re-classification of the mesentery as an organ prompted renewed interest in its role in physiological and pathological processes. With an improved understanding of its anatomy, accurately and reliably assessing the mesentery with non-invasive radiological investigation becomes more feasible. Multi-detector computed tomography is the main radiological modality employed to assess the mesentery due to its speed, widespread availability, and diagnostic accuracy. Pathologies affecting the mesentery can be classified as primary or secondary mesenteropathies. Primary mesenteropathies originate in the mesentery and subsequently progress to involve other organ systems (e.g., mesenteric ischemia or mesenteric volvulus). Secondary mesenteropathies describe disease processes that originate elsewhere and progress to involve the mesentery with varying degrees of severity (e.g., lymphoma). The implementation of standardized radiological imaging protocols, nomenclature, and reporting format with regard to the mesentery will be essential in improving the assessment of mesenteric anatomy and various mesenteropathies. In this article, we describe and illustrate the current state of art in respect of the radiological assessment of the mesentery.",,1278
578,35978509,Unwelcome prevalence of leishmaniasis with several other infectious diseases.,"Co-infection among leishmaniasis and other infectious diseases is common among natural populations especially in the endemic areas of the disease. It depends on the environmental factors, vector availability, host-parasite interactions and above all geographical boundaries. Leishmaniasis being an immunosuppressive disease empowers the invading opportunistic infections to invade and successfully colonize. A variety of infections coexist with leishmaniasis like HIV, leprosy, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis etc. With the different pathology and immune status, co-infection in most cases leads to disease severity and increased mortality.Inevitably, co-infection increases the complexity and poses a threat in the cure and control programmes. This is the first review which highlights the existing co-infections of leishmaniasis with other infectious diseases. The review also focuses on the immunology of co-infections together, diagnosis and the treatment options available for treating such cases. With the changing environment and the overlapping endemic areas of leishmaniasis with other diseases, it becomes difficult to treat a disease without accurate diagnosis. Thus, the review insists on the need for more research on development of newer and differential diagnostic methods for co-infected individuals with theoverlapping symptoms.",,1279
1161,35973710,"Kratom exposures managed by the British Columbia poison centre, 2012-2019: a descriptive analysis.","Kratom, a plant indigenous to Southeast Asia, which has been used both recreationally and in the treatment of pain and opioid dependence, has received little scrutiny in the United States and almost none in Canada. We analyzed calls to the British Columbia poison centre to describe caller-declared exposures to kratom and the acute health effects of these exposures. For this descriptive analysis, we accessed electronic records, including transcriptions and extracted variables, of calls specifying kratom exposure managed by the BC Drug and Poison Information Centre (DPIC) from 2012 to 2019. We describe changes in case numbers, reasons for exposure, concurrent drug exposures and clinical outcomes over the study period. We identified 32 cases during the study period. In 23 cases (72%), the DPIC was consulted by a health care worker. Case numbers increased from 0 in 2012 to 9 in 2019. Numbers were highest for males in their 20s (n = 17, 53%). A total of 27 cases (84%) involved ingestion, with online distributors and local stores named as sources of procurement. A concurrent drug exposure was identified in 13 (41%) cases. There were no deaths; in 1 case, the exposed individual was intubated to manage agitation following kratom withdrawal. We observed a steady increase in kratom-related poison centre calls from 2012 to 2019, especially in young adult males. Rising call numbers may reflect increasing availability of kratom and may be a consequence of BC's opioid crisis, with kratom used by some to lessen symptoms of opioid withdrawal.",,1280
1746,35967996,Development of an equation to screen for solar hemorrhages from digital cushion ultrasound texture analysis in veal calves at slaughter.,"Claw disorders are a relevant welfare issue in the cattle industry, fast and accurate diagnoses are essential for successful treatment and prevention. The present study aimed to develop an equation to assess the presence of solar hemorrhages from real-time ultrasound images texture analysis at slaughter. Eighty-eight hind feet were collected at the slaughterhouse from 44 Holstein male veal calves. The claws were trimmed by a veterinarian hoof-trimmer, approximately 30 min after the calves' slaughter, and classified into healthy and affected by solar hemorrhages. At the same time, ultrasound images were collected for each claw. Sole soft tissues' thickness was measured, and texture analysis was performed using MaZda software. The resulting parameters from sole soft tissues' measurements and texture analysis were screened with a stepwise linear discriminant analysis using the absence or presence (0/1) of solar hemorrhages as the dependent variable. Results from the stepwise analysis identified 9 variables (among 279) as predictors, and an equation was developed and used to predict the presence or absence of solar hemorrhages on the scanned claws by binary measure: values ≤0.5 counted as 0, while those >0.5 as 1. Validation of the equation was performed by testing predicted lesions (LESpred) against the clinically evaluated lesions (LESeval) with a confusion matrix, a ROC analysis, and a precision-recall curve. Results of the present study suggest that the equation proposed has a good potential for detecting effectively hemorrhages of the sole by ultrasound imaging texture means, and could be used to monitor unsatisfactory housing and management conditions at the farm level, and for early management intervention and prevention.",,1281
1465,35968433,Epidemiology of malaria and anemia in high and low malaria-endemic North-Eastern districts of India.,"Anemia and malaria are the two major public health problems that lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. Malaria infection destroys erythrocytes, resulting in low hemoglobin (Hb) levels known as anemia. Here we report the determinants of anemia in high and low malaria-endemic areas that would help understand which parasite densities, age, and gender-associated low Hb levels. Therefore, a cross-sectional mass survey (n = 8,233) was conducted to screen anemia and malaria in high and low malaria-endemic districts (HMED and LMED) of North-East India. Axillary body temperature was measured using a digital thermometer. The prevalence of anemia was found to be 55.3% (4,547/8,233), of which 45.1% had mild (2,049/4,547), 52.1% moderate (2,367/4,547) and 2.9% had severe anemia (131/4,547). Among anemic, 70.8% (3,219/4,547) resided in LMED and the rest in HMED. The median age of the anemic population was 12 years (IQR: 7-30). Overall, malaria positivity was 8.9% (734/8,233), of which HMED shared 79.6% (584/734) and LMED 20.4% (150/734) malaria burden. The village-wise malaria frequency was concordant to asymptomatic malaria (10-20%), which showed that apparently all of the malaria cases were asymptomatic in HMED. LMED population had significantly lower Hb than HMED [standardized beta (β) = -0.067, p < 0.0001] and low-density Plasmodium infections had higher Hb levels than high-density infections (β = 0.113; p = 0.031). Women of reproductive age had higher odds for malaria (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.00-2.05; p = 0.04). Females (β = -0.193; p < 0.0001) and febrile individuals (β = -0.029; p = 0.008) have shown lower Hb levels, but malaria positivity did not show any effect on Hb. Young children and women of reproductive age are prone to anemia and malaria. Although there was no relation between malaria with the occurrence of anemia, we found low-density Plasmodium infections, female gender, and LMED were potential determinants of Hb.",,1282
2286,35967145,"The Use of Antibiotics for the Prevention of Surgical Site Infections in Two Government Hospitals in Taif, Saudi Arabia: A Retrospective Study.","Background Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most common postoperative complications. To reduce the occurrence of surgical wound infections, suitable antimicrobials should be administered. Aim of the work This study investigated the prophylactic use of antibiotics to prevent SSIs, in terms of agents and/or combination preferences, and the adherence of surgeons to both national and international guidelines of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis in Taif city government hospitals. Methods This is a retrospective study using a chart review of patients' medical records in two government hospitals in Taif city, Saudi Arabia, from July 2016 to July 2018. While maintaining the confidentiality of the patient's data, it was collected and analyzed using the chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests, and the difference between means was tested using the student's t-test. Results Prophylactic antibiotics were used in 157 patients who had surgery (Group 1) while 52 patients did not receive preoperative antibiotics (Group 2). The most commonly used prophylactic antibiotics were metronidazole, cefuroxime, cefazolin, and ceftriaxone. Other antimicrobials used included cefotaxime, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. Surgical site infections developed in one patient of those who received antibiotics preoperatively and in three Group 2 patients. The mean hospital length of stay in Group 1 was 38.5±9.2 hours, and 57.3±12.1 hours in Group 2 patients. The types of antibiotics used were generally within the scope of national and international recommended guidelines. Conclusion The use of preoperative prophylactic antibiotics significantly reduces the development of surgical site infections and the mean length of hospital stay. Various antimicrobial drugs that were used prophylactically in surgical practice are within the recommendations of both national and international guidelines.",,1283
43,35983579,Effect of Different Interventions to Help Primary Care Clinicians Avoid Unsafe Opioid Prescribing in Opioid-Naive Patients With Acute Noncancer Pain: A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Prescription opioids can treat acute pain in primary care but have potential for unsafe use and progression to prolonged opioid prescribing. To compare clinician-facing interventions to prevent unsafe opioid prescribing in opioid-naive primary care patients with acute noncancer pain. We conducted a multisite, cluster-randomized, 2 × 2 factorial, clinical trial in 3 health care systems that comprised 48 primary care practices and 525 participating clinicians from September 2018 through January 2021. Patient participants were opioid-naive outpatients, 18 years or older, who presented for a qualifying clinic visit with acute noncancer musculoskeletal pain or nonmigraine headache. Practices randomized to: (1) control; (2) opioid justification; (3) monthly clinician comparison emails; or (4) opioid justification and clinician comparison. All groups received opioid prescribing guidelines via the electronic health record at the time of a new opioid prescription. Primary outcome measures were receipt of an initial opioid prescription at the qualifying clinic visit. Other outcomes were opioid prescribing for more than 3 months and a concurrent opioid/benzodiazepine prescription over 12-month follow-up. Among 22 616 enrolled patient participants (9740 women [43.1%]; 64 American Indian/Alaska Native [0.3%]; 590 Asian [2.6%], 1120 Black/African American [5.0%], 1777 Hispanic [7.9%], 225 Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander [1.0%], and 18 981 White [83.9%] individuals), the initial opioid prescribing rates at the qualifying clinic visit were 3.1% in the total sample, 4.2% in control, 3.6% in opioid justification, 2.6% in clinician comparison, and 1.9% in opioid justification and clinician comparison. Compared with control, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for a new opioid prescription was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.46-1.18; P = .20) for opioid justification and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.38-0.96; P = .03) for clinician comparison. Compared with control, clinician comparison was associated with decreased odds of opioid therapy of more than 3 months (aOR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91; P = .001) and concurrent opioid/benzodiazepine prescription (aOR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-1.00; P = .04), whereas opioid justification did not have a significant effect. In this cluster randomized clinical trial, comparison emails decreased the proportion of opioid-naive patients with acute noncancer pain who received an opioid prescription, progressed to treatment with long-term opioid therapy, or were exposed to concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine therapy. Health care systems can consider adding clinician-targeted nudges to other initiatives as an efficient, scalable approach to further decrease potentially unsafe opioid prescribing.

2458,35966826,Effects of cannabis on congenital limb anomalies in 14 European nations: A geospatiotemporal and causal inferential study.,"Cannabinoid exposure is increasing in some European nations. Europe therefore provides an interesting test environment for the recently reported link between cannabis exposure and congenital limb anomaly (CLA) rates (CLARs). Exponential genotoxic dose-response relationships make this investigation both intriguing and imperative. Annual CLAR in 14 nations were from Epidemiological Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies. Drug use rates were from European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Dependency. Median household income was from the World Bank. E-values provide a quantitative measure of robustness of results to confounding by extraneous covariates. Inverse probability weighting is an important technique for equalizing exposures across countries and removing sources of bias. Rates of CLA, hip dysplasia and the whole group of limb anomalies were higher in countries with increasing daily cannabis use (P = 1.81 × 10-16, 0.0005 and 2.53 × 10-6, respectively). In additive inverse-probability-weighted panel models, the limb reduction-resin Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration E-value estimate was 519.93 [95% lower bound (mEV) 49.56], order Resin > Herb ≫ Tobacco > Alcohol. Elevations were noted in 86% E-value estimates and 70.2% of mEVs from 57 E-value pairs from inverse-probability-weighted panel models and from spatial models. As judged by the mEV the degree of association with metrics of cannabis exposure was hip dysplasia > polydactyly > syndactyly > limb anomalies > limb reductions with median E-value estimates from 3.40 × 1065 to 7.06 and median mEVs from 6.14 × 1033 to 3.41. Daily cannabis use interpolated was a more powerful metric of cannabis exposure than herb or resin THC exposure. Data indicate that metrics of cannabis exposure are closely linked with CLAR and satisfy epidemiological criteria for causality. Along with Hawaii and the USA, Europe now forms the third international population in which this causal link has been demonstrated. Cannabis as a predictor of limb anomalies was more potent than tobacco or alcohol. Cannabinoid access should be restricted to protect public health and the community genome/epigenome transgenerationally.",,1285
391,35979283,Tracheobronchial intubation using flexible bronchoscopy in children with Pierre Robin sequence: Nursing considerations for complications.,"It has been shown that children with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) have a higher risk of difficult intubation before surgery. When mask ventilation or tracheobronchial intubation is expected to be challenging, flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is advantageous in airway safety when it is used to guide tracheobronchial intubation (TI). To evaluate the complications of TI using FB in children with PRS and explore the effect of nursing services on postoperative complications. One hundred and five children with PRS underwent TI using FB before early mandibular distraction osteogenesis. One hundred and eight children with common pneumonia who did not have a difficult airway were set as the control group. Demographic data, success rates of TI, time required for TI, number of TI attempts, and the incidence of postoperative complications were assessed. Besides, the strategies used to attenuate complications were investigated. The success rate of TI was 100% in children with PRS, while the success rate at the first attempt in the PRS group was significantly lower than that in the control group (88.6% vs 98.2%, P = 0.005). The time required for TI in the PRS group was markedly longer than that in the control group (P < 0.001). Children in the PRS group required repetitive operations to enter the glottis successfully (P = 0.017). The incidence of complications was noticeably higher in the PRS group (50/105, 47.6%) than in the control group (36/108, 33.3%) (P = 0.034). Seven of 105 PRS children experienced laryngeal edema (LE) (6.7%), compared with one (0.9%) in the control group (P = 0.034). Out of the seven patients who had LE, all were reintubated and managed with steroids: six recovered with inhaled steroids alone before extubated, and one was given systemic corticosteroids before recovery. FB contributes to a high success rate of TI in children with PRS. To prevent LE, operators should pay more attention to catheter material, catheter lubrication and intubation time.",,1286
1261,35971354,Delayed Presentation of Post-traumatic Multiorgan Left Diaphragmatic Hernia: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"Post-traumatic diaphragmatic injuries can present as diaphragmatic hernia with herniation of abdominal viscera into the thoracic cavity. It is challenging for trauma surgeons to identify the delayed presentation of post-traumatic diaphragmatic injuries which require a high index of suspicion in patients who are at risk. We report a rare case of delayed diagnosis and management of post-traumatic diaphragmatic hernia in a polytrauma patient with a concise review of the literature. The patient presented after two years of post-traumatic thoracoabdominal injury due to a road traffic accident with breathing difficulty. On investigations, it was a large diaphragmatic hernia with herniation of abdominal contents into the left thoracic cavity. Laparotomy was performed with a reduction of abdominal contents from the left side of the chest along with mesh repair of the large diaphragmatic hernia. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well. The literature suggests that there should be a high level of suspicion of diaphragmatic injuries, especially when dealing with thoracoabdominal trauma or polytrauma patients. Post-traumatic diaphragmatic injuries, though rare, can lead to high morbidity or mortality if not treated on time.",,1287
1663,35968111,Induction of heartwood formation in young Indian sandalwood (Santalum album L.) by gas elicitors.,"Induction of heartwood formation in 6-year-old Indian sandalwood (Santalum album L.) trees by treatment with carbon dioxide, ethylene, nitrogen, and wounding was investigated. All treatments induced fragrant heartwood formation upward and downward from the drill hole. The amount of heartwood formed above and below the drill hole depended on the treatment in the order nitrogen>carbon dioxide>ethylene>wounding, whereas the radial extension proportion was, in order, nitrogen>carbon dioxide>ethylene=wounding. Based on the chemical analysis (GC-MS) and evaluation of the essential oil quality and heartwood properties, heartwood induced by carbon dioxide showed the maximum similarities to naturally formed heartwood, which included the same color, similar chemical composition, reasonable oil content, and quality essential oil, whereas ethylene, nitrogen, and wounding treatment showed fewer similarities to natural heartwood. The results suggest that carbon dioxide is a promising candidate gas elicitor for inducing heartwood formation in young S. album.",,1288
1646,35968128,Root hair growth from the pH point of view.,"Root hairs are tubular outgrowths of epidermal cells that increase the root surface area and thereby make the root more efficient at absorbing water and nutrients. Their expansion is limited to the root hair apex, where growth is reported to take place in a pulsating manner. These growth pulses coincide with oscillations of the apoplastic and cytosolic pH in a similar way as has been reported for pollen tubes. Likewise, the concentrations of apoplastic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillate with the same periodicity as growth. Whereas ROS appear to control cell wall extensibility and opening of Ca2+ channels, the role of protons as a growth signal in root hairs is less clear and may differ from that in pollen tubes where plasma membrane H+-ATPases have been shown to sustain growth. In this review, we outline our current understanding of how pH contributes to root hair development.",,1289
150,35983233,Breast cancer metastasis: Is it a matter of OMICS and proper ex-vivo models?,"Genomics has greatly increased the understanding of the study of breast cancer (BC) and has shaped the concept of intra-tumor heterogeneity, currently recognized as a propelling force for cancer progression. In this context, knowledge and understanding of metastatic breast cancer (mBC) has somehow lagged behind that of primary breast cancer. This may be explained by the relative scarcity of matched mBC samples, however it is possible that the mutation spectrum obtained from primary BC does not capture the full complexity of the metastatic disease. Here, we provide a few examples supporting this possibility, from public databases. We evoke the need to perform an integrated multi-OMICS characterization of mBC, to obtain a broad understanding of this complex disease, whose evolution cannot be explained solely by genomics. Pertinent to this, we suggest that rather an infrequent use of Patient-Derived -Tumor-Organoids (PDTOs) may be influenced by assuming that the metastatic conditions of PDTOs growth (mPDTOs) should be similar to those of the tissue of origin. We challenge this view by suggesting that the use of target-organ inspired growth conditions for mPDTOs, may better fit the emerging knowledge of metastatic disease. Thus, the integrated use of multi-OMICS and of clinically relevant mPDTOs may allow a further understanding of such disease and foster therapeutically relevant advances. We believe that our points may be valid for other solid cancers.",,1290
955,35974724,MuMag2022: a software tool for analyzing magnetic field dependent unpolarized small-angle neutron scattering data of bulk ferromagnets.,"The MATLAB-based software tool MuMag2022 is presented for the analysis of magnetic-field-dependent unpolarized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data of bulk ferromagnets such as elemental nanocrystalline ferromagnets, magnetic nanocomposites or magnetic steels.

1831,35967809,Production and Optimization of Conjugated Linoleic and Eicosapentaenoic Acids by Bifidobacterium lactis in Cold-Pressed Soybean Cake.,"In regard to the biosynthesis of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) by some bacteria, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of solid-state fermentation based on soybean pressed cake (SPC) to produce CLA and EPA by Bifidobacterium lactis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of solid-state fermentation based on SPC to produce CLA and EPA by B. lactis. Process conditions including humidity, inoculation level, and temperature parameters were optimized by adopting the response surface methodology (RSM) method (response surface method) and the design expert software. Accordingly, a homogeneous SPC paste substrate at 60, 70, and 80% humidity was prepared with different inoculation levels at 30, 37, and 44°C to assess the strain behavior. The introduced SPC consisted of 60% humidity, 2% inoculation level at 37°C, and 60% humidity, and 4% inoculation level at 30 and 44°C; it also included 6% inoculation level at 37°C, 70% humidity at 2% inoculation level, at 30 and 44°C, and 4% inoculation level at 37°C. Also, SPC with 80% humidity at 2% and 4% inoculation levels, and at 30 and 44°C was obtained. To confirm the accuracy of the conditions, an experiment was conducted according to the defined requirements. The results were compared with the predicted data, which showed a significant difference. Under optimized conditions, with an inoculation level of 4% on the SPC medium with 70% humidity and at 37°C, B. lactis strains could yield 9cis-, 11 trans-linoleic and eicosapentaenoic at 0.18 and 0.39% of the total fatty acids. So, the potential benefits of using SPC as an inexpensive substrate for the commercial production of CLA and EPA should be noted.",,1292
1676,35968097,Real-time fluorescence and colorimetric identification of bulbus fritillariae using recombinase assisted loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification (RALA).,"Bulbus Fritillariae (BF) is a kind of herbal medicine widely used in many countries including China, Japan, Korea, and so on. Among the known BF medicinal materials, Bulbus Fritillariae cirrhosae (BF cirrhosae) was reported to have the best curative effect. Due to the limited resources of BF cirrhosae, a lot of adulterants have emerged in the market, impairing the market order, resource development, and above all, clinical efficacy. Here, a novel nucleic acid amplification technique, Recombinase Assisted Loop-mediated isothermal DNA Amplification (RALA), was used to establish a real-time fluorescence isothermal molecular authentication method for five commonly used BF drugs. Moreover, this RALA-based assay can also be developed as a colorimetric detection method for on-site detection. Both real-time fluorescence and visual methods could detect as low as 0.1% genuine targets in the mixed samples. In summary, we report an isothermal detection system for five kinds of BF circulating in the market, providing a new choice for the molecular identification of BF drugs and showing promise in the laboratory testing as well as field identification of other herbal medicines.",,1293
177,35982915,Goal-directed upper limb movement patterns and hand grip forces in multiple sclerosis.,"Upper limb disability in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) leads to increased dependence on caregivers. To better understand upper limb disability, observer-based or time-based clinical assessments have been applied. However, these only poorly capture the behavioural aspects underlying goal-directed task performance. We aimed to document alterations in goal-directed upper limb movement patterns and hand grip forces in a cohort of pwMS (n = 123) with mild to moderate upper limb impairments. We relied on the Virtual Peg Insertion Test (VPIT), a technology-aided assessment with a goal-directed pick-and-place task providing a set of validated digital health metrics. All metrics indicated significant differences to an able-bodied reference sample (p < 0.001), with smoothness, speed, and grip force control during object manipulation being most affected in pwMS. Such abnormalities negatively influenced the time to complete the goal-directed task (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.77), thereby showing their functional relevance. Lastly, abnormalities in movement patterns and grip force control were consistently found even in pwMS with clinically normal gross dexterity and grip strength. This work provides a systematic documentation on goal-directed upper limb movement patterns and hand grip forces in pwMS, ultimately paving the way for an early detection of MS sign using digital health metrics.",,1294

2038,35967548,Tumor-Background Ratio is an effective method to identify tumors and false-positive nodules in indocyanine-green navigation surgery for pediatric liver cancer.,"Indocyanine green (ICG) navigation surgery has been used for hepatoblastoma (HB) in children but the technique has been reported for using in other childhood liver cancers were rare. This article summarizes the application experience of ICG in HB and other childhood liver cancers in children and explores the role of fluorescence intensity measurement in identifying tumors. To summarize the clinical experience of children with liver cancer treated by ICG navigation surgery. The tumor and its surrounding tissue were photographed by near infrared during the operation. The fluorescence intensity of tumors, ICG (+) lesions and the normal liver was measured, and the Tumor-Background Ratio (TBR) was calculated. A total of 11 children with liver cancer were injected intravenously with ICG 1 day before operation. With the help of ICG fluorescence navigation, there was no residual tumor at the surgical margin for all the children. Total fluorescence was seen in 2 cases, rim fluorescence in 2 cases, and partial fluorescence in 7 cases. 19 ICG false-positive nodules were found on the resection stump or residual liver tissue in 5 cases, and the TBR value of tumors was higher than that of false- positive nodules. 10 children have survived without disease. ICG navigation surgery is safe and feasible for liver cancer in children, which can enhance the visualization of the tumor during operation and provide more information about the location and boundaries of the tumor. This technique also has limitations, which can be affected by chemotherapy, tumor location, ICG administration regimen, and equipment. TBR is an effective method to identify tumor and non-cancerous lesions.",,1296

2042,35967537,Childhood Steroid-resistant Nephrotic Syndrome: Long-term Outcomes from a Tertiary Care Center.,"Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a rare condition that accounts for about 10% to 20% of all nephrotic syndromes in children. While calcineurin inhibitors induce remission in the majority, the data on long-term outcomes are limited. This retrospective study aimed to look at the clinical profile, biopsy findings, and long-term treatment outcomes in children with SRNS. The records of all children (1-18 years) with SRNS with biopsy findings of minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), or mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, who received treatment for a minimum period of 12 months and were in follow-up during the years 2007-2018 at a tertiary care teaching hospital were retrieved. The clinical, histopathological, and biochemical factors and treatment outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Ninety-one (72 boys) children with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of onset of nephrotic syndrome as 48 (24-87) months were included. MCD and FSGS were the most common histopathological types (57.1% and 36.3%, respectively) and 62 (68.1%) patients had late steroid resistance. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) were used in 86.8% of the children, and response rates with cyclosporine and tacrolimus for complete remission (CR) were 80% and 73.7%, respectively, with median (IQR) time to response being 3 (2-4) months. The presence of MCD on histology and the use of CNIs were significantly associated with CR (P < 0.01). At a median (IQR) follow-up of 5 (3-7) years, 76 (83.5%) children had either CR or partial remission, four (4.4%) developed chronic kidney disease and five (5.5%) died (three due to end-stage renal disease and two of infective complications). SRNS children with MCD on biopsy, late resistance, and response to CNIs have better long-term outcomes. Most patients respond to CNIs within the first 6 months of use and need therapy for at least 24 to 36 months.",,1298

1439,35968459,Occupational Exposure to Poorly Soluble Low Toxicity Particles and Cardiac Disease: A Look at Carbon Black and Titanium Dioxide.,"Environmental particulate exposure and the potential risk to people with various types of cardiac diseases, most notably cardiovascular disease, have aroused scientific and regulatory interest worldwide. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between exposure to airborne environmental particulate matter (PM) and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). The associations reported, however, are complex and may not involve a direct role for PM, since air pollutants are diverse and highly correlated. This study examines the potential role of occupational exposure to two types of particles, namely, manufactured carbon black (CB) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), on the risk of cardiovascular disease. To address the risk of cardiovascular disease from exposure to carbon black and titanium dioxide, as reflective of poorly soluble low toxicity particles, we reviewed the published cohort mortality studies of occupational exposure to carbon black and titanium dioxide. Mortality studies of carbon black have been conducted in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Five mortality studies related to workers involved in the manufacture of titanium dioxide in the United States and Europe have also been conducted. In addition, a meta-analysis of the three-carbon black mortality studies was performed. In the random-effects meta-analysis, full cohort meta-SMRs were 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79-1.29) for heart disease; 1.02 (95% CI: 0.80-1.30) for ischemic heart disease; and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.74-1.59) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality. A small but imprecise increased AMI mortality risk was suggested for cumulative exposure by a meta-HR = 1.10 per 100 mg/m3-years (95% CI: 0.92-1.31) but not for lugged exposures, that is, for recent exposures. Results of five cohort mortality studies of titanium dioxide workers in the United States and Europe showed no excess in all heart disease or cardiovascular disease. In the most recent study in the United States, an internal analysis, that is, within the cohort itself, with no lag time, showed that the exposure group 15-35 mg/m3-years yielded a significantly increased risk for heart disease; however, there was no evidence of increasing risk with increasing exposure for any of the exposure categories. In contrast to environmental studies, the results of cohort mortality studies do not demonstrate that airborne occupational exposure to carbon black and titanium dioxide particulates increases cardiovascular disease mortality. The lack of a relationship between carbon black and titanium dioxide and CVD mortality suggests that the associations reported in air pollution studies may not be driven by the particulate component.",,1300
1404,35968545,Impact of additional HEPA filter on APAP performance and CPAP pressure level in simulated sleep apnea events.,"CPAP is the first line treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. Recently, the use of added filters has been debated following the field safety notice of Philips Respironics™ on potential health risks due to foam degradation used in their ventilators. However, the added resistance of filters has never been analyzed. The primary aim was to investigate the impact of four different filters on APAP mode performance with and without added unintentional air leaks (UIAL) with two simulated respiratory events. The secondary aim was to assess the pressure drop due to the increased filter resistance at different fixed CPAP pressure levels. This is a bench study. Performance tests were performed on a breathing simulator (ASL 5000™) with a DreamStation™ device. To assess the combined effect of UIAL, a controlled valve was added to the setup. Without UIAL, the algorithm was able to detect respiratory events and increase pressure level consequently. In the presence of UIAL, the device's response to simulated events was affected. In fixed CPAP mode, the median measured end-expiratory pressure was 6.2 to 10.0% (p < 0.001) below the set pressure with the additional filters. Additional UIAL severely impacted the delivered pressure with a median reduction up to 28.3% (p < 0.001) to the set pressure. Despite a slight pressure drop, the APAP algorithm still performed with additional filters when UIAL were avoided. However, the combined effect of added filter resistance and UIAL severely impacted APAP performance and effectively delivered set pressure.",,1301
2256,35967175,Esophagogastric Complications After Caustic Ingestion: A Case Report.,"Ingestion of corrosive agents is a well-known factor in extensive GI tract injury. Either acids or alkalis can lead to significant immediate and long-term complications throughout the GI system. The ingestion of these substances in children is often accidental, however, it is typical that in adults is due to suicidal attempts. A 25-year-old male with a history of suicidal attempt one month ago comes to the GI clinic due to unintentional weight loss of 19%, dysphagia of solids, emesis, and regurgitation. Evaluation with an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was done which showed severe esophageal stenosis (90%), esophagitis Zargar 3a, and total pyloric stenosis. A dilation procedure was attempted, but complicated by severe bleeding; thus, the patient was hospitalized for a new attempt. During the second endoscopy, an esophageal dilation was successfully performed, but the pyloric dilation could not be completed. For that reason, a hepato-pancreato-biliary surgeon was consulted and a jejunostomy was performed for enteral nutrition. Caustic agent ingestion can cause different types of injuries including laryngospasms, perforations, necrosis, and mediastinitis in the short term. On the other hand, esophageal stenosis (ES), gastric outlet obstruction (GOO), and esophageal cancer can appear in the long term. In this case, we highlighted the importance of prompt recognition, identification, and grading of the lesions to determine a better outcome and prognosis for the patient.",,1302
1048,35974571,Structure and optical properties of twist-bend nematic liquid crystals doped with chiral dopants.,"Twist-bend nematic liquid crystals (N_{TB} LCs), although consisting of achiral molecules, possess a spontaneous conic helix. They have been intensively studied and utilized in many applications in recent years. Herein we add chiral molecules to N_{TB} LCs and study their effects on the structure of the conic helix. We observe that the system is in the regular chiral nematic phase at high temperature and is still in the twist-bend nematic phase at low temperature. The addition of the chiral molecules does not induce a twist of the conic helical axis. The main effect of the chiral molecules is increasing the cone angle of the conic helix. We show that the structural chirality parameters in the chiral nematic phase and the twist-bend chiral nematic phase can be calculated from the same intrinsic chirality parameter, which only depends on the molecular structure and concentrations of the chiral molecule. We also observe a pretransitional phenomenon that the helical pitch of the chiral nematic phase increases dramatically when temperature is decreased toward the chiral nematic to twist-bend nematic phase transition temperature.",,1303

Since the advent of the first XFEL in 2009, recent years have witnessed a great number of applications with various pump-probe techniques at XFELs. Among these, time-resolved X-ray liquidography (TRXL) is a powerful method for visualizing structural dynamics in the liquid solution phase. Here, we classify various chemical and biological molecular systems studied via femtosecond TRXL (fs-TRXL) at XFELs, depending on the focus of the studied process, into (i) bond cleavage and formation, (ii) charge distribution and electron transfer, (iii) orientational dynamics, (iv) solvation dynamics, (v) coherent nuclear wavepacket dynamics, and (vi) protein structural dynamics, and provide a brief review on each category. We also lay out a plausible roadmap for future fs-TRXL studies for areas that have not been explored yet.",,1304
1036,35974583,Polarization-dependent reflection of I-WP minimal-surface-based photonic crystal.,"Brilliantly colored butterflies and weevils are known to utilize photonic crystals for their coloration. Interestingly, the morphology of such crystals made of cuticle is based on triply periodic minimal surfaces such as gyroid and diamond surfaces. Recently, a different minimal-surface-based photonic crystal, the I-WP surface, was discovered inside the scale of a longhorn beetle. The letter I is derived from expressing the body center symmetry and WP is derived from a wrapped package. It was reported that the brilliant green color is produced by the photonic band gap existing along the [110] direction of this crystal. In this study, the polarization dependence of the reflection from this photonic crystal was investigated. A peculiar reflectance spectrum with two peaks was observed under the crossed polarizers. This characteristic is theoretically reproduced by calculating the reflectance from a finite-sized photonic crystal, and the spectral shape is explained based on the symmetry of the electromagnetic modes. In addition, inspired by this longhorn beetle, a photonic crystal structure consisting of colloidal particles is proposed, which has a similar polarization effect.",,1305
1067,35974552,Extreme events and instantons in Lagrangian passive scalar turbulence models.,"The advection and mixing of a scalar quantity by fluid flow is an important problem in engineering and natural sciences. The statistics of the passive scalar exhibit complex behavior even in the presence of a Gaussian velocity field. This paper is concerned with two Lagrangian turbulence models that are based on the recent fluid deformation model, but adding a passive scalar field with uniform mean gradient. For a range of Reynolds numbers, these models can reproduce the statistics of passive scalar turbulence. For these models, we demonstrate how events of extreme passive scalar gradients can be recovered by computing the instanton, i.e., the saddle-point configuration of the associated stochastic field theory. It allows us to both reproduce the heavy-tailed statistics associated with passive scalar turbulence, and recover the most likely mechanism leading to such extreme events. We further demonstrate that events of large negative strain in these models undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking.",,1306
2030,35967556,Moderate grade subglottic stenosis in children: Laryngotracheal reconstruction versus cricotracheal resection and anastomosis.,"The surgical treatment of choice of pediatric moderate subglottic stenosis (major grade II and minor grade III SGS or 60-80% lumen obstruction) remains controversial. Laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) (with anterior ± posterior grafts for airway expansion) and partial crico-tracheal resection (PCTR) are the mainly described open surgical techniques. We reviewed our pediatric cases with moderate subglottic stenosis to determine the efficacy of LTR versus PCTR. A retrospective study of all children between 0 and 18 years that underwent open reconstructive airway surgery between 2012 and 2019. Children who had either acquired or congenital moderate subglottic stenosis (late grade II and early grade III: 60-80% lumen obstruction) were selected. Twenty-six children with moderate-grade subglottic stenosis were included. Seventeen were treated with LTR and nine with PCTR. No significant differences were observed between LTR and PCTR-treated cases. Decannulation rates were similar, as well as the functional results. Both LTR and PCTR are valid treatment options for moderate subglottic stenosis.

1965,35967642,Using Spiritual Connections to Cope With Stress and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"During the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, stress and anxiety were pervasive among the masses due to high morbidity and mortality. Besides the fear of coronavirus was also particularly driven by social media. Many people started to look for faith and spiritual connections to gain comfort. The role of spiritual ties and religious beliefs in relation to coping with pandemic stress has acquired the attention of researchers in some parts of the world. This cross-sectional survey aimed at assessing the intensity of stress and anxiety symptoms experienced by people and how much they were alleviated by employing spiritual connections. The study sample comprises 795 respondents with 52% males and 48% females living in Saudi Arabia. The brief online study questionnaire collected data about background variables, anxiety and stress scale from DASS-21, and items from the WHOQOL (SRBP) instrument assessed the use of spiritual beliefs to cope. Multiple regression models were tested to determine the role of spiritual connections after adjusting demographic variables. Results illustrated that after adjusting for gender and age, participants' anxiety symptoms decreased by (β = -0.27; p = 0.000) units with each unit increase in the use of spiritual connections, and participants' stress symptoms reduce by (β = -0.36; p = 0.000) units with each unit increase in coping with spirituality. Additionally, females' risk to experience anxiety and stress symptoms was more than males [(β = 0.88; p = 0.01) and (β = 0.92; p = 0.000)], respectively. An increase in age decreases the likelihood of experiencing anxiety symptoms and stress symptoms by (β = -0.75; p = 0.02) and (β = -0.11; p = 0.000) units, respectively. Findings support the protective role of spiritual connections despite small beta coefficients. The social and cultural context in Saudi Arabia favors deep-rooted connections with spirituality and faith. Our findings support the fact that the reliance on spiritual connections helped older people to deal with exaggerated fear during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduces the risk of experiencing anxiety and stress symptoms. Females and younger participants were relatively vulnerable to developing these symptoms. We discussed these findings considering some recent studies that reported similar relationships and made recommendations for future research.",,1308
93,35983390,Gastrointestinal Lesions and Its Associated Factors in Adult Males With Iron Deficiency Anaemia: A Cross-Sectional Study From Tertiary Care Centre of North India.,"Background Around 30% of the world's population suffers from iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). The standard evaluation for IDA involves upper and lower endoscopy, which allows for the confirmation of pathology of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) induced due to IDA through iron malabsorption mechanism or loss of blood. Assessing the prevalence of lesions of GIT of significant nature among males having IDA, was the goal of our study. Methods Our cross-sectional study was conducted for two years and involved 152 males (adults) with confirmed cases of IDA from the Outpatient (OPD) and In-patient (IPD) in the present hospital. Following collecting consent (both informed and written in nature), patient-specific data was collected in a standardized form, and a blood sample was taken for laboratory testing. The analyses were done at a 5% level of significance; an association was considered significant if the p-value < 0.05. Results The average age of the study participants was 59.6 years. The commonest lesions reported were antral gastritis (9.9%) and H. pylori gastritis (7.2%) in upper GI; and haemorrhoid (9.2%) and anal fissure (3.9%) in lower GI. The overall prevalence of any GI lesions was 65.1%. The GI lesions were significantly associated higher among men with age > 50 years (73.7%). The presence of occult blood in stools (p < 0.0001) and parasites in stools (p=0.0001) were significantly related to the presence of GI lesions. Conclusion GI lesions are frequently detected in males with IDA. Whether it is symptomatic male or asymptomatic male with anaemia refractory to iron treatment, GIT should be evaluated in them.",,1309
1835,35967805,Reduction in residual cyantraniliprole levels in spinach after various washing and blanching methods.,"Pesticides are used to protect crops from pests and diseases. However, as many pesticides are toxic to humans, it is necessary to assess methods that can remove pesticide residues from agricultural products before human consumption. Spinach is consumed immediately after a relatively simple washing and heating process in the Republic of Korea. Cyantraniliprole is used as a systemic insecticide during spinach cultivation, which means it might remain in the crop after processing. Consequently, it is important to assess whether residues can be reduced to levels that are harmless to the human body after processing. This study investigated lowering the residual cyantraniliprole levels in spinach after washing and blanching. The amount of cyantraniliprole residue in the spinach samples sprayed with cyantraniliprole during cultivation was analyzed using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The time of each washing and blanching method was set at 1, 3, and 5 min. The residual levels of cyantraniliprole decreased by 15.1-54.6% and 60.1-93.5% based on the washing and blanching methods employed. The most effective washing method to lower residual cyantraniliprole levels was steeping with a neutral detergent, resulting in cyantraniliprole reduction by 42.9-54.6%. When spinach was blanched after steeping washing with a neutral detergent, the largest removal rates of 77.9 and 91.2% were observed after 1 and 3 min of blanching, respectively. Blanching for 5 min after steeping and running washing exhibited the highest reduction rate of 93.5%. Therefore, a considerable amount of cyantraniliprole residue in spinach could be removed by washing or blanching. Based on the results of this study, blanching after steeping washing can be implemented as an effective method of lowering pesticide concentrations in spinach and other crops, thereby reducing their potential toxicity to humans upon consumption.",,1310
1710,35968060,"Antimicrobial efficacy of Xylitol, Probiotic and Chlorhexidine mouth rinses among children and elderly population at high risk for dental caries - A Randomized Controlled Trial.","Chlorhexidine is considered the most potent chemotherapeutic agent against Streptococcus mutans. However, its side effects due to prolonged use, indicates need for alternatives. The study intended to assess and compare antimicrobial efficacies of probiotic, xylitol and chlorhexidine mouth rinses in children and elderly. The study was a Double blind Randomized Controlled Trial conducted among residential school children aged 5-12 years and elderly greater than 60 years residing in old age homes. (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04399161). 30 participants each among children and elderly were chosen based on eligibility criterion (high risk for caries). They were further randomly divided into 3 groups with 10 participants in each group. Participants were asked to rinse with 15 ml of freshly prepared mouth rinses once daily for 2 minutes for 14 days. Antimicrobial efficacy was determined by assessing change in Streptococcus mutans levels in dental plaque. Significant reduction in Streptococcus mutans counts were observed in both children and elderly (Chlorhexidine: mean difference = 3.11 log10CFU/g, p = 0.022, Xylitol: mean difference = 0.93 log10CFU/g, p = 0.046, Probiotic: mean difference = 1.91 log10CFU/g, p = 0.023 in children); (Chlorhexidine: mean difference = 2.23 log10CFU/g, p = 0.004, Xylitol: mean difference = 1.39 log10CFU/g, p = 0.009, Probiotic: mean difference = 1.61 log10CFU/g, p = 0.018 in elderly). Intergroup comparison showed no significant difference. Antimicrobial efficacy of xylitol and probiotic mouth rinses were comparable to that of chlorhexidine in both children and elderly. Probiotics could potentially be more efficacious than xylitol among children.",,1311
634,35977217,"Performance Metrics of Substance Use Disorder Care Among Medicaid Enrollees in New York, New York.","There is limited evaluation of the performance of Medicaid managed care (MMC) private plans in covering substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. To compare the performance of MMC plans across 19 indicators of access, quality, and outcomes of SUD treatment. This cross-sectional study used administrative claims and mandatory assignment to plans of up to 159 016 adult Medicaid recipients residing in 1 of the 5 counties (boroughs) of New York, New York, from January 2009 to December 2017 to identify differences in SUD treatment access, patterns, and outcomes among different types of MMC plans. Data from the latest years were received from the New York State Department of Health in October 2019, and analysis began soon thereafter. Approximately 17% did not make an active choice of plan, and a subset of these (approximately 4%) can be regarded as randomly assigned. Plan assignment. Percentage of the enrollees achieving performance measures across 19 indicators of access, process, and outcomes of SUD treatment. Medicaid claims data from 159 016 adults (mean [SD] age, 35.9 [12.7] years; 74 261 women [46.7%]; 8746 [5.5%] Asian, 73 783 [46.4%] Black, and 40 549 [25.5%] White individuals) who were auto assigned to an MMC plan were analyzed. Consistent with national patterns, all plans achieved less than 50% (range, 0%-62.1%) on most performance measures. Across all plans, there were low levels of treatment engagement for alcohol (range, 0%-0.4%) and tobacco treatment (range, 0.8%-7.2%), except for engagement for opioid disorder treatment (range, 41.5%-61.4%). For access measures, 4 of the 9 plans performed significantly higher than the mean on recognition of an SUD diagnosis, any service use for the first time, and tobacco use screening. Of the process measures, total monthly expenditures on SUD treatment was the only measure for which plans differed significantly from the mean. Outcome measures differed little across plans. The results of this cross-sectional study suggest the need for progress in engaging patients in SUD treatment and improvement in the low performance of SUD care and limited variation in MMC plans in New York, New York. Improvement in the overall performance of SUD treatment in Medicaid potentially depends on general program improvements, not moving recipients among plans.",,1312
982,35974637,Short-range and long-range correlations in driven dense colloidal mixtures in narrow pores.,"The system of a driven dense colloid mixture in a tube with diameter comparable to particle size is modeled by a generalization of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) model. The generalization goes in two directions: relaxing the exclusion constraint by allowing several (but few) particles on a site and by considering two species of particles, which differ in size and transport coefficients. We calculate the nearest-neighbor correlations using a variant of the Kirkwood approximation and show by comparison with numerical simulations that the approximation provides quite accurate results. However, for long-range correlations, we show that the Kirkwood approximation is useless, as it predicts exponential decay of the density-density correlation function with distance, while simulation data indicate that the decay is algebraic. For the one-component system, we show that the decay is governed by a power law with universal exponent close to 2. In the two-component system, the correlation function behaves in a more complicated manner: Its sign oscillates but the envelope decays again very slowly and the decay is compatible with a power law with an exponent somewhat lower than 2. Therefore, our generalization of the ASEP belongs to a different universality class from the ensemble of generalized ASEP models which are mappable to zero-range processes.",,1313

52,35983514,The relationship between different iodine sources and nutrition in pregnant women and adults.,"Different iodine supplement measures emerge along with the economy development in China. The article objectives are to compare and explore the relationship between iodine sources and nutrition of pregnant women and adults. A total of 2,145 pregnant women and 1,660 adults were investigated by multi-stage random method. Questionnaire was used to collect basic information and the consumption of food, water, and iodine preparations. Household salt and individual urine and blood samples were collected, and thyroid function and morphology of pregnant women were measured. The median urinary iodine concentration (MUIC) of pregnant women (164.49 μg/L) was lower than adults (187.30 μg/L, p < 0.05). Iodine supplement with IS (iodized salt) was the main measure for pregnant women and adults, and the difference was mainly on the consumption of iodine preparations between pregnant women (5.19%) and adults (0.85%). Moreover, adults' dietary iodine intake from food (100.6 μg/day), IS (140.8 μg/day), and drinking water (6.0 μg/day) was higher than those of pregnant women (86.5, 107.2, and 3.5 μg/day, respectively). Compared with iodine supplement with IS, ISFP (IS + iodine-rich food + iodine preparations) could reduce the risk of iodine deficiency for pregnant women. The MUICs for pregnant women and adults of iodine supplements with IF (iodine-rich food) and ISF (IS + iodine-rich food) were lower. For pregnant women, thyroid nodule (11.90%) and peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) positive (9.32%) were high prevalent thyroid diseases, and habitation (urban/rural), gestation, annual income, and drinking water type would affect them. Pregnant women and adults had adequate iodine nutrition in four provinces. Their iodine supplement measures were different, the consumption of iodine preparations in pregnant women was higher, and their dietary iodine intake was lower than adults. ISFP was an effect measure for pregnant women to supplement iodine.",,1315
1532,35968354,SEPTIN9-SDC2-VIM methylation signature as a biomarker for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer.,"The accurate detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) at its initial stage can reduce mortality. However, the broad application of endoscopy has been limited due to the invasive procedure and patient noncompliance. Liquid biopsy with subsequent mapping of methylation in specific cell-free DNA (cfDNA) may represent an alternative approach for early diagnosis. In this study, we have developed a minimal-invasive blood-based test for detection of precancerous lesions and early-stage CRC. Using TCGA M450K methylation data, we identified candidate methylation sites with the highest Fold Change (FC) for three genes (SEPTIN9, SDC2 and VIM), which were selected from previous studies. Based on logistic regression models, we developed a 3-gene methylation signature for CRC diagnosis with high accuracy (Sensitivity =0.959, Specificity =1, AUC =0.997). Using independent public databases and data from blood samples, this model has demonstrated superior performance. The AUC was 0.919-1 and 0.905-0.916 in public tissue database for CRC and blood sample data, respectively. Thus, our proposed 3-gene methylation signature has a more reliable performance than other methods. Furthermore, signal enhancement effect of 3-gene methylation signature can improve the accuracy of early diagnosis for CRC, which demonstrates the potential for clinical application.",,1316
1112,35974507,Deep learning and inverse discovery of polymer self-consistent field theory inspired by physics-informed neural networks.,"We devise a deep learning solver inspired by physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to tackle the polymer self-consistent field theory (SCFT) equations for one-dimensional AB-diblock copolymers. The PINNs framework comprises two parallel feedforward neural networks that separately represent the segmental partition functions and self-consistent chemical potential fields. The two networks are coupled through a loss function incorporating the governing equation, initial and boundary conditions, and the incompressibility constraint. To avoid the metastable homogeneous solution, the network parameters are initialized based on known self-consistent fields obtained from the numerical pseudospectral method. For copolymers of length N at a given volume fraction of A block (f) and the reduced Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (χN), the minimization of the loss function leads to the converged network parameters that successfully capture the stable lamellar phase. The periodicity of the lamellar structure is correctly reproduced for the explored sets of [f,χN], irrespective of the presumed computational domain size for initialization. Moreover, the proposed PINNs are applicable to the inverse discovery of the interaction parameter and the embedded chemical potential fields for an observed structure. This capability of solving the inverse SCFT problem demonstrates the potential of using PINNs to accelerate the exploration of new polymeric materials.",,1317
2280,35967151,Laparoscopic Repair of Spontaneous Esophageal Perforation After Multiple Endoscopic Failures.,"Spontaneous esophageal perforation (SEP) (Boerhaave syndrome) carries high morbidity and mortality. Delay in diagnosis, because of the non-specific complaints and the rarity of the condition, further increases the mortality. While patients diagnosed early can be managed by primary closure of esophageal perforation, those presenting beyond 24 hours often require an esophagectomy with salivary diversion and feeding access with a plan for the reconstruction of the alimentary tract at a later date. In a minority of patients with a controlled esophageal fistula and feeding access, source control could be achieved by endotherapy. Patients with mediastinitis and associated systemic sepsis would be better served by surgical intervention. We present a case of an SEP with a delayed diagnosis, who underwent three unsuccessful endotherapy attempts and decortication before referral for surgical repair. The patient had an established esophageal fistula. He underwent a laparoscopic repair of the fistula. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. At the one-year follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and had gained weight. Though surgery is the treatment of choice, the optimal management of SEP with delayed diagnosis is not clearly defined. In the current era of advanced endotherapy, more cases are being managed endoscopically. However, they carry a high failure rate, resulting in increased morbidity among the patients. Early involvement of a surgical team in the decision-making is crucial for optimal outcomes of the disease.",,1318
1525,35968361,"The CX-DZ-II intelligent electronic stimulator for neck pain caused by cervical spondylosis: A two-center, randomized, controlled, and non-inferiority trial.","Electroacupuncture (EA) has been commonly used for the management of neck pain caused by cervical spondylosis (NPCS); however, current electrical instruments have limitations on intelligence, digitalization, and visualization. The intelligent electronic stimulator (CX-DZ-II) is a digital device with an evidence-based diagnosis and treatment system. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of the CX-DZ-II intelligent EA instrument for NPCS. A total of 164 patients with NPCS [mean age (SD), 49.48 (13.47) years] were randomly assigned to receive 8 sessions (over 2 weeks) EA of the intelligent electronic stimulator (CX-DZ-II) or the regular electronic stimulator (SDZ-II). The primary outcome was the change of the visual analog scale (VAS) from baseline to 2 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included mean scores of the VAS after each treatment in 1 week, responder rate, drug-usage rate of non-steroidal antipyretic analgesics (NSAAs), the occurrence rate of adverse events (AEs), proportions of apparatus with defect during treatment, and excellent rate of apparatus. The intelligent electronic stimulator (CX-DZ-II) was non-inferior to the regular electronic stimulator (SDZ-II) for changes from baseline in the VAS [3.36 vs. 3.23, with a difference of 0.17 (95% CI, -0.36 to 0.69), P < 0.025 for non-inferiority]. No between-group differences were found in outcomes of VAS in 1 week, overall responders, and drug-usage rate of NSAAs. The defect rate and excellent rate of the instrument were similar in the CX-DZ-II and SDZ-II groups. Adverse events occurred in 9 (10.84%) patients in the CX-DZ-II group and 4 (5.00%) patients in the SDZ-II group. The intelligent electronic stimulator (CX-DZ-II) was non-inferior to the regular electronic stimulator (SDZ-II) in relieving neck pain. The intelligent electronic stimulator (CX-DZ-II) is a promising non-inferior alternative instrument for NPCS. [https://clinicaltrials.gov/], identifier [NCT030 05301].",,1319
1775,35967896,Horse odor exploration behavior is influenced by pregnancy and age.,"In spite of a highly developed olfactory apparatus of horses, implying a high adaptive value, research on equine olfaction is sparse. Our limited knowledge on equine olfaction poses a risk that horse behavior does not match human expectations, as horses might react fearful when exposed to certain odors, which humans do not consider as frightening. The benefit of acquiring more knowledge of equine olfaction is therefore twofold; (1) it can aid the understanding of horse behavior and hence reduce the risk of dangerous situations, and (2) there may be unexplored potential of using odors in several practical situations where humans interact with horses. This study investigated behavior and olfactory sensitivity of 35 Icelandic horses who were presented with four odors: peppermint, orange, lavender and cedar wood in a Habituation/Dishabituation paradigm. The response variables were sniffing duration per presentation and behavioral reaction (licking, biting, snorting, and backing), and data were analyzed for potential effects of age, sex and pregnancy. Results showed that habituation occurred between successive odor presentations (1st vs. 2nd and 2nd vs. 3rd presentations: P < 0.001), and dishabituation occurred when a new odor was presented (1st vs. 3rd presentations: P < 0.001). Horses were thus able to detect and distinguish between all four odors, but expressed significantly longer sniffing duration when exposed to peppermint (peppermint vs. orange, lavender and cedar wood: P < 0.001). More horses expressed licking when presented to peppermint compared to cedar wood and lavender (P = 0.0068). Pregnant mares sniffed odors less than non-pregnant mares (P = 0.030), young horses (age 0-5 years) sniffed cedar wood for longer than old horses (P = 0.030), whereas sex had no effect (P > 0.050). The results show that horses' odor exploration behavior and interest in odors varies with age and pregnancy and that horses naïve to the taste of a substrate, may be able to link smell with taste, which has not been described before. These results can aid our understanding of horses' behavioral reactions to odors, and in the future, it may be possible to relate these to the physiology and health of horses.",,1320
260,35982569,Fate and mechanistic insights into nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) activation of sludge derived biochar reacted with Cr(VI).,"While nanoscale zero-valent iron modified biochar (nZVI-BC) have been widely investigated for the removal of heavy metals, the corrosion products of nZVI and their interaction with heavy metals have not been revealed yet. In this paper, nZVI-BC was synthesized and applied for the removal of Cr(VI). Batch experiments indicated that the adsorption of Cr(VI) fit Langmuir isotherm, with the maximum removal capacity at 172.4 mg/g at pH 2.0. SEM-EDS, BET, XRD, FT-IR, Raman and XPS investigation suggested that reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) was the major removal mechanism. pH played an important role on the corrosion of nZVI-BC, at pH 4.5 and 2.0, FeOOH and Fe3O4 were detected as the major iron oxide, respectively. Therefore, FeOOH-BC and Fe3O4-BC were further prepared and their interaction with Cr were studied. Combining with DFT calculations, it revealed that Fe3O4 has higher adsorption capacity and was responsible for the effective removal of Cr(VI) through electrostatic attraction and reduction under acidic conditions. However, Fe3O4 will continue to convert to the more stable FeOOH, which is the key to for the subsequent stabilization of the reduced Cr(III). The results showed that the oxide corrosion products of nZVI-BC were subjected to the environment, which will eventually affect the fate and transport of the adsorbed heavy metal.",,1321

Studies reporting the treatment of VMs using polidocanol (published until February 15, 2020) were reviewed in the Embase and PubMed databases. After excluding the same literature, part of the studies were excluded by reading the title, abstract, full text. Eleven studies (with 287 participants) that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included. Systematic meta-analysis was performed using Reviews Manager 5.2, and a fixed-effects model was used to calculate the pooled effective rate of polidocanol against VMs and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Lesion reduction of more than 50% was considered effective. A total of 287 patients were treated, and treatment in 271 was considered effective. The efficacy of polidocanol was 0.89 (95% CI = 0.83-0.93). Heterogeneity among the studies was small (I 2 = 0%, P = 0.47). T The funnel plot was roughly symmetric. Our study suggested that polidocanol is effective in the treatment of VMs. VMs at different sites can be treated without serious complications. Therefore, we have reason to believe that polidocanol is a safe and an effective drug for VMs.",,1322

The whole worm extract (WWE) of P. illiciens was fractionated by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration chromatography. The results showed that WWE fraction and F2 were highly antigenic as well as F1 and F3, which were moderately antigenic. For SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, the antigenic molecules of WWE and all three fractions were mostly at molecular weights (MW) ranging from 11 to 150 kDa. Four antigenic proteins of 11, 18, 27 and 75 kDa detected in WWE and F1-F3 were found to give a reaction with sera from P. illiciens infected cats, and these proteins were also identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For immunolocalization observation, it was revealed that the P. illiciens antigen was present in high concentration in the cytoplasm of vitelline cells in the vitelline glands, the shell of the eggs and the eggs within the uterus, but not in other organs, i.e., tegument, muscle, parenchymal cells, testes and oral and ventral suckers of adult fluke. This finding indicates that these proteins may be potential antigen candidates for the immunodiagnosis of feline platynosomosis caused by P. illiciens.",,1323

The data were analyzed using SPSS26.0 and Amos23.0, and the results showed that discrimination perception was significantly negatively correlated with core self-evaluation, psychological flexibility and career exploration (r = -0.487, -0.497, -0.326, p < 0.01), core self-evaluation was significantly positively correlated with psychological flexibility and career exploration (r = 0.518, 0.352, p < 0.01), and psychological flexibility was significantly positively correlated with career exploration (r = 0.386, p < 0.01); Core self-evaluation and psychological flexibility mediated the effect between discrimination perception and career exploration with effect sizes of -0.054 and -0.061, respectively; Core self-evaluation and psychological flexibility mediated the chain effect between discrimination perception and career exploration of higher vocational students with effect sizes of -0.030. Therefore, discrimination perception not only directly influences career exploration of higher vocational students, but also indirectly influences career exploration of higher vocational students through the separate mediating effects of core self-evaluation and psychological flexibility and the chain mediating effects of core self-evaluation and psychological flexibility. Accordingly, the following suggestions are put forward, which should pay attention to the cultivation of core self-evaluation and psychological flexibility of higher vocational students, strengthen the teaching quality and improve the image of vocational colleges.",,1324

In view of its solvent-implicit nature neglecting the electrostatics of water molecules with non-negligible charge structure and concentration, the precision of the DLVO formalism is somewhat puzzling. In order to shed light on this issue, we derive from our earlier explicit solvent formalism [S. Buyukdagli et al., Phys. Rev. E 87, 063201 (2013)1539-375510.1103/PhysRevE.87.063201] a solvent-augmented contact value theorem and assess the contribution of solvent molecules to the interaction of charged membranes. We find that in the case of hydrophobic membranes with fixed charges embedded in the membrane surface, the nearly exact cancellation of various explicit solvent effects of substantially large magnitude but opposite sign keeps the intermembrane pressure significantly close to the double-layer force of the DLVO theory. Then, in the case of hydrophilic surface charge groups within the aqueous region, due to the spatial separation of the membrane substrate from the location of the fixed charges where the nonlocal dielectric response of the structured solvent is sharply localized, the interfacial field energy and the contact charge densities remain unaffected by the explicit solvent. As a result, the hydration of the lipid head groups suppresses the signature of the solvent molecules from the membrane interaction force.",,1327
1898,35967712,Daily work pressure and task performance: The moderating role of recovery and sleep.,"Whereas previous research has focused on the link between (mental and physical) workload and task performance, less is known about the intervening mechanisms influencing this relationship. In the present study, we test the moderating roles of daily recovery and total sleep time in the relationship between work pressure and daily task performance. Using performance and recovery theories, we hypothesized that (a) work pressure relates positively to daily task performance, and that both (b) daily recovery in the form of psychological detachment and relaxation, and (c) total sleep time independently enhance this relationship. Our hypotheses were tested in a 30-day diary study with 110 officer cadets on a cross-Atlantic voyage on a Naval sail ship. The results of multilevel modeling lend support to all three hypotheses. Taken together, our findings suggest that recovery and sleep duration between shifts play a key role in the relationship between daily work pressure and task performance. We discuss the implications of these findings for the stressor-detachment model.",,1328
548,35978601,Management of Systemic Therapies and Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Based on Sarcopenia Assessment.,"Sarcopenia, defined as the loss of skeletal muscle mass (MM), physical performance, and strength, has been associated with poor clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with several therapies. As systemic therapies, including molecular targeted agents, have a strong impact on sarcopenia, we aimed to review the impact of sarcopenia in patients receiving systemic therapies, especially sorafenib and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). Several studies have demonstrated that sarcopenia is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients receiving sorafenib or lenvatinib, while HAIC has no association with overall survival (OS) and sarcopenia. Furthermore, based on our previous study, we developed the management of sorafenib score (MS score) to stratify patients' survival according to the positivity of three parameters (skeletal MM, disease control of sorafenib, and post-sorafenib therapy), ranging from 0 to 3. Patients with an MS score ≥2 (median survival time [MST], 16.4 months) showed significantly longer survival than those with an MS score ≤1 (MST, 8.4 months) (p < 0.001). This result indicates that patients need at least two positive parameters to prolong OS. Although performance status (PS) has been used in the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system, we consider that the assessment of sarcopenia has the potential to replace PS. Sarcopenia is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients of HCC receiving sorafenib or lenvatinib. The MS score, based on the positivity of three prognostic factors, including skeletal MM, in patients receiving sorafenib, can be a reliable indicator of prolonged survival.",,1329

While the presentation of MIS-C is generally delayed after exposure to the virus that causes coronavirus 2019, both MIS-C and Kawasaki disease (KD) share similar clinical features. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge given the lack of definitive diagnostic tests and a paucity of evidence regarding treatment modalities. We review the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluations, and management of MIS-C and compare its clinical features to those of KD.",,1330

The evolution of the software during the last two major revisions is reported here. This includes a simplified model builder for beginners, simple samples, additional sample models, statistical error analysis and the use of just-in-time compilation modules for the reflectometry kernel to achieve higher performance.

1013,35974606,Gyrokinetic electrostatic turbulence close to marginality in the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator.,"The transition from strong (fluidlike) to nearly marginal (Floquet-type) regimes of ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) driven turbulence is studied in the stellarator Wendelstein 7-X by means of numerical simulations. Close to marginality, extended (along magnetic field lines) linearly unstable modes are dominant, even in the presence of kinetic electrons, and provide a drive that results in finite turbulent transport. A total suppression of turbulence above the linear stability threshold of the ITG modes, commonly present in tokamaks and known as the Dimits shift, is not observed. We show that this is mostly due to the peculiar radial structure of marginal turbulence, which is more localized than in the fluid case and therefore less likely to be stabilized by shearing flows.",,1332
797,35975040,Triangulo-{ErIII3} complex showing field supported slow magnetic relaxation.,"The triangulo-{Er3} complex [Er3Cl(o-van)3(OH)2(H2O)5]Cl3·nH2O (n = 9.4; H(o-van) = o-vanillin) (1) was generated by an in situ method. The isolated Er(iii) complex 1 was characterized by elemental analysis and molecular spectroscopy. The results of single crystal X-ray diffraction studies have shown that 1 is built up of trinuclear [Er3Cl(o-van)3(OH)2(H2O)5]3+ complex cations, chloride anions and water solvate molecules. Within the complex cation the three Er(iii) central atoms are placed at the apexes of a triangle which are bridged by three (o-van)- ligands with additional chelating functions and two μ3-OH- ligands. Additionally five aqua and one chlorido ligands complete the octa-coordination of the three Er(iii) atoms. AC susceptibility measurements reveal that the compound exhibits slow magnetic relaxation with two relaxation modes.",,1333

Female gender, patients with diabetes, hypertension, age greater than 55, and a history of smoking are some of the risk factors that have been associated with noncharacteristic presentations of ACS. This often leads to misdiagnosis and overall increased mortality. Patients with risk factors for atypical presentations of myocardial infarctions should mandate a low threshold for suspicion and undergo evaluation with EKG and troponins for prompt diagnosis and early intervention.",,1334
1925,35967684,The dissemination effect of human-computer interactive advertising news-Using the theory of media audience and emotion management.,"The development and application of network media has seriously impacted the social information dissemination environment dominated by traditional media. To break the dissemination barriers encountered by traditional media, this work probes into the dissemination effect of human-computer interactive advertising news. An in-depth analysis of the current dissemination situation of interactive online advertising (IOA) is firstly conducted, and then the methods to effectively guide and manage audience emotions are studied. Finally, an improved LeNet-5 model is established to identify audience emotions. The improvement of the LeNet-5 model in this work is composed of the following four points. (1) The convolution module sets Inception_conv3 and Inception_conv5 are adopted to replace the third convolutional layer Conv3 and the fifth layer Conv5 of the LeNet-5, respectively. (2) The size of the convolution kernel is changed. The original convolution kernel is replaced by two 3 × 3 convolution kernels in the Inception_conv3 and Inception_conv5 module sets. (3) The number of convolution kernels is reasonably changed. (4) The Batch Normalization (BN) layer is used. The experimental results show that interactive advertisements have the better dissemination effects among the audiences with older age, higher education, and in more developed cities. The improved LeNet-5 network can effectively solve the over-fitting and gradient disappearance, with a good robustness. The recognition rate reaches more than 81%, which is higher than the traditional LeNet-5 network by 3%. It can be known that the accuracy of the improved LeNet-5 network image recognition is significantly promoted. This research provides a certain reference for the optimization of news dissemination.",,1335
1469,35968429,"Incubation period of wild type of SARS-CoV-2 infections by age, gender, and epidemic periods.","The incubation period of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is estimated to vary by demographic factors and the COVID-19 epidemic periods. This study examined the incubation period of the wild type of SARS-CoV-2 infections by the different age groups, gender, and epidemic periods in South Korea. We collected COVID-19 patient data from the Korean public health authorities and estimated the incubation period by fitting three different distributions, including log-normal, gamma, and Weibull distributions, after stratification by gender and age groups. To identify any temporal impact on the incubation period, we divided the study period into two different epidemic periods (Period-1: 19 January-19 April 2020 and Period-2: 20 April-16 October 2020), and assessed for any differences. We identified the log-normal as the best-fit model. The estimated median incubation period was 4.6 (95% CI: 3.9-4.9) days, and the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95% CI: 10.2-12.2) days. We found that the incubation period did not differ significantly between males and females (p = 0.42), age groups (p = 0.60), and the two different epidemic periods (p = 0.77). The incubation period of wild type of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic 2020, in South Korea, does not likely differ by age group, gender and epidemic period.",,1336
1580,35968305,CGRP and Migraine: What Have We Learned From Measuring CGRP in Migraine Patients So Far?,"The multi-functional neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a major role in the pathophysiology of migraine. The detection of elevated CGRP levels during acute migraine headache was the first evidence of the importance of the peptide. Since then, elevated CGRP levels have been detected not only during spontaneous and experimentally induced migraine attacks but also interictally. However, the detection of CGRP in peripheral blood shows conflicting results. In this respect, alternative detection methods are needed and have been already proposed. This article summarizes what we have learned from studies investigating CGRP in jugular and peripheral blood and reviews the latest state of research concerning the detection of CGRP in saliva and tear fluid as well as their contribution to our understanding of migraine pathophysiology.",,1337
429,35979155,A descriptive neuroimaging study of retinoblastoma in children: magnetic resonance imaging features.,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common intraocular malignancy of childhood. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for initial diagnosis, tumour extension, staging, and treatment planning of RB. Awareness of neuro-imaging findings and determining local extent are essential for early diagnosis and therapy guidance. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and to provide a detailed list of neuroimaging features of RB to improve the diagnostic work-up of children with RB. Retrospective review was performed among children with confirmed RB diagnosis. MRI features were identified to evaluate: 1) growth pattern; 2) intraocular extension; 3) extraocular extension; 4) central nervous system disease; 5) conventional MRI characteristics of the RB lesions; and 6) DWI and ADC characteristics. These features were compared between unilateral and bilateral RB lesions. Twenty-four children (male/female: 18/6) were included in this study. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 14.7 (11.4) months. In total, 34 RB lesions (bilateral = 18) were evaluated for the study. The most common features on MRI were: 1) endophytic RB lesion (50%); 2) subretinal haemorrhage (38%); 3) scleral involvement (3%); 4) leptomeningeal disease (12%); 5) contrast enhancement (97%); and 6) restricted diffusion (88%). The mean ADC value was 0.64 (0.15) × 10-3 mm2/s. Choroidal invasion (p = 0.05) and scleral involvement (p = 0.04) were significantly higher for bilateral RB lesions. Contrast enhancement and restricted diffusion are the most common neuroimaging features of RB. Choroidal invasion and scleral involvement are more frequently seen in bilateral disease.",,1338
2014,35967573,Case report: Single-session double-Ilizarov lengthening technique in the treatment of a child with congenital fibular deficiency.,"Congenital fibular deficiency is a rare disease with a broad spectrum of deformities. Associated anomalies complicate the symptoms of patients and, consequently, individualized treatments that aim at normal function and acceptable appearance. We present a case of congenital femoral and fibular shortening in the right lower limb with foot anomaly at school age. The patient underwent limb lengthening procedure in a single session on the right femur and tibia at the same time using a double-Ilizarov frame. The functional and cosmetic of his right lower extremity achieved a good outcome. Complications were minimal except for the superficial infection. Treatment lasted for 9.2 months, allowing for returning the patient to functional activity as soon as possible. A satisfactory result was obtained with limb lengthening in a single session using double Ilizarov external fixators in a school-aged patient with congenital fibular deficiency.",,1339
2010,35967577,Azygos vein preservation is feasible and beneficial in esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Esophageal atresia (EA) with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is a common congenital anomaly. It is still unknown whether azygos vein preservation will increase the difficulty or time of operation and reduce the quality of anastomosis. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to explore the puzzle. Two researchers independently searched the databases. Randomized controlled trials were included if these studies applied thoracotomy to perform operations and compared the outcomes in patients with EA/TEF between azygos vein preservation groups and azygos vein ligation groups. The Jadad score was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the I 2 value. A fixed or random-effect model was applied regarding the I 2 value. Four studies involving 286 patients were included. The pooled estimates indicated that preservation of the azygos vein decreased the incidence of anatomic leakage with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 0.54 (95% CI 0.29-0.99, P = 0.05) and mortality with an RR of 0.51 (95% CI 0.29-0.90; P = 0.02). Preservation of the azygos vein might not require a longer operative time than ligation of the azygos vein. This research certifies that preservation of the azygos vein is able to reduce the prevalence of anastomotic leakage and mortality.",,1340
798,35975039,Structure of benzene from mass-correlated rotational Raman spectroscopy.,"We present high resolution rotational Raman spectra and derived geometry parameters for benzene. Rotational Raman spectra with sub-5 MHz resolution were obtained via high-resolution mass-correlated rotational alignment spectroscopy. Isotopologue spectra for C6H6, 13C-C5H6, C6D6, and 13C-C5D6 were distinguished through their correlated mass information. Spectra for 13C6H6 were obtained with lower resolution. Equilibrium and effective bond lengths were estimated from measured inertial moments, based on explicit assumptions and approximations.

2485,35966773,Enlarged perivascular spaces and white matter hyperintensities in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution characteristics of enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and their associations with disease severity across the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) syndromes spectrum. This study included 73 controls, 39 progressive supranuclear palsy Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS), 31 corticobasal syndrome (CBS), 47 behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 36 non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), and 50 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). All subjects had brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological tests, including progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale (PSPRS) and FTLD modified clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (FTLD-CDR). EPVS number and grade were rated on MRI in the centrum semiovale (CSO-EPVS), basal ganglia (BG-EPVS), and brain stem (BS-EPVS). Periventricular (PWMH) and deep (DWMH) were also graded on MRI. The distribution characteristics of EPVS and WMH were compared between control and disease groups. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of EPVS and WMH with disease severity. Compared with control subjects, PSP-RS and CBS had more BS-EPVS; CBS, bvFTD, and nfvPPA had less CSO-EPVS; all disease groups except CBS had higher PWMH (p < 0.05). BS-EPVS was associated with PSPRS in PSP-RS (β = 2.395, 95% CI 0.888-3.901) and CBS (β = 3.115, 95% CI 1.584-4.647). PWMH was associated with FTLD-CDR in bvFTD (β = 1.823, 95% CI 0.752-2.895), nfvPPA (β = 0.971, 95% CI 0.030-1.912), and svPPA (OR: 1.330, 95% CI 0.457-2.204). BS-EPVS could be a promising indicator of disease severity in PSP-RS and CBS, while PWMH could reflect the severity of bvFTD, nfvPPA, and svPPA.",,1342
1982,35967625,Linking emotion regulation strategies to employee motivation: The mediating role of guanxi harmony in the Chinese context.,"This study examined the mediating role of guanxi harmony, a concept of interpersonal relationships specific to the Chinese context, between leaders' emotion regulation strategies and employee motivation. Data were drawn from 489 on-the-job MBA students with enough management experience from thirteen different types of cities in China. The study tested the model using hierarchical regression. The results showed that the reappraisal strategy was positively related to employee motivation and the suppression strategy was negatively related to employee motivation in the Chinese context. Guanxi harmony played a partially mediating role between reappraisal and employee motivation, and played a fully mediating role between suppression and employee motivation. These findings suggest that in the Chinese context, guanxi harmony between leaders and employees has a positive effect on employee motivation, and when leaders apply appropriate emotion regulation strategies, they can achieve guanxi harmony and promote employee motivation.",,1343
2058,35967504,Trust in government buffers the negative effect of rumor exposure on people's emotions.,"Although we are surrounded by various kinds of rumors during the coronavirus disease pandemic, little is known about their primary content, what effect they might have on our emotions, and the potential factors that may buffer their effect. Combining qualitative (study 1 extracted 1907 rumors from top rumor-refuting websites using the Python Web Crawler and conducted content analysis) and quantitative (study 2 conducted an online survey adopting a three-wave design, N = 444) research methods, the current study revealed that government-related rumors accounted for the largest proportion of rumors during the outbreak stage of the pandemic and were positively associated with the public's negative emotions. We also found that trust in government negatively moderated the relationship between government-related rumors and negative emotions. Specifically, when people had low trust in government, exposure to government-related rumors was positively associated with negative emotions. However, when people had high trust in government, the association was non-significant. For positive emotions, we found no significant effects of government-related rumors. The findings highlight the importance of rumor control during public emergencies and cultivating public trust in government in the long run.

347,35979327,Improving Quality Outcomes: The Value of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists.,"Given the growing prevalence and accelerating cost of diabetes, there is an urgent need to expand strategies in health care that improve access and outcomes and reduce the financial and human burden of the disease. Diabetes care and education specialists (DCESs) are well positioned to assist health care systems with delivery models that enhance diabetes care through evidence-based standards and quality improvement strategies. DCESs have increased opportunities to apply their competencies in primary, specialty, hospital, and acute care settings; accountable care organizations; community settings; research; and academia. Two national certification programs provide an evidence-based foundation for quality in the specialty, with updated competencies guiding practice. This article serves as a call to action for health care systems to integrate specialists in diabetes care and education into diabetes care delivery models and raise awareness of the positive impact these professionals have on the lives of people with diabetes.",,1345
426,35979172,A Two-To-One Deep Learning General Framework for Image Fusion.,"The image fusion algorithm has great application value in the domain of computer vision, which makes the fused image have a more comprehensive and clearer description of the scene, and is beneficial to human eye recognition and automatic mechanical detection. In recent years, image fusion algorithms have achieved great success in different domains. However, it still has huge challenges in terms of the generalization of multi-modal image fusion. In reaction to this problem, this paper proposes a general image fusion framework based on an improved convolutional neural network. Firstly, the feature information of the input image is captured by the multiple feature extraction layers, and then multiple feature maps are stacked along the number of channels to acquire the feature fusion map. Finally, feature maps, which are derived from multiple feature extraction layers, are stacked in high dimensions by skip connection and convolution filtering for reconstruction to produce the final result. In this paper, multi-modal images are gained from multiple datasets to produce a large sample space to adequately train the network. Compared with the existing convolutional neural networks and traditional fusion algorithms, the proposed model not only has generality and stability but also has some strengths in subjective visualization and objective evaluation, while the average running time is at least 94% faster than the reference algorithm based on neural network.",,1346
1093,35974526,Stress-free morphing by means of compatible distortions.,"We study the morphing of three-dimensional objects within the framework of nonlinear elasticity with large distortions. A distortion field induces a target metric, and the configuration which is effectively realized by a material body is the one that minimizes the distance, measured through the elastic energy, between the target metric and the actual one. Morphing through distortions might have a paramount feature: the resulting configurations might be stress-free; if this is the case, the distortions field is called compatible. We maintain that the morphing through compatible distortions is a key strategy exploited by many soft biological materials, which can exhibit very large shape-change in response to distortions controlled by stimuli such as chemicals or temperature changes, while keeping their stress state almost null. Thus, the study of compatible distortions, and of the related shape-changes, is quite important. Here, we show a blueprint for stress-free morphing based on the notions of metric tensor and of Riemann curvature which can be used to design large morphing of three-dimensional objects.",,1347
966,35974653,Frustration in a generalized kagomé Ising antiferromagnet: Exact results.,"We obtain the exact ground-state phase diagram of a generalized kagomé antiferromagnet with both pair and triplet interactions, J_{2} and J_{3}, respectively, in the presence of a magnetic field h appropriately tuned. We find that when the pair interaction J_{2}<0 dominates, the ground state is geometrically frustrated; on the other hand, the ground state is disordered but not frustrated when the triplet interaction J_{3} dominates, the boundaries between the two cases being at J_{3}=±J_{2}. The exact ground-state crossover lines between the two distinct types of disorder remain identifiable crossover curves at finite temperatures. In the frustrated domain, the ground state of the three-parameter model is identical to the ground state of the prototype one-parameter (J_{2}<0) model of geometrical frustration. Towards further understanding the frustration domain of the three-parameter model, a closed-form approximation (exact at zero temperature) determines solutions on a two-parameter subspace for induced magnetization and parallel magnetic susceptibility at finite fields h and temperatures T, the inverse susceptibility showing a Curie-Weiss behavior. We argue that the existence of an exact T=0 threshold magnetic field, below which the magnetization remains zero, indicates the existence of a gapped spectrum attributable to the presence of the triplet interaction J_{3}.",,1348
496,35978763,Embolic Cerebrovascular Accident Secondary to Device-Related Thrombus Post WATCHMAN Device Implantation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias encountered. Aggressive and appropriate management, along with identification and modification of risk factors, remains at the forefront of evidence-based practice. Thrombus formation (primarily in the left atrial appendage) and consequent thromboembolism are risks associated with AF. Anticoagulation is utilized to prevent and reduce AF-induced complications such as stroke, heart failure, and death. However, in instances when the risk of bleeding from anticoagulation outweighs the benefits of stroke prevention, other modalities such as left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) devices like the WATCHMAN device (Boston Scientific, MA) are utilized. LAAC devices, such as the WATCHMAN device, are also not without significant risks, one of them being device-related thrombus (DRT) formation. We present a case of device-related thrombus formation post WATCHMAN implantation and a subsequent embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA).",,1349
794,35975043,High-Q refractive index sensors based on all-dielectric metasurfaces.,"Possessing fantastic abilities to freely manipulate electromagnetic waves on an ultrathin platform, metasurfaces have aroused intense interest in the academic circle. In this work, we present a high-sensitivity refractive index sensor excited by the guided mode of a two-dimensional periodic TiO2 dielectric grating structure. Numerical simulation results show that the optimized nanosensor can excite guided-mode resonance with an ultra-narrow linewidth of 0.19 nm. When the thickness of the biological layer is 20 nm, the sensitivity, Q factor, and FOM values of the nanosensor can reach 82.29 nm RIU-1, 3207.9, and 433.1, respectively. In addition, the device shows insensitivity to polarization and good tolerance to the angle of incident light. This demonstrates that the utilization of low-loss all-dielectric metasurfaces is an effective way to achieve ultra-sensitive biosensor detection.",,1350
1102,35974517,Statistical physics of inhomogeneous transport: Unification of diffusion laws and inference from first-passage statistics.,"Characterization of composite materials, whose properties vary in space over microscopic scales, has become a problem of broad interdisciplinary interest. In particular, estimation of the inhomogeneous transport coefficients, e.g., the diffusion coefficient or the heat conductivity, which shape important processes in biology and engineering, is a challenging task. The analysis of such systems is further complicated because two alternative formulations of the inhomogeneous transport equations exist in the literature-the Smoluchowski and Fokker-Planck equations, which are also related to the so-called Ito-Stratonovich dilemma. Using the theory of statistical physics, we show that the two formulations, usually regarded as distinct models, are physically equivalent. From this result we develop efficient estimates for the transverse space-dependent diffusion coefficient in fluids near a phase boundary. Our method requires only measurements of escape probabilities and mean exit times of molecules leaving a narrow spatial region. We test our estimates in three case studies: (i) a Langevin model of a Büttikker-Landauer ratchet; atomistic molecular-dynamics simulations of liquid-water molecules in contact with (ii) vapor, and (iii) soap (surfactant) film which has promising applications in physical chemistry. Our analysis reveals that near the surfactant monolayer the mobility of water molecules is slowed down almost twice with respect to the bulk liquid. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of water correlates with the transition from hydrophilic to hydrophobic parts of the film.",,1351
1178,35973320,Primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the cecum: A rare case report.,"Primary SRCC is a rare histological colorectal cancer subtype. It is characterized by distinct clinical presentation. This case report describes a rare case of a Primary Signet-ring cell carcinoma of the cecum. A 37-year-old man came to the emergency department with bowel obstruction and altered general condition. The abdominal CT scan showed an intestinal occlusion upstream a thickening of the cecum. An exploratory laparotomy found a distention of the bowl with a suspect thickening of the cecum. The patient underwent a right ileo-colectomy and ileocolostomy. Histologic analysis of the operatory specimen confirmed the diagnosis of a primary Signet-ring cell carcinoma of the cecum. The recovery was uneventful, and the patient is in good health after six -months of follow-up. After completing the chemotherapy, the patient is scheduled for a colonoscopy and reversal of colostomy. Colorectal primary signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) is a rare entity, and it is associated with poor prognosis compared with common colorectal adenocarcinomas. characterized by distinct clinical presentation, with very poor response rates. Primary SRCC is an aggressive histological type of colon cancer and it is associated with a poor prognosis. There are no conclusive guidelines for the treatment of this type of tumor.",,1352
342,35979374,Gaps in transition readiness measurement: a comparison of instruments to a conceptual model.,"Measuring transition readiness is important when preparing young people with chronic illness for successful transition to adult care. The Expanded Socioecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness to Transition (Expanded SMART) offers a holistic view of factors that influence transition readiness and outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine conceptual congruency of transition readiness instruments with the Expanded SMART to determine the breadth and frequency of constructs measured. PubMed was searched to identify observational and experimental studies that measured transition readiness across chronic illnesses. Selected instruments were first evaluated on their development and psychometric properties. Next, reviewers independently mapped each instrument item to Expanded SMART constructs: knowledge, skills/self-efficacy, relationships/communication, psychosocial/emotions, developmental maturity, beliefs/expectations, goals/motivation. If items did not map to a construct, a new construct was named inductively through group discussion. Three instruments (TRAQ [20 items], STARx [18 items] and TRxANSITION Index [32 items]), reported in 74 studies, were identified. Across instruments, most items mapped to three constructs: skills/self-efficacy, developmental maturity, and knowledge. The psychosocial constructs of goals/motivation and psychosocial/emotions were underrepresented in the instruments. No instrument mapped to every model construct. Two new constructs: independent living and organization were identified. Constructs representing transition readiness in three frequently used transition readiness instruments vary considerably from Expanded SMART, a holistic conceptual model of transition readiness, suggesting that conceptualization and operationalization of transition readiness is not standardized. No instrument reflected all conceptual constructs of transition readiness and psychosocial constructs were underrepresented, suggesting that current instruments may provide an incomplete measurement of transition readiness.",,1353
195,35982842,Improved bandwidth and F/B ratio of a CPW-fed planar monopole antenna.,"A directional planar monopole antenna is described. The antenna comprises of a circular monopole, coplanar waveguide (CPW) feed line and a ground plane. To achieve unidirectional radiation, a stub is also attached to on the ground plane to increase the lower end impedance bandwidth and also increase the Front-to-Back ratio (F/B). The proposed antenna is etched on a 50 × 50 mm2 FR4 substrate. Simulated and experimental results reveal that the proposed antenna can achieve an impedance bandwidth from 2.3 - 10.5 GHz for S11 < -10 dB, and unidirectional radiation patterns with high gain and high efficiency.",,1354
1595,35968289,Vagus nerve stimulation for refractory posttraumatic epilepsy: Efficacy and predictors of seizure outcome.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been recognized as an important and common cause of epilepsy since antiquity. Posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) is usually associated with drug resistance and poor surgical outcomes, thereby increasing the burden of the illness on patients and their families. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an adjunctive treatment for medically refractory epilepsy. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of VNS for refractory PTE and to initially evaluate the potential predictors of efficacy. We retrospectively collected the outcomes of VNS with at least a 1-year follow-up in all patients with refractory PTE. Subgroups were classified as responders and non-responders according to the efficacy of VNS (≥50% or <50% reduction in seizure frequency). Preoperative data were analyzed to screen for potential predictors of VNS efficacy. In total, forty-five patients with refractory PTE who underwent VNS therapy were enrolled. Responders were found in 64.4% of patients, and 15.6% of patients achieved seizure freedom at the last follow-up. In addition, the responder rate increased over time, with 37.8, 44.4, 60, and 67.6% at the 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups, respectively. After multivariate analysis, generalized interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) were found to be a negative predictor (OR: 4.861, 95% CI: 1.145-20.632) of VNS efficacy. The results indicated that VNS therapy was effective in refractory PTE patients and was well tolerated over a 1-year follow-up period. Patients with focal or multifocal IEDs were recognized to have better efficacy after VNS therapy.",,1355

The average equatorial Cu-N bond lengths (2.013 and 2.026 Å for Cu-Nprim and Cu-Nsec, respectively) are substanti-ally shorter than the average axial Cu-O bond length (2.518 Å). The tetra-amine ligand adopts its energetically favored conformation with its five- and six-membered chelate rings in gauche and chair conformations, respectively. In the crystal, the N-H donor groups of the tetra-amine, the acceptor carboxyl-ate groups of the isophthalate dianion and both the coordinated water mol-ecules and the water mol-ecule of crystallization are involved in numerous N-H⋯O and O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, resulting in the formation of electroneutral layers oriented parallel to the ac plane.",,1356
2060,35967484,Two billion registered students affected by stereotyped educational environments: an analysis of gender-based color bias.,"According to the literature, educational technologies present several learning benefits to promote online education. However, there are several associated challenges, and some studies illustrate the limitations in elaborating educational technologies, called Design limitations. This aspect is responsible for unleashing various issues in the learning process, such as gender inequality, creating adverse effects on cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mediators, which opposes the fifth UN's Sustainable Development Goal. Therefore, many studies notice the harmful effects of stereotypes in educational technologies. These effects can be included in the design, like colors or other stereotyped elements, or how the activity is conducted. Based on this, the present study aimed to verify the predominance of color bias in educational technologies available on the WEB. This study developed a computational solution to calculate male and female color bias in the available educational technology web pages. The results suggest the prevalence of the development of educational technologies with a male color bias, with an imbalance among genders, without adequate customization for age groups. Furthermore, some environments, such as Computer Science, present a higher color bias for men when compared to women. Despite both scales being independent, results indicated interesting evidence of a substantial prevalence of colors associated with the male scale. According to the literature, this may be associated with dropout and lack of interest in female students, especially in sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics domains.",,1357
844,35974927,Ventricular repolarization indicators in risk stratification of decompensated heart failure patients with ventricular systolic dysfunction.,"Ventricular repolarization measurement by QTc interval and QT dispersion can recognize high-risk patients. Previous research tended to evaluate the act of repolarization indicators alone but this study aimed to elucidate their prognostic utility before and after modifying confounding parameters in risk stratification of different aspects of prognosis in decompensated heart failure patients with systolic dysfunction. Data of 98 variables were evaluated to determine their predictive value concerning arrhythmic events, in-hospital, and long-term mortality. From 858 cases that presented with acute heart failure, 19.2% (n=165) were enrolled in the study. During hospitalization, arrhythmic events and cardiac-related mortality occurred in 56(33.9%) and 11(7%) patients, respectively. QTc and QT dispersion were independent predictors of arrhythmia and in-hospital mortality after adjustment of the variables (arrhythmic events: QTc interval OR 1.085, P=0.007, QT dispersion OR 1.077, P=0.007, in-hospital mortality: QTc interval OR 1.116, P=0.009, QT dispersion OR 1.067, P=0.011). After being discharged, they were tracked for 181±56 days. Within the 16 deaths in follow-up time, 6 sudden cardiac deaths were documented. Cox regression, defined QTc as the predictor of all-cause and sudden death mortality (all-cause: HR 1.041, 95% CI 1.015-1.067, P=0.002; sudden death: HR 1.063, 95% CI 1.023-1.105, P=0.002); nevertheless, efforts to demonstrate QT dispersion as the predictor failed. The predictive nature of QT parameters was significant after modification of the variables; therefore, they should be measured for risk stratification of ventricular repolarization arrhythmia and death in decompensated heart failure patients.",,1358
1106,35974513,Active responsive colloids coupled to different thermostats.,"We introduce a model of active responsive colloids (ARCs) in which an internal degree of freedom (DoF) of a single colloidal particle is activated by coupling it to a different thermostat than for the translational DoFs. As for the responsive internal DoF, we consider specifically the size (diameter) of the spherical particles, which is confined by a harmonic parent potential being either entropic or energetic in nature. The ARCs interact via a repulsive Hertzian pair potential, appropriate to model hydrogels or elastic colloids, and are studied for various densities using Brownian dynamics simulations. We tune the internal activity in the nonequilibrium steady state by scanning through a wide range of internal temperatures, both smaller (colder) and larger (hotter) than the translational temperature. The results show a rich and intriguing behavior for the emergent property distributions, colloidal pair structure, and the diffusive translational dynamics controlled by the internal activity, substantially depending on whether the internal DoF moves in an entropic or energetic potential. We discuss theoretical thermal limits and phenomenological models which can explain some of the nonequilibrium trends qualitatively. Our study indicates that particle dynamical polydispersity as well as the structure and dynamics of dense macromolecular suspensions can be vastly tuned by internal activity in terms of internal hot or cold fluctuating states.",,1359
2400,35966955,"Savvy and woke: Gender, digital profile, social media competence, and political participation in gender issues among young Filipino netizens.","Social media has become a viable platform for political participation in issues related to gender, especially among the youth. Evidence suggests that gender and sexual identities, digital access, and skills foster political participation in social media. This study sought to determine the predictive relationship of gender, digital profile, and social media competence with social media political participation in gender issues (SMPP-GI) among young Filipino netizens through the lenses of social identity theory and resource model of political participation. A total of 1,090 college netizens aged 18-30 years old participated in this cross-sectional study. An online survey was used to collect data. The respondents reported low to moderate levels of SMPP-GI. Females and non-cisheterosexual respondents report higher scores in certain types of SMPP-GI. Respondents using more social media sites have higher levels of latent and counter engagement SMPP-GI. Among the four domains of social media competence, content generation significantly predicted all types of SMPP-GI, while content interpretation and anticipatory reflection were significantly linked with at least one type of engagement.",,1360
2330,35967047,"Fabrication of Densified Rice Husk by Sequential Hot-Compressed Water Treatment, Blending with Poly(vinyl alcohol), and Hot Pressing.","Processing agricultural wastes into densified materials to partially substitute wooden product production is significant for reducing the consumption of forest resources. This work proposes the fabrication of high-strength rice husk (RH)-based composite materials with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) via densification by hot pressing. RH was pretreated in hot-compressed water (HCW) prior to pulverization and blending with PVA or PVA/glycerol (GL). The incorporation of PVA greatly improved the strength, toughness, and waterproofness of the composite plate, which was discussed with the help of a variety of composite characterizations. The tensile strength, flexural strength, and toughness of a composite of HCW-treated RH, PVA, and GL with a mass ratio of 80:20:2 were 42, 81 MPa, and 5.9 MJ/m3, respectively. The HCW treatment and blending with PVA and GL improved those properties of the hot-pressed original RH plate by factors of 2.5, 2.3, and 6.7, respectively, and reduced the water uptake and swelling ratio in water by 57 and 53%, respectively, despite the hydrophilic nature of PVA and GL. Altogether, this work outlines a valuable and sustainable approach to the efficient utilization of agricultural wastes.",,1361
1325,35970007,Gradient electro-processing strategy for efficient conversion of harmful algal blooms to biohythane with mechanisms insight.,"Globally eruptive harmful algal blooms (HABs) have caused numerous negative effects on aquatic ecosystem and human health. Conversion of HABs into biohythane via dark fermentation (DF) is a promising approach to simultaneously cope with environmental and energy issues, but low HABs harvesting efficiency and biohythane productivity severely hinder its application. Here we designed a gradient electro-processing strategy for efficient HABs harvesting and disruption, which had intrinsic advantages of no secondary pollution and high economic feasibility. Firstly, low current density (0.888-4.444 mA/cm2) was supplied to HABs suspension to harvest biomass via electro-flocculation, which achieved 98.59% harvesting efficiency. A mathematic model considering coupling effects of multi-influencing factors on HABs harvesting was constructed to guide large-scale application. Then, the harvested HABs biomass was disrupted via electro-oxidation under higher current density (44.44 mA/cm2) to improve bioavailability for DF. As results, hydrogen and methane yields of 64.46 mL/ (g VS) and 171.82 mL/(g VS) were obtained under 6 min electro-oxidation, along with the highest energy yield (50.1 kJ/L) and energy conversion efficiency (44.87%). Mechanisms of HABs harvesting and disruption under gradient electro-processing were revealed, along with the conversion pathways from HABs to biohythane. Together, this work provides a promising strategy for efficient disposal of HABs with extra benefit of biohythane production.",,1362
1111,35974508,Residence time distributions for in-line chaotic mixers.,"We investigate the distributions of residence time for in-line chaotic mixers; in particular, we consider the Kenics, the F-mixer, and the multilevel laminating mixer and also a synthetic model that mimics their behavior and allows exact mathematical calculations. We show that whatever the number of elements of mixer involved, the distribution possesses a t^{-3} tail, so that its shape is always far from Gaussian. This t^{-3} tail also invalidates the use of second-order moment and variance. As a measure for the width of the distribution, we consider the mean absolute deviation and show that, unlike the standard deviation, it converges in the limit of large sample size. Finally, we analyze the performances of the different in-line mixers from the residence-time point of view when varying the number of elements and the shape of the cross section.",,1363

Prospective cohort study. Injury data from the National GAA Injury Surveillance Database. Elite male Gaelic football athletes. Incidence of injury as a rate per 1000 h of exposure. 38 datasets were analysed. Out of a total of 1606 time-loss injuries, 76 were back injuries (4.73%, 95% CI 3.80%-5.88%). The incidence of back injuries in match play was 1.72 (CI 95% 1.21 to 2.45) and in training was 0.2 (CI 95% 0.14 to 0.28) injuries per 1000 h of exposure. The majority of back injuries (63.16%, CI 95% 51.93-73.12) were new, as opposed to recurrent (35.53% CI 95% 25.7-46.74). Most back injuries were acute (51.32%, CI 95% 40.29-62.22), compared to chronic (31.58%, CI 95% 22.23-42.7) or overuse (11.84%, CI 95% 6.36-21.00). The majority of back injuries occurred during non-contact player activities (n = 60, 78.94% CI 95% 68.50-86.60). Back injury rates in Gaelic football are similar to soccer and Australian football but less than rugby union. Further research is needed to understand the factors leading to the onset and recurrence of back injury in Gaelic football athletes.",,1365
1444,35968454,Blood routine reference value range should be adjusted according to regional and ethnic characteristics.,"To further understand the influence of regional and ethnic factors on blood routine indicators. The routine blood test (RBT) results of 617 healthy men aged 18-45 years old of the Li, Tibet, and Han nationalities living in the city of Sanya, Hainan Province (200 m), the city of Xining, Qinghai Province (2,300 m), and Maduo County of Qinghai Province (4,300 m) for a long time were studied. Eight indexes, such as the red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and platelet (PLT) counts, were compared and analyzed. With an increase in altitude, the RBT index values and change trends of the different ethnic groups were different. When the altitude increased by 2,000 m, the RBC and Hb increased by 6.6 and 8.1%, respectively, and the PLT decreased by 16.8%. However, the RBC, Hb, and PLT of the Tibetan subjects decreased by 7.4, 5.1, and 3.0%, respectively. In the same region, there were also significant differences in the RBT index values among the ethnic groups. The RBC increased, Hb decreased, and PLT did not change in the Li nationality in Sanya compared with the Han nationality. The RBC, Hb, and PLT of Tibetans in the Xining area were significantly higher than those of the Han population. Referring to the current RBT reference value range in China, the abnormal rates of the various RBT index values of the enrolled population were high. By utilizing Hb as an example, 27.7% of the Li nationality in Sanya was low, 67.0% of the Tibetan nationality in Xining was high, and 89.4% of the Maduo Han nationality was high. The PLT was lower in the Sanya Li nationality (13.8%) and the Maduo Han nationality (88.3%). Regional and ethnic factors have a significant impact on the RBT, and the current range of normal values of the RBT in China needs to be revised and adjusted.",,1366
274,35982550,Sidestream materials show potential as top-dressed soil improvers for peatland forests.,"The effects of top-dressing of several industrial and farming sidestream materials on the growth of downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings in natural sphagnum peat soil were evaluated. Wood fly ash, industrial filter cake waste, mine tailings sand (quartz feldspar from lithium orebody), and digestate and liquid reject of cow manure from a biogas plant were studied for their physical and chemical properties, as well as for their effects as soil ameliorants on seedling growth during one growing period in a greenhouse. Each material was top-dressed on unfertilised peat in pots in quantities that corresponded to the amounts of ash used in Finnish peatland forest fertilisation (2-6 t ha-1). During growing, the pH of percolate water from the growing pots was below 4, and in the treatments with filter cake even below 3. However, no clear impairment of seedling growth due to acidity was observed. In all treatments, birch and pine seedlings grew at least as well as in the unfertilised peat (control treatment). Growth was strongest in the peat top-dressed with additives originating from cow manure, in which the high N and P contents promoted growth so much that foliar N was found to be diluted with respect to a high P content in the birch seedlings. No harmful concentrations of heavy metal residues were observed from the materials used. Overall, the results suggest that all the used sidestream materials show potential as soil improvers on forested peatlands.",,1367
2037,35967549,"A multicenter, randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial, comparing nasal continuous positive airway pressure with nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation as primary support before minimally invasive surfactant administration for preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (the NIV-MISA-RDS trial): Study protocol.","Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) treatment has been developed to minimize lung damage and to avoid invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in preterm infants, especially in those with a gestational age of <30 weeks. Our hypothesis is that for preterm infants <30 weeks with potential to develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is non-inferior to the nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) as primary respiratory support before minimal invasive surfactant administration (MISA). The NIV-MISA-RDS trial is planned as an unblinded, multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority trial at 14 tertiary neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in China. Eligible infants are preterm infants of 24-29+6 weeks of gestational age who have spontaneous breaths at birth and require primary NIV support for RDS. Infants are randomized 1:1 to treatment with either NCPAP or NIPPV once admitted into NICUs. If an infant presents progressively aggravated respiratory distress and is clinically diagnosed as having RDS, pulmonary surfactant will be supplemented by MISA in the first 2 h of life. The primary outcome is NIV treatment failure within 72 h after birth. With a specified non-inferiority margin of 10%, using a two-sided 95% CI and 80% power, the study requires 480 infants per group (in total 960 infants). Current evidence shows that NIV and MISA may be the most effective strategy for minimizing IMV in preterm infants with RDS. However, there are few large randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of NCPAP and NIPPV as the primary respiratory support after birth and before surfactant administration. We will conduct this trial to test the hypothesis that NCPAP is not inferior to NIPPV as the initial respiratory support in reducing the use of IMV in premature infants who have spontaneous breaths after birth and who do not require intubation in the first 2 h after birth. The study will provide clinical data for the selection of the initial non-invasive ventilation mode in preterm infants with a gestational age of <30 weeks with spontaneous breaths after birth. https://register.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT05137340.",,1368
591,35977906,Hospital mortality and prognostic factors in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and cancer undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy.,"Whether continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) should be applied to critically ill patients with both acute kidney injury (AKI) and cancer remains controversial because of poor expected outcomes. The present study determined prognostic factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality in patients with AKI and cancer undergoing CRRT. We included 471 patients with AKI and cancer who underwent CRRT at the intensive care unit of a Korean tertiary hospital from 2013 to 2020, and classified them by malignancy type. The primary outcomes were 28-day all-cause mortality rate and prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was renal replacement therapy (RRT) dependency at hospital discharge. The 28-day mortality rates were 58.8% and 82% in the solid and hematologic malignancy groups, respectively. Body mass index (BMI), presence of oliguria, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and albumin level were common predictors of 28-day mortality in the solid and hematologic malignancy groups. A high heart rate and the presence of severe acidosis were prognostic factors only in the solid malignancy group. Among the survivors, the proportion with RRT dependency was 25.0% and 33.3% in the solid and hematologic malignancy groups, respectively. The 28-day mortality rate of cancer patients with AKI undergoing CRRT was high in both the solid and hematologic malignancy groups. BMI, presence of oliguria, SOFA score, and albumin level were common predictors of 28-day mortality in the solid and hematologic malignancy groups, but a high heart rate and severe acidosis were prognostic factors only in the solid malignancy group.",,1369
605,35977866,The association between household wealth and the prevalence of child disability and specific functional limitations: Analysis of nationally representative cross-sectional surveys in 40 low- and middle-income countries.,"It is commonly stated that people with disabilities are at significantly greater risk of living in poverty than their non-disabled peers. However, most evidence supporting this assertion is drawn from studies in high-income countries and studies of adults. There is relatively little robust evidence on the association between poverty/wealth and the prevalence of child disability in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To estimate the strength of association between an indicator of wealth (household assets) and the prevalence of disability among children in a range of LMICs. Secondary analysis of data collected in Round 6 of UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Nationally representative data were available for 40 countries with a total sample size of 473,578 children aged 2-17. Disability was ascertained by responses to the Washington Group for Disability Statistics module on functional limitations. There were significant dose-dependent relationships between household wealth quintile and the prevalence of disability and 13 of the 15 specific functional difficulties associated with disability. Children living in the poorest 20% of households were 35% more likely to have a disability than children living in the most affluent 20% of households. The strength of the association between household wealth and the prevalence of child disability was markedly lower in low-income countries than in middle-income countries. r CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide robust evidence that in LMICs the prevalence of child disability is disproportionately concentrated in poorer households. Further research is required to better understand why this association appears to be weaker in low-income countries. c.",,1370

1075,35974544,Chaos and thermalization in a classical chain of dipoles.,"We explore the connection between chaos, thermalization, and ergodicity in a linear chain of N interacting dipoles. Starting from the ground state, and considering chains of different numbers of dipoles, we introduce single site excitations with excess energy ΔK. The time evolution of the chaoticity of the system and the energy localization along the chain is analyzed by computing, up to a very long time, the statistical average of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent λ(t) and the participation ratio Π(t). For small ΔK, the evolution of λ(t) and Π(t) indicates that the system becomes chaotic at approximately the same time as Π(t) reaches a steady state. For the largest considered values of ΔK the system becomes chaotic at an extremely early stage in comparison with the energy relaxation times. We find that this fact is due to the presence of chaotic breathers that keep the system far from equipartition and ergodicity. Finally, we show numerically and analytically that the asymptotic values attained by the participation ratio Π(t) fairly correspond to thermal equilibrium.",,1372
1772,35967899,Prescribing or co-designing exercise in healthy adults? Effects on mental health and interoceptive awareness.,"Universal exercise recommendations for adults neglect individual preferences, changing constraints, and their potential impact on associated health benefits. A recent proposal suggests replacing the standardized World Health Organisation (WHO) exercise recommendations for healthy adults by co-designed interventions where individuals participate actively in the decisions about the selected physical activities and the effort regulation. This study contrasts the effects on mental health and interoceptive awareness of a co-designed and co-adapted exercise intervention with an exercise program based on the WHO recommendations for healthy adults. Twenty healthy adults (10 men and 10 women, 40-55 y.o.) participated voluntarily in the research. They were randomly assigned to a co-designed exercise intervention (CoD group) and a prescribed exercise program (WHO group). Supervised online by specialized personal trainers, both programs lasted 9 weeks and were equivalent in volume and intensity. The effects of the exercise intervention were tested through personal interviews, questionnaires (DASS-21 and MAIA) and a cardiorespiratory exercise test. Intragroup differences (pre-post) were assessed using the Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test and intergroup differences through Student's t-tests. Effect sizes were calculated through Cohen's d. Interviews were analyzed through thematic analysis. Eleven participants completed the intervention (CoD = 8, WHO = 5). Both groups improved, but non significantly, their cardiorespiratory testing results, and no differences were found between them post-intervention. Mental health was only enhanced in the CoD group (p < 0.001), and interoceptive awareness improved in seven of the eight scales in the CoD group (p < 0.001) and only in 3 scales in the WHO group (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the co-designed intervention was more effective for developing mental health, interoceptive awareness, autonomy, and exercise self-regulation than the WHO-based exercise program.",,1373
2070,35967448,Antimicrobial Proteins and Peptides in Avian Eggshell: Structural Diversity and Potential Roles in Biomineralization.,"The calcitic avian eggshell provides physical protection for the embryo during its development, but also regulates water and gaseous exchange, and is a calcium source for bone mineralization. The calcified eggshell has been extensively investigated in the chicken. It is characterized by an inventory of more than 900 matrix proteins. In addition to proteins involved in shell mineralization and regulation of its microstructure, the shell also contains numerous antimicrobial proteins and peptides (AMPPs) including lectin-like proteins, Bacterial Permeability Increasing/Lipopolysaccharide Binding Protein/PLUNC family proteins, defensins, antiproteases, and chelators, which contribute to the innate immune protection of the egg. In parallel, some of these proteins are thought to be crucial determinants of the eggshell texture and its resulting mechanical properties. During the progressive solubilization of the inner mineralized eggshell during embryonic development (to provide calcium to the embryo), some antimicrobials may be released simultaneously to reinforce egg defense and protect the egg from contamination by external pathogens, through a weakened eggshell. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the diversity of avian eggshell AMPPs, their three-dimensional structures and their mechanism of antimicrobial activity. The published chicken eggshell proteome databases are integrated for a comprehensive inventory of its AMPPs. Their biochemical features, potential dual function as antimicrobials and as regulators of eggshell biomineralization, and their phylogenetic evolution will be described and discussed with regard to their three-dimensional structural characteristics. Finally, the repertoire of chicken eggshell AMPPs are compared to orthologs identified in other avian and non-avian eggshells. This approach sheds light on the similarities and differences exhibited by AMPPs, depending on bird species, and leads to a better understanding of their sequential or dual role in biomineralization and innate immunity.",,1374
829,35974942,Hydrocephalus associated to posterior fossa tumor-like sarcoidosis: A case report and literature review.,"Intracranial inflammatory pseudotumors (IIPT) are one of the differential diagnosis for the central nervous system (CNS) tumors. They represent a rare condition that may mimic clinically and radiologically intracranial tumors and induce their complications. Among their etiologies, neurosarcoidosis is one of the less known and less frequent. To the best of our knowledge, only two cases of posterior fossa IIPT have been reported in the literature. We present here the 3rd case related to a neurosarcoidosis. We report the case of a 55-year-old female patient who presented with an altered state of consciousness associated to severe intracranial hypertension syndrome for four months. Glasgow coma scale on admission was 14/15. Brain imaging revealed bilateral cerebellar micronodular meningeal enhancement regarding the mesencephalon and the pons, as well as a nodular lesion of the 4th ventricle causing a triventricular acute hydrocephalus. The patient had a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt with a favorable outcome. Afterwards, she underwent a salivary gland biopsy which confirmed the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis. Posterior fossa IIPT are very rare, mainly when located in the posterior fossa, leading to confusion with other pathologies. MRI has an important role in the diagnosis of these lesions, and the determination of their etiology. It shows other than the IIPT itself, many other signs such as leptomeningeal enhancement, nodular lesions or pituitary stalk thickening. These signs can orientate towards the diagnosis. Treatment may associate to symptomatic approach, corticosteroids. Surgical resection may be proposed when the diagnosis remains doubtful.",,1375

Water and the atmosphere are the major transport pathways for PFASs in the environment, while water, soil and sediment are sinks. Herein, the concentrations and distributions of traditional and emerging PFASs in multi-environmental media samples in the Qiantang River watershed were comprehensively investigated. Twenty-five PFASs, including seven emerging PFASs, were identified. The concentrations in water, soil, sediment and PM2.5 ranged from 3.58 to 786 ng L-1, 0.72 to 12.3 ng g-1, 0.73 to 6.60 ng g-1, and 93.9 to 255 pg m-3, respectively, with mean concentrations of 149 ng L-1, 4.70 ng g-1, 4.31 ng g-1, and 156 pg m-3. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the dominant contaminant in water, soil, and sediment, and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) was the dominant contaminant in PM2.5. Hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA) and 6 : 2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6 : 2 Cl-PFESA), as substitutes for PFOA and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), were detected, indicating the gradual replacement of traditional PFOA and PFOS in this area. Perfluoro-3,6-dioxaheptanoic acid (NFDHA), as a component of the aqueous film-forming foam FN-3, was first detected in this area. Short-chain PFASs were mainly distributed in water and PM2.5, while long-chain PFASs were distributed in the solid phase, such as soil, sediment, and PM2.5. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), the major PFAS sources were emulsifiers from fluorine polymerization and surface-active agents from the textile, papermaking, leather, and other industries. In addition, correlation analysis showed that water was the main source and transport pathway of short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid (PFCA), HFPO-DA, and NFDHA in this area, while the atmosphere combined with PM2.5 was the main transport pathway for both short- and long-chain PFCAs, PFOS, and 6 : 2 Cl-PFESA.",,1376
1234,35971411,Amide-Driven Secondary Building Unit Structural Transformations between Zn(II) Coordination Polymers.,"The behavior of coordination polymers (CPs) against external stimuli has witnessed remarkable attention, especially when the resulting CPs present reversible molecular arrays. Accordingly, CPs with these characteristics can lead to differences in their properties owing to these structural differences, being promising for their use as potential molecular switches with diverse applications. Herein, we have synthesized four Zn(II) CPs bearing α-acetamidocinnamic acid (HACA) and 4,4'-bipyridine (4,4'-bipy). The reaction between Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, HACA, and 4,4'-bipy yields {[Zn(ACA)2(4,4'-bipy)]·EtOH} n (1), which was used for the formation of three CPs through dissolution-recrystallization structural transformations (DRSTs): {[Zn(ACA)2(4,4'-bipy)]·2MeOH} n (2), {[Zn2(μ-ACA)2(ACA)2(4,4'-bipy)]·2H2O} n (3), and {[Zn3(μ-ACA)6(4,4'-bipy)]·0.75CHCl3} n (4). The study of the four crystal structures revealed that their secondary building units (SBUs) comprise monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric arrangements linked by 4,4'-bipy ligands. The fundamental role of the utilized solvent and/or temperature, as well as their effect on the orientation of the amide moieties driving the formation of the different SBUs is discussed. Furthermore, the reversibility and interconversion between the four CPs have been assayed. Finally, their solid-state photoluminescence has evinced that the effect of the amide moieties not only predetermine a different SBU but also lead to a different emission in 4 compared with 1-3.",,1377
3,35985730,Structural Competency in Health Care.,"The pandemics of COVID-19, systemic racism, and accelerating climate crises that have unfolded over the last 2 years highlight how social structures bear significant and disparate effects on individual health. The framework of structural competency offers a new way to understand and respond to health inequities in clinical care and health services delivery. Clinicians can work toward achieving structural competency at the individual, interpersonal, clinic, and community levels using the interventions described in the article.",,1378
1520,35968366,How does the use of simultaneous contrast illusion on product-background color combination nudge consumer behavior? A behavioral and event-related potential study.,"Color, as one of the most critical visual factors influencing consumer decisions, has been widely used in e-commerce marketing. However, the effects of product-background saturation combination on consumers' willingness to purchase products with different heaviness attributes (e.g., heaviness-positive products or heaviness-negative products) have not been conclusively determined. The current study demonstrated the effects of product-background saturation combination on product heaviness perception and its downstream consequences. Based on behavioral method, study 1 showed that a patch of color placed in a pale background (the saturation of the background is lower than the saturation of the color patch) was perceived as visually heavier than that in a colorful background (the saturation of the background is higher than the saturation of the color patch). Study 2 applied event-related potentials (ERPs) method to explore the underlying neural mechanisms of how the interactions between the presentation modes and the product types affect consumer decisions. Behaviorally, compared to the colorful background, the pale background would lead to a higher purchase rate for the heaviness-positive products, whereas the opposite results were found for the heaviness-negative products. Furthermore, for both the heaviness-positive and heaviness-negative products, a shorter reaction time would be observed in the pale background condition than in the colorful background condition. Neurophysiologically, the pale background would result in smaller N2 component and larger P3 component compared to the colorful background for the heaviness-positive products, while the reverse held for the heaviness-negative products. Smaller N2 component implies decreased perceptual conflicts and larger P3 component implies increased decision confidence, suggesting that e-retailers should present heaviness-positive products with pale backgrounds and heaviness-negative products with colorful backgrounds.",,1379
915,35974805,Carbapenemase Inhibitors: Updates on Developments in 2021.,"Carbapenem resistance, an emerging global health problem, compromises the treatment of infections caused by nosocomial pathogens. Preclinical and clinical trials demonstrate that a new generation of carbapenemases inhibitors, together with the recently approved avibactam, relebactam and vaborbactam, would address this resistance. Our review summarizes the latest developments related to carbapenemase inhibitors synthesized to date, as well as their spectrum of activity and their current stage of development. A particular focus will be on β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations that could potentially be used to treat infections caused by carbapenemase-producer pathogens. These new combinations mark a critical step forward the fight against antimicrobial resistance.",,1380
645,35976774,Synthesis and Photophysical Characterizations of Pyrroloquinolone Photosensitizers for Singlet Oxygen Production1.,"A series of pyrroloquinolone photosensitizers bearing different halogen substituents (Cl, Br, I) on the heterocyclic framework was studied. These structures were readily prepared through a multi-step synthetic sequence involving an oxidative protocol as an important step to access the quinolone framework. Spectroscopic characterizations and computational investigations were carried out to study the dyes before and after the oxidative step. Interestingly, the fluorescence emission was significantly reduced upon oxidation. In spite of a low photostability under UV light, the pyrroloquinolone photosensitizers proved effective to produce singlet oxygen. Higher singlet oxygen quantum yields were obtained with photosensitizers bearing halogen atoms with a higher atomic number.",,1381
808,35975013,Use of potentially inappropriate medications for heart failure according to the three sets of heart failure-specific criteria in Thai older patients with heart failure.,"To study the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications for patients with heart failure (PIMHF) use and to identify factors associated with PIMHF use in Thai older HF patients. This cross-sectional analytical survey included data on older (≥ 60 years) HF patients obtained from the electronic medical record databases of secondary- and tertiary-care hospitals. The medication profiles of patients were assessed to examine whether they were prescribed any PIMHF after an HF diagnosis. For PIMHF detection, the HF-specific criteria, including 2014 St Vincent criteria, 2019 Beers criteria, and 2021 Thailand criteria were applied. The prevalence of PIMHF use was expressed as percentages. The associated factors were identified using a binary logistic regression analysis, expressed as the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). A total of 2,639 patients were included in the study. Thirty-two PIMHF were found to have been prescribed to these patients. The prevalence of PIMHF use identified by the ST Vincent criteria, the Beers criteria, the Thailand criteria, and the three combined criteria was 23.76%, 19.67%, 21.18%, and 25.16%, respectively. The factors associated with PIMHF use were secondary-care hospital (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.26-1.87), HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (aOR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.38-2.38), hypertension (HTN) (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.02-1.51), diabetes mellitus (DM) (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.10-1.75), chronic pulmonary diseases (CPD) (aOR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.56-2.80), and connective tissue diseases (CTD) (aOR = 5.10, 95% CI: 2.20-11.83). PIMHF are commonly used in Thai older HF patients. The factors associated with PIMHF use identified in this study include secondary-care hospital, HFpEF, HTN, DM, CPD, and CTD.",,1382

(2022 ▸). Acta Cryst. E78, 732-736]. The structure of the new polymorph is stabilized by a C-H⋯O hydrogen bond that links mol-ecules into chains. These chains are linked by face-to-face π-π stacking inter-actions, resulting in a layered structure. Short inter-mol-ecular Br⋯O contacts and van der Waals inter-actions between the layers aid in the cohesion of the crystal packing. In the previously reported form-1, C-H⋯Br inter-actions connect mol-ecules into zigzag chains, which are linked by C-Br⋯π inter-actions into layers, whereas the van der Waals inter-actions between the layers stabilize the crystal packing of form-2. Hirshfeld mol-ecular surface analysis was used to compare the inter-molecular inter-actions of the polymorphs.",,1383
2344,35967032,Formation of a Pt-MgO Solid Solution: Analysis by X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy.,"Thermal treatment of Pt nanoparticles or Pt(acac)2 supported on MgO resulted in the formation of a solid solution of Pt-MgO, as evidenced by Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The valence of Pt in the Pt-MgO solid solution was determined to be 4+. A characteristic shrinkage of the Pt-O bond distance was observed in comparison with that of the nearest-neighboring Mg-O bond in MgO, which agreed with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The segregation of Pt and MgO proceeded with a further increase in the thermal treatment temperature up to 1273 K. The dispersion of Pt on MgO measured through CO adsorption was much higher than that on Al2O3 or SiO2 owing to the formation of the Pt-MgO solid solution.",,1384
1504,35968383,Developing a digital archive system for imperial Chinese robe in the Qing Dynasty.,"The digital archive of cultural heritage provides new opportunities for the protection of the cultural heritage and the development of online museums. One of the essential requirements for the digitization is to achieve accurate color reproduction. Taking the Imperial Chinese robes in the Qing Dynasty as an example, this study aims to develop a digital achieve system to digitize the robes using a high-end imaging system and accurately reproduce their color properties on a display. Currently, there has been very limited study focused on the color reproduction of silk fabrics or other textile materials. The conventional color management process using a traditional color chart, however, may not be suitable for the reproduction of silk fabrics because they have very high gloss. To address this difficulty, a unique Qianlong Palette color chart, consisting of 210 silk fabric samples, has been specifically produced for optimizing the color reproduction of silk fabrics and a color image reproduction system has been developed for the digitization and archiving of the clothing fabric for the royal court. Color characterization models using both the Qianlong Palette color chart and the traditional color chart, and different mapping methods, are compared and the model with highest accuracy used in a self-programmed interface for automatically processing textile images in the future. Finally, the digital archive system has been validated using six garments of silk fabric relics. The color differences after the color image reproduction are all less than 3.00ΔE* ab , indicating acceptable color reproduction of the system. The images after color reproduction have also been evaluated subjectively by experts from the museum and the results are considered satisfactory. Our results show that the newly designed Qianlong Palette color chart exhibits superior performance over the conventional color chart in effectively predicting the color of the silk fabrics. The self-programmed graphical user interface for image color management can serve as a powerful tool to truly reproduce the color of various silk fabric relics in museums in the future and digitally archive those valuable cultural relics for different uses.",,1385
920,35974770,Pd(ii)-catalyzed meta-C-H bromination and chlorination of aniline and benzoic acid derivatives.,"The classic electrophilic bromination leads to ortho- and para-bromination of anilines due to their electron-rich properties. Herein we report the development of an unprecedented Pd-catalyzed meta-C-H bromination of aniline derivatives using commercially available N-bromophthalimide (NBP), which overcomes the competing ortho/para-selectivity of electrophilic bromination of anilines. The addition of acid additives is crucial for the success of this reaction. A broad range of substrates with various substitution patterns can be tolerated in this reaction. Moreover, benzoic acid derivatives bearing complex substitution patterns are also viable with this mild bromination reaction, and meta-C-H chlorination is also feasible under similar reaction conditions. The ease of the directing group removal and subsequent diverse transformations of the brominated products demonstrate the application potential of this method and promise new opportunities for drug discovery.",,1386
162,35983119,Comparison of two drainage parameters on diuretic renogram in predicting the fate of prenatally detected pelvi-ureteric junction-like obstruction.,"In infants with suspected pelviureteric junction (PUJ) like obstruction, we compared the drainage patterns suggested by t 1/2 and normalized residual activity (NORA) to determine which parameter can differentiate obstructive from nonobstructive dilatation and thus predict the need for surgery. Infants presenting with prenatally detected PUJ-like obstruction from January 2014 to March 2020 were evaluated with ultrasonography. Diuretic renogram was performed using Tc99m ethylene dicysteine using the F0 protocol. Subjects with a differential renal function >40% were included in the study. The t ½ values were noted. NORA was calculated by dividing the tracer values at 60 min with the values at 2 min. The infants were followed using ultrasonography. Renogram was repeated if there was increase in hydronephrosis or after 6 months if hydronephrosis did not regress. The follow-up was continued till a decision for pyeloplasty was made or the hydronephrosis regressed. Pyeloplasty was advised if differential function dropped to below 40%. 34 patients met the inclusion criteria. NORA and t ½ had very poor concordance in defining the drainage pattern. t ½ values did not correlate with the need for surgery or conservative management (P ≥ 0.05). Good drainage pattern by NORA was associated with regression of hydronephrosis (P ≤ 0.001). NORA predicted obstruction more accurately. NORA can define good drainage in a much larger subset of patients with PUJ-like obstruction who eventually do not need surgery. However, further multicenter studies are needed to confirm this.",,1387
1315,35970057,Olive oil authentication based on quantitative β-carotene Raman spectra detection.,"β-carotene and oleic acids are important molecules to distinguish between extra olive oil (EVOO) and other oils. To identify adulteration which use common vegetable oils blended with β-carotene to imitate EVOO, a non-invasive, lossless method is proved to be effective. The present work presents a laser confocal Raman technique for analyzing and comparing the differences of molecule between EVOO and SSO, which based on theoretical Raman spectra of β-carotene, oleic acids and linoleic acids calculated by density functional theory (DFT). Chemometrics based on support vector regression (SVR) was used to realize quantitative analysis of β-carotene in synthetic olive oils. Nine different volume ratios were prepared independently, and test set evaluation index of linear kernel of SVR as follow: RMSE 0.0653, R2 0.9868. The results show that laser confocal Raman technique, combined with theoretical Raman spectra based on DFT, could analyze composition of vegetable oil accurately, and identify low-cost imitation of olive oil.",,1388
1060,35974559,Stationary states in two-lane traffic: Insights from kinetic theory.,"Kinetics of dilute heterogeneous traffic on a two-lane road is formulated in the framework of Ben-Naim-Krapivsky model and stationary state properties are analytically derived in the asymptotic limit. The heterogeneity is introduced into the model as a quenched disorder in desired speeds of vehicles. The two-lane model assumes that each vehicle or platoon in a lane moves ballistically until it approaches a slow-moving vehicle or platoon and then joins it. Vehicles in a platoon are assumed to escape the platoon at a constant rate by changing lanes after which they continue to move at their desired speeds. Each lane is assumed to have a different escape rate. As the stationary state is approached, the platoon densities in the two lanes become equal, whereas the vehicle densities and fluxes are higher in the lane with lower escape rate. A majority of the vehicles enjoy a free flow if the harmonic mean of the escape rates of the lanes is comparable to average initial flux on the road. The average platoon size is close to unity in the free-flow regime. If the harmonic mean is lower than the average initial flux, then vehicles with desired speeds lower than a characteristic speed v^{*} still enjoy free flow while those vehicles with desired speeds that are greater than v^{*} experience congestion and form platoons behind the slower vehicles. The characteristic speed depends on the mean of escape times [R=(R_{1}+R_{-1})/2] of the two lanes (represented by 1 and -1) as v^{*}∼R^{-1/μ+2}, where μ is the exponent of the quenched disorder distribution for desired speed in the small speed limit. The average platoon size in a lane, when v^{*}≪1, is proportional to R^{μ+1/μ+2} plus a lane-dependent correction. Equations for the kinetics of platoon size distribution for two-lane traffic are also studied. It is shown that a stationary state with platoons as large as road length can occur only if the mean escape rate is independent of platoon size.",,1389
707,35975224,Reliability and Utility of Standard Gene Sequence Barcodes for the Identification and Differentiation of Cyst Nematodes of the Genus Heterodera.,"Difficulties inherent in the morphological identification of cyst nematodes of the genus Heterodera Schmidt, 1871, an important lineage of plant parasites, has led to broad adoption of molecular methods for diagnosing and differentiating species. The pool of publicly available sequence data has grown significantly over the past few decades, and over half of all known species of Heterodera have been characterized using one or more molecular markers commonly employed in DNA barcoding (18S, internal transcribed spacer [ITS], 28S, coxI). But how reliable are these data and how useful are these four markers for differentiating species? We downloaded all 18S, ITS, 28S, and coxI gene sequences available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, GenBank, for all species of Heterodera for which data were available. Using a combination of sequence comparison and tree-based phylogenetic methods, we evaluated this dataset for erroneous or otherwise problematic sequences and examined the utility of each molecular marker for the delineation of species. Although we find the rate of obviously erroneous sequences to be low, all four molecular markers failed to differentiate between at least one species pair. Our results suggest that while a combination of multiple markers is best for species identification, the coxI marker shows the most utility for species differentiation and should be favored over 18S, ITS, and 28S, where resources are limited. Presently, less than half the valid species of Heterodera have a sequence of coxI available, and only a third have more than one sequence of this marker.",,1390
1583,35968301,Update in autoimmune and paraneoplastic myelopathies: Newly described antigen targets and antibody testing.,"Myelopathy is an increasingly recognized presentation of many antibody-mediated neuroinflammatory disorders. While specific features of certain autoimmune myelopathies such as aquaporin-4 antibody associated neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein associated disorder (MOGAD) are well-characterized, other less commonly seen antibody-associated myelopathies are not as well-defined. These include but are not limited to, Hu/ANNA1, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), anti-CV2/collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP5), and amphiphysin. Here, we review the mentioned more common antibody mediated myelopathies as well those that as less common, followed by a review of differentials that may mimic these disorders.",,1391
1052,35974567,Vacuum breakdown in magnetic dipole wave by 10-PW class lasers.,"The vacuum breakdown by 10-PW-class lasers is studied in the optimal configuration of laser beams in the form of an m-dipole wave, which maximizes the magnetic field. Using 3D PIC simulations we calculated the threshold of vacuum breakdown, which is about 10 PW. We examined in detail the dynamics of particles and identified particle trajectories which contribute the most to vacuum breakdown in such highly inhomogeneous fields. We analyzed the dynamics of the electron-positron plasma distribution on the avalanche stage. It is shown that the forming plasma structures represent concentric toroidal layers and the interplay between particle ensembles from different spatial regions favors vacuum breakdown. Based on the angular distribution of charged particles and gamma photons a way to experimentally identify the process of vacuum breakdown is proposed.",,1392
1441,35968457,Factors related to the length of stay for major depressive disorder patients in China: A real-world retrospective study.,"As numerous patients with depression have to be hospitalized because of various reasons, the demand far exceeds the limited bed count in the psychiatry department. Controlling the length of stay (LOS) of the patient is gradually being considered an effective method to alleviate this problem. Given the lack of statistical evidence of the LOS of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in China and the strain on the limited psychiatric resources, the purpose of our study was to investigate the LOS of patients with MDD among in-patient samples and to analyze related factors of the LOS in China by building a regression model. The data were exported from the electronic medical record system. A total of three categories of independent variables were enrolled in our study, namely, demographic, clinical, and biochemical. Univariate analysis and binominal regression analysis were applied comprehensively to find the factors related to the LOS among MDD samples. The discrimination accuracy of the model was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. ROC analysis indicated that the discrimination accuracy of our model was acceptable (AUC = 0.790, 95% CI = 0.714-0.865, P < 0.001). A total of 254 patients were finally brought into analysis after filtering. Regression analysis indicated that abnormal LDL was the only risk factor of long LOS (OR = 3.352, 95% CI = 1.087-10.337, P = 0.035) among all the kinds of variables. Notably, in the statistically irrelevant factors of the LOS, the category of anti-depressant drugs [serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)] prescribed to patients with MDD was not associated statistically with the LOS, which was against our initial hypothesis that the LOS of patients with MDD treated with SNRI would vary from that of the patients treated with SSRI. Up to our knowledge, our research is the first study to show the potential factors related to the LOS from various domains, especially biochemical indexes, and the effect of drugs, among clinical patients with MDD in China. Our results could provide a theoretical reference for efficient psychiatry hospitalization management and prioritization of allocating medical resources. Future studies are required for updating independent variables which are potentially related to the LOS and verifying existing results in a larger sample.",,1393
1396,35968621,The role of multi-modal intra-operative neurophysiological monitoring in corrective surgeries for thoracic tuberculosis with kyphosis.,"The aim of this study was to assess the performance and utility of motor evoked potentials (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) during corrective surgery for thoracic tuberculosis with kyphosis (TTK). 68 patients (mean age 31.7 ± 20.3 years) who underwent corrective surgery for TTK from 2012 to 2019 were included in this retrospective study. Patients were neurologicaly evaluated before and after surgery with systematic neurologic examinations. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) with SSEP and MEP was carried out. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under ROC curve (AUC) were used to identify the diagnostic accuracy of potential recovery. IONM alerting occurred in 12 surgeries (12/68, 17.6%), of which 6 were SSEP alerting, 2 MEP alerting, and 4 combinations of both SSEP and MEP. Among the 12 cases where there was IONM alerting, 3 (25%) had postoperative neurological deficits(PND), whereas one patient had PND without IONM alerting. IONM sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 (95% CI 0.22-0.99) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.74-0.93) respectively. Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 0.25 and 0.98 respectively. The AUC of evoked potential recovery in diagnosing PND was 0.884. Our study showed that multi-modal IONM with SSEP and MEP can effectively indicate a potential neural injury and predict PND during TTK corrective surgery. Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",,1394
1299,35970648,Association between postoperative hemodynamic metrics of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction and clinical outcomes after left ventricular assist device implantation.,"While preoperative hemodynamic risk factors associated with early right heart failure (RHF) following left ventricular assist device (LVAD) surgery are well-established, the relationship between postoperative hemodynamic status and subsequent outcomes remains poorly defined. We analyzed adult CF-LVAD patients from the STS-INTERMACS registry surviving at least 3 months without evidence of early RHF and with hemodynamic data available at 3 months after LVAD implant. The association between metrics of RV afterload and function and the subsequent risk of death, right heart failure (RHF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), or stroke were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling. Among 1,050 patients with available 3-month hemodynamics, pulmonary hypertension was common, with 585 (55.7%) having mPAP ≥ 20 mm Hg and 164 (15.6%) having PVR ≥ 3 WU. Pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi, HR 0.62 per log-increase for values < 3, 95% CI 0.43-0.89) and PVR (HR 1.19 per 1 WU-increase for values > 1.5 WU, 95% CI 1.03-1.38) were independently associated with the composite of death or RHF. Postoperative RAP (HR 1.18 per 5 mm Hg increase, 95% CI 1.04-1.33), RAP:PCWP (HR 1.46 per log-increase, 95% CI 1.12-1.91), and PAPi (HR 0.76 per log-increase, 95% CI 0.61-0.95) were each associated with GIB risk. Postoperative hemodynamics was not associated with stroke risk. Hemodynamic metrics of postoperative RV dysfunction and elevated RV afterload are independently associated with RHF, mortality and GIB. Whether strategies targeting postoperative optimization of RV function and afterload can reduce the burden of these adverse events requires prospective study.",,1395
1254,35971361,The Mystery of a Unilateral Headache Ultimately Diagnosed as Moyamoya Disease.,"Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare chronic cerebrovascular occlusive disease characterized by progressive stenosis or occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid arteries and their proximal branches, with subsequent abnormally formed collateral vessels. Moyamoya disease is typically found in children of East Asian descent and is the most common pediatric cerebrovascular pathology in East Asian populations. However, moyamoya disease can be present without any predisposing factors, and this is what distinguishes the disease from the syndrome. Moyamoya syndrome is typically associated with other conditions such as sickle cell disease or neurofibromatosis. The syndrome can also be seen in patients who have had exposure to cervical or neck radiation. We present a rare case of an adult Peruvian woman who initially presented with a severe right hemispherical headache, which was ultimately diagnosed as MMD. This report and the discussion aim to provide more understanding of moyamoya disease and how it can be incidentally discovered in an unsuspected patient without any predisposing factors. The fact that the patient lacked any predisposing factors makes moyamoya disease, and not the syndrome, the diagnosis. Currently available treatments are limited. One specialized therapeutic approach is a procedure called encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS), which aims to involve the transposition of a segment of a scalp artery onto the surface of the brain to permit the additional formation of collateral arteries. We aim to highlight the management and treatment of a case of moyamoya presenting as a severe right hemispherical headache in a patient without any predisposing factors.",,1396
1484,35968408,Guided multi-scale refinement network for camouflaged object detection.,"The purpose of camouflaged object detection (COD) is to identify the hidden camouflaged object in an input image. Compared with other binary segmentation tasks like salient object detection, COD needs to deal with more complex scenes, such as low contrast, similar foreground and background. In this work, we proposed a novel guided multi-scale refinement network for COD. Specifically, we first design a global perception module for coarse localization by stacking multi-scale residual block on the top of the backbone in a recurrent manner. Then, we propose the guided multi-scale refinement module to refine such initial prediction progressively, which is combined with multi-level side-output features in a prediction-to-feature fusion strategy. By plugging into side-output features for multi-scale guidance, the missing object parts and false detection can be well remedied. Experimental results show that our proposed network can more accurately locate the camouflaged object and salient object with sharpened details than existing state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, our model is also very efficient and compact, which enables potential real-world applications.",,1397
1819,35967821,Structural characterization and bioactivity evaluation of water-extractable polysaccharides from chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) seeds.,"Two water-extractable polysaccharide fractions designated as CWP (7. 37 × 105 Da) and CWP-0.2 (1.58 × 104 Da) were isolated and purified from chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) seeds. The chemical structure of the two polysaccharides was characterized by various methods. Monosaccharide composition and methylation analysis showed that CWP was composed of Man and Glc in a molar ratio of 44.6:55.4, and CWP-0.2 was composed of Rha, Ara, Man, Glc, and Gal in a molar ratio of 10.6:23.3:5.2:4.9:56. Further structural characterization indicated that the main chain connection of CWP was → (2-β-d-Fruf-1) n →, and the main chain connection of CWP-0.2 was explored as → 2,4)-α-l-Rhap-(1 → 3)-α-d-Galp-(1 → with the branched chain of → 2,4)-α-l-Rhap-(1 → o-4. Besides, both CWP and CWP-0.2 had antioxidant and immunoregulatory activity in vitro, through scavenging DPPH· and ABTS·+ as well as stimulating production of NO, IL-6, TNF-α and MCP-1 in RAW 264.7 macrophages.

Awake tracheal intubation with flexible bronchoscopy is recommended for general anaesthetics required by patients with this disease. This case report describes the novel approach of using dexmedetomidine sedation in combination with local anaesthesia to allow dental extraction of the fifth and seventh upper left teeth in a patient with fibrodyplasia ossificans progressive, who had a known difficult airway and profound thrombocytopenia. This procedure was not previously tolerated by the patient under local anaesthesia alone. The use of dexmedetomidine was successful in facilitating completion of the procedure with a high degree of patient satisfaction. We discuss the advantages of dexmedetomidine over other sedative agents due to its minimal effects on respiratory drive and airway muscle tone. We highlight the use of dexmedetomidine for complex cases such as this, where tracheal intubation is potentially challenging, but the procedure itself could be managed under sedation and local anaesthesia.",,1399
930,35974760,"Cooperative B-H bond activation: dual site borane activation by redox active κ2-N,S-chelated complexes.","Cooperative dual site activation of boranes by redox-active 1,3-N,S-chelated ruthenium species, mer-[PR3{κ2-N,S-(L)}2Ru{κ1-S-(L)}], (mer-2a: R = Cy, mer-2b: R = Ph; L = NC7H4S2), generated from the aerial oxidation of borate complexes, [PR3{κ2-N,S-(L)}Ru{κ3-H,S,S'-BH2(L)2}] (trans-mer-1a: R = Cy, trans-mer-1b: R = Ph; L = NC7H4S2), has been investigated. Utilizing the rich electronic behaviour of these 1,3-N,S-chelated ruthenium species, we have established that a combination of redox-active ligands and metal-ligand cooperativity has a big influence on the multisite borane activation. For example, treatment of mer-2a-b with BH3·THF led to the isolation of fac-[PR3Ru{κ3-H,S,S'-(NH2BSBH2N)(S2C7H4)2}] (fac-3a: R = Cy and fac-3b: R = Ph) that captured boranes at both sites of the κ2-N,S-chelated ruthenacycles. The core structure of fac-3a and fac-3b consists of two five-membered ruthenacycles [RuBNCS] which are fused by one butterfly moiety [RuB2S]. Analogous fac-3c, [PPh3Ru{κ3-H,S,S'-(NH2BSBH2N)(SC5H4)2}], can also be synthesized from the reaction of BH3·THF with [PPh3{κ2-N,S-(SNC5H4)}{κ3-H,S,S'-BH2(SNH4C5)2}Ru], cis-fac-1c. In stark contrast, when mer-2b was treated with BH2Mes (Mes = 2,4,6-trimethyl phenyl) it led to the formation of trans- and cis-bis(dihydroborate) complexes [{κ3-S,H,H-(NH2BMes)Ru(S2C7H4)}2], (trans-4 and cis-4). Both the complexes have two five-membered [Ru-(H)2-B-NCS] ruthenacycles with κ2-H-H coordination modes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the activation of boranes across the dual Ru-N site is more facile than the Ru-S one.",,1400
1038,35974581,Dancing vortices in a driven nematic liquid crystal cell: Theory and experiment.,"The interaction of light beams with helical defects in optical materials generates optical vortices. Understanding and manipulating the dynamics of helical defects allows for the creation of versatile sources of optical vortex beams. Using a magnetic ring on a nematic liquid crystal cell, we trapped helical defects identified as matter vortices. We observe oscillatory rotating and beating matter vortices by applying a low-frequency voltage. Experimentally, we determine the region of parameters where these vortices are observed. The amplitude of oscillatory rotating vortices decays with the inverse of the voltage frequency. We propose an adequate amplitude equation, which allows us to describe the vortex dynamics; theoretical findings have a qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.",,1401
2091,35967427,Prevention of omalizumab for seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis: a retrospective cohort study.,"Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) is an allergic disease that is characterized by conjunctival and nasal symptoms such as edema and congestion of conjunctiva, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and blocked nose. Seasonal ARC (SARC) is usually induced by seasonal allergens and often occurs at specific times during the year. Traditional treatments of SARC include nasal corticosteroids, antihistamines, and mast cell membrane stabilizers. Biological agents such as omalizumab have also been proved effective in the treatment of SARC. We aim to certify the preventative efficacy of omalizumab for SARC and explore its influence factors. Medical records of 64 SARC patients were retrospectively analyzed, and generalized linear models were used to analyze influence factors of efficacy of omalizumab. Compared with forepassed pollen season without omalizumab treatment, the combined symptom and medication score (CSMS) of ARC with pre-seasonal omalizumab was significantly lower (with omalizumab: 0.67[0.00,1.83], without omalizumab: 4.00[2.83,4.96], p<0.001, max score=6). Subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the influence factor of preventative efficacy of omalizumab. The CSMS with omalizumab treatment were not significantly different among different age, gender, dosage, number of injections, and injection date subgroups (p>0.05). Pre-seasonal omalizumab treatment could significantly relieve SARC related symptoms and reduce medication use. This preventative efficacy would not be influenced by the dosage and number of injections of omalizumab. A single dose of 150mg omalizumab could achieve a satisfactory outcome.",,1402
128,35983279,Transmembrane Domain 3 Is a Transplantable Pharmacophore in the Photodynamic Activation of Cholecystokinin 1 Receptor.,"Cholecystokinin 1 receptor (CCK1R) is activated in photodynamic action by singlet oxygen, but detailed molecular mechanisms are not elucidated. To identify the pharmacophore(s) in photodynamic CCK1R activation, we examined photodynamic activation of point mutants CCK1RM121/3.32A, CCK1RM121/3.32Q, and a chimeric receptor with CCK1R transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) transplanted to muscarinic ACh receptor 3 (M3R) which is unaffected by photodynamic action. These engineered receptors were tagged at the N-terminus with genetically encoded protein photosensitizer miniSOG, and their light-driven photodynamic activation was compared to wild type CCK1R and M3R, as monitored by Fura-2 fluorescent calcium imaging. Photodynamic activations of miniSOG-CCK1RM121/3.32A and miniSOG-CCK1RM121/3.32Q were found to be 55% and 73%, respectively, when compared to miniSOG-CCK1R (100%), whereas miniSOG-M3R was not affected (0% activation). Notably, the chimeric receptor miniSOG-M3R-TM3CCK1R was effectively activated photodynamically (65%). These data suggest that TM3 is an important pharmacophore in photodynamic CCK1R activation, readily transplantable to nonsusceptible M3R for photodynamic activation.",,1403
2272,35967159,Burned-Out Testicular Germ Cell Tumor Presenting as Retroperitoneal Lymphadenopathy in a Patient With Cryptorchidism: A Case Report & Review of Literature.,"Testicular germ cell tumors are the most common malignancy in young and middle-aged men. Spontaneous primary testicular tumor regression, or testicular tumor burn-out, is a rare clinical phenomenon where extragonadal metastatic lesions are observed concurrently with the spontaneous regression of the primary testicular germ cell tumors. Here, we describe the case of a 36-year-old male who presented to our hospital with left-sided abdominal pain and testicular swelling and was found to have significant retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy on his abdominopelvic CT scan. His testicular ultrasound showed multiple echogenic calcifications through the right testicle consistent with microlithiasis. Biopsy of the retroperitoneal lesion revealed a mixed germ cell tumor of testicular origin composed of embryonal carcinoma and teratoma. The patient received four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin, followed by retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) and radical right testicular orchiectomy. Here, we report the second case of burned-out testicular tumor in a patient with ipsilateral cryptorchidism. Furthermore, we elucidate the etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic modalities in burned-out testicular germ cell tumors.",,1404
1371,35969088,Synthesis of Graphene-Hydroxyapatite Nanocomposites for Potential Use in Bone Tissue Engineering.,"Developing novel materials for bone tissue engineering is one of the most important thrust areas of nanomedicine. Several nanocomposites have been fabricated with hydroxyapatite to facilitate cell adherence, proliferation, and osteogenesis. In this study, hybrid nanocomposites were successfully developed using graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite (nHAPs), that when employed in bioactive scaffolds may potentially improve bone tissue regeneration. These nanostructures can be biocompatible. Here, two approaches were used for preparing the novel materials. In one approach, a co-functionalization strategy was used where nHAP was synthesized and conjugated to GNRs simultaneously, resulting in nanohybrids of nHAP on GNR surfaces (denoted as nHAP/GNR). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed that the nHAP/GNR composite is comprised of slender, thin structures of GNRs (maximum length of 1.8 µm) with discrete patches (150-250 nm) of needle-like nHAP (40-50 nm in length). In the other approach, commercially available nHAP was conjugated with GNRs forming GNR-coated nHAP (denoted as GNR/nHAP) (i.e., with an opposite orientation relative to the nHAP/GNR nanohybrid). The nanohybrid formed using the latter method exhibited nHAP nanospheres with a diameter ranging from 50 nm to 70 nm covered with a network of GNRs on the surface. Energy dispersive spectra, elemental mapping, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra confirmed the successful integration of nHAP and GNRs in both nanohybrids. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that the loss at elevated heating temperatures due to the presence of GNRs was 0.5% and 0.98% for GNR/nHAP and nHAP/GNR, respectively. The nHAP-GNR nanohybrids with opposite orientations represent significant materials for use in bioactive scaffolds to potentially promote cellular functions for improving bone tissue engineering applications.",,1405
2431,35966865,Too much tolerance for hyperoxemia in mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia? Report from an Italian intensive care unit.,"In COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, the administration of high oxygen (O2) doses for prolonged time periods may be necessary. Although life-saving in most cases, O2 may exert deleterious effects if administered in excessive concentrations. We aimed to describe the prevalence of hyperoxemia and excessive O2 administration in mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and determine whether hyperoxemia is associated with mortality in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or the onset of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Retrospective single-center study on adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for ≥48 h. Patients undergoing extracorporeal respiratory support were excluded. We calculated the excess O2 administered based on the ideal arterial O2 tension (PaO2) target of 55-80 mmHg. We defined hyperoxemia as PaO2 > 100 mmHg and hyperoxia + hyperoxemia as an inspired O2 fraction (FiO2) > 60% + PaO2 > 100 mmHg. Risk factors for ICU-mortality and VAP were assessed through multivariate analyses. One hundred thirty-four patients were included. For each day of mechanical ventilation, each patient received a median excess O2 of 1,121 [829-1,449] L. Hyperoxemia was found in 38 [27-55]% of arterial blood gases, hyperoxia + hyperoxemia in 11 [5-18]% of cases. The FiO2 was not reduced in 69 [62-76]% of cases of hyperoxemia. Adjustments were made more frequently with higher PaO2 or initial FiO2 levels. ICU-mortality was 32%. VAP was diagnosed in 48.5% of patients. Hyperoxemia (OR 1.300 95% CI [1.097-1.542]), time of exposure to hyperoxemia (OR 2.758 [1.406-5.411]), hyperoxia + hyperoxemia (OR 1.144 [1.008-1.298]), and daily excess O2 (OR 1.003 [1.001-1.005]) were associated with higher risk for ICU-mortality, independently of age, Sequential Organ failure Assessment score at ICU-admission and mean PaO2/FiO2. Hyperoxemia (OR 1.033 [1.006-1.061]), time of exposure to hyperoxemia (OR 1.108 [1.018-1.206]), hyperoxia + hyperoxemia (OR 1.038 [1.003-1.075]), and daily excess O2 (OR 1.001 [1.000-1.001]) were identified as risk factors for VAP, independently of body mass index, blood transfusions, days of neuromuscular blocking agents (before VAP), prolonged prone positioning and mean PaO2/FiO2 before VAP. Excess O2 administration and hyperoxemia were common in mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The exposure to hyperoxemia may be associated with ICU-mortality and greater risk for VAP.",,1406

1816,35967831,"I am Alexa, your virtual tutor!: The effects of Amazon Alexa's text-to-speech voice enthusiasm in a multimedia learning environment.","Modern text-to-speech voices can convey social cues ideal for narrating multimedia learning materials. Amazon Alexa has a unique feature among modern text-to-speech vocalizers as she can infuse enthusiasm cues into her synthetic voice. In this first study examining modern text-to-speech voice enthusiasm effects in a multimedia learning environment, a between-subjects online experiment was conducted where learners from a large Asian university (n = 244) listened to either Alexa's: (1) neutral voice, (2) low-enthusiastic voice, (3) medium-enthusiastic voice, or (4) high-enthusiastic voice, narrating a multimedia lesson on distributed denial-of-service attack. While Alexa's enthusiastic voices did not enhance persona ratings compared to Alexa's neutral voice, learners could infer more enthusiasm expressed by Alexa's medium-and high-enthusiastic voices than Alexa's neutral voice. Regarding cognitive load, Alexa's low-and high-enthusiastic voices decreased intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load ratings compared to Alexa's neutral voice. While Alexa's enthusiastic voices did not impact affective-motivational ratings differently from Alexa's neutral voice, learners reported a significant increase of positive emotions from their baseline positive emotions after listening to Alexa's medium-enthusiastic voice. Finally, Alexa's enthusiastic voices did not enhance the learning performance on immediate retention and transfer tests compared to Alexa's neutral voice. This study demonstrates that a modern text-to-speech voice enthusiasm can positively affect learners' emotions and cognitive load during multimedia learning. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed through the lens of the Cognitive Affective Model of E-learning, Integrated-Cognitive Affective Model of Learning with Multimedia, and Cognitive Load Theory. We further outline this study's limitations and recommendations for extending and widening the text-to-speech voice emotions research.",,1408

The Mesenteric-based model of abdominal anatomy articlulates a foundation that re-unites scientific and clinical approaches to the abdomen in health and disease. Importantly, recent advances are a reminder that we must always question dogma. The peritoneal-based dogma of conventional anatomy remained unquestioned for too long. With time, the mesenteric-based dogma will also be altered and improved on. Anatomy, and hence surgery, must always be considered as works in progress.",,1409
1850,35967790,"Quantification of Vitamins, Minerals, and Amino Acids in Black Walnut (Juglans nigra).","This paper aims to quantify the micronutrients in black walnut and address its human health benefits. The metabolic profiling of 11 black walnut cultivars was accomplished using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometer. Results revealed that the highest concentration of vitamin B9 was present in cultivar Daniel (avg. relative signal intensity 229.53 × 104 mAU). Surprise and Daniel cultivars had the highest amount of vitamin B5. However, vitamin A, D3, E, and K showed no significant difference among the cultivars. The vitamin content levels among the cultivars were compared by applying one way ANOVA method with (P < 0.05) significance level. Mineral analysis for the black walnut kernel, Persian walnut, and black walnut protein powder was done using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission spectroscopy. The experimental data for black walnut kernel is 0.04 mg/g for Fe and 0.03 mg/g for Zn, and for black walnut, protein powder is 0.07 mg/g for Fe and 0.07 mg/g for Zn. The amino acid analysis and comparison with black walnut kernel show that black walnut flour and protein powder have a higher amount of essential and non-essential amino acids. Therefore, researchers, food process engineers, and food product developers should consider the health benefits of black walnuts and explore the commercial potential of this native agroforestry crop.",,1410
2438,35966858,Using random forest algorithm for glomerular and tubular injury diagnosis.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common chronic condition with high incidence and insidious onset. Glomerular injury (GI) and tubular injury (TI) represent early manifestations of CKD and could indicate the risk of its development. In this study, we aimed to classify GI and TI using three machine learning algorithms to promote their early diagnosis and slow the progression of CKD. Demographic information, physical examination, blood, and morning urine samples were first collected from 13,550 subjects in 10 counties in Shanxi province for classification of GI and TI. Besides, LASSO regression was employed for feature selection of explanatory variables, and the SMOTE (synthetic minority over-sampling technique) algorithm was used to balance target datasets, i.e., GI and TI. Afterward, Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), and logistic regression (LR) were constructed to achieve classification of GI and TI, respectively. A total of 12,330 participants enrolled in this study, with 20 explanatory variables. The number of patients with GI, and TI were 1,587 (12.8%) and 1,456 (11.8%), respectively. After feature selection by LASSO, 14 and 15 explanatory variables remained in these two datasets. Besides, after SMOTE, the number of patients and normal ones were 6,165, 6,165 for GI, and 6,165, 6,164 for TI, respectively. RF outperformed NB and LR in terms of accuracy (78.14, 80.49%), sensitivity (82.00, 84.60%), specificity (74.29, 76.09%), and AUC (0.868, 0.885) for both GI and TI; the four variables contributing most to the classification of GI and TI represented SBP, DBP, sex, age and age, SBP, FPG, and GHb, respectively. RF boasts good performance in classifying GI and TI, which allows for early auxiliary diagnosis of GI and TI, thus facilitating to help alleviate the progression of CKD, and enjoying great prospects in clinical practice.",,1411

Health-related quality of life was assessed, and worse scores were found to be associated with a low level of education, self-perceived health reported as poor/very poor, being bedridden and not physically exercised, having seen a doctor more than four times in the past year, and having reported comorbidities and episodes of hypoglycemia.",,1412
2335,35967042,Associations of Gangue Minerals in Coal Flotation Tailing and Their Transportation Behaviors in the Flotation Process.,"The mass production of flotation tailings has become a serious risk to the environment. Re-concentration of tailings is one of the best ways to solve this problem, which requires a better understanding of flotation tailings. In the present work, flotation kinetics, timed-release flotation, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) were used to analyze the properties of flotation tailings with different particle sizes and densities, the occurrence and binding state of gangue minerals in tailing, and the transportation behaviors in the re-flotation process. Flotation results showed that the flotation yield exhibited little change with the extension of flotation time, while the ash content of the froth concentrates increased. An increase of the flotation time could reduce the ash content of the obtained product. The characterization results confirmed that the main gangue minerals in the tailings were kaolinite and quartz. With the decrease of particle size or the increase of floating and sinking density, the contents of kaolinite and quartz increased. However, due to the different dissemination characteristics of kaolinite and quartz in the tailings, the distributions of kaolinite and quartz in the different particle sizes and densities of tailing had differences. Although both kaolinite and quartz could exist as monomers, kaolinite was more easily associated with coal. Based on the above cognition, a new flotation method is proposed for coal flotation tailing. A part of the concentrates in the early stage of flotation should be scraped out quickly. Then, the concentrates obtained in the later stage of flotation are collected and merged into the concentrates obtained during the early stage of flotation, while the secondary tailing is directly pumped into the raw feed system.",,1413
2231,35967260,Phylogenetic endemism of the orchids of Megamexico reveals complementary areas for conservation.,"Orchid diversity provides a unique opportunity to further our understanding of biotic and abiotic factors linked to patterns of richness, endemism, and phylogenetic endemism in many regions. However, orchid diversity is consistently threatened by illegal trade and habitat transformation. Here, we identified areas critical for orchid conservation in the biogeographic province of Megamexico. For this purpose, we evaluated orchid endemism, phylogenetic diversity, and phylogenetic endemism within Megamexico and characterized orchid life forms. Our results indicate that the majority of the regions with the highest estimates of endemism and phylogenetic endemism are in southern Mexico and northern Central America, mostly located on the Pacific side of Megamexico. Among the most important orchid lineages, several belong to epiphytic lineages such as Pleurothallidinae, Laeliinae and Oncidiinae. We also found that species from diverse and distantly related lineages converge in montane forests where suitable substrates for epiphytes abound. Furthermore, the southernmost areas of phylogenetic diversity and endemism of Megamexico are in unprotected areas. Thus, we conclude that the most critical areas for orchid conservation in Megamexico are located in southern Mexico and northern Central America. We recommend that these areas should be given priority by the Mexican system of natural protected areas as complementary conservation areas.",,1414
1226,35971487,Eight-years Egyptian experience of Boston type I keratoprosthesis following failed penetrating keratoplasty or ocular surface disease.,"To evaluate the outcome and complications after implantation of the Boston type I keratoprosthesis (Kpro) in two groups of eyes. We retrospectively reviewed records of 28 eyes with failed Penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) (Group A) and 31 eyes with severe ocular surface diseases who implanted Kpro. Follow-up was performed for a mean 37 months. Primary outcomes were Kpro retention and visual improvement, secondary outcomes included the occurrence of complications as endophthalmitis, retro-prosthesis membrane (RPM), intraocular pressure (IOP) abnormalities, posterior capsule opacification (PCO), graft thinning and extrusion. Visual improvement was achieved in 20 eyes in Group A, and in 19 eyes in Group B. In group A, the prosthesis was retained in 25 eyes, while prosthesis retention in Group B was in 26 eyes. Group A had higher rates of PCO, high IOP, soft IOP, and graft thinning. Group B had higher risk of RPM, and endophthalmitis. Two eyes in Group A, and Five eyes in Group B required redo procedure. The Boston Kpro type I is an effective procedure in eyes with high risk of keratoplasty failure and in severe ocular surface diseases, it has a high retention rate, higher in cases following failed PKP.",,1415
1419,35968482,"Burden of carbon monoxide poisoning in China, 1990-2019: A systematic analysis of data from the global burden of disease study 2019.","Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is one of the most common toxic occupational diseases, but related data in China are scarce. A better understanding of the burden of CO poisoning is essential for improving its management. A systematic analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019 was conducted. Following the general analytical strategy used in the GBD Study 2019, the sex- and age-specific incidence and mortality rates of CO poisoning and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to CO poisoning in China were analyzed. Estimated average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) in age-standardized rates were calculated by joinpoint regression analysis. The effects of age, period and cohort on the incidence of CO poisoning and DALYs due to CO poisoning were estimated by an age-period-cohort model. The age-standardized incidence and mortality rates as well as DALYs of CO poisoning per 100,000 population were estimated to be 21.82 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 15.05-29.98], 0.93 (95% UI: 0.63-1.11), and 40.92 (95% UI: 28.43-47.85), respectively, in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the AAPCs in the age-standardized incidence significantly increased in both males and females, while the age-standardized mortality rates and DALYs significantly decreased in both males and females. The incidence of CO poisoning peaked in individuals aged 15-19 years. Males had a higher burden of CO poisoning than females. The age effect showed that the relative risks (RRs) of incident CO poisoning decreased with age among males and females and that individuals aged 15-24 years had the highest RRs. The RRs of incident CO poisoning increased with time. The cohort effect showed that the incidence increased in successive birth cohorts. The incidence of CO poisoning in China increased from 1990 to 2019. More attention should be given to improving the burden of CO poisoning in Chinese adolescents. The results of this study can be used by health authorities to inform preventative measures to reduce the burden of CO poisoning.",,1416
297,35981409,First report on the isolation of Chlamydia abortus from female dromedary camels with ovarian hydrobursitis.,"This study sought to isolate Chlamydia abortus (C. abortus) from camels with ovarian hydrobursitis (OVHB). To accomplish this goal, bursal tissue (n = 5) and bursal fluid (n = 6) samples were collected from 11 female dromedary camels with unilateral OVHB. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used for the preliminary detection of C. abortus in the infected samples. For the purpose of isolation, the prepared samples were inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs. Giemsa, Gimenez, and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) staining were used to detect any chlamydial inclusions in the infected yolk sacs. A second qPCR was then performed on the infected yolk sacs. The C. abortus gene was detected in 83.8% of the infected bursal tissue and bursal fluid samples. All the yolk sac smears treated with Giemsa, Gimenez, and DIF staining revealed intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Moreover, hemorrhagic patches, massive congestion, macerated yolk sacs, and dwarfism were observed in the infected chicken embryos. The C. abortus gene was also found in 63.6% of the infected yolk sacs. In conclusion, this is the first report of C. abortus isolation from female dromedary camels with OVHB, which represents a key step toward developing a practical vaccine and avoiding fertility problems in female camels.",,1417
1753,35967985,Finding Potential Replacements for TRI Solvents Using the Environmental Impact of the Average Solvent.,"A solvent has many different types of impact on the environment. This article describes a method that combines several different types of impacts together into one environmental index so that similar solvents may be compared by their cumulative impact to the environment. The software tool PARIS III (Program for Assisting the Replacement of Industrial Solvents III) initially finds thousands of solvents mixtures with behaviors as close as possible to those of the original solvent entered. The overall environmental impacts of these solvent mixtures are estimated and assigned to environmental indexes. Users of the software tool can then choose replacements for the original solvent with similar activities but with significantly smaller environmental indexes. These solvent mixtures may act as practical substitutes for the industrial solvents but substantially reduce the overall environmental impact of the original harmful solvents. Potential replacements like this are found for three of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory solvents, carbon tetrachloride, toluene, and N-methylpyrrolidone.",,1418
2333,35967044,Ternary and Quaternary Nanocrystalline Cu-Based Sulfides as Perspective Antibacterial Materials Mechanochemically Synthesized in a Scalable Fashion.,"Twelve Cu-based ternary (Cu-Me1-S, Me1 = Fe, Sn, or Sb) and quaternary (Cu-Me2-Sn-S, Me2 = Fe, Zn, or V) nanocrystalline sulfides are shown as perspective antibacterial materials here. They were prepared from elemental precursors by a one-step solvent-free mechanochemical synthesis in a 100 g batch using scalable eccentric vibratory ball milling. Most of the products have shown strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. For instance, stannite Cu2FeSnS4 and mohite Cu2SnS3 were the most active against E. coli, whereas kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 and rhodostannite Cu2FeSn3S8 exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against S. aureus. In general, stannite has shown the best antibacterial properties out of all the studied samples. Five out of twelve products have been prepared using mechanochemical synthesis for the first time in a scalable fashion here. The presented synthetic approach is a promising alternative to traditional syntheses of nanomaterials suitable for biological applications and shows ternary and quaternary sulfides as potential candidates for the next-generation antibacterial agents.",,1419
1255,35971360,Comparison of Conventional Oxygen Therapy With High-Flow Nasal Oxygenation in the Management of Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure.,"The effectiveness of high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure (RF) remains controversial. The current study compared the effectiveness of HFNO in patients with hypercapnic RF with conventional oxygen therapy (COT). The primary objective was to compare changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) between those receiving COT and HFNO. The secondary objectives were to compare changes in the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate (RR), serum bicarbonate level, base excess, lactate level, and incidence of the need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and mechanical ventilation (MV). We recruited 30 patients with mild to moderate hypercapnic RF in the HFNO group, and data of 30 patients from historical controls, who matched the inclusion criteria, were obtained from medical records for comparison (COT group). The study was terminated after two hours, and patients were managed per the existing protocol after that. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis was repeated at the baseline, first, second, and third hours. In the COT group, the mean RR at the baseline, first, second, and third hours was 24.5 ± 2.61, 24.9 ± 3.03, 26.03 ± 3.4, and 22.90 ± 1.86, whereas, in the HFNO group, it was 25.93 ± 3.91, 23.00 ± 3.54, 22.50 ± 3.38, and 21.90 ± 3.57, respectively. The mean PaCO2 in the COT vs. HFNO groups was 54.45 ± 5.83 vs. 62.22 ± 9.15, 57.74 ± 6.05 vs. 58.65 ± 10.43, 60.79 ± 7.48 vs. 60.41 ± 11.24, and 55.23 ± 6.63 vs. 56.95 ± 10.31. The mean SpO2 in the COT group at these points of time was 94.50 ± 1.46, 95.4 ± 1.28, 96.10 ± 1.84, and 97.53 ± 2.05, whereas, in the HFNO group, it was 95.40 ± 2.55, 98.63 ± 1.43, 99.00 ± 1.66, and 99.50 ± 1.31, respectively. The patients who needed NIV after the study period were 50% and 36.67% in the COT and HFNO groups, respectively. There was no change in PaCO2 levels with HFNO, but there was a significant improvement in SpO2 and PaO2 levels and a decreased RR. Following the termination of the study protocol, more patients in the COT group needed NIV than those in the HFNO group.",,1420
1279,35970748,Development and evaluation of an educational curriculum for healthcare providers on overweight/obesity management in individuals with spinal cord injury based on diverse stakeholder engagement.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) healthcare providers are aware of the harmful consequences of overweight/obesity in persons with SCI, but many are unaware of available information and lack training to guide weight management care in the SCI population. Describe the development and content of an educational curriculum for healthcare providers to help individuals with SCI prevent or manage overweight/obesity. The biopsychoecological framework guided curriculum planning, data collection, and product development. Thematic analysis of interviews conducted with individuals with SCI, informal caregivers, and SCI healthcare providers pinpointed central educational curriculum topics. SCI healthcare providers evaluated the curriculum. Seven comprehensive topics were developed: 1. Scope and consequences of overweight/obesity in SCI; 2. Classifying and measuring overweight/obesity in SCI; 3. Guidelines related to weight management in SCI; 4. Identifying challenges (and solutions) to weight management in SCI; 5. Strategies for providers to facilitate weight management; 6. Understanding goals, motivators, and desired feedback for weight management; and 7. Knowing how informal caregivers are affected by weight and weight management of care recipients with SCI. High ratings (>80% strong agreement) were achieved on content, word choice, organization, relevance, and actionability. Modification needs were identified and subsequently made to layout, visual aids, and provision of tangible resources. Providers described the curriculum as a scientifically rigorous resource that addresses a knowledge gap, provides population-specific content, and is useful across interdisciplinary teams. We developed a self-directed learning educational curriculum addressing topics most salient to stakeholders involved in overweight/obesity management of persons with SCI.",,1421
1961,35967646,"Green Innovation, Corporate Environmental Ethics, and Competitive Advantages of Chinese Automobile Industry During COVID-19: Corporate Environmental Management as Moderator.","The main purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of green product and process innovation on the competitive advantages of the Chinese automobile industry during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study also examined the mediating role of corporate environmental ethics (CEE) and the moderating role of corporate environmental management in the relationship between the green product and process innovation on the competitive advantages of the Chinese automobile industry during COVID-19. This study used a quantitative approach of research with the cross-sectional method for the collection of data. This study also used purposive sampling for the collection of data from the production managers of the automobile industry of China. The structural equation modeling-partial least squares (SEM-PLS) is used to analyze the data. The results of direct effects indicated that green product innovation has a significant and positive effect on the corporate advantages (β = 0.294, t = 2.868) and green process innovation also has a significant and positive effect on the corporate advantages (β = 0.350, t = 3.276). Moreover, green product innovation has also a significant effect on corporate advantages (β = 0.334, t = 4.258) and green product innovation has also a significant effect on corporate advantages (β = 0.269, t = 3.202). The research in this domain about the antecedents of green innovation is still minimal in the previous literature. One of the antecedents of the green innovation, corporate environmental ethics is discussed in this study; thus, it provides the understanding of green innovation as the mediator which would mediate the relationship between corporate environmental ethics and competitive advantage in the auto manufacturing industry of China. This study is among very few to examine the relationship between green innovation, corporate environmental ethics, corporate environmental management, and competitive advantages of the Chinese automobile industry during COVID-19.",,1422
964,35974655,Molecular signatures of the glass transition in polymers.,"The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) is one of the most fundamental properties of polymers. T_{g} is predicted by some theories as a sudden change in a macroscopic quantity (e.g., compressibility). However, for systems with soft glass transitions where the change is gradual it becomes hard to pinpoint precisely the transition temperature as well as the set of molecular changes occurring during this transition. Here, we introduce two new molecular signatures for the glass transition of polymers that exhibit clear changes as one approaches T_{g}: (i) differential change of the probability distribution of dihedral angles as a function of temperature and (ii) the distribution of fractional of the time spent in the different torsional states. These new signatures provide insights into the glass transition in polymers by directly exhibiting the concept of spatial heterogeneity and dynamical ergodicity breaking in such systems, as well as provide a key step to quantitatively obtain the transition temperature from molecular characteristics of the polymeric systems.",,1423
1062,35974557,Enhancement in the diffusivity of Brownian spheroids in the presence of spheres.,"In the present paper, we have extended the simulation technique Brownian cluster dynamics (BCD) to analyze the dynamics of the binary mixture of hard ellipsoids and spheres. The shape dependent diffusional properties have been incorporated into BCD using Perrin's factor and compared with analytical results of a one-component ellipsoidal system. We have investigated pathways to enhance the diffusivity of spheroids in the binary mixture by manipulating the phase behavior of the system through varying the fraction of spheres in the binary mixture. We show that at low volume fraction the spherical particles have a higher diffusion coefficient than the ellipsoids due to the higher friction coefficient. However, at a higher volume fraction, we show that the diffusion coefficient of the ellipsoids increases irrespective of the aspect ratio due to the anisotropic shape.",,1424
1189,35972317,ENDOCELL: a Delphi protocol to harmonise methods in endometrial cell culturing.,"In vitro culturing of endometrial cells obtained from the uterine mucosa or ectopic sites is used to study molecular and cellular signalling relevant to physiologic and pathologic reproductive conditions. However, the lack of consensus on standard operating procedures (SOPs) for deriving, characterising and maintaining primary cells in two- or three-dimensional cultures from eutopic or ectopic endometrium may be hindering progress in this area of research. Guidance for unbiased in vitro research methodologies in the field of reproductive science remains essential to increase confidence in the reliability of in vitro models. We present herein the protocol for a Delphi process to develop a consensus on in vitro methodologies using endometrial cells (ENDOCELL Project). A steering committee composed of leading scientists will select critical methodologies, topics and items that need to be harmonised and that will be included in a Survey. An enlarged panel of experts (ENDOCELL Working Group) will be invited to patriciate in the Survey and provide their ratings to the items to be harmonised. According to Delphi, an iterative investigation method will be adopted. Recommended measures will be finalised by the steering committee. The study received full ethical approval from the Ethical Committee of the Maastricht University (ref. FHML-REC/2021/103). The study findings will be available in both peer-reviewed articles and will also be disseminated to appropriate audiences at relevant conferences.",,1425
985,35974634,Geometric thermodynamics of strain-induced crystallization in polymers.,"Going beyond the classical Gaussian approximation of Einstein's fluctuation theory, Ruppeiner gave it a Riemannian geometric structure with an entropic metric. This yielded a fundamental quantity, the Riemannian curvature, which was used to extract information on the nature of interactions between molecules in fluids, ideal gases, and other open systems. In this article, we examine the implications of this curvature in a nonequilibrium thermodynamic system where relaxation is sufficiently slow so as not to invalidate the local equilibrium hypothesis. The nonequilibrium system comprises a rubbery polymer undergoing strain induced crystallization. The curvature is found to impart information on a spurious isochoric energy arising from the conformational stretching of already crystallized segments. This unphysical component perhaps arises as the crystallized manifold is considered Euclidean with the stretch measures defined via the Euclidean metric. The thermodynamic state associated with curvature is the key to determine the isochoric stretch and hence the spurious energy. We determine this stretch and propose a form for the spurious free energy that must be removed from the total energy in order for the correct stresses to be recovered.",,1426
2336,35967041,Enhancement of Underwater Tribological Properties of Hybrid PTFE/Nomex Fabric/Epoxy Resin Multilayer Composites by Mixed Graphite and MoS2 Fillers.,"This work studied the effect of mixed graphite and MoS2 fillers on tribological properties of hybrid polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/Nomex fabric/epoxy multilayer composites under water lubrication. A ring-on-block tribometer was used to perform the tribological test under dry sliding and water lubrication conditions. The worn surface was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy. The results showed mixed fillers with 2.5 wt % graphite and 5 wt % MoS2 had the best underwater tribological properties with the lowest friction coefficient (COF) of 0.067 and the lowest wear amount of 1.7 mg. Mixed fillers optimize epoxy resin properties, thereby increasing shore hardness, reducing water absorption, and improving wear resistance. This study also explained the reasons of the wear amount was higher in water than in dry sliding.",,1427
713,35975186,Socioeconomic status and injury history in adolescent athletes: Lower family affluence is associated with a history of concussion.,"While healthcare and health outcome disparities have been studied across a variety of different injuries, their relation to concussion incidence and management are relatively understudied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between history of concussion or musculoskeletal injury, and family affluence and/or school-level measures of socioeconomic status. We conducted a cross-sectional study of adolescent athletes in a local school district. Adolescent athletes (n = 192; mean age = 15.3, SD = 1.6 years; 49% female), who presented for a pre-participation physical evaluation reported concussion and injury history, and family affluence scale (FAS) scores. We also examined the percent of students on free/reduced lunch at each school compared to state averages. Independent variables, individual FAS score and school-based marker of socioeconomic status, were compared between those with and without a history of concussion and time-loss musculoskeletal injury. Of the participants, 40 (21%) reported a history of concussion. Athletes with a concussion history had significantly lower FAS scores than athletes without a history of concussion (mean difference = 0.7, 95%CI = 0.1, 1.4; P = 0.027). There was no significant difference in FAS scores between those with and without a history of time-loss musculoskeletal injury (mean difference = 0.0, 95% CI = -0.5, 0.5; P = 0.97). Athletes with a history of concussion had a higher proportion of a prior time-loss musculoskeletal injury (68% vs. 32%; P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, school free-reduced lunch rate, and history of musculoskeletal injury, a lower FAS score was associated with concussion history (adjusted odds ratio = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.64, 0.96; P = 0.019). Concussion and musculoskeletal injury were not associated with school-level markers of socioeconomic status. Lower individual measures, but not school-level measures, of socioeconomic status were associated with a history of concussion in our sample of adolescent athletes. Enhance providers' understanding of how socioeconomic factors may impact concussion history and empower providers to adequately screen for and provide concussion education to mitigate disparities.",,1428

1553,35968333,COMT rs737865 mediates chemobrain in breast cancer patients with various levels of Ki-67.,"Previous findings have indicated that catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) may be a genetic risk factor for chemobrain. However, the mediation of chemobrain by COMT polymorphisms in breast cancer patients with various levels of Ki-67 remains unknown. The current research assessed the genetic risk across COMT genotypes for chemobrain in breast cancer patients with various levels of Ki-67. Breast cancer patients (65 with Ki-67<14%, 75 with Ki-67>14%) completed cognitive tests before and after adjuvant chemotherapy, and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of COMT (rs165599, rs4680, rs737865) were genotyped from peripheral blood. Lower cognitive test results in breast cancer patients were displayed in those before chemotherapy. Furthermore, the event-based prospective memory (EBPM) scores of patients in the Ki-67>14% group were worse than those in the patients in the Ki-67<14% group after chemotherapy (z=-7.51, P<0.01), but the time-based prospective memory (TBPM) scores of the two groups were not significantly different. The COMT rs737865 A/G genotype was associated with memory protection (codominant model: adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.135, 95% CI=0.026-0.706, P=0.018), and A/G genotype carriers exhibited better performance on the EBPM test than the A/A genotype. Levels of Ki-67 were likely to be associated with EBPM decline in breast cancer patients. Taken together, COMT rs737865 polymorphisms are a potential genetic risk factor for chemobrain in breast cancer patients with various levels of Ki-67.",,1430
636,35977215,Staffing Patterns in US Nursing Homes During COVID-19 Outbreaks.,"Staff absences and departures at nursing homes may put residents at risk and present operational challenges. To quantify changes in nursing home facility staffing during and after a severe COVID-19 outbreak. In this cohort study, daily staffing payroll data were used to construct weekly measures of facility staffing, absences, departures, and use of overtime and contract staff among US nursing homes experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak that started between June 14, 2020, and January 1, 2021. Facility outbreaks were identified using COVID-19 case data. An event-study design with facility and week fixed effects was used to investigate the association of severe outbreaks with staffing measures. Weeks since the beginning of a severe COVID-19 outbreak (4 weeks prior to 16 weeks after). Total weekly staffing hours, staff counts, staff absences, departures, new hires, overtime and contract staff hours measured for all nursing staff and separately by staff type (registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, certified nursing assistants), facility self-reported staff shortages, and resident deaths. Of the included 2967 nursing homes experiencing severe COVID-19 outbreaks, severe outbreaks were associated with a statistically significant drop in nursing staffing levels owing to elevated absences and departures. Four weeks after an outbreak's start, around when average new cases peaked, staffing hours were 2.6% (95% CI, 2.1%-3.2%) of the mean below preoutbreak levels, despite facilities taking substantial measures to bolster staffing through increased hiring and the use of contract staff and overtime. Because these measures were mostly temporary, staffing declined further in later weeks; 16 weeks after an outbreak's start, staffing hours were 5.5% (95% CI, 4.5%-6.5%) of the mean below preoutbreak levels. Staffing declines were greatest among certified nursing assistants, primarily owing to smaller increases in new hires of this staff type compared with licensed practical nurses and registered nurses. In this cohort study of nursing homes experiencing severe COVID-19 outbreaks, facilities experienced considerable staffing challenges during and after outbreaks. These results suggest the need for policy action to ensure facilities' abilities to maintain adequate staffing levels during and after infectious disease outbreaks.",,1431
877,35974846,"An Analysis of the Ethical, Economic, and Environmental Aspects of Entomophagy.","Population growth is causing a high demand for meat products, which, coupled with the current climate crisis, has fueled research into alternative protein sources. This review discusses the role of edible insects as an alternative protein source to complement our diet. We compare nutritional, environmental, economic, and food safety aspects between edible insects and current protein sources and conclude with a discussion on ethical considerations. Edible insects are a good protein source, with a higher average protein content than most protein-rich products we consume today. In addition, they provide fiber, fats such as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and essential amino acids and are also rich in some minerals and vitamins. Product safety is yet to be studied; however, they have a much lower environmental impact than other intensive livestock products. Moreover, the production of edible insects is not expected to be expensive. The consumption of edible insects is a good alternative to conventional animal foods in modern times: a major climate crisis accompanied by numerous societal inequalities due to population growth.",,1432
1430,35968469,Leave Me Alone With Your Symptoms! Social Exclusion at the Workplace Mediates the Relationship of Employee's Mental Illness and Sick Leave.,"Although a substantial part of employees suffers from a mental illness, the work situation of this population still is understudied. Previous research suggests that people with a mental illness experience discrimination in the workplace, which is known to have detrimental effects on health. Building on the stereotype content model and allostatic load theory, the present study investigated whether employees with a mental illness become socially excluded at the workplace and therefore show more days of sick leave. Overall, 86 employees diagnosed with a mental disorder were interviewed and completed online-surveys. Path analyses supported the hypotheses, yielding a serial mediation: The interview-rated severity of the mental disorder had an indirect effect on the days of sick leave, mediated by the symptomatic burden and the social exclusion at the workplace. In the light of the costs associated with absenteeism the present paper highlights the harmfulness of discrimination. Organizations and especially supervisors need to be attentive for signs of exclusion within their teams and try to counteract as early as possible.",,1433
1947,35967661,Morphological Priming Effects in L2 English Verbs for Japanese-English Bilinguals.,"For native (L1) English readers, masked presentations of past-tense verb primes (e.g., fell and looked) produce faster lexical decision latencies to their present-tense targets (e.g., FALL and LOOK) than orthographically related (e.g., fill and loose) or unrelated (e.g., master and bank) primes. This facilitation observed with morphologically related prime-target pairs (morphological priming) is generally taken as evidence for strong connections based on morphological relationships in the L1 lexicon. It is unclear, however, if similar, morphologically based, connections develop in non-native (L2) lexicons. Several earlier studies with L2 English readers have reported mixed results. The present experiments examine whether past-tense verb primes (both regular and irregular verbs) significantly facilitate target lexical decisions for Japanese-English bilinguals beyond any facilitation provided by prime-target orthographic similarity. Overall, past-tense verb primes facilitated lexical decisions to their present-tense targets relative to both orthographically related and unrelated primes. Replicating previous masked priming experiments with L2 readers, orthographically related primes also facilitated target recognition relative to unrelated primes, confirming that orthographic similarity facilitates L2 target recognition. The additional facilitation from past-tense verb primes beyond that provided by orthographic primes suggests that, in the L2 English lexicon, connections based on morphological relationships develop in a way that is similar to how they develop in the L1 English lexicon even though the connections and processing of lower level, lexical/orthographic information may differ. Further analyses involving L2 proficiency revealed that as L2 proficiency increased, orthographic facilitation was reduced, indicating that there is a decrease in the fuzziness in orthographic representations in the L2 lexicon with increased proficiency.",,1434
16,35985184,Pigkeepers' knowledge and perceptions regarding African swine fever and the control measures in Estonia.,"African swine fever (ASF) has been present in Estonia since 2014, and pigkeepers play a major role in controlling the spread of viral infection in domestic pigs. Participatory epidemiology may provide insight into livestock keepers' existing attitudes and compliance with implementing control strategies. By conducting focus group discussions and using participatory epidemiology tools, this study aimed to reveal pigkeepers' knowledge and awareness of ASF clinical signs, transmission routes, and preventive measures. Furthermore, opinions including trust in stakeholders in ASF control, acceptability of ASF eradication, and control measures by pigkeepers in Estonia were identified. The most indicative ASF signs in pigs were increased mortality and fever, inappetence, lethargy. The highest risk of virus introduction into the herd was designated to agricultural machinery, vehicles, rodents, birds, insects, and people. Fencing was the most liked ASF preventive measure, while training of staff in biosecurity and informing the visitors was considered the most effective measure. The least accepted ASF eradication measure was culling of all animals on the farm. Generally, pigkeepers perceived that healthy animals should not be culled but only ASF-infected pigs. Additionally, healthy pigs could be slaughtered and used for the production of heat-treated canned meat. Destroying the feed of ASF-infected farms was not favoured because some pigkeepers proposed using it for other animal species. Regarding ASF territorial restrictions (zoning), lower meat prices and economic losses were regarded as consequences with the greatest impact. Pigkeepers ranked trust in Veterinary Authority and Ministry of Rural Affairs regarding their role in ASF prevention and control as high while perceiving themselves as the most trustworthy stakeholder within the ASF network. This study demonstrates a generally good level of awareness among the pigkeepers in Estonia concerning the clinical manifestation of ASF, the most relevant transmission routes of the virus for their farms, and preventive measures for ASF. Pigkeepers are aware of their own role in preventing ASF, and there is a high level of trust between them and government authorities. Additional efforts are needed from authorities to communicate better the purpose of some ASF control and eradication measures to the pigkeepers. Further incentives are required to support the implementation of costly biosecurity measures, assure compliance, and mitigate the consequences of these measures.",,1435
1355,35969132,Seven years (2015-2021) of blood donor screening for HEV-RNA in France: lessons and perspectives.,"The French health authorities are considering expanding the current selective HEV-RNA testing procedure to include all donations in order to further reduce transfusion-transmitted HEV infection. Data obtained from blood donors (BDs) tested for HEV-RNA between 2015 and 2021 were used to assess the most efficient nucleic acid testing (NAT) strategy. Viral loads (VLs) and the plasma volume of blood components, as well as an HEV-RNA dose of 3.85 log IU as the infectious threshold and an assay with a 95% limit of detection (LOD) at 17 IU/mL, were used to assess the proportion of: (i) HEV-RNA-positive BDs that would remain undetected; and (ii) blood components associated with these undetected BDs with an HEV-RNA dose >3.85 log IU, considering 4 NAT options (Individual testing [ID], MP-6, MP-12, and MP-24). Of the 510,118 BDs collected during the study period, 510 (0.10%) were HEV-RNA-positive. Based on measurable VLs available in 388 cases, 1%, 15.2%, 21.8%, and 32.6% of BDs would theoretically pass undetected due to a VL below the LOD of ID, MP-6, MP-12, and MP-24 testing, respectively. All BDs associated with a potentially infectious blood component would be detected with ID-NAT while 13% of them would be undetected with MP-6, 19.6% with MP-12, and 30.4% with MP-24 depending on the plasma volume. No red blood cell (RBC) components with an HEV-RNA dose >3.85 log IU would enter the blood supply, regardless of the NAT strategy used. A highly sensitive ID-NAT would ensure maximum safety. However, an MP-based strategy can be considered given that: (i) the risk of transmission is closely related to the plasma volume of blood components; (ii) RBC are the most commonly transfused components and have a low plasma content; and (iii) HEV-RNA doses transmitting infection exceed 4 log IU. To minimise the potential risk associated with apheresis platelet components and fresh frozen plasma, less than 12 donations should be pooled using an NAT assay with a LOD of approximately 20 IU/mL.",,1436

1755,35967981,cifB-transcript levels largely explain cytoplasmic incompatibility variation across divergent Wolbachia.,"Divergent hosts often associate with intracellular microbes that influence their fitness. Maternally transmitted Wolbachia bacteria are the most common of these endosymbionts, due largely to cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) that kills uninfected embryos fertilized by Wolbachia-infected males. Closely related infections in females rescue CI, providing a relative fitness advantage that drives Wolbachia to high frequencies. One prophage-associated gene (cifA) governs rescue, and two contribute to CI (cifA and cifB), but CI strength ranges from very strong to very weak for unknown reasons. Here, we investigate CI-strength variation and its mechanistic underpinnings in a phylogenetic context across 20 million years (MY) of Wolbachia evolution in Drosophila hosts diverged up to 50 MY. These Wolbachia encode diverse Cif proteins (100% to 7.4% pairwise similarity), and AlphaFold structural analyses suggest that CifB sequence similarities do not predict structural similarities. We demonstrate that cifB-transcript levels in testes explain CI strength across all but two focal systems. Despite phylogenetic discordance among cifs and the bulk of the Wolbachia genome, closely related Wolbachia tend to cause similar CI strengths and transcribe cifB at similar levels. This indicates that other non-cif regions of the Wolbachia genome modulate cif-transcript levels. CI strength also increases with the length of the host's larval life stage, presumably due to prolonged cif action. Our findings reveal that cifB-transcript levels largely explain CI strength, while highlighting other covariates. Elucidating CI's mechanism contributes to our understanding of Wolbachia spread in natural systems and to improving the efficacy of CI-based biocontrol of arboviruses and agricultural pests globally.",,1438

2385,35966988,A systematic review of research on augmentative and alternative communication brain-computer interface systems for individuals with disabilities.,"Augmentative and alternative communication brain-computer interface (AAC-BCI) systems are intended to offer communication access to people with severe speech and physical impairment (SSPI) without requiring volitional movement. As the field moves toward clinical implementation of AAC-BCI systems, research involving participants with SSPI is essential. Research has demonstrated variability in AAC-BCI system performance across users, and mixed results for comparisons of performance for users with and without disabilities. The aims of this systematic review were to (1) describe study, system, and participant characteristics reported in BCI research, (2) summarize the communication task performance of participants with disabilities using AAC-BCI systems, and (3) explore any differences in performance for participants with and without disabilities. Electronic databases were searched in May, 2018, and March, 2021, identifying 6065 records, of which 73 met inclusion criteria. Non-experimental study designs were common and sample sizes were typically small, with approximately half of studies involving five or fewer participants with disabilities. There was considerable variability in participant characteristics, and in how those characteristics were reported. Over 60% of studies reported an average selection accuracy ≤70% for participants with disabilities in at least one tested condition. However, some studies excluded participants who did not reach a specific system performance criterion, and others did not state whether any participants were excluded based on performance. Twenty-nine studies included participants both with and without disabilities, but few reported statistical analyses comparing performance between the two groups. Results suggest that AAC-BCI systems show promise for supporting communication for people with SSPI, but they remain ineffective for some individuals. The lack of standards in reporting outcome measures makes it difficult to synthesize data across studies. Further research is needed to demonstrate efficacy of AAC-BCI systems for people who experience SSPI of varying etiologies and severity levels, and these individuals should be included in system design and testing. Consensus in terminology and consistent participant, protocol, and performance description will facilitate the exploration of user and system characteristics that positively or negatively affect AAC-BCI use, and support innovations that will make this technology more useful to a broader group of people. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42018095345, PROSPERO: CRD42018095345.",,1440
952,35974728,The Radon transform as a tool for 3D reciprocal-space mapping of epitaxial microcrystals.,"This work presents a new approach suitable for mapping reciprocal space in three dimensions with standard laboratory equipment and a typical X-ray diffraction setup. The method is based on symmetric and coplanar high-resolution X-ray diffraction, ideally realized using 2D X-ray pixel detectors. The processing of experimental data exploits the Radon transform commonly used in medical and materials science. It is shown that this technique can also be used for diffraction mapping in reciprocal space even if a highly collimated beam is not available. The application of the method is demonstrated for various types of epitaxial microcrystals on Si substrates. These comprise partially fused SiGe microcrystals that are tens of micrometres high, multiple-quantum-well structures grown on SiGe microcrystals and pyramid-shaped GaAs/Ge microcrystals on top of Si micropillars.",,1441
19,35985149,Ultrasonic breast tumor extraction based on adversarial mechanism and active contour.,"Breast cancer is a high incidence of gynecological diseases; breast ultrasound screening can effectively reduce the mortality rate of breast cancer. In breast ultrasound images, the localization and segmentation of tumor lesions are important steps for the extraction of lesions, which helps clinicians evaluate breast lesions quantitatively and makes better clinical diagnosis of the disease. However, the segmentation of breast lesions is difficult due to the blurred and uneven edges of some lesions. In this paper, we propose a segmentation framework combining active contour module and deep learning adversarial mechanism and apply it for the segmentation of breast tumor lesions. We use a conditional adversarial network as the main framework. The generator is a segmentation network consisting of a Deformed U-Net and an active contour module. Here, the Deformed U-Net performs pixel-level segmentation for breast ultrasound images. The active contour module refines the tumor lesion edges, and the refined result provides loss information for Deformed U-Net. Therefore, the Deformed U-Net can better classify the edge pixels. The discriminator is the Markov discriminator; this discriminator provides loss feedback for the segmentation network. We cross-train the discriminator and segmentation network to implement Adversarial Mechanism for getting a more optimized segmentation network. The segmentation performance of the segmentation network for breast ultrasound images is improved by adding a Markov discriminator to provide discriminant loss training. The proposed method for segmenting the tumor lesions in breast ultrasound image obtains dice coefficient: 89.7%, accuracy: 98.1%, precision: 86.3%, mean-intersection-over-union: 82.2%, recall: 94.7%, specificity: 98.5% and F1score: 89.7%. Comparing with traditional methods, the proposed method gives better performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively segment the lesions in breast ultrasound images, and then assist doctors to realize the diagnosis of breast lesions.",,1442
1955,35967652,Determinants of patients' satisfaction and trust toward healthcare service environment in general practice clinics.,"This study aimed to examine the healthcare service environment, patients' experience, and responses toward healthcare services in private general practice (GP) clinics. Self-administered questionnaires were used for collecting data from 367 respondents with prior experience in visiting the general practice clinics in Malaysia. SmartPLS statistical tool was used to test the underlying hypotheses. The results revealed that ambiance, service delivery, interior decor, and cleanliness had a significant influence on patients' trust and satisfaction while the exterior design is neither associated with satisfaction nor trust. Patients' satisfaction and trust had a higher significant effect on their repatronage intention, willingness to pay for a premium healthcare service, and engagement in word-of-mouth for healthcare services. In practice, both the service delivery and ambiance features of the healthcare services environment might be optimized by GP clinics. This research provides significant insights from the patients' perspective toward the GP clinics' healthcare services environment.",,1443
402,35979272,Effect of the Gant-Miwa-Thiersch Procedure for Rectal Prolapse on the Mesorectum.,"Rectal prolapse (RP) most commonly occurs among elderly women and is caused by vulnerable suspensory tissue in the pelvis. In Japan, the Gant-Miwa-Thiersch procedure (GMT) is recommended for elderly people with poor general health. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 12 patients who underwent GMT at our hospital from September 2005 to July 2021 and investigated the effect of GMT on the mesorectum using abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT) performed for other diseases. The median age of the cohort was 82 years, and 92% of the subjects were women. The median RP length was 5 cm, and the median follow-up period was 60 months. Recurrence was observed in 1 of 12 patients (8.0%). CT conducted before and more than 6 months after GMT revealed no abnormal findings in the mesorectum, whereas CT within 5 months after GMT revealed hyperdense fat in the mesorectum in all three patients (100%; P < 0.05). The RP recurrence rate after the GMT was low. The mechanism of the effect of GMT may involve not only a direct mucosal plicating effect but also adhesional rectosacral fixation due to the presence of inflammation extending to the mesorectum.",,1444
1168,35973378,The RNA-binding proteins CELF1 and ELAVL1 cooperatively control the alternative splicing of CD44.,"CD44 mRNA contains nine consecutive cassette exons, v2 to v10. Upon alternative splicing, several isoforms are produced with different impacts on tumor biology. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of the RNA-binding proteins CELF1 and ELAVL1 in the control of CD44 splicing. We show by FRET-FLIM that these proteins directly interact in the nucleus. By combining RNAi-mediated depletion and exon array hybridization in HeLa cells, we observe that the exons v7 to v10 of CD44 are highly sensitive to CELF1 and ELAVL1 depletion. We confirm by RT-PCR that CELF1 and ELAVL1 together stimulate the inclusion of these exons in CD44 mRNA. Finally, we show in eight different tumor types that high expression of CELF1 and/or ELAVL1 is correlated with the inclusion of CD44 variable exons. These data point to functional interactions between CELF1 and ELAVL1 in the control of CD44 splicing in human cancers.",,1445
1927,35967682,The predictive function of Swedish word accents.,"Swedish lexical word accents have been repeatedly said to have a low functional load. Even so, the language has kept these tones ever since they emerged probably over a thousand years ago. This article proposes that the primary function of word accents is for listeners to be able to predict upcoming morphological structures and narrow down the lexical competition rather than being lexically distinctive. Psycho- and neurophysiological evidence for the predictive function of word accents is discussed. A novel analysis displays that word accents have a facilitative role in word processing. Specifically, a correlation is revealed between how much incorrect word accents hinder listeners' processing and how much they reduce response times when correct. Finally, a dual-route model of the predictive use of word accents with distinct neural substrates is put forth.",,1446
444,35979027,Integration of robotic in the reprocessing and transfer of endoscopes.,"Background and study aims  Optimal hygiene is crucial for patients undergoing flexible endoscopy. Reprocessing is currently influenced by manual procedures performed by endoscopy staff. To overcome this limitation, we designed and evaluated the integration of robotic application for an automated endoscope processing pathway. Methods  We used an endoscope reprocessing pass through machine with drying cabinet and a Franka Emika Panda robot. The robot was programmed to interact with its environment in a compliant way, guaranteeing desired contact force thresholds and therefore ensuring safety of both robot and medical equipment. Results  In an initial phase we tested the robots' ability to handle a modified tray holding an endoscope as well as certain challenges (correct positioning, connection of tubing, undesired collisions). We added another Panda robot arm resulting in a device featuring two independent manipulators and tested the accuracy of each individual step. We evaluated 50 consecutive processing and transfer procedures, simulating the average daily throughput of an endoscopic unit. The endoscopes were removed in adapted tray using a specially designed lifting device and placed in an endoscope storage and venting cabinet. The mean time for the handling of the scope was 104.2 ± 1.2 seconds and an accuracy of 100 % (0 failures in 50 attempts) was achieved. Conclusions  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description and evaluation of an automated compliant robotic assistance in the processing of endoscopes. Further development could help to overcome shortcomings of the man handled endoscope processing and could lead to reproducible, standardized and certified endoscope processing.",,1447
965,35974654,"Mutual information in changing environments: Nonlinear interactions, out-of-equilibrium systems, and continuously varying diffusivities.","Biochemistry, ecology, and neuroscience are examples of prominent fields aiming at describing interacting systems that exhibit nontrivial couplings to complex, ever-changing environments. We have recently shown that linear interactions and a switching environment are encoded separately in the mutual information of the overall system. Here we first generalize these findings to a broad class of nonlinear interacting models. We find that a new term in the mutual information appears, quantifying the interplay between nonlinear interactions and environmental changes, and leading to either constructive or destructive information interference. Furthermore, we show that a higher mutual information emerges in out-of-equilibrium environments with respect to an equilibrium scenario. Finally, we generalize our framework to the case of continuously varying environments. We find that environmental changes can be mapped exactly into an effective spatially varying diffusion coefficient, shedding light on modeling of biophysical systems in inhomogeneous media.",,1448
412,35979246,Exploring the Ways of The Great Imitator: A Case Report of Syphilitic Hepatitis.,"Syphilis is a chronic infection caused by Treponema pallidum. Manifestations of this disease are vast, and syphilitic hepatitis is a rarely depicted form of secondary syphilis. We report the case of a 63-year-old man with worsening jaundice, maculopapular rash and perianal discomfort. Proctological examination with anoscopy revealed a perianal gray/white area with millimetric pale granules along the anal canal. Liver function tests showed a mixed pattern. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, T. pallidum hemagglutination assay and IgM fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbance were positive. The patient was successfully treated with a single dose of penicillin G. Syphilitic hepatitis is scarcely reported in the literature. Secondary syphilis with mild hepatitis rarely leads to hepatic cytolysis and jaundice. Many signs of secondary syphilis including syphilitic hepatitis may be linked to immune responses initiated during early infection. Over the past decades, evidence has emerged on the importance of innate and adaptive cellular immune responses in the immunopathogenesis of syphilis. This report raises awareness to a clinical entity that should be considered in patients at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, who present with intestinal discomfort or liver dysfunction, as it is a treatable and fully reversible condition. A sífilis é uma infeção crónica provocada pelo Treponema pallidum. As manifestações desta doença são vastas e a hepatite sifilítica é uma forma de sífilis secundária raramente descrita. Apresentamos o caso de um doente de 63 anos com icterícia de agravamento progressivo, rash maculopapular e desconforto perianal. O exame proctológico complementado por anuscopia revelou uma região perianal cinzenta-esbranquiçada com grânulos pálidos milimétricos ao longo do canal anal. Testes de função hepática revelaram um padrão misto e o Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, T. pallidum hemagglutination assay e IgM fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbance foram positivos. O doente foi tratado com sucesso com uma dose única de penicilina G. São raros os casos de hepatite sifilítica descritos na literatura. Sífilis secundária com hepatite ligeira raramente conduz a citólise hepática e icterícia. Muitos dos sinais de sífilis secundária, incluindo a hepatite sifilítica, parecem estar associados a respostas imunitárias iniciadas durante o período de infeção precoce. Ao longo das últimas décadas, têm surgido evidências crescentes sobre a importância das respostas imunes inata e adaptativa na patogénese da sífilis. Este caso clínico descreve uma entidade nosológica que deve ser considerada em doentes em risco de contraírem doenças sexualmente transmissíveis, que se apresentem com desconforto intestinal ou disfunção hepática, visto tratar-se de uma condição tratável e totalmente reversível.",,1449
2411,35966900,Feline gastrointestinal eosinophilic sclerosing fibroplasia presenting as a rectal mass.,"A 9-year-old neutered male cat was referred owing to dyschezia and weight loss. Abdominal CT revealed a heterogeneous mass in the rectum and thickening of one caudal mesenteric lymph node. The mass induced a focal rectal obstruction. Cytological evaluation of fine-needle aspirates showed signs of mixed inflammation for the rectal mass and a reactive lymph node. Because a definite diagnosis was not achieved, complete resection of the mass via a dorsal approach to the rectum was attempted. Histopathology confirmed complete removal and diagnosed feline gastrointestinal eosinophilic sclerosing fibroplasia (FGESF). The cat was treated with psyllium husks and lactulose after surgery. In the postoperative year, the owner reported normal behaviour, food intake and defecation of the patient. Dyschezia reoccurred 14 months after surgery. Imaging revealed recurrence of a rectal mass. Owing to clinical deterioration, the owner elected for euthanasia. This is the first report of rectal FGESF with dyschezia and weight loss as the main clinical signs. The case demonstrates an acceptable outcome for more than 1 year without additional immunosuppressive therapy, and emphasises that FGESF must be considered as a differential diagnosis for rectal masses in cats.",,1450
1023,35974596,Dynamical buckling of a table-tennis ball impinging normally on a rigid target: Experimental and numerical studies.,"We report on the dynamical buckling of a spherical shell (a table-tennis ball) impinging in normal incidence on a rigid surface (a glass plate). Experimentally, we observe and decipher the geometrical characteristics of the shell profile in the contact region along with global metrics such as the contact duration and the coefficient of restitution of the linear velocity. We determine, in particular, the onset of the ball buckling instability. We find that, just like in quasi-statics, the shell buckles when the crushing exceeds about twice the thickness of the shell. In addition, for launching conditions resulting in the ball elastic buckling, a drop in the restitution coefficient is observed. A companion numerical finite elements study is set to monitor the different sources of energy and reveals that the added energy loss is mainly due to the friction between the shell surface and the solid substrate.",,1451
2459,35966825,European epidemiological patterns of cannabis- and substance-related congenital cardiovascular anomalies: geospatiotemporal and causal inferential study.,"As prenatal and community cannabis exposures have recently been linked with congenital heart disease (CHD), it was of interest to explore these associations in Europe in a causal framework and space-time context. Congenital anomaly data from Eurocat, drug-use data from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, and income from the World Bank. Countries with rising daily cannabis use had in general higher congenital anomaly rates over time than those without (time: status interaction: β-Est. = 0.0267, P = 0.0059). At inverse probability-weighted panel regression, cannabis terms were positive and significant for CHD, severe CHD, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, vascular disruptions, double outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great vessels, hypoplastic right heart, and mitral valve anomalies from 1.75 × 10-19, 4.20 × 10-11, <2.2 × 10-16, <2.2 × 10-16, 1.58 × 10-12, 4.30 × 10-9, 4.36 × 10-16, 3.50 × 10-8, 5.35 × 10-12, <2.2 × 10-16, 5.65 × 10-5 and 6.06 × 10-10. At spatial regression, terms including cannabis were positive and significant for this same list of anomalies from 0.0038, 1.05 × 10-10, 0.0215, 8.94 × 10-6, 1.23 × 10-5, 2.05 × 10-5, 1.07 × 10-6, 8.77 × 10-5, 9.11 × 10-6, 0.0001, 3.10 × 10-7 and 2.17 × 10-7. 92.6% and 75.2% of 149 E-value estimates and minimum E-values were in high zone >9; 100.0% and 98.7% >1.25. Data show many congenital cardiac anomalies exhibit strong bivariate relationships with metrics of cannabis exposure. Causal inferential modelling for the twelve anomalies selected demonstrated convincing evidence of robust relationships to cannabis which survived adjustment and fulfilled epidemiological criteria for causal relationships. Space-time regression was similarly confirmatory. Epigenomic pathways constitute viable potential mechanisms. Given exponential genotoxic dose-response effects, careful and astute control of cannabinoid penetration is indicated.",,1452
1472,35968426,Factors and optimizations of healthcare workers' perception in alternative care facilities.,"Diverse measures have been carried out worldwide to establish Alternative Care Facilities (ACFs) for different ends, such as receiving, curing or isolating patients, aiming to cope with tremendous shock in the urban medical system during the early passage of the COVID-19 epidemic. Healthcare workers always felt anxious and stressed during multiple major public health emergencies in medical facilities. Some active measures to improve healthcare workers' perceptions, such as temporary training, workflow improvement, and supplementary facilities, were proved insufficient in several past public health emergencies. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the contributing factors of the healthcare workers' perceptions of the ACFs in this pandemic, which can help find an innovative path to ensure their health, well-being and work efficiency. This paper conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with the world's first batch of healthcare workers who have worked in ACFs through a qualitative study based on Grounded Theory. The healthcare workers interviewed from Heilongjiang, Shandong, Fujian, and Hubei provinces, have worked in one of the four different ACFs built in Wuhan. The results are obtained through the three-level codes and analyses of the interview recordings. The factors affecting the perception of healthcare workers in ACFs during the epidemic situation can be summarized into five major categories: individual characteristics, organization management, facilities and equipment, space design, and internal environment. The five major categories affecting the composition of perception can be further divided into endogenous and exogenous factors, which jointly affect the perception of healthcare workers in ACFs. Among them, individual characteristics belong to endogenous factors, which are the primary conditions, while other categories belong to exogenous factors, which are the decisive conditions. This paper clarifies factors affecting the perception of healthcare workers in ACFs and analyzes the mechanism of each factor. It is posited that the passive strategies are a promising solution to protect healthcare workers' health, improve their work efficiency, and help reduce the operation stress of ACFs. We should train multidisciplinary professionals for future healthcare and enhance collaborations between healthcare workers and engineers. To sum up, this paper broadens new horizons for future research on the optimization of ACFs and finds new paths for alleviating healthcare workers' adverse perceptions of ACFs.",,1453
2329,35967048,Pore Characteristics and Fractal Dimension Analysis of Tectonic Coal and Primary-Structure Coal: A Case Study of Sanjia Coal Mine in Northern Guizhou.,"Understanding the pore heterogeneity of tectonic coal and primary-structure coal is of great significance for predicting and preventing tectonic coal. This study adopts the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption method, mercury injection experiment, and other methods, combined with fractal theory, to quantitatively analyze the pore distribution of coal samples inside and outside the outburst cavities of the Sanjia coal mine. The experiments have shown that the contents of aliphatic functional groups and hydrogen in tectonic coal are higher than those of aromatic structural functional groups. Raw coal has more straight chains than side chains, whereas aliphatic hydrocarbon mostly has short chains, and the branching degree is high. Soft and primary-structure coals have similar elemental content and tectonic effects endow the coal with better connectivity. The pores are filled with particles and flakes, and the surfaces of tectonic coal have more pores and fissures on them. According to the experimental curve, the pores are divided into five types. The pore size of primary-structure coal is mainly type II pores, and the pore size distribution of tectonic coal is relatively wide, with the majority being class I and class II pores. The specific surface area of tectonic coal is 60.7% more than that of primary-structure coal. The box fractal dimension of coal decreases with the increase in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) magnification. The minimum fractal dimension of tectonic coal is 2.49, which is 7.8% lower than the peak of 2.70. It can be seen from the fractal dimension that the fractal dimensions of pore types II, III, and IV are rougher.",,1454
991,35974628,Deriving the slip-front propagation velocity with slip-dependent and slip-velocity-dependent friction laws via the use of the linear marginal stability hypothesis.,"We investigate analytically and numerically the determining factors of the slip front propagation (SFP) velocity. The slip front has two forms characterized by an intruding or extruding front. We assume a one-dimensional viscoelastic medium on a rigid and fixed substrate, and we employ the friction law depending on the slip and slip velocity. Despite this dependency potentially being nonlinear, we use the linear marginal stability hypothesis, which linearizes the governing equation for the slip, to investigate the intruding and extruding front velocities. The analytically obtained velocities are found to be consistent with the numerical computation where we assume the friction law depends nonlinearly on both the slip and slip velocity. This implies that the linearized friction law is sufficient to capture the dominant features of SFP behavior.",,1455
1480,35968417,An ecological dynamics perspective on designing urban nature environments for wellbeing and health-enhancing physical activity.,"The latest World Health Organization report on green and blue space and mental health (2021) calls for greater, and better, urban nature environments, i. e., wilder urban parks, tree-laden sidewalks, and overall presence of nature in the urban environment. Evidence shows that living close to and interacting with nature promotes benefits to numerous health and well-being indicators. The present article narratively reviews what are the aspects of urban nature environments that enhance health and wellbeing markers, which aspects are preferred among users and visitors of urban nature environments, and how can the benefits for health and wellbeing be understood from a theoretical perspective. Finally, guided by the ecological dynamics framework, suggestions are put forward on how designers and planners of urban nature environments can consider affordances to promote physical activity behavior, health and wellbeing; and how exercise and health researchers and professionals may channel the interaction of individuals with the nature environment in their interventions and programs.",,1456
1007,35974612,Cylindrical convergence effects on the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in elastic and viscous media.,"Convergence effects on the perturbation growth of an imploding surface separating two nonideal material media (elastic and viscous media) are analyzed in the case of a cylindrical implosion in both the Rayleigh-Taylor stable and unstable configurations. In the stable configuration, the perturbation damping effect due to angular momentum conservation becomes destroyed for sufficiently high values of the elastic modulus or of the viscosity of the media. For the unstable configuration, Rayleigh-Taylor instability can be suppressed by the elasticity or mitigated by the viscosity, but without practically affecting the perturbation growth due to the geometrical convergence. However, the convergence effects manifest themselves in a manner somewhat different from the classical Bell-Plesset effect by making the process more sensitive to the media compressibility than in the case involving ideal media.",,1457

It is caused by pathogens entering the bloodstream and infecting the endocardium. We demonstrate a unique presentation of infective endocarditis following a prostatic urethral lift. The low index of suspicion and atypical symptoms prevented early diagnosis of the disease, leading to life-threatening complications and valve replacement surgery. Understanding unusual presentations of infective endocarditis can increase the index of suspicion in outpatient settings, leading to early diagnosis and preventing fatal complications.",,1460
723,35975160,Asymmetric synthesis of chromanone lactones via vinylogous conjugate addition of butenolide to 2-ester chromones.,"Chiral chromanone lactones are a class of natural products with important biological activity. We report a direct diastereo- and enantioselective vinylogous conjugate addition of butenolide to 2-ester substituted chromones. The transformation proceeded well in the presence of as low as 1 mol% of a chiral N,N'-dioxide/ScIII complex, 3 Å MS and a catalytic amount of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). The scope of Michael acceptors includes a variety of substituted chromones at different positions, and the desired chromanone lactones upon reduction are afforded in good yield and diastereoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). The strategy could be used in the concise synthesis of blennolide C and gonytolide A, C and G.",,1461
923,35974767,Ni single atoms on carbon nitride for visible-light-promoted full heterogeneous dual catalysis.,"Visible-light-driven organic transformations are of great interest in synthesizing valuable fine chemicals under mild conditions. The merger of heterogeneous photocatalysts and transition metal catalysts has recently drawn much attention due to its versatility for organic transformations. However, these semi-heterogenous systems suffered several drawbacks, such as transition metal agglomeration on the heterogeneous surface, hindering further applications. Here, we introduce heterogeneous single Ni atoms supported on carbon nitride (NiSAC/CN) for visible-light-driven C-N functionalization with a broad substrate scope. Compared to a semi-heterogeneous system, high activity and stability were observed due to metal-support interactions. Furthermore, through systematic experimental mechanistic studies, we demonstrate that the stabilized single Ni atoms on CN effectively change their redox states, leading to a complete photoredox cycle for C-N coupling.",,1462
1164,35973395,Use of a proline-specific endopeptidase to reintroduce gluten in patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity: A randomized trial.,"A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the main therapy for non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). However, the availability of novel enzymes with the ability to digest gluten could represent a therapeutic opportunity for NCGS patients to avoid a GFD. To evaluate the controlled reintroduction of gluten with or without the endopeptidase P1016 in NCGS patients. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monocentric study, Registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier no. NCT01864993. Gluten was reintroduced incrementally over a 3-week period under nutritional control. NCGS patients were randomized into two groups and administered P1016 or placebo during gluten reintroduction. We evaluated symptoms (visual analogue scale, VAS), quality of life (SF-36) and mental health symptoms (SCL-90) on a weekly basis. We enrolled a total 23 patients who were allocated to a placebo group (n = 11, age 38.4 ± 2.9) or an intervention group (n = 12, age 39.5 ± 3.1). No effect of P1016 on symptoms was found. During gluten reintroduction, patients reported a significant increase in abdominal pain and a worsening of stool consistency. Furthermore, no differences were found between the groups regarding SCL-90 and SF-36 scores. Our results demonstrate a lack of effect of P1016 in the management of NCGS patients and the possible reintroduction of gluten.",,1463
1585,35968299,Analysis of the genotype-phenotype correlation in isovaleric acidaemia: A case report of long-term follow-up of a chinese patient and literature review.,"Isovaleric acidaemia (IVA), characterized by an acute metabolic crisis and psychomotor delay, is a rare inherited metabolic disease caused by a deficiency in isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD). We report the case of a Chinese patient with IVA who was admitted to Tianjin Children's Hospital and followed up for 8 years. Genetic analysis of the patient and his parents was conducted using the whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. We searched for similar reported cases in the PubMed and Wanfang databases using the term isovaleric acidaemia, reviewed the related literature to obtain a summary of the clinical and genetic characteristics, and analyzed the genotype-phenotype correlations. The patient presented with encephalopathic symptoms, such as vomiting, lethargy, and somnolence. We identified compound heterozygous variants of the IVD gene, including the unreported variant c.224A>G (p.Asn75Ser) and the reported variant c.1195G>C (p.Asp399His). The child was prescribed a low-protein diet supplemented with L-carnitine. During the 8-year follow-up, no metabolic disorder or encephalopathic symptoms recurred. At present, the child is 11 years of age and has normal mental and motor performance. Another 154 cases identified in 25 relevant references were combined with this case, resulting in a sample of 155 patients, including 52 asymptomatic patients, 64 with neonatal onset, and 39 with the chronic intermittent disease with onset from ages of 1 month to 10 years (median age, 2 years). Among articles that reported sex, the male-to-female ratio was 1:1.06. The cardinal symptoms included vomiting, lethargy, sweaty foot odor, poor feeding, developmental delay, and epilepsy. The proportion of variants in regions 123-159 and 356-403 of the IVD protein was greater in symptomatic patients than in asymptomatic patients. Conversely, in asymptomatic patients, the proportion of variants in the 282-318 region was greater than in symptomatic patients. This case report describes an unreported variant c.224A>G (p.Asn75Ser) of the IVD gene, and summarizes previously reported cases. Furthermore, the correlation between the genotype and clinical phenotype of IVA is analyzed to improve the understanding of this disease.",,1464
1968,35967639,How the emergence of the omicron variant may change people's attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic.,"This study aims to examine people's attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic before and after the emergence of the omicron variant. Data were collected between November 15 and December 14, 2021, and three attitudes were included, namely, the negative influence on daily life, concerns of infection risk, and prediction of the ending of the pandemic. The majority of people perceived that daily life was at least somewhat negatively influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, and they worried at least once a week about infection risk. After the emergence of the omicron variant, the perceived negative influence and concern of infection risk decreased slightly while the prediction of ending increased significantly. People who were infected by COVID-19 perceived more negative influence and more concern of infection risk, but were more optimistic about the ending of the pandemic. People who did not get a vaccine perceived less negative influence and less concern of infection risk, but were more pessimistic about the ending of the pandemic. The attitudes varied significantly by individual and contextual characteristics. The emergence of omicron significantly increased people's predicted ending time of the pandemic but did not change people's perception of the pandemic's negative influence on daily life and concern of infection risk.",,1465
856,35974867,Sellar Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumors (AT/RT): A Systematic Review and Case Illustration.,"Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid tumors are rare, highly malignant tumors in adults, with a median survival of 20 months. We report a case of a sellar atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor in a 70-year-old female treated with intraventricular chemotherapy, followed by a systematic review of the current management of sellar AT/RTs. A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted on Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed Central using the key terms sellar and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data, including patient demographics, histology, treatments, and overall survival were extracted and analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank analysis were used to compare survival outcomes between different treatment regimens. Our literature search disclosed 123 publications. After prespecified exclusions, 41 patients with sellar AT/RT from 30 manuscripts were identified, and 38 were included in the final analysis. Including our patient, the median age was 44 (range: 20-70) with a substantial female predominance (94.7%). Collectively, patients who received combined chemoradiation therapy had a significantly increased overall survival compared to those who received single modality or no adjuvant therapies (median OS 27 vs. 1.25 months; p=0.0052). Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor in the sellar region carries a poor prognosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy were associated with significantly increased overall survival. Early consideration of neuro-oncology and radiation-oncology referral and management is likely beneficial in this patient population. Intrathecal chemotherapy is a treatment modality that requires further exploration given the limited options and current dismal prognosis of adult sellar AT/RT.",,1466

884,35974839,Stretchable and self-healable hydrogel artificial skin.,"Hydrogels have emerged as promising materials for the construction of skin-like mechanical sensors. The common design of hydrogel-based artificial skin requires a dielectric sandwiched between two hydrogel layers for capacitive sensing. However, such a planar configuration limits the sensitivity, stretchability and self-healing properties. Here, we report the design of single-layer composite hydrogels with bulk capacitive junctions as mechanical sensors. We engineer dielectric peptide-coated graphene (PCG) to serve as homogenously dispersed electric double layers in hydrogels. Any mechanical motions that alter the microscopic distributions of PCG in the hydrogels can significantly change the overall capacitance. We use peptide self-assembly to render strong yet dynamic interfacial interactions between the hydrogel network and graphene. The resulting hydrogels can be stretched up to 77 times their original length and self-heal in a few minutes. The devices can effectively sense strain and pressure in both air and aqueous environments, providing tremendous opportunities for next-generation iontronics.",,1468
1047,35974572,Ionization states for the multipetawatt laser-QED regime.,"A paradigm shift in the physics of laser-plasma interactions is approaching with the commissioning of multipetawatt laser facilities worldwide. Radiation reaction processes will result in the onset of electron-positron pair cascades and, with that, the absorption and partitioning of the incident laser energy, as well as the energy transport throughout the irradiated targets. To accurately quantify these effects, one must know the focused intensity on target in situ. In this work, a way of measuring the focused intensity on target is proposed based upon the ionization of xenon gas at low ambient pressure. The field ionization rates from two works [Phys. Rev. A 59, 569 (1999)1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.59.569 and Phys. Rev. A 98, 043407 (2018)2469-992610.1103/PhysRevA.98.043407], where the latter rate has been derived using quantum mechanics, have been implemented in the particle-in-cell code SMILEI [Comput. Phys. Commun. 222, 351 (2018)0010-465510.1016/j.cpc.2017.09.024]. A series of one- and two-dimensional simulations are compared and shown to reproduce the charge states without presenting visible differences when increasing the simulation dimensionality. They provide a way to accurately verify the intensity on target using in situ measurements.",,1469
1795,35967860,Antibiotic Resistance and Mechanisms of Pathogenic Bacteria in Tubo-Ovarian Abscess.,"A tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) is a common type of inflammatory lump in clinical practice. TOA is an important, life-threatening disease, and it has become more common in recent years, posing a major health risk to women. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents are necessary to cover the most likely pathogens because the pathogens that cause TOA are polymicrobial. However, the response rate of antibiotic treatment is about 70%, whereas one-third of patients have poor clinical consequences and they require drainage or surgery. Rising antimicrobial resistance serves as a significant reason for the unsatisfactory medical outcomes. It is important to study the antibiotic resistance mechanism of TOA pathogens in solving the problems of multi-drug resistant strains. This paper focuses on the most common pathogenic bacteria isolated from TOA specimens and discusses the emerging trends and epidemiology of resistant Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and gram-positive anaerobic cocci. Besides that, new methods that aim to solve the antibiotic resistance of related pathogens are discussed, such as CRISPR, nanoparticles, bacteriophages, antimicrobial peptides, and pathogen-specific monoclonal antibodies. Through this review, we hope to reveal the current situation of antibiotic resistance of common TOA pathogens, relevant mechanisms, and possible antibacterial strategies, providing references for the clinical treatment of drug-resistant pathogens.",,1470
2348,35967028,Application of a Synthetic Polymer Nanocomposite Latex in a Wellbore Cement Slurry for Gas Blockage Functions.,"Commercial synthetic polymers are a professional approach to creating versatile new materials with high-performance classes. This research focuses on controlling gas migration within cement in the early stages of cement setting through a newly synthesized butadiene-carbon nanotube (CNT) polymer nanocomposite latex. The optimized cement in these experiments exhibits the inherited combination behavior from the flexible characteristics of the polymer matrix and the mechanical features from the carbon nanotubes. The feedback of the superelastic behavior of carbon nanotubes is indicated by a 75% increase in the modulus of elasticity and a 48% increase in the flexural strength in cementitious samples reinforced with the polymer nanocomposite latex. The improvement of surface tension by the polymer latex in the slurry and enough tensile strength during cement hydration have positive control and compensatory effects in early shrinkage and resistance to the development of fissures and cracks in the hardening cement. Optimized cement slurries containing polymer nanocomposite additives dramatically reduce the critical transfer time window to about 40 min for gelatinized cement, thereby reducing the risk of gas migration during the mentioned critical period for the cement slurry.",,1471
864,35974859,Ptosis Correction: Our Modification and Experience.,"Background Congenital ptosis not only results in an asymmetric facial appearance but can lead to permanent visual disturbances if not addressed at an appropriate time. Crawford used fascia lata for suspension of the eyelid to frontalis muscle, which remains a standard procedure for congenital ptosis correction to date, with an acceptable recurrence rate due to graft slippage. There are many modifications in this technique to reduce this complication; hence, in this study, we share our experience of a modification to improve the outcomes. Methodology This retrospective study was conducted at a private tertiary care hospital in Karachi for 10 years. In total, 26 patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All patients underwent a modified Crawford's procedure under general anesthesia. Results In this study, the male-to-female ratio was 1:1.5. In total, 17 (65%) patients had unilateral ptosis. The mean age of presentation was 7 ± 3 years. All of our patients had poor levator function (<5 mm excursion) with a mean of 3 mm and mean grade of ptosis of 4 ± 1.6 mm. The mean preoperative marginal reflex distance (MRD) was +1.8 ± 0.6 mm. In this study, the patients had a mean postoperative MRD of 4.2 ± 0.7 mm at the four-week follow-up. Conclusions Although Crawford's procedure gives promising results for ptosis correction, suturing the fascial sling to the tarsal plate ensures good anchorage and prevents relapse.",,1472
2321,35967057,Fabrication of TiO2 Spheres and a Visible Light Active α-Fe2O3/TiO2-Rutile/TiO2-Anatase Heterogeneous Photocatalyst from Natural Ilmenite.,"High-purity (98.8%, TiO2) rutile nanoparticles were successfully synthesized using ilmenite sand as the initial titanium source. This novel synthesis method was cost-effective and straightforward due to the absence of the traditional gravity, magnetic, electrostatic separation, ball milling, and smelting processes. Synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles were 99% pure. Also, highly corrosive environmentally hazardous acid leachate generated during the leaching process of ilmenite sand was effectively converted into a highly efficient visible light active photocatalyst. The prepared photocatalyst system consists of anatase-TiO2/rutile-TiO2/Fe2O3 (TF-800), rutile-TiO2/Fe2TiO5 (TFTO-800), and anatase-TiO2/Fe3O4 (TF-450) nanocomposites, respectively. The pseudo-second-order adsorption rate of the TF-800 ternary nanocomposite was 0.126 g mg-1 min-1 in dark conditions, and a 0.044 min-1 visible light initial photodegradation rate was exhibited. The TFTO-800 binary nanocomposite adsorbed methylene blue (MB) following pseudo-second-order adsorption (0.224 g mg-1 min-1) in the dark, and the rate constant for photodegradation of MB in visible light was 0.006 min-1. The prepared TF-450 nanocomposite did not display excellent adsorptive and photocatalytic performances throughout the experiment period. The synthesized TF-800 and TFTO-800 were able to degrade 93.1 and 49.8% of a 100 mL, 10 ppm MB dye solution within 180 min, respectively.",,1473
1277,35970759,External Validation of a Novel Risk Model in Patients With Favorable Risk Renal Cell Carcinoma Defined by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC): Results From the Turkish Oncology Group Kidney Cancer Consortium (TKCC) Database.,"A novel prognostic model was recommended for patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) by the International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC). In this study, we aimed to externally validate a novel risk model for the IMDC-favorable risk group in patients with mRCC. The Turkish Oncology Group Kidney Cancer Consortium (TKCC) is a multicenter registry that includes 13 cancer centers in Turkey. As described by Schmidt et al., 3 parameters (ie, time from diagnosis to systemic therapy <3 vs. ≥3 years, Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] 80 vs. >80, and the presence of brain, liver, or bone metastasis) were used to divide the IMDC favorable risk group into 2 new categories: very favorable and favorable risk groups. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Time to treatment failure (TTF) and objective response rate (ORR) in the very favorable and favorable risk groups were the secondary endpoints. A total of 545 patients with mRCC from all IMDC risk groups and 112 patients from the favorable risk group were included in this study. According to the novel classification model, 44 (39.3%) and 68 (60.7%) patients with former favorable risk were categorized into very favorable and favorable risk groups, respectively. The median OS (55.8 months vs. 34.2 months, P = .025) and TTF (25.5 months vs. 15.5 months, P = .010) were longer in the very favorable risk group than in the favorable risk group. The concordance index of the new IMDC model in all patients was 0.65 for OS. Despite the higher ORR in the very favorable risk group than in the favorable risk group, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (52.4% vs. 44.7, P = .573). This was the first study to externally validate the novel IMDC risk model presented in the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium 2021.",,1474
200,35982822,Extensive Pleural Involvement in Pediatric T-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma.,"Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is the common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in childhood and adolescence. T-cell LBL (T-LBL) usually manifests with an anterior mediastinal mass and disseminated disease. We present a 12-year-old girl with progressive neck swelling and dyspnea for 1 year. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography done for pretreatment staging unveiled hypermetabolic lymph nodes on both sides of the diaphragm with splenic and bone marrow involvement. Apart from these, there was the extensive involvement of the left pleura. Biopsy and immunohistochemistry revealed T-LBL. The extensive secondary pleural involvement in pediatric T-LBL is rarely seen and needs to be reported.",,1475
454,35978935,Tensioned space after pneumonectomy for cancer with mediastinal shift and cardiac tamponade-causes and treatment (Review).,"Regarding the pleural space after pneumonectomy for malignancy, a vast number of studies have assessed early drop in the fluid level, suggesting a broncho-pleural fistula, but only a small number of studies reported on the abnormal increase in the fluid level-a potentially lethal complication. In the present study, the available databases worldwide were screened and 19 cases were retrieved, including 14 chylothorax and 3 hydrothorax cases, 1 pneumothorax and 1 haemothorax case. Tension chylothorax is caused by mediastinal lymph node dissection as an assumed risk in radical cancer surgery. For tensioned haemothorax, the cause has not been elucidated, although lymphatic stasis associated with deep venous thrombosis was suspected. Tensioned pneumothorax was caused by chest wall damage after extrapleural pneumonectomy combined with low aspiration pressure on the chest drain. No cause was determined for none of the tensioned hydrothorax-all 3 cases had the scenario of pericardial resection in addition to pneumonectomy in common. Tensioned space after pneumonectomy for cancer manifests as cardiac tamponade. Initial management is emergent decompression of the heart and mediastinum. Final management depends on the fluid type (chyle, transudate, air, blood) and the medical context of each case. Of the 19 cases, 12 required a major surgical procedure as the definitive management.",,1476
1474,35968424,"Antiviral treatment in outpatients with herps zoster in six major areas of China, 2010-2019.","The objective of this study was to assess the status and trends of antiviral treatment in outpatients with herpes zoster in China. Prescription data on antiviral drugs were extracted from the database of the Hospital Prescription Analysis Program of China according to the inclusion criteria. Yearly prescriptions and costs were calculated, and trends were analyzed. The trends were further stratified by age, sex, and specific drug use. The distribution of defined daily costs (DDCs) of valaciclovir and famciclovir were analyzed, and trends in the median DDCs were identified. A total of 132,911 prescriptions from 49 hospitals located in six major areas of China were included in the analysis. The yearly prescriptions containing antivirals increased from 8,819 in 2010 to 16,361 in 2019. The percentage of prescriptions for patients aged 65 years and above also increased (27.7% in 2010 to 31.0% in 2019), and the number of prescriptions for females was higher than those for males (P < 0.001). The average cost of antivirals per prescription decreased; thus, the yearly cost showed no increasing trend. The main prescribed antivirals were valaciclovir and famciclovir, which progressively increased in prescriptions. The use of acyclovir decreased during the study period. Prescriptions containing topical formulations, acyclovir and penciclovir, both increased. The DDCs of valaciclovir and famciclovir decreased dramatically. The use of antivirals has increased over the decade, while the cost has not. Antiviral treatments adhere well to recent recommendations, except for the use of topical antivirals. The findings of this study may benefit the healthcare source allocation and management of herpes zoster in China.",,1477
2282,35967149,Unusual Presentation of T-cell Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia.,"Large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia is a rare chronic lymphoproliferative disorder that can arise from T- or natural killer-cell lineages. It is an indolent disease that typically occurs in the sixth decade of life. Most cases of T-cell LGL leukemia (T-LGL) are associated with autoimmune disorders. Patients with T-LGL are generally asymptomatic; however, they can present with symptoms related to neutropenia, infections, and autoimmune disorders. Here, we report two cases of T-LGL in which the patients presented with liver dysfunction.",,1478
1515,35968371,A fused biometrics information graph convolutional neural network for effective classification of patellofemoral pain syndrome.,"Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common, yet misunderstood, knee pathology. Early accurate diagnosis can help avoid the deterioration of the disease. However, the existing intelligent auxiliary diagnosis methods of PFPS mainly focused on the biosignal of individuals but neglected the common biometrics of patients. In this paper, we propose a PFPS classification method based on the fused biometrics information Graph Convolution Neural Networks (FBI-GCN) which focuses on both the biosignal information of individuals and the common characteristics of patients. The method first constructs a graph which uses each subject as a node and fuses the biometrics information (demographics and gait biosignal) of different subjects as edges. Then, the graph and node information [biosignal information, including the joint kinematics and surface electromyography (sEMG)] are used as the inputs to the GCN for diagnosis and classification of PFPS. The method is tested on a public dataset which contain walking and running data from 26 PFPS patients and 15 pain-free controls. The results suggest that our method can classify PFPS and pain-free with higher accuracy (mean accuracy = 0.8531 ± 0.047) than other methods with the biosignal information of individuals as input (mean accuracy = 0.813 ± 0.048). After optimal selection of input variables, the highest classification accuracy (mean accuracy = 0.9245 ± 0.034) can be obtained, and a high accuracy can still be obtained with a 40% reduction in test variables (mean accuracy = 0.8802 ± 0.035). Accordingly, the method effectively reflects the association between subjects, provides a simple and effective aid for physicians to diagnose PFPS, and gives new ideas for studying and validating risk factors related to PFPS.",,1479
1453,35968445,The association between reproductive history and the multidimensional health of older adults in rural China and its gender differences: Evidence from the Chinese longitudinal healthy longevity survey.,"Few studies have examined the association between reproductive history and the multidimensional health of older adults with more diverse reproductive histories and poorer health status in rural China. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of parity, sex ratio of children and late childbearing on multidimensional health and its gender differences. The analytical sample consisted of 3,377 older adults in rural China who participated in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) in 2018. Linear regression models were applied to estimate the relationship between reproductive history and multidimensional health, with separate models for each indicator of health outcomes. Older adults in rural areas with greater parity were more likely to have better cognitive function (β = 0.409, 95% CI: 0.255-0.563), fewer Activities of Daily Living (ADL) limitations (β = -0.085, 95% CI: -0.137 to -0.034) and symptoms of depression (β = -0.396, 95% CI: -0.577 to -0.216). The social mechanism of intergenerational support from children later in life partly explained the positive effect of parity. Late childbearing had negative effects on cognitive function (β = -1.220, 95% CI: -1.895 to -0.545), ADL (β = 0.253, 95% CI: 0.028-0.478) and symptoms of depression (β = 1.025, 95% CI: 0.237-1.812). Women were more likely to be influenced by the positive effect of parity; the association between late childbearing and health was only significant in the male group. Parity and late childbearing are associated with cognitive function, activities of daily living, and symptoms of depression in the older adults in rural China. Older adults with more children might be in better health, and this finding is especially significant in women. However, late childbearing had a negative effect on multidimensional health, especially for men. The social mechanism and gender differences between reproductive history and health need to be further explored.",,1480
231,35982789,Revising the paradigm: Are bats really pathogen reservoirs or do they possess an efficient immune system?,"While bats are often referred to as reservoirs of viral pathogens, a meta-analysis of the literature reveals many cases in which there is not enough evidence to claim so. In many cases, bats are able to confront viruses, recover, and remain immune by developing a potent titer of antibodies, often without becoming a reservoir. In other cases, bats might have carried an ancestral virus that at some time point might have mutated into a human pathogen. Moreover, bats exhibit a balanced immune response against viruses that have evolved over millions of years. Using genomic tools, it is now possible to obtain a deeper understanding of that unique immune system and its variability across the order Chiroptera. We conclude, that with the exception of a few viruses, bats pose little zoonotic danger to humans and that they operate a highly efficient anti-inflammatory response that we should strive to understand.",,1481
1906,35967703,A Positive Versus Negative Interaction Memory Affects Parole Officers' Implicit Associations Between the Self-Concept and the Group Parolees.,"Parole officers are one of many actors in the legal system charged with interpreting and enforcing the law. Officers not only assure that parolees under their supervision comply with the terms of their release, but also monitor and control parolees' criminal behavior. They conduct their jobs through their understanding of their official mandate and make considered and deliberate choices while executing that mandate. However, their experiences as legal actors may impact their implicit cognitions about parolees. This experiment is the first of its kind to examine implicit (i.e., automatic) associations between the self and parolees among actors of the legal system. The present study examines the implicit cognitive consequences of the quality of the parole officer-parolee relationship from the perspective of the parole officer; specifically, whether parole officers who are reminded of positive experiences with parolees implicitly associate more with the group parolees than those reminded of a negative experience. In addition, we explore the moderating effects of parole officers' subjective professional orientation and identification. Eighty-four New Jersey parole officers participated in the study. First, an experimental manipulation of either a past positive or negative experience was administered via a writing task. Participants then completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure associations between the self-concept of parole officers with parolees who are part of the group criminal, followed by measures of professional orientation and identification. Participants who were reminded of a positive experience with a parolee exhibited stronger associations between self and the group parolee when compared to those who were reminded of a negative experience. Neither professional orientation nor parole officer group identification were related to implicit associations and did not moderate the effect of the past experience reminder on implicit associations. Implicit cognitions of parole officers may influence their behaviors and interactions with those whom they supervise. Positive reminders affect implicit self-associations with parolees presumably via empathy, which is known to affect the quality of therapeutic and supervision relationships; thus, theoretically, leading to improved outcomes for both officers and parolees.",,1482
1841,35967799,True Cost Accounting of a healthy and sustainable diet in Italy.,"It is widely upheld that global food systems are unsustainable. Sustainable diets are gaining prominence as key components to entangle global food system challenges, as well as to transition towards the pathway of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Hence, sustainable and healthy diets are at the core of much research with the aim to bring together nutritional adequacy, cultural acceptability, environmental sustainability, economic affordability, and shape future consumption patterns. This article contributes to advancing knowledge on sustainable diets by proposing a True Cost Accounting method to assess the cost and impact of the adoption of a more sustainable and healthier diet, using Italy as an illustration. The research analyses the complexity of a diet from an environmental, health, and socioeconomic point of view and defines a new assessment framework that can be replicated and adapted to other contexts. Results show that in Italy, the adoption of a sustainable and healthy diet has a 47% lower carbon footprint and 25% lower water footprint than the current diet, while impacting 13% less on the average income and food monthly expenditure. Also, the desirable diet has a 21% lower impact on the sanitary costs related to cardiovascular disease. This study corroborates that the consumption of the desirable diet would provide a total cost saving of 741 EUR per year per capita, if we consider its impact on the environment, health, and socio-economic costs.",,1483
1017,35974602,Particles on demand for flows with strong discontinuities.,"Particles-on-demand formulation of kinetic theory [B. Dorschner, F. Bösch and I. V. Karlin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 130602 (2018)0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.121.130602] is used to simulate a variety of compressible flows with strong discontinuities in density, pressure, and velocity. Two modifications are applied to the original formulation of the particles-on-demand method. First, a regularization by Grad's projection of particles populations is combined with the reference frame transformations in order to enhance stability and accuracy. Second, a finite-volume scheme is implemented which allows tight control of mass, momentum, and energy conservation. The proposed model is validated with an array of challenging one- and two-dimensional benchmarks of compressible flows, including hypersonic and near-vacuum situations, Richtmyer-Meshkov instability, double Mach reflection, and astrophysical jet. Excellent performance of the modified particles-on-demand method is demonstrated beyond the limitations of other lattice Boltzmann-like approaches to compressible flows.",,1484

We exemplify with two examples but highlight that there are many other potential opportunities.",,1485
95,35983388,The Role of Alvarado Score in Predicting Acute Appendicitis and Its Severity in Correlation to Histopathology: A Retrospective Study in a Qatar Population.,"Background/objective Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common surgical emergencies that require a proper diagnosis to avoid a negative outcome in the case of missed or delayed diagnosis. Our study aims to assess the diagnostic power of the Alvarado score and the prediction of the severity of acute appendicitis in correlation to intraoperative findings and the final histopathology (HP) result. Methods This retrospective study was applied to 1,303 patients with clinically proven acute appendicitis (AA) and available HP results. We correlated Alvarado score to the gold standard HP and intraoperative findings. We selected the cutoff point of Alvarado at 5 and 7 as they were the most frequent cutoff value mentioned in the literature and based on the ROC curve in this study to assess sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Results The mean age of the study cohort is 33.3 ± 9.5 years, with a male predominance (75.8%). The negative appendectomy (NA) rate was 4%. The operative complication rate was 1.2%, and we recorded one mortality case (0.1%). The diagnostic evidence of AA was in 95.9% of cases. Alvarado score ≥ 7 presented sensitivity and specificity of 66.4% and 69.8%, respectively, with PPV of 98.1% and NPV of 8.1%, with an accuracy of 66.5%. For Alvarado score ≥ 5, the sensitivity was 91.2%, specificity was 22.6%, PPV was 96.5%, NPV was 9.8%, and accuracy was 88.4%. In addition, we demonstrated statistical significance between Alvarado risk stratification with HP and intraoperative grades (p = 0.001 each). Conclusion The Alvarado scoring system alone is not enough to diagnose AA with unsatisfactory sensitivity and specificity. However, it is a good indicator of the severity of AA that we can depend on to prioritize those patients waiting for surgery.",,1486
360,35979314,Unusual course of congenital complete heart block in an adult: A case report.,"Congenital complete heart block (CCHB) with normal cardiac structure and negativity for anti-Ro/La antibody is rare. Additionally, CCHB is much less frequently diagnosed in adults, and its natural history in adults is less well known. A 23-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for frequent syncopal episodes. She had bradycardia at the age of 1 year but had never had impaired exercise capacity or a syncopal episode before admission. The possible diagnosis of acquired complete atrioventricular block was carefully ruled out, and then the diagnosis of CCHB was made. According to existing guidelines, permanent pacemaker implantation was recommended, but the patient declined. With regular follow-up for 28 years, the patient had an unusually good outcome without any invasive intervention or medicine. She had an uneventful pregnancy and led a normally active life without any symptoms of low cardiac output or syncopal recurrence. This case implies that CCHB in adulthood may have good clinical outcomes and does not always require permanent pacemaker implantation.",,1487

2281,35967150,Effectiveness of Communication Skills Training in Medical Students Using Simulated Patients or Volunteer Outpatients.,"Communication skills are the vital basis for patient-doctor interactions in undergraduate medical education. With excellent patient-physician interaction and communication, patients will likely build better rapport and trust with the physician. This allows all the necessary information to be divulged with the reassurance of confidentiality and devise appropriate investigations and treatment plans that patients would be more inclined to follow. The most common and effective ways of teaching communication skills to medical students are by using simulated patients and volunteer outpatients. However, which types of patients to use for better development of practical communication skills training. Establishing the demonstrable difference between using two kinds of patients would refine the training scheme for students. This would produce doctors that have practical communication skills and enhance their care to assist patients on their road to recovery or palliative care. This review compares and establishes the effectiveness of medical students' communication skills training using simulated patients and volunteer outpatients about the adult learning theories. This research is carried out following a critical review of internationally reputed guidelines from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the General Medical Council (GMC). Several search terms were used on various online databases such as Medline (Ovid), PubMed, and Academic Medicine. A thorough selection process was applied using the inclusion and exclusion criteria to narrow the search. Four studies related to this review's aim were collected and critically analyzed. The methods of obtaining the studies were structured using the PRISMA guidelines. The studies showed that one study favored volunteer outpatients while the other preferred having simulated patients. Another study showed that students considered both types of patients essential for communication skills training. All the studies presented the strengths and weaknesses of both simulated and volunteer outpatients. Discussion of the validity of all analyses was based on the CASP criteria. Study design, sample selection, and biases were scrutinized for each study. Various adult learning theories were used to correlate the effects of the communication skills training. In conclusion, simulated patients are more useful for pre-clinical years, intimate examination, and giving instructions about the physical examination. Whereas volunteer outpatients are put to better use in clinical years to incorporate more medical aspects such as obtaining a differential diagnosis, management of illness, and procedural techniques. Introducing different types of patients based on their study progression and topic of discussion could be adapted.",,1489
938,35974752,Phenothiazine-based covalent organic frameworks with low exciton binding energies for photocatalysis.,"Designing delocalized excitons with low binding energy (E b) in organic semiconductors is urgently required for efficient photochemistry because the excitons in most organic materials are localized with a high E b of >300 meV. In this work, we report the achievement of a low E b of ∼50 meV by constructing phenothiazine-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with inherent crystallinity, porosity, chemical robustness, and feasibility of bandgap engineering. The low E b facilitates effective exciton dissociation and thus promotes photocatalysis by using these COFs. As a demonstration, we subject these COFs to photocatalytic polymerization to synthesize polymers with remarkably high molecular weight without any requirement of the metal catalyst. Our results can facilitate the rational design of porous materials with low E b for efficient photocatalysis.",,1490
1732,35968010,Estimating the sensitivity and specificity of serum ELISA and pooled and individual fecal PCR for detecting Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in Canadian cow-calf herds using Bayesian latent class models.,"While Johne's disease (JD) is less common in beef than in dairy herds, consolidation is increasing transmission risk. Estimates of Mycobacterium avium spp. paratuberculosis (MAP) prevalence and test performance in cow-calf herds are needed to inform control programs. Objectives of this study included describing the prevalence of MAP in Canadian cow-calf herds and comparing the relative performance of a serum ELISA, pooled fecal PCR and individual fecal PCR using Bayesian latent class models, and to investigate factors associated with positive MAP tests. Blood and fecal samples (n = 3,171) were collected from 159 Canadian cow-calf herds. All samples were analyzed using serum ELISA and fecal PCR (pools of five samples) and a subset of 913 fecal samples were also tested with individual PCR. Based on latent class analysis, MAP prevalence was higher in eastern compared to western Canada for both animals {East, 3% [95% Credible Interval (CrI) 1-7%]; West, 1% [95% CrI 0.2-2%]} and herds [East, 15% (95% CrI 2-35%); West, 10% (95% CrI 1-26%), based on one or more positive results]. Sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) for animal level individual PCR were 96% (95% CrI 80-100%) and 98% (95% CrI 96-100%), respectively followed by pooled PCR [Se = 54% (95% CrI 36-72%), Sp > 99.9% (95% CrI 99.8-100%)] and ELISA [Se = 36% (95% CrI 22-52%), Sp = 98% (95% CrI 96-99%)]. Based on 20 samples per herd, the herd level Se of ELISA was 79% (95% CrI 47-100%) (at least one positive sample) compared to 43% (95% CrI 14-94%) for pooled PCR. Herd-level Sp was 99% (95% CrI 96-100%) for pooled PCR and 90% (95% CrI 83-100%) for ELISA. Cows from herds with dairy cattle on farm and cows with symptoms of JD in the past 3 years were more likely to be MAP positive. Herds that had animals with JD symptoms in the previous 3 years and those with more breeding females were most likely to test positive for MAP. While serum ELISA can be effective for herd screening, PCR performed better for animal testing. Pooled PCR testing could be a less costly option; however, determining the most cost-effective approach will require further economic analysis.",,1491
1668,35968106,Nanoporous silica gel can compete with the flower stigma in germinating and attracting pollen tubes.,"To find nanoporous substrates with hydrodynamic properties useful for pollen hydration and germination, we used the glassy Silica gel and Vycor scales and pollen with different morphological and physiological traits, that of Crocus vernus, and that of Narcissus poeticus. For in vitro tests, the scales were spread on microscope slides, hand pollinated, and incubated. Pollen germination was evaluated with the stereomicroscope and the tube growth was explored with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The in vivo tests were carried out by sprinkling the stigmas of the Crocus plants with Silica gel scales and immediately after having pollinated them by hand, the plants were incubated. Three hours later, the stigmas were removed and treated for observation with SEM. In vitro the pollen of both species germinated on Silica gel with percentages similar to those of the in vivo and in vitro controls, accumulating fibrillary material at the interface. The tubes grew perpendicular to the surface of the scales, trying to penetrate the scales to the point of flattening with the apex. On Crocus stigmas sprinkled with Silica gel scales, pollen developed tubes that grew to the scales rather than penetrating the papillae. The results underline the close interaction of pollen with nanoporous artificial material, so much so that its pollen tubes are attracted to the Silica scales more than to the stigma papillae that arises from a mechanism of natural selection.",,1492
2428,35966868,Cytoplasmic strings between ICM and mTE are a positive predictor of clinical pregnancy and live birth outcomes: A time-lapse study.,"Elective single blastocyst transfer (eSBT) is considered to reduce the incidence of multiple pregnancy compared to double embryo transfer. Blastocyst selection is the key to achieving pregnancy. In the past, morphological assessment was the main criterion used to select blastocyst. Some important morphological parameters are considered to be clinically valuable, such as cytoplasmic strings traversing from the inner cell mass (ICM) and mural trophectoderm (mTE). In this study, 1,267 elective frozen-thawed eSBT cycles cultured in a time-lapse culture system from January 2018 to May 2019 were included. Blastocysts were grouped into present and absent according to the appearance of cytoplasmic strings between ICM and mTE cells. The present group was further categorized according to the quantity of cytoplasmic strings between the ICM and mTE cells. A time-lapse analysis indicated that cytoplasmic strings between ICM and mTE were more visible among good quality blastocysts. Furthermore, blastocysts with cytoplasmic strings showed higher clinical pregnancy and live birth rates (P = 0.011 and 0.003), while no significant differences were observed in abortion rate and birth weight (P = 0.466 and 0.556). In conclusion, although the results of previous studies about cytoplasmic strings have been controversial, the present time-lapse analysis provides evidence for the first time that cytoplasmic strings between ICM and mTE cells are a positive predictor of clinical pregnancy and live birth outcomes in elective frozen-thawed single blastocyst transfer cycles.",,1493
2496,35966714,A SARS-CoV-2 Negative Antigen Rapid Diagnostic in RT-qPCR Positive Samples Correlates With a Low Likelihood of Infectious Viruses in the Nasopharynx.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) transmission occurs even among fully vaccinated individuals; thus, prompt identification of infected patients is central to control viral circulation. Antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are highly specific, but sensitivity is variable. Discordant RT-qPCR vs. Ag-RDT results are reported, raising the question of whether negative Ag-RDT in positive RT-qPCR samples could imply the absence of infectious viruses. To study the relationship between negative Ag-RDT results with virological, molecular, and serological parameters, we selected a cross-sectional and a follow-up dataset and analyzed virus culture, subgenomic RNA quantification, and sequencing to determine infectious viruses and mutations. We demonstrated that RT-qPCR positive while SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT negative discordant results correlate with the absence of infectious virus in nasopharyngeal samples. A decrease in sgRNA detection together with an expected increase in detectable anti-S and anti-N IgGs was also verified in these samples. The data clearly demonstrate that a negative Ag-RDT sample is less likely to harbor infectious SARS-CoV-2 and, consequently, has a lower transmissible potential.",,1494
1221,35971492,Long-term outcomes and causes of intrastromal corneal ring segment explantation in a tertiary eye hospital.,"To evaluate the causes and long-term outcomes after intrastromal corneal ring segment (ICRS) explantation in the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital. This was retrospective cohort study. Two groups were analyzed: Group one, ICRS surgery done in our hospital (n = 41) and group two, surgery done outside but removed in our hospital (n = 29). Causes and postoperative management after ICRS removal were analyzed. For statistical analysis, groups were analyzed into two subgroups of causes of ICRS removal: Visual disturbance versus extrusion/infection/neovascularization (NV) subgroups; and two subgroups of postoperative treatment: Corneal transplant (CT) versus Contact lens (CL)/eyeglasses subgroups. The most common cause of ICRS removal in group one was visual disturbance (45.2%) while in group two was extrusion (41.2%). CL is the preferable management after explantation. 76% of ICRS removal occurred during the first 4 years. In group 1, there was significant worse preimplantation visual acuity (P = 0.02) in CT subgroup versus CL/eyeglasses. CT subgroup had lower pachymetry of 437.4 μm (P = 0.04) and higher myopia of 8.05 (P = 0.03) than CL/eyeglasses subgroup. For group two, there was a significant improvement in uncorrected visual acuity in visual disturbances subgroup after explantation (P = 0.004). After explantation, visual disturbances subgroup had higher myopia -4.4 than extrusion subgroup -1.15 (P = 0.004). Seventy-six percent of ICRS removal occurred during the first 4 years. High myopia and pachymetry lower than 437 um were associated with visual disturbances and further management with corneal transplantation. High myopia was also associated with visual disturbances in surgeries done outside our hospital.",,1495
926,35974764,Highly stereoselective and enantiodivergent synthesis of cyclopropylphosphonates with engineered carbene transferases.,"Organophosphonate compounds have represented a rich source of biologically active compounds, including enzyme inhibitors, antibiotics, and antimalarial agents. Here, we report the development of a highly stereoselective strategy for olefin cyclopropanation in the presence of a phosphonyl diazo reagent as carbene precursor. In combination with a 'substrate walking' protein engineering strategy, two sets of efficient and enantiodivergent myoglobin-based biocatalysts were developed for the synthesis of both (1R,2S) and (1S,2R) enantiomeric forms of the desired cyclopropylphosphonate ester products. This methodology enables the efficient transformation of a broad range of vinylarene substrates at a preparative scale (i.e. gram scale) with up to 99% de and ee. Mechanistic studies provide insights into factors that contribute to make this reaction inherently more challenging than hemoprotein-catalyzed olefin cyclopropanation with ethyl diazoacetate investigated previously. This work expands the range of synthetically useful, enzyme-catalyzed transformations and paves the way to the development of metalloprotein catalysts for abiological carbene transfer reactions involving non-canonical carbene donor reagents.",,1496
1211,35971603,Constant score in asymptomatic shoulders varies with different demographic populations: derivation of adjusted score equation.,"In the present study, the age- and sex-adjusted Constant score (CS) in a normal Indian population was calculated and any differences with other population cohorts assessed. The study participants were patients who visited the outpatient department for problems other than shoulder and healthy volunteers from the local population. Patients without shoulder pain/discomfort during activity were included in the study. Subjects with any problem that might affect shoulder function (e.g., cervical, thoracic spine, rib cage deformity, inflammatory arthritis) were excluded. Constant scoring of all participants was performed by trained senior residents under the supervision of the senior faculty. Shoulder range of movement and strength were measured following recommendations given by the research and Development Committee of the European Society for Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2008). A fixed spring balance was used for strength measurement; one end was fixed on the floor and the other end tied with a strap to the wrist of the participant, arm in 90 degree abduction in scapular plane with palm facing down. Among the 248 subjects (496 shoulders), the average age was 37 years (range, 18-78 years), 65.7% were males (326 shoulders) and 34.3% females (170 shoulders). The mean CS was 84.6±2.9 (males, 86.1±3.0; females, 81.8±2.9). CS decreased significantly after 50 years of age in males and 40 years of age in females (p<0.05). The mean CS was lower than in previous studies for both males and females. Heavy occupation workers had higher mean CS (p<0.05). A linear standardized equation was estimated for calculating the adjusted CS for any age. Mean CS and its change with age differed from previous studies among various population cohorts.",,1497
1660,35968114,Measuring the Invisible: The Sequences Causal of Genome Size Differences in Eyebrights (Euphrasia) Revealed by k-mers.,"Genome size variation within plant taxa is due to presence/absence variation, which may affect low-copy sequences or genomic repeats of various frequency classes. However, identifying the sequences underpinning genome size variation is challenging because genome assemblies commonly contain collapsed representations of repetitive sequences and because genome skimming studies by design miss low-copy number sequences. Here, we take a novel approach based on k-mers, short sub-sequences of equal length k, generated from whole-genome sequencing data of diploid eyebrights (Euphrasia), a group of plants that have considerable genome size variation within a ploidy level. We compare k-mer inventories within and between closely related species, and quantify the contribution of different copy number classes to genome size differences. We further match high-copy number k-mers to specific repeat types as retrieved from the RepeatExplorer2 pipeline. We find genome size differences of up to 230Mbp, equivalent to more than 20% genome size variation. The largest contributions to these differences come from rDNA sequences, a 145-nt genomic satellite and a repeat associated with an Angela transposable element. We also find size differences in the low-copy number class (copy number ≤ 10×) of up to 27 Mbp, possibly indicating differences in gene space between our samples. We demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the sequences causing genome size variation within species without the use of a reference genome. Such sequences can serve as targets for future cytogenetic studies. We also show that studies of genome size variation should go beyond repeats if they aim to characterise the full range of genomic variants. To allow future work with other taxonomic groups, we share our k-mer analysis pipeline, which is straightforward to run, relying largely on standard GNU command line tools.",,1498

663,35975824,Pervasive approximate periodic symmetry in organic P1 structures.,"The goal of this project was to identify the prevalence of approximate symmetry in organic P1 structures. In the November 2019 version of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), there are 2592 organic, P1, R ≤ 0.050 structures; complete, unique entries are available for 1407 Z = Z' > 1 and 1049 Z = Z' = 1 structures. All the Z > 1 structures can have approximate symmetry; the Z = 1 structures were scanned to find those composed of molecules or ions that might lie on a special position and those that have two or more large molecules or ions that are very similar. The number of Z = 1 structures so identified was 285, of which 49 were grouped with the Z > 1 structures because Zeffective > 1. The packing in each of the 1407 + 285 = 1692 structures was investigated. The 144 that should almost certainly have been described in a smaller or higher-symmetry unit cell were removed from the list; 120 of the 144 are composed of achiral or racemic material. (About half of the Z = 1 and 89% of the Z > 1 structures are composed of enantiopure material.) Approximate periodic symmetry was found in 86% of the 1337 remaining Z > 1 structures and in 72% of the 211 remaining Z = 1 structures. About a third of the enantiomerically pure structures mimic inversion symmetry; 38% have approximate rotational symmetry. For the structures of achiral and racemic material, distorted glide or mirror symmetry is more common than is distorted inversion symmetry. Approximate rotational and glide symmetry was found to be periodic in two dimensions considerably more often than in three. In 4% of the structures, different layer types alternate or layers are related by approximate local rotations, as well as by small translations. In 5% of the structures, different parts of the molecule are segregated into two-dimensional regions that have different approximate symmetries. More than a third of the structures that are a distorted version of a higher-symmetry structure were determined at T ≥ 288 K.",,1500
354,35979320,Hem-o-lok clip migration to the common bile duct after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration: A case report.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) has been widely used for management of gallbladder and common bile duct (CBD) stones. Post-operative clip migration is a rare complication of laparoscopic biliary surgery, which can serve as a nidus for stone formation and cause recurrent cholangitis. A 59-year-old female was admitted to hospital because of fever and acute right upper abdominal pain. She has a history of LC and had a LCBDE surgery 2 mo ago. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the upper quadrant of right abdomen. Computed tomography scan demonstrated a high-density shadow at the distal CBD, which was considered as migrated clips. The speculation was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography examination, and two displaced Hem-o-lok clips were removed with a stone basket. No fever or abdominal pain presented after the operation. In addition to the case report, literature regarding surgical clip migration after laparoscopic biliary surgery was reviewed and discussed. Incidence of postoperative clip migration may be reduced by using clips properly and correctly; however, new methods should be explored to occlude cystic duct and vessels. If a patient with a past history of LC or LCBDE presents with features of sepsis and recurrent upper quadrant pain, clip migration must be considered as one of the differential diagnosis.",,1501
1486,35968403,"Deploying machine learning with messy, real world data in low- and middle-income countries: Developing a global health use case.","The rapid emergence of machine learning in the form of large-scale computational statistics and accumulation of data offers global health implementing partners an opportunity to adopt, adapt, and apply these techniques and technologies to low- and middle-income country (LMIC) contexts where we work. These benefits reside just out of the reach of many implementing partners because they lack the experience and specific skills to use them. Yet the growth of available analytical systems and exponential growth of data require the global digital health community to become conversant in this technology to continue to make contributions to help fulfill our missions. In this community case study, we describe the approach we took at IntraHealth International to inform the use case for machine learning in global health and development. We found that the data needed to take advantage of machine learning were plentiful and that an international, interdisciplinary team can be formed to collect, clean, and analyze the data at hand using cloud-based (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive) and open source tools (e.g., R). We organized our work as a sprint lasting roughly 10 weeks in length so that we could rapidly prototype these approaches in order to achieve institutional buy in. Our initial sprint resulted in two requests in subsequent workplans for analytics using the data we compiled and directly impacted program implementation.",,1502
1215,35971499,Combined corneal wavefront-guided transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy and accelerated corneal collagen cross-linking following intracorneal ring segment implantation in management of moderate keratoconus.,"Keratoconus (KC) leads to gradual progressive loss of vision in young and adult patients. For the purpose of visual rehabilitation and for hindering KC progression in patients, we designed this study. The main aim of this study is to help the KC patients to improve and stabilize their vision. This prospective consecutive uncontrolled study includes 36 eyes of 36 patients with moderate degree of KC. All patients underwent combined wavefront-guided transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (TPRK) and accelerated corneal collagen cross-linking (ACXL) after intracorneal ring segment (ICRS) implantation. Different measures will be evaluated at baseline, after ICRS implantation, and at one, 3, 6, and 12 months after combined (TPRK and ACXL). These measurements are uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), corneal indices based on Scheimpflug tomography, and higher-order aberrations (HOAs) based on (Sirius, Schwind) tomography. There were significant improvements in logMAR (UDVA and CDVA) and reduction in sphere, manifest cylinder, MRSE, maximal keratometry, and mean keratometry after ICRS implantation in the first stage. After TPRK and ACXL as the second stage, there were significant improvements in visual acuity of both logMAR UDVA and CDVA. Reduction in refractive outcomes, including MRSE, sphere, and manifest cylinder. All corneal indices including steep, flat, mean, and maximal keratometries had been decreased. Furthermore, there were significant improvements in the final root mean square, HOAs, and coma aberrations from baseline. In moderate KC, triple therapy of ICRS implantation followed by combined TPRK and ACXL appears to be a safe and effective approach. This approach provides an improvement in visual acuity, refraction, corneal indices, and HOAs. These improvements were maintained for 1 year postoperatively. It also halts KC progression.",,1503
1997,35967607,Research on Sustainable Development of Competitive Sports in China Based on PSR and DEA Model.,"From the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, the sustainable development of competitive sports has become more and more popular in China. Therefore, for the sustainable development of China's competitive sports, first, the logical relationship of pressure-state-response is adopted to select the index system, covering the elements of the economy, society, policy, and so on. Principal component analysis and entropy weight method are used to construct the comprehensive evaluation model of the sustainable development of competitive sports. Second, through the coupling coordination method to study the coordinated development of China's competitive sports and economic society, and then from the perspective of the obstacle factor diagnosis method to determine the obstacles to the sustainable development of China's competitive sports system. Finally, the DEA model is used to predict the development level of competitive sports in China's provinces in the next 10-20 years. The research shows that the overall development level of competitive sports in China is good, but there are certain differences among different regions. Meanwhile, from the forecast results, the development level of competitive sports in Hainan, Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Ningxia may be greatly improved in the future. Based on the above research conclusions, this study puts forward some suggestions to give full play to the joint and synergistic development effect among different regions, reasonably draw lessons from the advanced experience of competitive sports development at home and abroad, and scientifically construct the comprehensive development system of competitive sports. At the same time, the research of this study provides some reference value for the sustainable development of China's competitive sports and the coordinated development of China's competitive sports and economic society.",,1504
403,35979271,"Treatment Result of the Mucopexy-Recto Anal Lifting Method for Hemorrhoids in Comparison with Ligation and Excision, and Aluminum Potassium Sulfate and Tannic Acid Sclerotherapy.","The outcomes of Mucopexy-Recto Anal Lifting (MuRAL) in hemorrhoid surgery were compared with ligation and excision (LE), and aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid sclerotherapy (ALTA). In this study, we conducted a 3-year follow-up study of MuRAL (380 cases) and compared it with LE (1417 cases) and ALTA (541 cases) performed at the same period. Operative time, mean hospital stay, postoperative pain, postoperative complications, and recurrence were compared and examined retrospectively. The mean operative time was the longest for MuRAL, followed by LE, and then ALTA at 29.1, 21.5, and 12.4 minutes, and the mean length of hospital stay was 6.2, 10.6, and 1.3, days, respectively. Based on the frequency of injectable analgesic use, postoperative pain was clearly milder in MuRAL and ALTA than in LE. The recurrence rates were 3.2% with MuRAL, 1.1% with LE, and 12.4% with ALTA. Early postoperative low-grade fever and bowel movement urgency were observed in all surgeries, but these were minor and did not pose a safety problem. LE is painful and requires prolonged hospitalization but is the most curative; ALTA is simple and can be performed as a day surgery but has a high recurrence rate. MuRAL was less painful than LE and had a lower recurrence rate than ALTA. In recent years, there have been various innovations in the surgical treatment of hemorrhoids, and choosing a technique that is appropriate for the condition of the hemorrhoid and patient's needs is necessary. MuRAL can be one of the options for hemorrhoid treatment as a cure without cutting method.",,1505

The objective of the study was to assess whether the advances in MWA for HCC translated into a real-world survival benefit. This retrospective study included 2,354 patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 to B from 5 hospitals, with at least 2 years of follow-up for all the patients. Recurrence and survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with time-period stratification. A total of 5,326 HCCs (mean diameter, 2.9 cm ± 1.2) underwent 4,051 sessions of MWA with a median follow-up of 61.3 (0.6-169.5 range) months during 3 periods (2007-2010, 2011-2014, and 2015-2018). Technical success was achieved in 5,194 (97.5%) tumors with significant improvement over time, especially for >3.0-cm HCC (p < 0.001). Local tumor progression (LTP) showed no period-dependent advance, with >3.0-cm HCC and perivascular location being the risk factors for LTP. The median intrahepatic metastasis time was 27.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.2-28.8) months, with 5- and 10-year occurrence rates of 68.8% and 79.4%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year overall survivals were 63.9% and 41.1%, respectively, and BCLC stage 0, A, and all B patients showed an observable survival improvement over time (p < 0.001). The median disease-free survival time increased from 19.4 (95% CI: 16.5-22.6) months in 2007-2010 to 28.1 (95% CI: 25.9-32.3) months in 2015-2018. The improved survival for early recurrent (≤2 years) patients was period-dependent, as verified by Cox regression analyses. The major complications rate per procedure was 3.0% (122/4,051). These real-world data show that MWA provided an upward trend in survival for HCC patients with BCLC stage 0-B over a 12-year follow-up period. An encouraging clear survival benefit in early recurrent patients was also observed.",,1506
288,35981473,Aptamer-mediated DNA concatemer functionalized magnetic nanoparticles for reversible capture and release of circulating tumor cells.,"Effectively capturing, releasing, and reanalyzing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are critical in cancer diagnosis and individualized treatment. Traditional immunomagnetic separation has disadvantages of low sensitivity and specificity, and is time-consuming and costly in CTCs capture. It is also easily disturbed by the microenvironment in releasing and analyzing CTCs. Here, we proposed an aptamer-mediated DNA concatemer functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs-AMDC) for the reversible capture and release of CTCs. In this study, aptamers were used both for efficiently capturing CTCs without complicated assembly steps and stimulus-response switch for releasing CTCs with little influence on cellular activity. The MNPs-AMDC was demonstrated to effectively capture (83%) and release CTCs with a good viability rate (92%). Moreover, this device was also tested in clinical blood samples, which would provide a universal tool for diagnosing cancer and treating individuals.",,1507
599,35977894,The role of diaphragmatic thickness measurement in weaning prediction and its comparison with rapid shallow breathing index: a single-center experience.,"Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is commonly managed with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The majority of the time that a patient spends on IMV is in the process of weaning. Prediction of the weaning outcome is of paramount importance, as untimely/delayed extubation is associated with a high risk of mortality. Diaphragmatic ultrasonography is a promising tool in the intensive care unit, and its utility in predicting the success of weaning remains understudied. In this prospective-observational study, we recruited 54 ARF patients on IMV, along with 50 healthy controls. During a spontaneous breathing trial, all subjects underwent diaphragmatic ultrasonography along with a rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) assessment. The mean age was 41.8±17.0 and 37.6±10.5 years among the cases and control group, respectively. Demographic variables were broadly similar in the two groups. The most common cause of ARF was obstructive airway disease. The average duration of IMV was 5.41±2.81 days. Out of 54 subjects, 45 were successfully weaned, while nine patients failed weaning. Age, body mass index, and severity of disease were similar in the successful and failed weaning patients. The sensitivity in predicting successful weaning of percent change in diaphragmatic thickness (Δtdi%) >29.71% was high (93.33%), while specificity was 66.67%. The sensitivity and specificity of mean diaphragmatic thickness (tdi) end-expiratory >0.178 cm was 60.00% and 77.78%, respectively. RSBI at 1 minute of ≤93.75 had an equally high sensitivity (93.33%) but a lower specificity (22.22%). Similar Results were also found for RSBI measured at 5 minutes. During the weaning assessment, the purpose is to minimize both premature as well as delayed extubation. We found that diaphragmatic ultrasonography, in particular Δtdi%, is better than RSBI in predicting weaning outcomes.",,1508
2103,35967415,Viral immunogenic footprints conferring T cell cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.,"COVID-19 brought scenes from sci-fi movies into real life. Infected individuals include asymptomatic cases to severe disease leading to death, suggesting the involvement of the genetic constitution of populations and pathogens contributing to differential individuals' outcomes. To investigate shared immunogenic features between SARS-CoV-2 targets and other coronaviruses, we modeled their peptides in 3D structures of HLA-A*02:01 (pMHC), comparing their molecular surfaces These structures were also compared with a panel of epitopes from unrelated viruses, looking for potential triggers conferring cross-protection in uninfected individuals. As expected, SARS-CoV 1 and 2 peptides share molecular and physicochemical features, providing an explanation for the verified experimental immunogenicity among them. Surprisingly, even discordant sequences from human coronaviruses 229E, OC43 and epitopes from unrelated viruses involved in endemic human infections exhibit similar fingerprints of immunogenicity with SARS-CoV-2 peptides. The same approach indicates a conserved CD8+ T cell recognition between Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 sequences and altered peptides from Variants of Concern. Examination of structural data over epitope sequence analysis here could explain how previous infections may produce a heterologous immunity response in a global scale against emergent diseases such as Covid-19, mitigating its full lethal potential, and paves the way for the development of wide spectrum vaccine development.",,1509

Both the efficient near-infrared downconversion luminescence (DCL) and visible upconversion luminescence (UCL) of the Er3+ and Nd3+ ions are simultaneously observed and systematically demonstrated under dual-wavelength excitation (808 and 980 nm continuous-wave lasers). Subsequently, the SrF2:Nd3+/Yb3+/Er3+ (15/4/0.2 mol %) NCs with the strongest luminescence were utilized for detecting the metal ion concentrations under 808 nm excitation. The results reveal that both the UCL and DCL gradually decrease as the metal ion concentrations increase, and high sensitivity is obtained for Cu2+ ions with a detection limit of 0.22 nM (∼650 nm) and 0.63 nM (∼976 nm). In addition, these SrF2:Nd3+/Yb3+/Er3+ NCs are further demonstrated to achieve a solid-state display under 980 nm excitation, exhibiting obvious red and green patterns by varying the doping rare earth ion concentrations.",,1510

Although some evidence suggests that corruption deteriorates subjective wellbeing, the relationship between perception of official corruption and subjective wellbeing is still unknown. This study aims to examine the link between perceived official corruption and subjective wellbeing in the context of China and whether satisfaction with government performance has a mediating effect in the process. Based on data from China General Social Survey, a structural equation model was used to test the hypotheses. The results of 3,033 Chinese respondents suggest that perception of official corruption is negatively related to subjective wellbeing, and satisfaction with government performance plays a mediating role in the relationship between perception of official corruption and subjective wellbeing.",,1511
1258,35971357,Abnormal Weight Loss in an Adolescent Female With Down Syndrome.,"Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality identified at birth. These individuals will have multiple comorbid illnesses that require complex medical care throughout their lives. In recent years, specific patterns of regression have been detected in these individuals; most notably, developmental regression with language, behavior, and cognitive skills that they had previously acquired, which now affects both the quality of life and autonomy. These development regression patterns are referred to as Down syndrome disintegrative disorder. The case that we are reporting occurred in a 17-year-old female presenting with significant weight loss, altered mental status, and loss of functional skills over a period of one month. Co-occurring hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism symptoms exacerbation may have triggered this patient's regression. Our case highlights the importance of conducting a thorough investigation for life-threatening and non-life-threatening illnesses that can present with similar symptoms, in order to make the correct diagnosis of Down syndrome disintegrative disorder and find appropriate therapies and future care.",,1512
950,35974731,Tem-per-ature dependence in Bragg edge neutron transmission measurements.,"A systematic study has been carried out to investigate the neutron transmission signal as a function of sample tem-per-ature. In particular, the experimentally de-ter-mined wavelength-dependent neutron attenuation spectra for a martensitic steel at tem-per-atures ranging from 21 to 700°C are com-pared with simulated data. A theoretical description that includes the Debye-Waller factor in order to describe the tem-per-ature influence on the neutron cross sections was im-plemented in the nxsPlotter software and used for the simulations. The analysis of the attenuation coefficients at varying tem-per-atures shows that the missing contributions due to elastic and inelastic scattering can be clearly distinguished: while the elastically scattered intensities decrease with higher tem-per-atures, the inelastically scattered intensities increase, and the two can be separated from each other by analysing unique sharp features in the form of Bragg edges. This study presents the first systematic approach to qu-antify this effect and can serve as a basis , for example, to correct measurements taken during in situ heat treatments, in many cases being a prerequisite for obtaining qu-anti-fiable results.",,1513
256,35982575,Groundwater characterization and non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risk assessment of nitrate exposure in the Mahanadi River Basin of India.,"Agriculture is the mainstay of India's economy and chemical fertilizers have been extensively used to meet increasing demands. Anthropogenic interventions at the soil surface, especially the application of nitrogenous fertilizers in agricultural fields, provide essential nutrients but become major pollutant sources in terrestrial ecosystems and aquatic environments. Groundwater samples from phreatic aquifers of the Mahanadi River Basin, Chhattisgarh, India, showed that the Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- freshwater type dominates, followed by the Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl- and Na+-HCO3- types. Increasing trends in the ionic ratios of (NO3-+Cl-)/HCO3- over TDS and of NO3-/Cl- over Cl- indicated the significant impact of anthropogenic pollution on groundwater contamination. Deterministic and probabilistic approaches were used to assess the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks of nitrate to children and adults. Both approaches produced the same results and indicated children were more prone to non-carcinogenic health risk than adults. An excess gastric cancer risk (ER) exposure model showed that approximately 42% of the groundwater samples had a non-negligible ER (1.00 × 10-4 to 1.00 × 10-5). Sensitivity analysis indicated groundwater nitrate concentration, ingestion rate, and the percentage of nitrite from nitrate were the most significant variables in determining HI and ER. It is suggested to adopt proper management of control policies for reducing the elevated groundwater nitrate concentration in the present study area.",,1514
1991,35967614,Psychological support for public-funded normal students engaged in teaching profession.,"Among primary and secondary school teachers in China, 70% of teachers believe that they are facing greater occupational pressure. 63.8% of teachers clearly stated that occupational pressure has caused a great or great impact on themselves. And this has had negative effects on them such as mental, physical and personal development. This article studies the group of public-funded normal students from the perspective of psychological support. This article uses the SCL-90 form to investigate the professional psychology of teachers for the psychological support of public-funded normal students engaged in the teaching profession. And it conducts a survey on the curriculum setting and satisfaction of the public-funded normal students during their study stage. The experimental results of this article show that only 11.9% of public-funded normal students are very willing to take root and serve township education. Moreover, the psychological pressure of teachers at different educational stages is quite different.",,1515
862,35974861,Erythema Multiforme: A Presentation of COVID-19 Pneumonia.,"Since its emergence in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been detrimental worldwide. Although COVID-19 infection is primarily known for its respiratory manifestations, extrapulmonary features are increasingly being reported. Among these, cutaneous manifestations are apparent but have a high likelihood of not being attributed to COVID-19. We present the case of a 63-year-old female unvaccinated against COVID-19. She presented with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and rash. The symptoms were present for four days and appeared after contact with a confirmed symptomatic COVID-19-positive family member. The rash started first on the chest and then spread to the face and whole body including the palms and soles. It was erythematous and maculopapular and is associated with ulceration and swelling of the lips. In places, it was confluent and had a target-like appearance. On admission, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative. As she was septic with initial suspicion of tick-borne infections, she was started on doxycycline. Given her symptoms on presentation, the suspicion of COVID-19 was very high, and the SARS-CoV-2 nasal swab PCR was repeated, which was negative yet again. With the index of suspicion being very high, her presentation was speculated to be atypical, especially in the setting of a target-like rash involving the palms and soles. The antibody was checked. IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. All other antibodies for mycoplasma, Lyme disease, Ehrlichia, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) were negative. Parvovirus DNA and chikungunya IgG, antinuclear antibody (ANA), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screens were negative. IgG for mycoplasma, dengue, and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) were positive. During all this time, the patient did not show clinical improvement in spite of being on antibiotics. In fact, her oxygen saturation dropped, and she required oxygen through the nasal cannula. A lung tissue biopsy taken on bronchoscopy showed chronic inflammation and organizing pneumonia. To note, mycoplasma DNA PCR and HSV culture from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were negative. The patient was started on intravenous steroids. A confirmatory skin biopsy was done, and it showed perivascular, interstitial, and spongiotic dermatitis related to a viral infection. While on steroids, the patient improved dramatically. Her skin rash also improved, and she was discharged. On outpatient follow-up, she was doing exceptionally well with ambulatory oxygen saturation of 100%. This patient who was COVID-19 PCR-negative twice could have been easily deemed as not having COVID-19. However, the fact that she was unvaccinated, had positive sick contact with imaging concern for COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19 antibody being positive and no other test being positive clearly attributes her manifestations to the virus. The presence of a rash could easily be misleading. Awareness of the fact that a rash like erythema multiforme (EM) could be a sign of underlying COVID-19 is extremely prudent and is an addition to the ever-expanding knowledge of this virus.",,1516
286,35981790,Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy and the Risk of Death in Primary Prevention Defibrillator Recipients.,"Contemporary guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) confers a significant mortality benefit for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), as compared to GDMT prevalent at the time of landmark primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) trials. The impact of modern era GDMT on survival in this population is unknown. This study sought to investigate the impact of number of GDMT medications prescribed for HFrEF on all-cause mortality in recipients of primary prevention ICD. A cohort of 4,972 recipients with primary prevention ICD (n = 3,210) or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) (n = 1,762) was studied. The association of number of GDMT medications prescribed at the time of device implantation and all-cause mortality at 2 years post implantation was examined. In our primary prevention cohort, 5%, 20%, 52%, and 23% of patients were prescribed 0, 1, 2, or 3-4 GDMT medications, respectively. After risk adjustment for age, sex, ejection fraction, body mass index, the Elixhauser comorbidity score, the type of cardiomyopathy, and the year of device implantation, each additional GDMT conferred a reduction in the risk of death of 36% in recipients of ICD (HR: 0.64; P < 0.001) and 30% in recipients of CRT-D (HR: 0.70; P < 0.001). A higher number of prescribed GDMT medications is associated with an incremental 1-year survival in recipients of primary prevention ICD with or without CRT. Initiation of maximum number of tolerated GDMT medications should therefore be the goal for all patients with HFrEF. In the setting of robust GDMT, the risk versus benefit of a primary prevention ICD warrants re-examination in future studies.",,1517
2027,35967559,Should we give antibiotics to neonates with mild non-progressive symptoms? A comparison of serial clinical observation and the neonatal sepsis risk calculator.,"To compare two strategies [the neonatal sepsis risk calculator (NSC) and the updated serial clinical observation approach (SCO)] for the management of asymptomatic neonates at risk of early-onset sepsis (EOS) and neonates with mild non-progressive symptoms in the first hours of life. This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted over 15 months (01/01/2019-31/03/2020). All live births at ≥34 weeks of gestation were included. Infants were managed using SCO and decisions were compared with those retrospectively projected by the NSC. The proportion of infants recommended for antibiotics or laboratory testing was compared in both strategies. McNemar's non-parametric test was used to assess significant differences in matched proportions. Among the 3,445 neonates (late-preterm, n = 178; full-term, n = 3,267) 262 (7.6%) presented with symptoms of suspected EOS. There were no cases of culture-proven EOS. Only 1.9% of the neonates were treated with antibiotics (median antibiotic treatment, 2 days) and 4.0% were evaluated. According to NSC, antibiotics would have been administered in 5.4% of infants (absolute difference between SCO and NSC, 3.51%; 95% CI, 3.14-3.71%; p <0.0001) and 5.6% of infants would have undergone rule out sepsis (absolute difference between SCO and NSC, 1.63%, 95% CI 1.10-2.05; p <0.0001). SCO minimizes laboratory testing and unnecessary antibiotics in infants at risk of EOS or with mild non-progressive symptoms, without the risk of a worse neonatal outcome. The NSC recommends almost three times more antibiotics than the SCO without improving neonatal outcomes.",,1518
934,35974756,Functionalisation of ethereal-based saturated heterocycles with concomitant aerobic C-H activation and C-C bond formation.,"With an ever-growing emphasis on sustainable synthesis, aerobic C-H activation (the use of oxygen in air to activate C-H bonds) represents a highly attractive conduit for the development of novel synthetic methodologies. Herein, we report the air mediated functionalisation of various saturated heterocycles and ethers via aerobically generated radical intermediates to form new C-C bonds using acetylenic and vinyl triflones as radical acceptors. This enables access to a variety of acetylenic and vinyl substituted saturated heterocycles that are rich in synthetic value. Mechanistic studies and control reactions support an aerobic radical-based C-H activation mechanism.",,1519
649,35976005,"Respiratory syncytial virus among children hospitalized with severe acute respiratory infection in Kashmir, a temperate region in northern India.","Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) are a leading cause of hospitalizations in children, especially due to viral pathogens. We studied the prevalence of respiratory viruses among children aged <5 years hospitalized with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in Kashmir, India. We conducted a prospective observational study in two tertiary care hospitals from October 2013 to September 2014, systematically enrolling two children aged <5 years with SARI per day. We defined SARI as history of fever or measured fever (≥38°C) and cough with onset in the last 7 days requiring hospitalization for children aged 3-59 months and as physician-diagnosed acute lower respiratory infection for children aged <3 months. Trained study staff screened children within 24 hours of hospitalization for SARI and collected clinical data and nasopharyngeal swabs from enrolled participants. We tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, influenza viruses, rhinoviruses (HRV)/enteroviruses, adenovirus (AdV), bocavirus (BoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) A and B, coronaviruses (OC43, NL65, C229E), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4 using standardized duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among 4548 respiratory illness admissions screened from October 2013 to September 2014, 1026 met the SARI case definition, and 412 were enrolled (ages = 5 days to 58 months; median = 12 months). Among enrolees, 256 (62%) were positive for any virus; RSV was the most commonly detected (n = 118, 29%) followed by HRV/enteroviruses (n = 88, 21%), PIVs (n = 31, 8%), influenza viruses (n = 18, 4%), BoV (n = 15, 4%), coronaviruses (n = 16, 4%), AdV (n = 14, 3%), and hMPV (n = 9, 2%). Fifty-four children had evidence of virus co-detection. Influenza-associated SARI was more common among children aged 1-5 years (14/18, 78%) while most RSV detections occurred in children <12 months (83/118, 70%). Of the RSV viruses typed (n = 116), the majority were type B (94, 80%). Phylogenetic analysis of G gene of RSV showed circulation of the BA9 genotype with 60bp nucleotide duplication. Respiratory viruses, especially RSV, contributed to a substantial proportion of SARI hospitalizations among children <5 years in north India. These data can help guide clinicians on appropriate treatment and prevention strategies.",,1520
2045,35967532,Two Decades Outcomes of Posttransplant Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy in Live Donor Renal Transplantation.,"The data on long-term outcomes of posttransplant immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) are confounding and vary with geography and ethnicity worldwide. We aimed to study the long-term graft outcomes of patients with posttransplant IgAN in the northern Indian cohort. The long-term graft outcomes of 51 live donor renal transplant recipients with biopsy-proven posttransplant IgAN (recurrence/de novo) were analyzed. The risk factors for graft failure in the posttransplant IgA groups were analyzed using the Cox regression analysis. Out of the total of 51 patients who had posttransplant IgAN, 40 patients had a biopsy-proven native kidney IgAN. The mean duration of the clinical presentation of posttransplant IgAN was 62.4 months (5.2 years) posttransplant. Proteinuria at the time of biopsy was 3.03 ± 2.2 g/day, and 41.2% had proteinuria of more than 3 g/day at the time of biopsy. The estimated 1, 5, 10, and 20 years patient survival was 98%, 95.4%, 75.9%, and 25.2%, respectively, and the estimated 1, 5, 10, and 20 years graft survival was 98%, 88.5%, 44.6%, and 11.9%, respectively, in patients who had posttransplant IgA. Many of the traditional risk factors associated with progression in native kidney IgAN, such as the degree of proteinuria, Oxford MEST (mesangial and endocapillary hypercellularity, segmental sclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy) scoring, recipient's age, and sex were not predictive of early graft failure among patients with posttransplant IgAN. In our cohort, the only significant graft failure predictor was serum creatinine at 5 years. Chronic antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) was seen in 21.6% of patients with posttransplant IgAN. Whether this coexistence of chronic ABMR is an incidental finding or posttransplant IgAN predisposes to chronic ABMR requires further investigation. Posttransplant IgAN is associated with poor long-term graft outcomes in live donor renal transplants. Proteinuria and MEST scoring were not predictive of graft failure in living donor posttransplant IgAN.",,1521
727,35975154,Cyclometalated iridium-coumarin ratiometric oxygen sensors: improved signal resolution and tunable dynamic ranges.,"In this work we introduce a new series of ratiometric oxygen sensors based on phosphorescent cyclometalated iridium centers partnered with organic coumarin fluorophores. Three different cyclometalating ligands and two different pyridyl-containing coumarin types were used to prepare six target complexes with tunable excited-state energies. Three of the complexes display dual emission, with fluorescence arising from the coumarin ligand, and phosphorescence from either the cyclometalated iridium center or the coumarin. These dual-emitting complexes function as ratiometric oxygen sensors, with the phosphorescence quenched under O2 while fluorescence is unaffected. The use of blue-fluorescent coumarins results in good signal resolution between fluorescence and phosphorescence. Moreover, the sensitivity and dynamic range, measured with Stern-Volmer analysis, can be tuned two orders of magnitude by virtue of our ability to synthetically control the triplet excited-state ordering. The complex with cyclometalated iridium 3MLCT phosphorescence operates under hyperoxic conditions, whereas the two complexes with coumarin-centered phosphorescence are sensitive to very low levels of O2 and function as hypoxic sensors.",,1522
701,35975302,Experiences of adult patients living with depression-related insomnia: a qualitative systematic review protocol.,"The objective of this review is to identify and synthesize the best available evidence on how adult patients experience living with depression-related insomnia. In particular, the review will examine the experiences related to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to improve sleep. Approximately 80% to 90% of patients with depression suffer from insomnia, which is associated with substantial personal and social costs. Despite these costs, insomnia is often underdiagnosed and viewed as a symptom that disappears when depression abates. However, research indicates that insomnia and depression are distinct but overlapping disorders. Thus, it is important to treat both disorders simultaneously, as improving sleep may, in turn, ease core symptoms of depression. Optimal care and treatment rely on patients' experiences of insomnia and their attitudes toward treatment options. Therefore, it is important to synthesize evidence of patients' experiences of living with insomnia and the experience of pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep interventions to understand the consequences of insomnia and to optimize sleep interventions. This systematic review will synthesize qualitative studies exploring how adults with depression experience living with insomnia and how they experience pharmacological or non-pharmacological sleep interventions. Both inpatient and outpatient populations will be considered. Databases to be searched include MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, SveMed+, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies in English, German, Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian will be included. Databases will be searched from their inception to the present date. All studies will be screened against the inclusion criteria and critically appraised for methodological quality. Findings will be pooled using meta-aggregation, and a ConQual Summary of Findings will be presented. PROSPERO: CRD42021276048.",,1523
1110,35974509,Continuous to intermittent flows in growing granular heaps.,"If a granular material is poured from above on a horizontal surface between two parallel, vertical plates, a sand heap grows in time. For small piles, the grains flow smoothly downhill, but after a critical pile size X_{c}, the flow becomes intermittent: sudden avalanches slide downhill from the apex to the base, followed by an uphill front that slowly climbs up, until a new downhill avalanche interrupts the process. By means of experiments, controlling the distance between the apex of the sandpile and the container feeding it from above, we show that X_{c} grows linearly with the input flux, but scales as the square root of the feeding height. We explain these facts from a phenomenological model based on the experimental observation that the flowing granular phase forms a wedge on top of the static one, differently from the case of stationary heaps. Moreover, we demonstrate that our controlled experiments allow to predict the value of X_{c} for the common situation in which the feeding height decreases as the pile increases in size.",,1524

84,35983399,Pulmonary Carcinosarcoma: A Rare Disease With Challenging Diagnosis and Treatment.,"Pulmonary carcinosarcoma (PCS) is a rare type of non-small cell cancer. Overall, middle-aged and older smokers are the most affected age and sex groups. The diagnosis of PCS is difficult due to the absence of characteristic imaging findings. Additionally, preoperative biopsies do not usually reflect the heterologous nature of this tumor. Given the rarity of such tumors and the challenging diagnosis, the prognostic factors have not been established, and the overall prognosis remains poor. The valid therapeutic options are still limited. Here, we report a rare case of metastatic PCS that was accidentally discovered by imaging and properly diagnosed after surgical resection. The clinicopathological features, diagnostic tools, genetic theories, prognosis, and therapeutic options of this rare cancer are also discussed.",,1526
2246,35967185,Three-Dimensional Immersive Photorealistic Layered Dissection of Superficial and Deep Back Muscles: Anatomical Study.,"Introduction The distinct anatomy of the superficial and deep back muscles is characterized by complex layered courses, fascial planes, specific vascularization, and innervation. Knowledge of these anatomical parameters is important for some surgical approaches, including lumbar disc herniation, cerebrospinal fluid fistula repair, vascularized muscle pedicle flaps, and posterior fossa extra-intracranial bypass. In the present study, we use modern techniques of three-dimensional (3D) surface scanning to help better illustrate the layered anatomy of the back muscles. Material and methods We dissected in layers the back muscles of one cadaver. Every step of the dissection was 3D scanned using a technique called photogrammetry, which allows the extraction of 3D data from 2D photographs. The 3D data were processed using Blender software, and the 3D photorealistic models were uploaded to a dedicated website for 3D visualization. This allows users to see the 3D models from every desktop or mobile device, as well as augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) formats. Results The photorealistic 3D models present the back muscles' anatomy in a volumetric manner, which can be visualized on any computer device. The web 3D features, including AR and VR, allow users to zoom, pan, and rotate the models, which may facilitate learning. Conclusion The technology of photorealistic surface scanning, modern 3D visualization possibilities of web-dedicated formats, as well as advances in AR and VR, have the potential to help with a better understanding of complex anatomy. We believe that this opens the field for further research in the field of medical education.",,1527
500,35978759,Acute Severe Seronegative Autoimmune Hepatitis With Undiagnosed Graves' Disease.,"Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive inflammatory condition hypothesized to be a T-lymphocyte (T-cell)-mediated immune response that commonly affects females more than males. Given its proposed mechanism associated with immune response, it is more likely to present with other autoimmune conditions, particularly autoimmune disorders associated with the thyroid. AIH can be difficult to diagnose as it is a diagnosis of exclusion. AIH lacks validated algorithms for proper diagnosis and can seldom present with negative antibodies. If not fully worked up, AIH may progress to cirrhosis and even increase the risk of malignancy. Therefore, a liver biopsy is a crucial step in the workup for AIH. We report a rare case of acute severe AIH associated with negative antibodies and undiagnosed Graves' disease.",,1528
1443,35968455,Exercise intensity and energy expenditure of a multicomponent home-based training program: Xiangya hospital circuit training (X-CircuiT).,"Our previous studies showed that Xiangya Hospital Circuit Training (X-CircuiT) effectively improved physical fitness and reversed pre-frailty in community-dwelling older adults. This study aimed to explore the generalizability and applicability of X-CircuiT in different aged populations in the context of exercise intensity and energy expenditure. We prospectively recruited 72 community-dwelling sedentary adults, twelve adults divided into 6 age groups ranging from 20 to 80 years old and separated by decades. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed to determine peak heart rate (HRpeak). An individual HR-oxygen consumption regression equation was fit for each participant, and then a session of remote heart rate monitored X-CircuiT was performed. Exercise intensity (%HRpeak) and energy expenditure of X-CircuiT among the six age groups were assessed. Further sub-analysis was conducted by dividing the participants by peak metabolic equivalent (MET) values, <5 METs, 5-7 METs, and more than 7METs to explore the relationship between maximum exercise capacity and exercise intensity of X-CircuiT. The average %HRpeak of X-CircuiT for subjects in the 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70-80 age groups were 54 ± 6, 59 ± 8, 60 ± 8, 62 ± 5, 66 ± 10, and 67 ± 13, respectively (p = 0.008); and the average energy expenditure was 121.9 ± 26.5, 123.3 ± 33.8, 129.2 ± 40.9, 130.9 ± 31.8, 146.8 ± 29.0, and 125.0 ± 28.4 kcal, respectively. The average %HRpeak for the warm-up, aerobic, acupoint patting, resistance, and stretching stages in overall subjects was 61 ± 9, 70 ± 10, 70 ± 10, 63 ± 9, and 57 ± 9, respectively. Furthermore, when subjects were divided by peak METs, it was found that the lower the peak METs, the greater the value of the relative exercise intensity indicators. The aerobic and acupoint stages of X-CircuiT could illicit a response of high intensity for those with peak METs <5, moderate intensity in those with peak METs of 5-7, and low-intensity for those with peak METs of more than 7. Xiangya Hospital Circuit Training followed the principle of low-intensity warm-up and medium-intensity training with multicomponent exercise training. It is classified as a moderate-intensity exercise for sedentary middle-aged and older adults, or those with a maximum exercise capacity of 5-7 METs, and is classified as a low-intensity exercise for young people.",,1529

Corrective osteotomy is used to obtain good alignment and is generally performed for patients with prolonged deformity or bony union after fracture. We report the case of a 10-year-old boy who presented with elbow pain after falling. Plain radiography showed lateral condylar fracture and cubitus varus deformity. This injury was the fourth fracture of the same distal humerus. Open reduction and internal fixation for lateral condylar fracture and lateral closing wedge osteotomy for cubitus varus deformity were performed simultaneously. At the last follow-up, one and a half years after operation, plain radiography showed closure of the physis of the distal humerus, and coronal alignment was maintained. The patient was asymptomatic and satisfied with cosmetic issues. There was no fracture after two surgical procedures simultaneously.",,1530
1677,35968096,Agronomic efficiency and genome mining analysis of the wheat-biostimulant rhizospheric bacterium Pseudomonas pergaminensis sp. nov. strain 1008T.,"Pseudomonas sp. strain 1008 was isolated from the rhizosphere of field grown wheat plants at the tillering stage in an agricultural plot near Pergamino city, Argentina. Based on its in vitro phosphate solubilizing capacity and the production of IAA, strain 1008 was formulated as an inoculant for bacterization of wheat seeds and subjected to multiple field assays within the period 2010-2017. Pseudomonas sp. strain 1008 showed a robust positive impact on the grain yield (+8% on average) across a number of campaigns, soil properties, seed genotypes, and with no significant influence of the simultaneous seed treatment with a fungicide, strongly supporting the use of this biostimulant bacterium as an agricultural input for promoting the yield of wheat. Full genome sequencing revealed that strain 1008 has the capacity to access a number of sources of inorganic and organic phosphorus, to compete for iron scavenging, to produce auxin, 2,3-butanediol and acetoin, and to metabolize GABA. Additionally, the genome of strain 1008 harbors several loci related to rhizosphere competitiveness, but it is devoid of biosynthetic gene clusters for production of typical secondary metabolites of biocontrol representatives of the Pseudomonas genus. Finally, the phylogenomic, phenotypic, and chemotaxonomic comparative analysis of strain 1008 with related taxa strongly suggests that this wheat rhizospheric biostimulant isolate is a representative of a novel species within the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas pergaminensis sp. nov. (type strain 1008T = DSM 113453T = ATCC TSD-287T) is proposed.",,1531

46,35983567,Early-life weight gain is associated with non-atopic asthma in childhood.,"Previous studies suggest the association between early-life weight gain and asthma. It remains unclear whether early-life weight gain is associated with atopic or non-atopic asthma. This study aimed to investigate whether early-life weight gain is associated with atopic or non-atopic asthma. Included in this study were 1343 singleton-birth children (761 boys, 57%) born between January 2010 and December 2011 participating in the Longitudinal Investigation of Global Health in Taiwanese Schoolchildren (LIGHTS) cohort were evaluated by a modified International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire and interviewed by pediatricians between July 1, 2016 and May 31, 2018 at the mean age of 6.4 years. Weight gain z-scores during the first 6, 12, and 18 months of life were classified into 4 groups: slow (below -0.67), on track (-0.67 to 0.67), rapid (0.67 to 1.28), and extremely rapid (above 1.28). The main outcomes were atopic and non-atopic asthma. Asthma was defined as having physician-diagnosed asthma and the presence of wheeze or asthma exacerbations in the last 12 months. Atopy was determined by Phadiatop Infant. The extremely rapid weight gain group of children during the first 6, 12, and 18 months of life was significantly associated with an increased risk of non-atopic asthma (adjusted odd ratio [AOR], 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-4.53 for the first 6 months; AOR, 2.86, 95% CI, 1.34-6.14 for the first 12 months; AOR, 3.26, 95% CI 1.49-7.15 for the first 18 months) compared with the on track group. No significant association was found in atopic asthma. A sex-stratified analysis revealed the association of early-life weight gain with non-atopic asthma was statistically significant only in boys (AOR, 4.24, 95% CI, 1.44-12.50). Extremely rapid weight gain during the first 6-18 months of life was significantly associated with 2.1- to 3.3-fold increased risk of non-atopic asthma, with a more pronounced risk found in boys.",,1533
1094,35974525,Super rogue waves: Collision of rogue waves in Bose-Einstein condensate.,"An important and incompletely answered question is whether a high-order rogue wave (RW) can be excited by the collision of first-order RWs, especially for its generation and propagation mechanisms. In this paper, the evolution properties of collisions between RWs are studied numerically for two-component coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. We find that whether a second-order RW can be successfully excited strongly depends on the location and time of the first-order RWs encountered. Only when the highest peaks of two RWs meet at the same position at the same time, can the standard second-order RW be triggered and its structure is in good agreement with the exact solution. Further, we demonstrate that such results are also applicable to the collision of subordinate RWs. This paper not only reveals the collision properties of RWs, but also provides a feasible scheme to generate higher-order RWs for experimental realization.",,1534
1265,35971350,Why Is There an Increased Risk for Sudden Cardiac Death in Patients With Early Repolarization Syndrome?,"The last two decades have changed the viewpoint on early repolarization syndrome (ERS). The prevalence of the early repolarization pattern is variable and ranges between 3-24% depending upon age, gender, and criteria used for J-point upliftment from baseline (0.05mV vs. 1 mV). While this pattern was previously linked with a benign result, multiple recent investigations have found a link between early repolarization and Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) by causing life-threatening arrhythmias like Ventricular tachycardia/Ventricular fibrillation, a condition known as early repolarization syndrome. The syndrome falls under a broader bracket of J wave syndromes, which can be caused by early repolarization or depolarization abnormalities. The characteristics of early repolarization that are considered high risk for Sudden Cardiac Death include the amplitude of J-point upliftment from baseline ( > 0.2 mV), Inferior-lateral location of Early Repolarization pattern, and horizontal and downsloping ST-segment. Patients with symptomatic early repolarisation patterns on ECG are more likely to have repeated cardiac episodes. Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) implantation and isoproterenol are the recommended treatments in symptomatic patients. On the other hand, asymptomatic patients with early repolarization patterns are prevalent and have a better outcome. Risk categorization is still obscure in asymptomatic early repolarization patterns. This traditional review outlines the known knowledge of pathophysiology behind the increased risk of sudden cardiac death, risk stratification of patients with ERS, and the treatment guidelines for patients with ERS. Further prospective studies are recommended to elucidate the exact mechanism for ventricular arrhythmogenesis in ERS patients and to risk stratifying asymptomatic patients with ERS.",,1535

1240,35971375,Atypical Presentation of Babesiosis With Neurological Manifestations as Well as Hematological Manifestations.,"Babesiosis is an infectious disease that is typically known to present with fevers, chills, and myalgias; and less commonly with anorexia, headache, nausea, and vomiting. The least common are shortness of breath, sore throat, neck stiffness, emotional lability, photophobia, and dark urine. Even more unusual are severe neurologic manifestations like altered mental status, motor deficits, and ataxia. We present two cases of patients, both in their seventies, with multiple comorbidities, who were admitted with similar symptoms of confusion/cognitive impairment, slurred speech, ataxia, fever, myalgias and chills, urinary frequency, and urgency, with no previous history of travel outside the country or tick bites. Both patients had extensive workup, which raised suspicion of hemolytic infections, especially babesiosis and malaria. Considering our patients had not traveled out of the country, we leaned more toward babesiosis. The patients were treated appropriately for babesiosis and were also empirically treated for Lyme's, anaplasmosis, along with Mycoplasma in the second patient. Following two days of treatment, cognition, as well as speech, improved dramatically. On outpatient follow-up, both patients had entirely resolved hemolysis, parasitic load, and neurological manifestations. During the literature review, neurologic manifestations, being associated with babesiosis, were found to be exceedingly rare but could be fatal if left undiagnosed. It is an infection that is associated with complete recovery on prompt diagnosis and treatment. It is pertinent to have a high suspicion of this disease, especially in endemic areas, such as the Northeast United States, even more so when seen with hematologic and neurologic manifestations.",,1537

355,35979319,Total knee arthroplasty in Ranawat II valgus deformity with enlarged femoral valgus cut angle: A new technique to achieve balanced gap.,"Nearly 10% of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have valgus deformity (VD) of the knee. For severe VD of the knee, a more lateral structural release is needed to achieve balance between medial and lateral space and neutral femorotibial mechanical axis (FTMA), which is challenging and technical. To introduce a new surgical technique of resection, soft tissue release, and FTMA for Ranawat type-II VD with a 5-year follow-up. A retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent TKA from December 2011 to December 2014. Hip-knee-ankle (HKA), range of motion (ROM), Oxford knee score (OKS), and knee society score (KSS) were used to assess the joint activity of patients in the new theory TKA group (NT-TKA) and were compared with those of the conventional TKA group (C-TKA). A total of 103 people (103 knees) were included in this study, including 42 patients with an average follow-up period of 83 mo in the C-TKA group and 61 patients with an average follow-up period of 76 mo in the NT-TKA group. Six patients had constrained prosthesis, one had common peroneal nerve injury, and two had joint instability in the C-TKA group, but none of these occurred in the NT-TKA group. There were significant statistical differences in constrained prosthesis usage and complications between the groups (P = 0.002 and P = 0.034, respectively). The KSS at 1 mo post-operation for the C-TKA and NT-TKA groups were 11.2 ± 3.8 and 13.3 ± 2.9, respectively, with a significant difference (P = 0.007). However, the data of HKA, ROM, OKS KSS, and prosthesis survival rate were insignificant (P > 0.05) in both the preoperative and follow-up periods. Adopting 5°-7° valgus cut angle for VD and sacrificing 2° neutral FTMA for severe VD which cannot be completely corrected during TKA can reduce the need for soft tissue release, maintain early joint stability, reduce the use of constrained prostheses, and minimize postoperative complications.",,1539
2285,35967146,Calciphylaxis in End-Stage Renal Disease: A Rare Condition With High Mortality.,"Calciphylaxis is a rare but life-threatening condition, seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on renal replacement therapy. Its pathogenesis is not completely known, but microvascular calcification and thrombosis are considered the likely processes. It is characterized by significant morbidity due to severe pain and nonhealing wounds with frequent hospitalizations. Sepsis is the most common cause of mortality with more than 50% of patients dying within the first year after diagnosis. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach. We describe a case of a 66-year-old female with ESRD on hemodialysis (HD) who presented with severe progressive calciphylaxis wounds on both lower extremities and died within two months after diagnosis. She had multiple admissions in the past for cellulitis when she presented with swelling in the legs and chronic wounds. Our goal is to increase awareness among physicians to include calciphylaxis in their differential diagnosis when treating ESRD patients with significant risk factors to detect it early and prevent morbidity and mortality.",,1540
2230,35967261,Substance Use Disorder Treatment Providers' Knowledge and Opinions Toward Testing and Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C in Rural North Carolina.,"Poor access to care has made western North Carolina vulnerable to an outbreak of hepatitis C viral infection (HCV), particularly among persons who inject drugs (PWID). As substance use disorder (SUD) treatment providers could potentially improve linkage to HCV testing and treatment, we sought to understand SUD providers, clinic and client characteristics; referral patterns; HCV knowledge; willingness to participate in additional trainings; and local linkage-to-care pathways for treatment of substance use and HCV. Online survey data were collected from 78 SUD providers serving PWID in eight western rural North Carolina counties. Providers' attitudes toward working with HCV+ clients were very positive. One-third of providers reported a low fund of knowledge regarding HCV, HCV treatment, and financial assistance opportunities. Non-prescribing providers rarely initiated discussions about HCV testing/treatment, but were receptive to training. Respondents indicated that HCV testing and treatment were best delivered at local health departments or primary care clinics but were open to other venues where PWID access care. The vast majority of prescribing and non-prescribing providers expressed interest in obtaining training in HCV treatments, how to obtain HCV medications and topics on advanced liver disease. Data from prescribing and non-prescribing SUD providers suggest opportunities to develop or expand integrated care models for HCV testing/treatment in PWID in rural Appalachian North Carolina.",,1541
1005,35974614,Solving a directed-percolation inverse problem.,"We present a directed-percolation inverse problem for diode networks: Given information about which pairs of nodes allow current to percolate from one to the other, can one find a configuration of diodes consistent with the observed currents? We implement a divide-and-concur iterative projection method for solving the problem and demonstrate the supremacy of our method over an exhaustive approach for nontrivial instances of the problem. We find that the problem is most difficult when some but not all of the percolation data are hidden, and that the most difficult networks to reconstruct generally are those for which the currents are most sensitive to the addition or removal of a single diode.",,1542
381,35979293,Imaging-based diagnosis for extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma in pediatrics: A case report.,"Extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma (EES) is a member of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors which is pathologically known as a small, round, blue cell tumor involving bone and soft tissue. The prevalence of EES is only 15%-25% of all Ewing sarcoma and EES often occurs in patients aged from 20-mo-old to 30-years-old resulting in an unfavorable prognosis. The present case report described a 7-year-old patient with a palpable EES mass of 33 mm × 27 mm × 28 mm in the deep neck with symptoms of persistent dyspnea over the past 5 mo. After laboratory examinations, abnormal physiological and biochemical indicators were not found. Ultrasound images presented the mass to be complex, solid and fluid-filled with circumscribed margins and posterior acoustic enhancement. The mass also presented with partial internal vascularity. The contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scan illustrated the outstanding enhancement with fast perfusion mode in the early arterial phase. Our study suggested that a quick-growing mass in the pediatric patient is possibly a malignant tumor whether the mass has well-defined margins or not.",,1543
2024,35967562,Rapid automatic naming and phonological awareness deficits in preschool children with probable developmental coordination disorder.,"Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have been reported to have a higher risk of dyslexia than children with typical development (TD). Phonological awareness (PA) and rapid automatic naming (RAN) are known to be predictive of children's reading development. The present study examined PA and RAN in preschool children with and without probable DCD in Taiwan. In total, 704 children aged 5-6 years old from 25 preschools in Taichung City were included as participants. The probable DCD children performed more poorly than the children with TD on the PA and the RAN tests. Put in deficit terms, 22% of the children with TD, but 48% of the probable DCD children, had a single or dual PA/RAN deficit. Furthermore, it was manual dexterity that bore the unique relationship with RAN. Automatic visual perceptual-motor coordination may be the common processing component that underlies RAN and probable DCD. The early visual perceptual-motor profile of probable DCD children has not been well recognized before.",,1544
1386,35969052,Detection and Removal of Tooth-Colored Composite Resin using the Fluorescence-Aided Identification Technique.,"The detection and removal of tooth-colored filling materials is a major challenge for every dentist. The Fluorescence-aided Identification Technique (FIT) is a noninvasive tool to facilitate the distinction of composite resin material from sound tooth substance. Compared to conventional illumination, FIT is a very accurate, reliable, and fast diagnostic method. When composite resin is illuminated with a wavelength of approximately 398 ± 5 nm, certain fluorescent components make the composite resin appear brighter than the tooth structure. Any fluorescence-inducing light source with the appropriate wavelength can be used for this method. Optimally, this technique is used without additional natural or artificial lighting. The application of FIT can be used for diagnostic purposes, for example, dental charts, and additionally for the complete and minimally invasive removal of composite resin restorations, bracket debonding, and trauma splint removal. The assessment of volumetric changes after composite removal can be provided by overlapping pre- and postoperative scans and subsequent calculation using suitable software.",,1545
29,35985072,The Venezuelan diaspora: Migration-related experiences and mental health.,"Since 2015, the Venezuelan diaspora has poured forth from the Venezuelan sending context into an array of (mostly) middle-income receiving countries and into the United States (US) as well. For many Venezuelan migrants, post-migration reception has been mixed, and multiple studies suggest that mental health is an important challenge with discrimination and negative context reception contributing to mental health burden in terms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. Cross-national research points to important sociodemographic differences between Venezuelan migrants resettled in South American contexts and in the US, and suggests that-on average-migration-related cultural stress is lower and mental health outcomes are better among those resettling in South Florida and elsewhere in the US.",,1546
2245,35967186,Survival Outcomes in Metastatic Ewing Sarcoma Treated With Whole-Lung Radiation.,"Background and objective There is a scarcity of research on outcomes in patients with metastatic Ewing sarcoma limited to pulmonary metastases who receive whole-lung radiotherapy (WLRT). In light of this, this study aimed to evaluate the use of WLRT and compare the survival outcomes between patients with metastatic Ewing sarcoma who received treatment with WLRT and those who did not. Materials and methods Patients of all ages with metastatic Ewing sarcoma restricted to the lung who were referred to the British Columbia (BC) Cancer from 1995 to 2017 were identified from the Sarcoma Outcomes Unit (SARCOU). Patient demographics and tumor and treatment characteristics were compared between cohorts treated with WLRT versus those who did not undergo WLRT. Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates and compared between treatment groups with log-rank tests. Results The study cohort comprised 30 patients (median follow-up time: 6.8 years). Overall, the median age of the patients was 16 years (range: 4-86 years) and 60% were female; the primary disease sites were as follows: 27% axial skeleton, 53% appendicular skeleton, 20% visceral, 86% had ≥2 lung metastases, and 60% had bilateral disease. Fifteen (50%) patients received WLRT (median of 1500 cGy in 10 fractions). Chemotherapy was used in 97% of patients. The rate of surgery for lung metastases was 40%, which was similar between the WLRT and non-WLRT groups. The median size of the largest lung metastasis in the WLRT cohort was 1 cm (range: 0.3-1.8 cm), compared to 2 cm (range 0.5-6.7 cm) in the non-WLRT cohort (p=0.05). Demographics and tumor characteristics were otherwise not significantly different between the two treatment groups (all p>0.05). Among patients who received WLRT, 53% had complete response (CR), 7% partial response (PR), and 40% had disease progression. The five-year PFS was 86% vs. 59% (p=0.33) and OS was 78% vs. 54% (p=0.24) respectively for patients in the WLRT group vs. those in the non-WLRT group. The five-year PFS outcomes were higher on univariate analysis in patients with appendicular skeletal compared to axial skeletal and visceral primary sites (87.5% vs. 58% vs. 50%, respectively, p=0.02) and in patients with the size of the largest lung metastasis <2 cm vs. those with a size ≥2 cm (80% vs. 25%, p=0.04). Conclusions Patients treated with WLRT had a smaller-volume lung disease and over half of the patients who received WLRT had either complete or partial response. Trends of improved PFS and OS at five years were observed among patients who received WLRT compared to the non-WLRT group, but these were not statistically significant.",,1547
936,35974754,Free-base porphyrin polymer for bifunctional electrochemical water splitting.,"Water splitting is considered a promising approach for renewable and sustainable energy conversion. The development of water splitting electrocatalysts that have low-cost, long-lifetime, and high-performance is an important area of research for the sustainable generation of hydrogen and oxygen gas. Here, we report a metal-free porphyrin-based two-dimensional crystalline covalent organic polymer obtained from the condensation of terephthaloyl chloride and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl) porphyrin which is stabilized by an extensive hydrogen bonding network. This material exhibits bifunctional electrocatalytic performance towards water splitting with onset overpotentials, η, of 36 mV and 110 mV for HER (in 0.5 M H2SO4) and OER (in 1.0 M KOH), respectively. The as-synthesized material is also able to perform water splitting in neutral phosphate buffer saline solution, with 294 mV for HER and 520 mV for OER, respectively. Characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronoamperometry, the as-synthesized material also shows enhanced conductivity and stability compared to its molecular counterpart. Inserting a non-redox active zinc metal center in the porphyrin unit leads to a decrease in electrochemical activity towards both HER and OER, suggesting the four-nitrogen porphyrin core is the active site. The high performance of this metal-free material towards water splitting provides a sustainable alternative to the use of scarce and expensive metal electrocatalysts in energy conversion for industrial applications.",,1548
380,35979294,Massive gastrointestinal bleeding after endoscopic rubber band ligation of internal hemorrhoids: A case report.,"Rubber band ligation (RBL) using rigid anoscope is a commonly recommended therapy for grade I-III symptomatic internal hemorrhoids. Severe complications of RBL include pain, hemorrhage and sepsis. Flexible endoscopic RBL (ERBL) is now more commonly used in RBL therapy but few severe complications have been reported. Here we report on a case of massive bleeding after ERBL. A 31-year-old female was admitted to the department of gastroenterology with a chief complaint of discontinuous hematochezia for 2 years. No previous history, accompanying diseases or drug use was reported. Physical examination and colonoscopy showed grade II internal hemorrhoids. The patient received ERBL therapy. Five days after ligation, the patient presented with mild hematochezia. On days 7 and 9 after ligation, she presented with a large amount of rectal bleeding, dizziness and weakness. Emergency colonoscopy revealed active bleeding and an ulcer in the anal wound. The patient received two sessions of hemoclipping on days 7 and 9 to treat the bleeding. No further bleeding was reported up to day 15 and she was discharged home. Although the hemorrhoid prolapse disappeared after ERBL, she was dissatisfied with the subsequent complications. ERBL therapy is an effective treatment for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids with satisfactory short and long-term recovery. Pain and anal bleeding are the most frequently reported postoperative complications. Coagulation disorders complicate the increased risk of bleeding. Although rarely reported, our case reminds us that those patients without coagulation disorders are also at risk of massive life-threatening bleeding and need strict follow-up after ligation.",,1549
1989,35967617,Hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy with online sessions to reduce fatigue in patients undergoing chemotherapy for a metastatic colorectal cancer: Rational and study protocol for a feasibility study.,"In metastatic colorectal cancer (CRCm), fatigue is pervasive, reduces quality of life, and is negatively associated with survival. Its course is explained in part by psychosocial variables such as emotional distress, coping strategies, or perceived control. Thus, to reduce fatigue, psychosocial interventions appear to be relevant. In some cancers, Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT) reduce fatigue. Hypnosis is also used as a complementary therapy to reduce the side effects of cancer. While CBT requires specific training often reserved for psychologists, hypnosis has the advantage of being increasingly practiced by caregivers and is therefore less expensive (Montgomery et al., 2007). On the other hand, CBT and hypnosis remain understudied in the CRC, do not focus on the symptom of fatigue and in Europe such programs have never been evaluated. Implementing an intervention in a healthcare setting is complex (e.g., economic and practical aspects) and recruiting participants can be challenging. The primary objective will therefore be to study the feasibility of two standardized interventions (hypnosis and CBT) that aim to reduce fatigue in patients with CRCm treated in a French cancer center. A prospective, single-center, randomized interventional feasibility study, using mixed methods (both quantitative and qualitative). A total of 60 patients will be allocated to each intervention group [Hypnosis (n = 30) and CBT (n = 30)]. Participants will be randomized into two parallel groups (ratio 1:1). Both programs will consist of 6 weekly sessions focusing on the CRF management over a period of 6 weeks. Trained therapists will conduct the program combining 3 face-to-face sessions and 3 online sessions. The feasibility and experience of interventions will be evaluated by the outcome variables, including the adhesion rate, the reasons for acceptability, relevance or non-adherence, the satisfaction, the fatigue evolution (with ecological momentary assessments), and the quality of life. All questionnaires will be self-assessment using an online application from the cancer center. Results will highlight the barriers/facilitators to the implementation of the program and the relevance of the program to the patients, and will be used to generate hypotheses for a randomized control trial.

Premature infants admitted to Shanghai Children's Medical Center within 24 h after birth from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018 were enrolled. Neonatal complications, nutrition support, and anthropometric data were collected and analyzed to diagnose EUGR on different definitions at discharge. The weight and the height of each subject were collected by telephone investigation from 1 September 2021 to 31 November 2021 to access the incidences of overweight/obesity, short stature, and thinness at age 3-6 years. A total of 527 preterm infants were included in the final sample. The overall mean weight and height Z-scores were -0.37 ± 0.97 SD and -0.29 ± 1.18 SD at birth, and increased to -0.03 ± 1.11 SD and 0.13 ± 1.2 SD at follow-up, respectively. The logistic regression analysis indicated longitudinal EUGR on head circumference as the risk factor of overweight or obesity, cross-sectional EUGR on height as the risk factor of short stature, and delayed EN as the risk factor of thinness. The growth trajectories of the preterm newborns tended toward the normal direction. Longitudinal EUGR on the head circumference and cross-sectional EUGR on height at discharge were associated with adverse physical growth outcomes at age 3-6 years.",,1551

We describe a case of a six-year-old male child who presented to our hospital with pain in the abdomen after an alleged history of minor trauma to the abdomen. On per abdomen examination there was a visible mass that was cystic on palpation. Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging showed large multiloculated, septated intra-abdominal cystic structures. The patient underwent sclerotherapy with doxycycline and resolved completely after one session without complications.

2093,35967425,Development and validation of a cancer-associated fibroblast-derived lncRNA signature for predicting clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer.,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are actively involved in cancer progression through generating extracellular matrix and orchestrating the crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This study aimed to develop and validate a CAF-derived lncRNA (long non-coding RNA) (CAFDL) signature for predicting clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC). Clinical data and transcriptomic profiles of 2,320 patients with CRC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-COAD and TCGA-READ datasets and 16 Gene Expression Omnibus datasets were included in this study. CAFDLs were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The CAFDL signature was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis in the TCGA-CRC training set. Multiple CRC cohorts and pan-cancer cohorts were used to validated the CAFDL signature. Patients with high CAFDL scores had significantly worse overall survival and disease-free survival than patients with low CAFDL scores in all CRC cohorts. In addition, non-responders to fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)/fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, bevacizumab, and immune checkpoint inhibitors had significantly higher CAFDL scores compared with responders. Pan-cancer analysis showed that CAFDL had prognostic predictive power in multiple cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma. The CAFDL signature was positively correlated with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis pathways but negatively correlated with the expression of immune checkpoints such as PDCD1, CD274, and CTLA4. The CAFDL signature reflects CAF properties from a lncRNA perspective and effectively predicts clinical outcomes in CRC and across pan-cancer. The CAFDL signature can serve as a useful tool for risk stratification and provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of CAFs in cancer immunity.",,1553
125,35983282,Quantification of Cannabis in Infused Consumer Products and Their Residues on Skin.,"Cannabis consumer products are a $4.6 billion industry in the U.S. that is projected to exceed $14 billion by 2025. Despite an absence of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation or clinical data, thousands of nutraceuticals, topical consumer products, and beauty products claim benefits of hemp or cannabidiol. However, a lack of required quality control measures prevents consumers from knowing the true concentration or purities of cannabis-labeled products. Thirteen over-the-counter consumer products were examined for the presence of cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A (THCA). Additionally, the efficacy of topical applications was investigated using a porcine skin model, in which particle size and zeta potential relate to skin permeability. Skin permeation was correlated to particle size and relative stability in skin-like conditions but not directly related to the CBD content, suggesting that topical products can be designed to enhance overall skin permeation. Of the products analyzed, all products have some traceable amount of cannabinoids, while seven products had multiple cannabinoids with quantifiable amounts. Overall, the need for further regulation is clear, as most products have apparent distinctions between their true and labeled contents.",,1554
1621,35968195,"Many-Particle Li Ion Dynamics in LiMPO4 Olivine Phosphates (M = Mn, Fe).","LiMPO4 (M = Mn, Fe) olivine phosphates are important materials for battery applications due to their stability, safety, and reliable recharge cycle. Despite continuous experimental and computational investigations, several aspects of these materials remain challenging, including conductivity dimensionality and how it maps onto Li pathways. In this work, we use a refined version of our finite temperature molecular dynamics shooting approach, originally designed to enhance Li hopping probability. We perform a comparative analysis of ion mobility in both materials, focused on many-particle effects. Therein, we identify main [010] diffusion channels, as well as means of interchannel couplings, in the form of Li lateral [001] hopping, which markedly impact the overall mobility efficiency as measured by self-diffusion coefficients. This clearly supports the need of many-particle approaches for reliable mechanistic investigations and for battery materials benchmarking due to the complex nature of the diffusion and transport mechanisms.",,1555
1897,35967713,Strategic outsourcing's role in driving economic value by examining mediating role of organizational capabilities and sustainable innovation.,"The study's overarching purpose was to investigate the impact of strategic HR outsourcing on organizational sustainability. This study also attempted to evaluate the function of organizational capabilities and HR proficiency as a mediator in the relationship between strategic HR outsourcing and organizational sustainability. Data was collected from 400 HR professionals in China using a questionnaire technique. The Smart-PLS software and a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique were used to evaluate the data. Organizational sustainability was found to be insignificantly related to strategic HR outsourcing. Furthermore, organizational capabilities and HR proficiency were discovered to mediate the association between strategic HR outsourcing and organizational sustainability. By analyzing the impact of strategic HR outsourcing on organizational sustainability, this paper provided an important theoretical contribution. In terms of practical applications, this article would surely help HR professionals to maintain and develop policies to encourage employees to be engaged and perform well. Furthermore, this study might be effective in resolving difficulties linked to organizational sustainability. The small sample size of this study, which included solely HR professionals working in Chinese firms, was one of its limitations. In addition, future studies can incorporate other constructs to acquire a deeper knowledge of the factors that influence employee health.",,1556
780,35975057,Phase behavior of binary and ternary fluoropolymer (PVDF-HFP) solutions for single-ion conductors.,"A fluoropolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) has a dielectric constant of ∼11, providing charge screening effects. Hence, this highly polar PVDF-HFP material has been employed as a matrix for solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). In this study, the phase behavior of binary PVDF-HFP solutions was analyzed using the Flory-Huggins theory, in which ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, γ-butyrolactone, and acetone were employed as model solvents. In particular, for the binary PVDF-HFP/acetone system, the solid-liquid and liquid-liquid phase transitions were qualitatively described. Then, the phase diagram for ternary acetone/PVDF-HFP/polyphenolate systems was constructed, in which the binodal, spinodal, tie-line, and critical point were included. Finally, when a polyelectrolyte lithium polyphenolate was mixed with the PVDF-HFP matrix, it formed a single-ion conductor with a Li+ transference number of 0.8 at 23 °C. In the case of ionic conductivity, it was ∼10-5 S cm-1 in solid state and ∼10-4 S cm-1 in gel state, respectively.",,1557
857,35974866,Weight Stigma in Patients With Obesity and Its Clinical Correlates: A Perspective From an Indian Bariatric Clinic.,"Introduction Obesity being a global epidemic, currently has several adverse health outcomes. Weight stigma is a significant barrier to delivering quality services and also impairs clinical progress. We intended to study the association of stigma with demographic and clinical variables in obese patients to identify the obstacles in treatment-seeking, so stigma could be adequately addressed to improve clinical outcomes. Methods This study was a retrospective chart review in a Bariatric clinic in a tertiary care hospital. The weight self-stigma questionnaire (WSSQ) was routinely used in the clinic. Demographic and clinical data were collected for 146 obese patients.  Results Female patients (73%) had higher stigma scores. The mean total stigma score was 41.6(SD 3.83), the total self-devaluation score was 21.88(SD 2.10), total fear of enacted stigma was 21.26(SD 2.33). Multivariate analysis revealed an association between stigma with multiple dysfunctional eating patterns like bingeing, overeating, and grazing (Adjusted aOR 3.86, 95% CI- 1.66-8.96) and psychiatric diagnosis (adjusted aOR 3.00, CI- 1.25-7.17). Conclusion This study found an association between stigma and certain clinical variables that maintain and worsen obesity and comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. This highlights the importance of an assessment of mental health and stigma in general practice when dealing with patients with obesity. Treating the underlying psychiatric comorbidities and addressing unhealthy eating behaviors can help reduce self-stigma. Stigma is a barrier to treatment-seeking that needs to be addressed in the community.",,1558
1689,35968083,"Harnessing photosynthesis to produce electricity using cyanobacteria, green algae, seaweeds and plants.","The conversion of solar energy into electrical current by photosynthetic organisms has the potential to produce clean energy. Life on earth depends on photosynthesis, the major mechanism for biological conversion of light energy into chemical energy. Indeed, billions of years of evolution and adaptation to extreme environmental habitats have resulted in highly efficient light-harvesting and photochemical systems in the photosynthetic organisms that can be found in almost every ecological habitat of our world. In harnessing photosynthesis to produce green energy, the native photosynthetic system is interfaced with electrodes and electron mediators to yield bio-photoelectrochemical cells (BPECs) that transform light energy into electrical power. BPECs utilizing plants, seaweeds, unicellular photosynthetic microorganisms, thylakoid membranes or purified complexes, have been studied in attempts to construct efficient and non-polluting BPECs to produce electricity or hydrogen for use as green energy. The high efficiency of photosynthetic light-harvesting and energy production in the mostly unpolluting processes that make use of water and CO2 and produce oxygen beckons us to develop this approach. On the other hand, the need to use physiological conditions, the sensitivity to photoinhibition as well as other abiotic stresses, and the requirement to extract electrons from the system are challenging. In this review, we describe the principles and methods of the different kinds of BPECs that use natural photosynthesis, with an emphasis on BPECs containing living oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. We start with a brief summary of BPECs that use purified photosynthetic complexes. This strategy has produced high-efficiency BPECs. However, the lifetimes of operation of these BPECs are limited, and the preparation is laborious and expensive. We then describe the use of thylakoid membranes in BPECs which requires less effort and usually produces high currents but still suffers from the lack of ability to self-repair damage caused by photoinhibition. This obstacle of the utilization of photosynthetic systems can be significantly reduced by using intact living organisms in the BPEC. We thus describe here progress in developing BPECs that make use of cyanobacteria, green algae, seaweeds and higher plants. Finally, we discuss the future challenges of producing high and longtime operating BPECs for practical use.",,1559
2086,35967432,Notes on syphilis vaccine development.,"The quest for a syphilis vaccine to provide protection from infection or disease began not long after the isolation of the first Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (T. pallidum) strain in 1912. Yet, a practical and effective vaccine formulation continues to elude scientists. Over the last few years, however, efforts toward developing a syphilis vaccine have increased thanks to an improved understanding of the repertoire of T. pallidum outer membrane proteins (OMPs), which are the most likely syphilis vaccine candidates. More has been also learned about the molecular mechanisms behind pathogen persistence and immune evasion. Published vaccine formulations based on a subset of the pathogen's OMPs have conferred only partial protection upon challenge of immunized laboratory animals, primarily rabbits. Nonetheless, those experiments have improved our approach to the choice of immunization regimens, adjuvants, and vaccine target selection, although significant knowledge gaps remain. Herein, we provide a brief overview on current technologies and approaches employed in syphilis vaccinology, and possible future directions to develop a vaccine that could be pivotal to future syphilis control and elimination initiatives.",,1560
775,35975062,Synthesis of flexible Co nanowires from bulk precursors.,"This work reports a method of producing flexible cobalt nanowires (NWs) directly from the chemical conversion of bulk precursors at room temperature. Chemical reduction of Li6CoCl8 produces a nanocomposite of Co and LiCl, of which the salt is subsequently removed. The dilute concentration of Co in the precursor combined with the anisotropic crystal structure of the hcp phase leads to 1D growth in the absence of any templates or additives. The Co NWs are shown to have high saturation magnetization (130.6 emu g-1). Our understanding of the NW formation mechanism points to new directions of scalable nanostructure generation.",,1561
608,35977791,Reproductive Strategies Affect Telomere Dynamics across the Life Course.,"AbstractBecause parental care has a heritable basis, the benefits of receiving increased parental provisioning early in life are genetically linked to the costs of providing increased parental provisioning at adulthood. Reproductive strategies thus result in distinct cost-benefit syndromes across the life course that may shape individual health and aging trajectories. Here we used an artificial selection approach in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) to test how reproductive strategies affect telomere length, a biomarker of somatic state, at different life stages. We show that males but not females from lines selected for low maternal investment (i.e., developing in a relatively small egg) had shorter telomeres at birth. These patterns were still weakly present at the end of the juvenile growth period. In contrast, significantly shorter telomeres were found in reproductively active adult birds from the high-investment lines, suggesting that telomere attrition was accelerated in these individuals once they had become reproductively active. Our study shows that reproductive strategies differentially affect telomere dynamics across the life course, highlighting the role of cross-generational constraints in shaping individual aging trajectories.",,1562

2367,35967009,Study on Mechanical Properties and Crack Propagation of Raw Coal with Different Bedding Angles based on CT Scanning.,"The deformation and damage characteristics of coal are the important foundation that affects the fracturing potential of coal reservoirs and the development plan of coalbed methane (CBM). To reveal the influence regulation of primary fractures and the bedding angle of coal on its failure and provide theoretical basis for CBM development, raw coal samples of no 16 coal seam in Wenjiaba Coal Mine, Zhijin County, Bijie City with different bedding angles were selected as the research object, and uniaxial compression tests were carried out on them, and CT scanning and crack reconstruction before and after sample failure were carried out. The results show that (1) the compressive strength, elastic modulus, and Poisson's ratio of coal show a strong bedding angle effect, and the changing trend of each index is basically the same. The coal samples with bedding angles of 0 and 90° are the highest, while the coal samples with bedding angles of 30° are the lowest, and the overall distribution is an approximate U with the increase in bedding angle. With the increase in bedding angle of 0-90°, the failure modes of coal samples are tension-shear combined failure, shear-slip failure, and splitting tension failure in turn. (2) The observation of raw coal and CT scanning show that the primary cracks in coal samples are well developed, especially in the lower part of 0° samples, the cracks in 30° samples, 60° samples, and 90° samples are evenly distributed and develop at a certain angle with the weak bedding surface, and microcracks parallel to and nearly perpendicular to the weak bedding surface are developed in 45° samples. At the same time, banded minerals in coal and rock samples are also well developed. (3) The characteristics of crack propagation and evolution in coal samples with different bedding dip angles are significantly different. The bedding dip angles and primary cracks of coal seam have a great influence on crack propagation. With different bedding angles, the propagation modes are different. The crack propagation mainly includes two ways: forming a certain angle with bedding and extending along the bedding plane. (4) The fracture characteristic parameters of coal in the primary state and after failure have the same law with the bedding dip angle, showing a trend of high at both ends and low in the middle, which is an irregular U-shaped distribution and has a similar law with mechanical characteristic parameters.",,1564
1196,35972064,Fathers' experience of depression during the perinatal period: a qualitative systematic review.,"The objective of this review was to understand fathers' experiences of depression in the perinatal period, including how they recognize their depression, the emotions they experience, the impact of depression on their relationships, and their help-seeking behaviors and support. Whilst the prevalence of perinatal depression in men is now estimated to be just below that in women, no current care pathways for affected men exclusively exist in the United Kingdom. However, evidence demonstrates that paternal depression has severe consequences, affecting men's relationships with their partners and infants, their parenting behaviors, and the well-being of their children. This demonstrates a need to focus on the paternal experience of depression during this stage of life. This review included qualitative studies that included biological fathers over the age of 18. The phenomena of interest was depression or mental distress in fathers within the context of the perinatal period. All qualitative designs were included in the study with a focus on lived experiences of fathers. Searches for existing systematic reviews were carried out in March 2021 and no similar protocols or completed reviews were identified. Seven databases were searched in August 2021: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest Sociology, ProQuest Dissertations and Thesis Global, and OpenGrey. Search limits included English language and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Two reviewers assessed methodological quality, a third reviewer was not required when assessing quality since no disagreements arose. A standardized data extraction tool was used to extract and synthesize data. Confidence in the findings was subsequently assessed. Nine papers were included after full-text review, which were considered relevant to the research questions and which focused on fathers' experiences (n = 138), although only two focused specifically on depression. The overall quality of the studies was moderate. Overall, 109 findings were collated into 22 categories producing six synthesized findings. These were: mental health literacy around paternal perinatal depression is poor amongst men; relationships are experienced as both comforting and distressing in the perinatal period; new fathers do experience depression, but this is avoided, normalized, or hidden; fathers feel judged about mental health difficulties and so are reluctant to disclose them; help-seeking in fathers is prevented by non-targeted support for dads; and all men have the potential to become depressed because fatherhood is challenging. The review found that fathers may experience depression and negative emotions around the time their child is born, including anger, irritability, and resentment of the child. Men found their relationship changes difficult, feeling that fatherhood did not seem real until the baby was born. There was a significant lack of father-focused support for men, who were aware of stigma and social expectations of them. Men were not keen to seek help for their feelings, in part due to prioritizing the needs of the mother (and child) as more important. There is a need for greater attention on paternal perinatal depression through research and practice. PROSPERO CRD42021245894.",,1565
395,35979279,Immunoadsorption therapy for Klinefelter syndrome with antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient: A case report.,"Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a genetic disease of male sex chromosome malformations that affects sperm production and reduces testosterone production. It has been reported that there is currently more than 10 cases of KS combined with antiphospholipid syndrome. Here, we describe a 31-year-old male patient with chromosome 47, XXY type, who suffered deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs accompanied by abnormal antiphospholipid antibody, lupus anticoagulant and factor VIII. After treatment with immunoadsorption therapy, glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin and anticoagulant therapy, the patient showed dramatic symptomatic improvement. During the follow-up, the patient did not develop any new thrombotic events. Immunoadsorption combined with glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide shock comprehensive treatment has achieved significant results for patients with KS combined with antiphospholipid syndrome.",,1566
749,35975088,From 0D to 2D: N-doped carbon nanosheets for detection of alcohol-based chemical vapours.,"The application of N-doped carbon nanosheets, with and without embedded carbon dots, as active materials for the room temperature chemoresistive detection of methanol and/or ethanol is presented. The new carbons were made by converting 0D N-doped carbon dots (NCDs) to 2D nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets by heat treatment (200-700 °C). The nanosheets exhibited a lateral size of ∼3 μm and a thickness of ∼12 nm at the highest annealing temperature. Both Raman and TEM analyses showed morphological transitions of the dots to the sheets, whilst XPS analysis revealed transformation of the N-bonding states with increasing temperature. PDF analysis confirmed the presence of defective carbon sheets. Room temperature screening of the chemical vapours of two alcohols (methanol and ethanol), revealed that the structure and the type of N-configuration influenced the detection of the chemical vapours. For instance, the lateral size of the nanosheets and the high charge density N-configurations promoted detection of both methanol and ethanol vapours at good sensitivity (-16.8 × 10-5 ppm-1 EtOH and 1.2 × 10-5 ppm-1 MeOH) and low LoD (∼44 ppmEtOH and ∼30.3 ppmMeOH) values. The study showed that the composite nature as well as the large basal area of the carbon nanosheets enabled generation of adequate defective sites that facilitated easy adsorption of the VOC analyte molecules, thereby eliminating the need to use conducting polymers or the formation of porous molecular frameworks for the alcohol detection.",,1567
1538,35968348,Development and validation of prognostic m6A-related lncRNA and mRNA model in thyroid cancer.,"Although N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulators and lncRNAs influence the carcinogenesis of thyroid cancer (THCA), the association between m6A-related lncRNAs and THCA remains unexplored. Therefore, we have developed and validated a prognostic model based on m6A-related lncRNAs and mRNAs in THCA. Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas were used to analyze the expression and prognostic characteristics of m6A-related lncRNAs and mRNAs in THCA. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen out independent prognostic factors, while Lasso Cox regression was performed to construct m6A-related lncRNA and mRNA models. The correlation between the prognostic models and gene mutation, immune cell infiltration, tumor microenvironment score, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability were assessed. The prognostic models showed excellent accuracy in predicting the prognosis of patients with THCA. Our study established an m6A-related nomogram capable of predicting the prognosis of patients with THCA. In addition, the hub lncRNAs and mRNAs provide insight into improving the prognosis of THCA. These findings can improve our understanding of m6A modifications in THCA and the prognosis and treatment strategies of THCA.",,1568
761,35975076,Ascorbic acid-induced fiber-scrolling of titanium carbide Ti3C2T x MXene.,"Changing the morphology of two-dimensional materials often offers an efficient and effective means to exploit their electronic and mechanical properties. Two-dimensional materials such as graphene can be scrolled into one-dimensional fibers via simple sonication. Unfortunately, scrolling MXene nanosheets into fibers is quite challenging, especially Ti3C2T x composed of three layers of titanium atoms and two layers of carbon atoms. Herein, we report a new method to fabricate MXene fibers via ascorbic acid (AA) induced scrolling of Ti3C2T x nanosheets. An unusual AA-Ti3C2T x interaction is discovered in that intercalated AA molecules bind to and interact with the Ti3C2T x surface in the form of a hydrogen bonding-bonded assembly instead of as individual molecules, and a sheet-scrolling mechanism is proposed based on this interaction. The as-obtained MXene fibers exhibit a compact cross-section, and the diameter can be tailored from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers through tuning the MXene/AA ratio. Moreover, the storage modulus of the MXene-fiber sponge attains its maximum value of ∼1 MPa when a unique morphology comprising both fibers and not-yet-scrolled sheets is presented. This work offers a new strategy of fiber-shaping MXenes for applications in structural composites and flexible electronics.",,1569
1949,35967659,Research on the influence mechanism of creative time pressure on employee knowledge hiding: Evidence from creative service enterprises in China.,"Employee knowledge sharing is critical to the success of creative service enterprises. However, knowledge hiding is prevalent in creative service enterprises. Using 381 advertising agency employees as respondents, we explored the mechanism of action of creative time pressure affecting knowledge hiding. We constructed a regulated dual-path model by drawing on affective event theory, with work passion as a mediating variable and team psychological safety climate as a moderating variable. The results show that creative time pressure increases employees' knowledge hiding; creative time pressure mitigates knowledge hiding through the effect of harmonious passion, while obsessive passion enhances employees' knowledge hiding; team psychological safety climate can regulate the relationship between creative time pressure and two types of work passion and the strength of the two paths. Therefore, the mediating effect of harmonious passion is stronger in a high team psychological safety climate, while the mediating effect of obsessive passion is stronger in a low team psychological safety climate.",,1570

291,35981466,Theoretical investigation of the titanium-nitrogen heterofullerenes evolved from the smallest fullerene.,"In this survey, we are performed kinetic stability, global reactivity, atomic polar tensor (APT) charge and counter plots of Ti-N heterofullerenes developed from C20 fullerene with the molecular formula of C20-2nTinNn (n = 1-8), at B3PW91/6-311+G∗ level of theory. Also, we are investigated substituent effect of titanium and nitrogen heteroatoms on deuterium adsorption of the heterofullerenes according to density functional theory (DFT). Substituting of Ti-N units with various topology in the cap or equatorial position of heterofullerenes, changes significantly their electronic properties and causes different frontier molecular orbital energy separation (ΔEHOMO-LUMO). Hence, C18Ti1N1 and C10Ti5N5 are found as the best insulated species, while C12Ti4N4 and C4Ti8N8 are considered as the strongest conductive nanocage. Also, C14Ti3N3 cage shows the highest positive APT charge on Ti atom (+1.357, +1.053), while C12Ti4N4 cage shows the lowest positive APT charge on Ti atom (+0.031, -0.292). Accordingly, C14Ti3N3, and C12Ti4N4 exhibit the lowest, and the highest global electrophilicity; ω of 2.58, and 7.01 eV, respectively. As six D2 molecules are approached the C14Ti3N3 heterofullerene, its ΔEHOMO-LUMO (Eg) is increased from 1.29 eV in C14Ti3N3 heterofullerene to 2.11 eV in D2/C14Ti3N3 complex (∼+63.57%) indicating high sensitivity of it to adsorption of six D2 molecules through an exothermic process. As sixteen D2 molecules approaches the C4Ti8N8 nanocage, its Eg reduces from 0.97 to 0.73 eV (∼-24.74%) indicating high electrical conductivity of D2/C4Ti8N8 complex. Therefore, C4Ti8N8 as hopeful sensor, can be generate electrical signals when the D2 molecules approach.",,1572
1058,35974561,Temporal Theil scaling in diffusive trajectory time series.,"Temporal fluctuation scaling (TFS) is a power-law relation between the variance (Ξ) and the mean (Υ) which is present in cumulative time series. Taking into account that Theil index (T) can be assumed as a measure of dispersion and considering diffusive trajectory time series, we find a power-law relation between T and Υ of the form T∼(1-cΥ)^{β}, which we call temporal Theil scaling (TTS). Specifically, by analyzing data of volatility and absolute log-return for 24 nonstationary time series of financial markets, meteorology, and COVID-19 spread, we find that TTS is present in diffusive trajectory time series, while TFS is not present. Furthermore, we show that the power-law relation of TTS has a form that is similar to the relation between order parameter and temperature, which is found in the Ginzburg-Landau theory when the nontrivial critical points of an energy functional F_{η,δ} containing arbitrary powers η and δ of the order parameter are calculated.",,1573
1128,35973934,Effect of text message communication on patient presentation for an influenza vaccination in a community-based pharmacy setting.,"Community pharmacies use text message communications for information regarding approaching refills and fill status. Patients can also be notified regarding annual influenza vaccine availability and schedule an appointment for the vaccine. This study aimed to evaluate whether text message communications affected patient presentation and resulted in a percent increase of patients receiving an influenza vaccine compared with previous vaccine season and to determine whether additional vaccines are administered upon presentation. Ambidirectional study retrospectively analyzed the impact, nationally, of a new text message communication on influenza vaccinations at a large community pharmacy chain and prospectively surveyed patients receiving an influenza vaccine at 2 geographically similar pharmacies of the chain in Southwest Virginia. Text message communications regarding vaccine and appointment availability were sent to patients at the age of 18 years and older who opted in to text message communications and received an influenza vaccine with the chain during the 2019-2020 influenza season. Vaccine data from consecutive seasons were compared. Eligible patients in Southwest Virginia were surveyed about how they were informed about availability, previous intent to receive an influenza vaccine, applicability to other vaccines, and effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on vaccination. Results were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate analyses. Nationally, influenza vaccines administered increased by 17.45% in patients who permitted text message communication and overall by 13.22% after implementation. Decreases in co-administered pneumococcal vaccines and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines and an increase in co-administered zoster vaccines were observed. A total of 111 patients were surveyed; 4% presented owing to text message communication. A majority were intent on receiving the vaccine before being notified and reported that the pandemic did not affect presentation. Notably, 45.05% of patients were likely to receive routine vaccines if notified by text message. Text message communications are another viable way to increase vaccinations, but further studies should be conducted outside of a pandemic setting.",,1574
144,35983256,Orthodontic Treatment Needs of Adolescents in North-Western Nigeria Using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Needs.,"Orthodontic treatment planning within a public health system needs information on the need for orthodontic treatment within the population. It is imperative to have epidemiological data from which the need for orthodontic care in any region can be estimated. The present study, therefore, aimed to determine the orthodontic treatment need of adolescents in North-Western Nigeria. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted of 200, 12-15-year-old schoolchildren in Northern Nigeria using the Dental Health Component (DHC) and Aesthetic Component (AC) of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN). A structured interview and clinical examination were used to assess the subjects. Descriptive statistics and χ2 tests were used for data analysis with statistical significance set at P < 0.05. There were 19.5% with definite need (DHC 4 or 5) for orthodontic treatment and 15.5% borderline need (DHC 3). The AC scores demonstrated that 1% of the studied subjects had a definite need (AC 8-10) for orthodontic treatment and 24% borderline need (AC 5-7). A statistically significant relationship between AC and DHC of IOTN among the study population (P < 0.05) was observed. Using the DHC of the IOTN, the proportion of subjects estimated to have great and very great treatment needs (grades 4 and 5) was 19.5%. However, only 1% of individuals were in need (grades 8-10) of orthodontic treatment according to the AC. Awareness about orthodontic treatment should be a part of public health planning for this region.",,1575
161,35983120,Combination therapy in metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer: A Systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Studies directly comparing the different combination therapies offered to men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), are not available yet. This study was designed using the network meta-analysis (NMA) framework to provide a comparison of the different available options for the treatment of men with mCSPC. A systematic search was performed and the prospective randomized controlled trials reporting the overall survival (OS) or failure-free survival (FFS) were selected for review. A total of 14 studies were included in the NMA. The addition of abiraterone, apalutamide, docetaxel, and docetaxel with zoledronic acid to the androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) demonstrated a significant improvement in the OS. In indirect comparison, abiraterone had a higher impact on the OS as compared to docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.46) and docetaxel with zoledronic acid (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.05-1.63) but not apalutamide. Furthermore, apalutamide was not different than docetaxel or docetaxel with zoledronic acid. There was a significant improvement in the FFS with the combination of abiraterone, apalutamide, docetaxel (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.46-0.81), docetaxel with zoledronic acid (HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.9), and enzalutamide (HR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.25-0.61) as compared to the ADT alone. Similar to the indirect comparison of OS, abiraterone outperformed docetaxel (HR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.12-2.47), docetaxel with zoledronic acid (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.06-2.68), and enzalutamide (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.63-1.80), but not apalutamide in terms of impact on the FFS. Overall, abiraterone demonstrated better OS and FFS outcomes as compared to all the other combination strategies in this NMA.",,1576
1032,35974587,Spacing distribution in the two-dimensional Coulomb gas: Surmise and symmetry classes of non-Hermitian random matrices at noninteger β.,"A random matrix representation is proposed for the two-dimensional (2D) Coulomb gas at inverse temperature β. For 2×2 matrices with Gaussian distribution we analytically compute the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution of complex eigenvalues in radial distance. Because it does not provide such a good approximation as the Wigner surmise in 1D, we introduce an effective β_{eff}(β) in our analytic formula that describes the spacing obtained numerically from the 2D Coulomb gas well for small values of β. It reproduces the 2D Poisson distribution at β=0 exactly, that is valid for a large particle number. The surmise is used to fit data in two examples, from open quantum spin chains and ecology. The spacing distributions of complex symmetric and complex quaternion self-dual ensembles of non-Hermitian random matrices, that are only known numerically, are very well fitted by noninteger values β=1.4 and β=2.6 from a 2D Coulomb gas, respectively. These two ensembles have been suggested as the only two symmetry classes, where the 2D bulk statistics is different from the Ginibre ensemble.",,1577
139,35983261,The Impact of Reported β-Lactam Allergy on Clinical Outcomes and Antibiotic Use Among Solid Organ Transplant Recipients.,"Reported β-lactam allergies (BLAs) are common and frequently inaccurate, but there are limited data on the clinical implications of BLA among solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. We examined the impact of BLA on clinical outcomes and antibiotic use among SOT recipients. This retrospective cohort study included adult patients undergoing single-organ heart, kidney, liver, lung, or pancreas transplant at a United States academic medical center from 1 April 2017 to 31 December 2020. Demographic and clinical data were collected from the electronic health record. Multivariate median regression was performed to evaluate the association between BLA and days alive and out of the hospital in the first 180 days posttransplant (DAOH180). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between BLA and antibiotic use. Among 1700 SOT recipients, 285 (16.8%) had a BLA at the time of transplant. BLA was not associated with DAOH180 (adjusted median difference, -0.8 days [95% confidence interval {CI}, -2.7 to 1.2]; P = .43). Patients with BLA were more likely to receive intravenous vancomycin (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.8 [95% CI, 1.3-2.6]; P < .001), clindamycin (aOR, 9.9 [95% CI, 5.1-18.9]; P < .001), aztreonam (aOR, 19.6 [95% CI, 5.9-64.4]; P < .001), fluoroquinolones (aOR, 3.8 [95% CI, 2.8-5.0]; P < .001), or aminoglycosides (aOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.5-6.2]; P < .001).

1183,35973278,"Application, challenge and perspective of triboelectric nanogenerator as micro-nano energy and self-powered biosystem.","As a new type of energy harvesting technology, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) can convert distributed energy into electrical energy. It is widely used in various fields such as wearable devices, biomedical devices, Internet of Things (IoT), natural environment, etc. However, there are still some issues that need to be solved for the commercial implementation of TENGs. This review focuses on four major kinds of applications for TENG as the platform of harvesting micro-nano energy: in vivo, in vitro, living environment and wild environment. The challenges and feasible techniques facing TENGs are summarized in three aspects, including low energy output, immature manufacturing technology and unreliable service life. We also review the recent progress in the strategies for improving the output performance and robustness of TENGs, including but not limited to material optimization, device engineering and power management. The aim is to establish a feasible framework of TENGs from laboratory to engineering application. Finally, the future trend of TENGs' application in distributed sensors and biomedical devices has prospected as a promising micro-nano energy for guiding the next innovation researches.",,1579
1992,35967613,Management work mode of college students based on emotional management and incentives.,"The student management work model in colleges and universities is an effective plan for college student management, but the traditional college student management work is not very good in terms of student psychology, resulting in negative attitudes such as low learning desire, low learning efficiency, and inactive learning. In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence technologies such as sentiment analysis and incentive theory, emotional management and incentive theory have been applied to the management of college students. The emotional management and incentive model is a way to help college students get rid of psychological obstacles and guide students to establish positive and correct values by predict and analyze the psychological state of college students through language emotion recognition and BP neural network. This paper compares the college student management work model based on emotional management and incentives with the traditional college management work mode through experiments. The results show that the students' learning enthusiasm is better than the traditional college student management work mode based on emotional management and incentives. The student management work model in colleges and universities is 15.8% better, and the students' grades have improved by 12.5%; the college student management work model based on emotional management and incentives also has a positive role in helping students' mental health. The way of emotional management and motivation can make better use of college students' psychology to effectively manage students and guide students to develop in a good direction.",,1580
968,35974651,Tensile strength of rubber described via the formation and rupture of load-bearing polymer chains.,"A theoretical picture describing the tensile strength σ_{T} of elastomers is developed. σ_{T} is composed of three factors: (1) the tensile strength of individual polymer load-bearing chains (LBCs) according to Eyring's theory, (2) an occupation number of LBC states using Fermi statistics, and (3) an excluded volume factor reducing the number of possible LBCs due to the presence of filler particles or crosslinks between polymers. This description is compared to experimental tensile strengths of carbon black (N339)-filled EPDM (Keltan 4450) as well as to other experiments in the literature studying the effects of temperature, filler concentration, and particle size as well as crosslink density.",,1581
2118,35967400,Potential association factors for developing effective peptide-based cancer vaccines.,"Peptide-based cancer vaccines have been shown to boost immune systems to kill tumor cells in cancer patients. However, designing an effective T cell epitope peptide-based cancer vaccine still remains a challenge and is a major hurdle for the application of cancer vaccines. In this study, we constructed for the first time a library of peptide-based cancer vaccines and their clinical attributes, named CancerVaccine (https://peptidecancervaccine.weebly.com/). To investigate the association factors that influence the effectiveness of cancer vaccines, these peptide-based cancer vaccines were classified into high (HCR) and low (LCR) clinical responses based on their clinical efficacy. Our study highlights that modified peptides derived from artificially modified proteins are suitable as cancer vaccines, especially for melanoma. It may be possible to advance cancer vaccines by screening for HLA class II affinity peptides may be an effective therapeutic strategy. In addition, the treatment regimen has the potential to influence the clinical response of a cancer vaccine, and Montanide ISA-51 might be an effective adjuvant. Finally, we constructed a high sensitivity and specificity machine learning model to assist in designing peptide-based cancer vaccines capable of providing high clinical responses. Together, our findings illustrate that a high clinical response following peptide-based cancer vaccination is correlated with the right type of peptide, the appropriate adjuvant, and a matched HLA allele, as well as an appropriate treatment regimen. This study would allow for enhanced development of cancer vaccines.",,1582

823,35974948,Late consequences of chemotherapy on left ventricular function in women with breast cancer.,"Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death among breast cancer survivors. Several chemotherapy drugs may cause cardiovascular toxicity. Our study aimed to assess the late effects of chemotherapy on left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in a group of female breast cancer survivors. Our study was a case-control study consisted of 60 breast cancer survivors who had undergone chemotherapy for more than 5 years and a control group of 49 women without breast cancer. All patients underwent echocardiography and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), global longitudinal strain (GLS), pulse-Doppler early transmitral peak flow velocity (E wave), early diastolic (e'), and left atrial (LA) diameter were calculated. The mean LVEF and GLS were reduced in chemotherapy group (51.63±7.93% vs. 55.37±3.50%, P=0.002 and -17.99±3.27% vs. -19.25±2.27%, P=0.025). Also, the chemotherapy group had a larger left ventricular end-systolic internal diameter than the control group (1.74±0.44cm/m2 vs. 1.58±0.22cm/m2, P= 0.011). Logistic regression analysis showed among the different cardiovascular risk factors, chemotherapy had an association with decreasing LVEF. Breast cancer survivors might have an excess risk of having subclinical LV dysfunction over time. These findings present the potential benefits of echocardiographic assessment in breast cancer survivors.",,1584
2233,35967258,"Plastid genome evolution of a monophyletic group in the subtribe Lauriineae (Laureae, Lauraceae).","Litsea, a non-monophyletic group of the tribe Laureae (Lauraceae), plays important roles in the tropical and subtropical forests of Asia, Australia, Central and North America, and the islands of the Pacific. However, intergeneric relationships between Litsea and Laurus, Lindera, Parasassafras and Sinosassafras of the tribe Laureae remain unresolved. In this study, we present phylogenetic analyses of seven newly sequenced Litsea plastomes, together with 47 Laureae plastomes obtained from public databases, representing six genera of the Laureae. Our results highlight two highly supported monophyletic groups of Litsea taxa. One is composed of 16 Litsea taxa and two Lindera taxa. The 18 plastomes of these taxa were further compared for their gene structure, codon usage, contraction and expansion of inverted repeats, sequence repeats, divergence hotspots, and gene evolution. The complete plastome size of newly sequenced taxa varied between 152,377 bp (Litsea auriculata) and 154,117 bp (Litsea pierrei). Seven of the 16 Litsea plastomes have a pair of insertions in the IRa (trnL-trnH) and IRb (ycf2) regions. The 18 plastomes of Litsea and Lindera taxa exhibit similar gene features, codon usage, oligonucleotide repeats, and inverted repeat dynamics. The codons with the highest frequency among these taxa favored A/T endings and each of these plastomes had nine divergence hotspots, which are located in the same regions. We also identified six protein coding genes (accD, ndhJ, rbcL, rpoC2, ycf1 and ycf2) under positive selection in Litsea; these genes may play important roles in adaptation of Litsea species to various environments.",,1585
1358,35969107,Forming Micro-and Nano-Plastics from Agricultural Plastic Films for Employment in Fundamental Research Studies.,"Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) dispersed in agricultural ecosystems can pose a severe threat to biota in soil and nearby waterways. In addition, chemicals such as pesticides adsorbed by NPs can harm soil organisms and potentially enter the food chain. In this context, agriculturally utilized plastics such as plastic mulch films contribute significantly to plastic pollution in agricultural ecosystems. However, most fundamental studies of fate and ecotoxicity employ idealized and poorly representative MP materials, such as polystyrene microspheres. Therefore, as described herein, we developed a lab-scale multi-step procedure to mechanically form representative MPs and NPs for such studies. The plastic material was prepared from commercially available plastic mulch films of polybutyrate adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) that were embrittled through either cryogenic treatment (CRYO) or environmental weathering (W), and from untreated PBAT pellets. The plastic materials were then treated by mechanical milling to form MPs with a size of 46-840 µm, mimicking the abrasion of plastic fragments by wind and mechanical machinery. The MPs were then sieved into several size fractions to enable further analysis. Finally, the 106 µm sieve fraction was subjected to wet grinding to generate NPs of 20-900 nm, a process that mimics the slow size reduction process for terrestrial MPs. The dimensions and the shape for MPs were determined through image analysis of stereomicrographs, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) was employed to assess particle size for NPs. MPs and NPs formed through this process possessed irregular shapes, which is in line with the geometric properties of MPs recovered from agricultural fields. Overall, this size reduction method proved efficient for forming MPs and NPs composed of biodegradable plastics such as polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT), representing mulch materials used for agricultural specialty crop production.",,1586
292,35981449,Factors associated with providers' culturally competent care for sexual and gender minority older adults in Taiwan: A qualitative study applying the social ecological model.,"Sexual and gender minority older adults receive less social support than does the general population, leading to reliance on long-term care services. On May 24, 2019, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage. Sexual and gender minority older adults are becoming more visible in Taiwanese society. However, healthcare providers' behaviour and intention to offer culturally competent care to sexual and gender minority older adults and factors affecting their behaviour and intention in Asian culture remain unclear. This study determined factors associated with healthcare providers' behaviour and intention to offer culturally competent care to Taiwanese sexual and gender minority older adults and identified related training requirements. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. This study recruited participants from 14 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organisations; long-term care facilities; and community healthcare centres. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of XXX (Ref. 201811049RIND). A total of 25 providers were interviewed: 12 nurses, 10 social workers, and 3 staff members from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organisations. Semistructured interviews were conducted between May 2019 and September 2019. Interview data were analysed using the socio-ecological model and the constant comparative technique. Factors associated with the providers' behaviour and intention to offer culturally competent care to sexual and gender minority older adults were categorised by the socio-ecological model level: 1) intrapersonal factors, namely providers' attitudes towards sexual and gender minority older adults, knowledge regarding sexual and gender minority populations, and experiences of providing care for sexual and gender minority older adults; 2) interpersonal factors, namely providers' concerns regarding interactions among staff, sexual and gender minority older adults, nonsexual and gender minority residents, and nonsexual and gender minority residents' families; 3) community factors, namely resources, training courses, and support from managers and organisations; and 4) societal factors, namely social environment and policies. This study identified multilevel factors associated with the providers' cultural competence in caring for sexual and gender minority older adults in Taiwan. These factors may lead to disparities in quality of life and health for sexual and gender minority older adults. Recommendations to address multilevel barriers to reduce health disparities and improving quality of life in sexual and gender minority older adults have been provided.",,1587
1750,35967992,"Mental well-being and diversity, equity, and inclusiveness in the veterinary profession: Pathways to a more resilient profession.","Mental well-being (MWB) and diversity, equity, and inclusiveness (DEI) continue to be critical within the veterinary profession but there is less information regarding how professional associations around the world tackle these issues. A mixed-method study including an international online survey in English (n = 137 responses via snowball sampling), fourteen interviews, and two webinars was used to identify the availability and impact of MWB and DEI support programs for veterinarians. Survey results showed that more veterinary organizations designated MWB and DEI challenges (54%, n = 43/79 and 58%, n = 45/78, respectively) as a key priority area than veterinary clinics (26%, n = 15/57 and 33%, n = 19/57, respectively). Whereas, MWB support programs were available in a moderate number of mainly English-speaking countries, DEI support programs were available in only a few countries and focused primarily on specific groups, with an unknown impact due to their recent implementation. Universally, survey respondents believed activities for specific groups, such as MWB webinars, training, and awareness campaigns, as well as MWB/DEI helplines and DEI peer-to-peer support programs had a high impact (median 3.5-4/5) yet were underemployed by both veterinary organization and veterinary clinics. Further feedback from respondents during focused interviews indicated that requiring initial and continuing training as well as tailored group activities would be most beneficial to improve MWB/DEI throughout the veterinary professional career. There are many areas of the intersection between MWB and DEI that remain to be elucidated in the future studies. Having a sufficient sample size, improving accessibility, and addressing varying cultural perceptions are the main challenges, as seen in our study. To truly address MWB and DEI disparities, change is also needed in veterinary workplace culture and environment. In conclusion, raising awareness for an inclusive profession, including increasing openness and acceptance to enhance DEI and destigmatizing MWB challenges, is needed to ensure a thriving, modern veterinary profession.",,1588
1121,35974498,Conserving elastic turbulence numerically using artificial diffusivity.,"To simulate elastic turbulence, where viscoelasticity dominates, numerical solvers introduce an artificial stress diffusivity term to handle the steep polymer stress gradients that ensue. This has recently been shown [A. Gupta and D. Vincenzi, J. Fluid Mech. 870, 405 (2019)0022-112010.1017/jfm.2019.224; V. Dzanic et al., J. Fluid Mech. 937, A31 (2022)0022-112010.1017/jfm.2022.103] to introduce unphysical artifacts with a detrimental impact on simulations. In this Letter, we propose that artificial diffusion is limited to regions where stress gradients are steep instead of seeking the zero-diffusivity limit. Through the cellular forcing and four-roll mill problem, we demonstrate that this modified artificial diffusivity is devoid of unphysical artifacts, allowing all features of elastic turbulence to be retained. Results are found to conform with direct simulations, reducing the impact of artificial diffusivity from a qualitative scale to a quantitative scale while only requiring a fraction of the numerical resolution.",,1589
1873,35967765,Canola as a potential forage.,"The nutritive quality of four cultivars of canola forage (Brassica napus L.), Orient, Midas, Global, and Hybrid (Cobra × Regent), which were harvested in the early-spring period, were compared with green-winter barley (GWB) in terms of their yields, chemical composition, in vitro gas production variables, in situ crude protein (CP) degradation, and predicted dry matter intake (PDMI). Data were statistically analyzed using a completely randomized design with four replications and three samples per replication. The study was based on a randomized complete block design, and data were analyzed using SAS, general linear model procedure for normal distribution. The canola dry matter (DM) yield was highest in Orient cultivar and lowest in Midas (P < 0.05). Organic matter (OM), CP, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and lignin(sa) concentration of the four cultivars ranged from 862 to 865, 218 to 247, 295 to 340, and 35 to 53 g/kg DM, respectively. The estimated OM disappearance (OMD), effective degradability of CP, effective rumen degradable protein (ERDP), digestible undegradable protein, and metabolizable protein (MP) of the forages were from 636 to 671 g/kg, 878 to 910, 172 to 193, 1.9 to 3.4, and 112 to 126 g/kg DM, respectively. Compared to Global and Hybrid cultivars, Orient and Midas contained higher CP, OMD, ERDP, MP concentration, and PDMI, but lower NDF, acid detergent fiber (ADF), and lignin(sa) concentrations (P < 0.05). The level of glucosinolates in the forages ranged from 0.38 to 1.51 µmol/g DM, which is below the detrimental level for ruminants. Compared to winter canola cultivars, GWB had higher DM yield (P < 0.003), NDF, lignin(sa), PDMI (P < 0.01), and digestible undegradable protein (P < 0.04), but had lower OMD (P < 0.03), ERDP (P = 0.01), and MP (P < 0.009). Based on the obtained results, the variation in the nutritive quality among the canola cultivars is relatively small, and the Orient cultivar, which is most comparable to GWB, was judged to be nutritionally the best among the cultivars.",,1590
401,35979273,Simple Anal Reinforcement with Anal Encirclement Using an Artificial Ligament in Patients with fecal Incontinence: A Single-center Observational Study.,"Surgical repair of anal sphincter defects in patients with fecal incontinence (FI) has been associated with excellent or good short-term results; however, its benefits have been shown to deteriorate over long-term follow-up. When sphincteroplasty fails or is not feasible, the subsequent surgical options are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of anal encirclement using the Leeds-Keio ligament in patients with FI. The inclusion criteria for the procedure were failure of or unsuitability for sphincteroplasty and the presence of a patulous anus (diameter, ≥35 mm). The artificial ligament was routed outside the external anal sphincter at the depth of the middle anal canal under caudal epidural anesthesia. Fourteen patients (mean age, 79.4 years; 8 females) with FI were included. Of these, seven (50%) showed a ≥50% reduction in the Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS). The mean CCFIS of 13.6 at baseline significantly improved to 7.9 3 months after surgery. The mean maximal anal resting pressure significantly increased from 16.8 mmHg to 22.6 mmHg. Postoperatively, temporary fecal impaction was observed in one patient (7%). None of the cases required removal of the artificial ligament or additional operative interventions for FI during the mean follow-up period of 31.9 months. Anal encirclement using the Leeds-Keio ligament was technically simple and safe and achieved good short-term outcomes. Therefore, this technique appears to be a simple solution for sphincter defects and may become an important surgical option for patients with FI and a patulous anus.",,1591
438,35979143,Accumulation of the gaseous hormone ethylene helps roots sense compact soil.,"Soil compaction, in which soil grains are pressed together leaving less pore space for air and water, is a persistent problem in mechanized agriculture. Most plant roots fail to penetrate soil if it is too dense. One might assume that they are physically unable to penetrate the compact soil. However, new research demonstrates a more complex mechanism that requires the build-up of the volatile plant hormone ethylene in the rhizosphere1. Ethylene itself can arrest growth and, in compact soil, it is present in higher concentrations near roots due to its reduced ability to diffuse. Roots that lack the ethylene response pathway grow better through compact soil, demonstrating that it is physically possible to do so. The work suggests new levers for crop improvement in increasingly degraded soils.",,1592
2317,35967061,Improvement in Digestion Resistibility of Mandua Starch (Eleusine coracana) after Cross-Linking with Epichlorohydrin.,"Starch, being a polymer of excessive demand for the development of products of pharmaceutical importance, has been tremendously treated in many ways for improving the desired characteristics such as viscosity, paste clarity, digestibility, swelling, syneresis, and so forth. In the present study, alkali-extracted starch of mandua grains (Eleusine coracana; family Poaceae) was treated with epichlorohydrin for cross-linking and the modified starch was assessed for swelling, solubility, water binding capacity, moisture content, and degree of cross-linking. The digestion resistibility of modified starch was analyzed in simulated gastric fluid (pH 1.2), simulated intestinal fluid (pH 6.8), and simulated colonic fluid (pH 7.4). The structural modifications in treated mandua starch were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and C13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR). The results of the study reflected the significant modification in mandua starch after treatment with epichlorohydrin (1.0% w/w sdb, solid dry basis). The degree of cross-linking of treated mandua starch was 85.15%, and the swelling capacity of mandua starch changed from 226.51 ± 2.175 to 103.14 ± 1.998% w/w after cross-linking with epichlorohydrin. A remarkable increment in digestion resistibility was observed in modified mandua starch. The XRD pattern and FTIR spectra revealed the presence of resistant starch after chemical modification. The decomposition pattern of modified mandua starch was also different from extracted mandua starch. All the results reflected the effective modification of mandua starch by epichlorohydrin and the formation of resistant starch to a significant content. The treated mandua starch may have the potential in developing various preparations of food, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals.",,1593

2292,35967139,Role of Melatonin in the Management of Substance Addiction: A Systematic Review.,"Recent evidence links melatonin hormone and its receptor to the etiology and behavioral manifestation of addiction. The role of exogenous melatonin in addiction treatment is still inconsistent and unclear. The present study aimed to review the literature on randomized clinical trials that evaluated the role of melatonin supplementation, compared to placebo, in the treatment of various substance addictions. The literature searches of relevant articles published in the English language in MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases were performed from inception up to May 2021. We included only randomized clinical trials investigating the effect of melatonin treatment, compared to placebo, on substance addiction-related parameters. Non-randomized clinical trials, observation studies, and animal studies were excluded. The risk of bias-2 was used to assess the quality of the studies. Of 537 articles, 12 randomized control trials (RCT) met our inclusion criteria. Studies have been conducted on substances of addiction including benzodiazepine (BZD), alcohol, nicotine, and opioids. Our results indicated that melatonin treatment had mixed results in improving sleep quality and was not found beneficial in BDZ cessation/discontinuation rate among patients with BDZ dependence. Sleep quality and mental health had improved by melatonin supplements in opioid addiction. In nicotine addiction, melatonin treatment showed effectiveness only on mood changes but not in performance tests. In patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), melatonin treatment did not show any improvement in sleep quality. We found that the use of exogenous melatonin in substance addiction has mixed results which do not provide sufficient evidence, relative to randomized clinical trials, to establish its role.",,1595
1988,35967618,How does capability reconfiguration impact the innovation performance of Chinese manufacturing firms?,"This study explores the relationship between capability reconfiguration and firm innovation performance by analyzing a sample of 375 manufacturing firms in China. The results suggest that the relationship between capability reconfiguration and innovation performance is affected by both the catch-up stage and the mode of capability reconfiguration (evolution or substitution). The catch-up stage of enterprises significantly impacts the moderating effects of innovation magnitude on the relationship between capability substitution and firm innovation performance, however, it has no obvious effects on the moderation of innovation magnitude on the relationship between capability evolution and innovation performance. This study contributes to the theory of dynamic capability and catch-up by revealing how innovation magnitude affects capability reconfiguration and subsequent innovation performance in different catch-up stages. The implication of this study is to remind managers to take full account of the innovation magnitude and catch-up stage in their decision-making.",,1596
413,35979244,Lymphogranuloma Venereum-Associated Proctitis Mimicking a Malignant Rectal Neoplasia: Searching for Diagnosis.,"Chlamydia trachomatis-lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and an uncommon cause of proctitis. The diagnosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion, since the clinical, imaging, endoscopic, and histological findings can mimic multiple benign or malignant conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and rectal neoplasms. We present the case of a 48-year-old Caucasian male with no significant previous medical history who was admitted due to the suspicion of a rectal neoplasia. He underwent an abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before admission due to complaints of anorectal pain, hematochezia, and constipation over the previous 2 weeks. The examination revealed a circumferential rectal wall thickening, infiltration of the perirectal fat and invasion of the mesorectal fascia, associated with perirectal fat lymphadenopathy. A radiological diagnosis of a rectal malignant neoplasia staged as T4N2MX was stated. Digital rectal examination identified a circumferential rectal tumor. Rectosigmoidoscopy showed an extensive and circumferential ulceration of the rectal mucosa, with elevated geographical borders, exudate, and aphthoid erosions at the proximal limit of the endoscopic mucosal ulceration. Biopsy specimens revealed acute ulcerative proctitis with lymphoplasmocytic inflammatory infiltrate but no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. A STI screening was positive for HIV-1 (CD4+ 251/mm3; N = 700-1,100) and C. trachomatis, with an elevated IgA-specific antibody titer (52.000; N < 5.0), suggesting LGV disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by the identification of C. trachomatis DNA on rectal swab. Other infectious causes of acute proctitis were excluded. When faced with these results, the patient ended up mentioning that he had unprotected anal sex with men. He started treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 21 days, with a drastic improvement. Rectosigmoidoscopy was repeated and showed clear signs of progressive resolution of the ulcerative proctitis. LGV-associated proctitis, often undervalued, is a reemerging disease which should always be considered a benign cause of rectal mass, in order to avoid delay in diagnosis and development of complications. Diagnosis becomes more challenging in patients with unknown HIV status. A detailed clinical history, including sexual behaviors, is a vital step to achieve the final diagnosis. A infeção por Chlamydia trachomatis-linfogranuloma venéreo (LGV) é uma doença sexualmente transmissível (DST), sendo uma causa incomum de proctite. O diagnóstico exige um elevado grau de suspeição, dado que os achados clínicos, radiológicos, endoscópicos e histológicos podem mimetizar múltiplas condições benignas ou malignas, como a doença inflamatória intestinal e as neoplasias retais. Apresentamos o caso de um homem de 48 anos, caucasiano, sem antecedentes relevantes, admitido por suspeita de neoplasia retal. Por queixas de dor anorretal, hematoquézias e obstipação com 2 semanas de evolução, realizou uma tomografia computadorizada abdominopélvica e uma ressonância magnética pélvica, que revelaram espessamento retal circunferencial, infiltração da gordura periretal e invasão da fáscia mesoretal, associados a linfadenopatias locais, sugestivos de malignidade retal (T4N2MX). O toque retal identificou uma tumoração retal circunferencial.A retosigmoidoscopia mostrou mucosa retal com ulceração extensa e circunferencial, bordos geográficos elevados, exsudado e erosões aftóides no limite proximal da ulceração mucosa. As biópsias revelaram proctite ulcerada aguda com infiltrado linfoplasmocitário difuso, sem displasia ou neoplasia. O screening de DST foi positivo para VIH-1 (CD4+ 251/mm3; N: 700–1100) e título elevado de IgA para C. trachomatis (52 000; N< 5), sugerindo LGV. O diagnóstico foi confirmado pela identificação do DNA de C. trachomatis em zaragatoa retal. Outras causas infecciosas de proctite aguda foram excluídas. Perante estes resultados, o doente acabou por mencionar que tinha tido relações homossexuais anais desprotegidas. Iniciou doxiciclina (100 mg duas vezes por dia, por 21 dias) com melhoria sintomática drástica. Repetiu retosigmoidoscopia, com sinais de proctite ulcerada em resolução. A proctite por LGV, frequentemente desvalorizada, é uma doença re-emergente, que deve ser sempre equacionada como causa benigna de massa retal, de modo a evitar o atraso diagnóstico e o desenvolvimento de complicações. O diagnóstico torna-se mais desafiante em doentes com status VIH desconhecido. A história clínica detalhada, incluindo comportamentos sexuais de risco, é fundamental para o diagnóstico.",,1597
371,35979303,Pregnancy-related psychopathology: A comparison between pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19-related social restriction periods.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impacted in a still undefined way pregnant women's mental health. There are reports of mood and affect changes in the general population and the suggestion that similar changes occur also in the pregnant population. The greater vulnerability of women during the COVID-19 restriction period may translate into a greater risk for mental disorders in the gestational period. We hypothesised that pregnant women in the pre-pandemic period would have less psychopathology and more psychological support than pregnant women during the pandemic restriction period. To compare pregnant women for anxiety, prenatal depression, psychopathology, and social support before and after the awareness of the pandemic. We administered to women willing to participate in their 2nd-3rd trimesters of pregnancy the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y (STAI-Y), and the Symptom CheckList-90-Revised (SCL-90R); we further collected sociodemographic variables and explored women's social support. The comparison was cross-sectional. The first sample was termed nonCOVID-19 because data were gathered before the COVID-19 outbreak (January 2020-February 2020) was declared, and the second sample termed COVID-19 because participants were already subjected to the COVID-19-related restrictive measures (January 2021-February 2021). Since normal distribution was not met (Shapiro-Wilk test applied), we applied nonparametric Mann-Whitney's U-test to compare psychometric tests. Ethical standards were met. The nonCOVID-19 group reported higher support from partners only, while the COVID-19 group reported multiple support (χ 2 = 9.7181; P = 0.021); the nonCOVID-19 group scored higher than the COVID-19 group only on state anxiety among psychometric scales [STAI-Y1, nonCOVID-19 median = 39 (95%CI: 39.19-51.10) vs COVID-19 median= 32 (95%CI: 30.83-38.90); Mann-Whitney's U=117.5, P = 0.00596]. Other measures did not differ meaningfully between the two groups. Scores on the EPDS, the state and trait subscales of the STAI-Y, and most SCL-90R subscales inter-correlated with one another. The anxiety component of the EPDS, EPDS-3A, correlated poorly with other measures, while it was the Global Symptom Index of the SCL-90-R that correlated most strongly with most measures. Our results are at odds with most literature and do not confirm increased depression and anxiety rates in pregnant women during the pandemic. The ability of pregnant women to deal with novel generalised threats involves mobilization of inner resources. Increasing sources of social support may have produced anxiolysis in the COVID-19 sample.",,1598
2376,35966997,Asking questions that matter - Question prompt lists as tools for improving the consent process for neurotechnology clinical trials.,"Implantable neurotechnology devices such as Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Deep Brain Stimulators (DBS) are an increasing part of treating or exploring potential treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders. While only a few devices are approved, many promising prospects for future devices are under investigation. The decision to participate in a clinical trial can be challenging, given a variety of risks to be taken into consideration. During the consent process, prospective participants might lack the language to consider those risks, feel unprepared, or simply not know what questions to ask. One tool to help empower participants to play a more active role during the consent process is a Question Prompt List (QPL). QPLs are communication tools that can prompt participants and patients to articulate potential concerns. They offer a structured list of disease, treatment, or research intervention-specific questions that research participants can use as support for question asking. While QPLs have been studied as tools for improving the consent process during cancer treatment, in this paper, we suggest they would be helpful in neurotechnology research, and offer an example of a QPL as a template for an informed consent tool in neurotechnology device trials.",,1599
639,35977042,Liner Dissociation and Acetabular Erosion Treated by Implant Retention and Dual-Mobility Liner Cementation: A Case Report.,"A 56-year-old woman underwent a left total hip arthroplasty (THA) after developing avascular necrosis after chemotherapeutic treatment of breast cancer. She presented approximately 2 years after index THA with left groin pain and complaints of instability. Imaging revealed pseudodislocation of the ceramic femoral head with erosion through the acetabular component. Intraoperative evaluation revealed a dissociated polyethylene liner, damaged acetabular locking mechanism, metallosis, and well-fixed and aligned components. Treatment consisted of component retention, bone grafting, and dual-mobility liner cementation into the acetabular component. The two-year follow-up demonstrated a pain-free, well-functioning hip, bone graft incorporation, and no evidence of loosening.",,1600
804,35975021,A novel missense mutation in obscurin gene in a Chinese consanguineous family with left ventricular noncompaction.,"Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is an increasingly recognised cardiomyopathy of which a significant percentage are genetic in origin. The purpose of the present study was to identify potential pathogenic mutation leading to disease in a Chinese LVNC family. A 3-generation family affected by LVNC was recruited. Clinical assessments were performed on available family members, with clinical examination, ECG, echocardiography and cardiac MRI. The proband (I-2), the proband's daughter (II-1, affected) and mother (III-1, unaffected) were selected for WGS. Sanger sequencing were performed in all of the 4 surviving family members. Combined whole genome sequencing with linkage analysis identified a novel missense mutation in the giant protein obscurin (OBSCN NM_001098623, c.C19063T), as the only plausible disease-causing variant that segregates with disease among the four surviving individuals, with interrogation of the entire genome excluding other potential causes. This c.C19063T missense mutation resulted in p.R6355W in the encoded OBSCN protein. It affected a highly conserved residue in the C terminus of the obscurin-B-like isoform between the PH and STKc domains, which was predicted to affect the function of the protein by different bioinformatics tools. Here we present clinical and genetic evidence implicating the novel R6355W missense mutation in obscurin as the cause of familial LVNC. This expands the spectrum of obscurin's roles in cardiomyopathies. It furthermore highlights that rare obscurin missense variants, currently often ignored or left uninterpreted, should be considered to be relevant for cardiomyopathies and can be identiﬁed by the approach presented here. This study also provided new insights into the molecular basis of OBSCN mutation positive LVNC.",,1601
1263,35971352,Parainfluenza Bronchiolitis Mimicking Recurrent Lobar Pneumonia.,"Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are the second most common cause of hospitalization in children, causing upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) and lower respiratory tract illness (LRTIs) in infants and young children. Common presentations include common cold, laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), bronchitis, and pneumonia. In immunocompetent adults, their effect is usually limited to mild upper respiratory tract illness with spontaneous recovery. However, elderly and immunocompromised adults are at risk for severe infection manifesting as epiglottitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and on rare occasions, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We describe a case of a 73-year-old female who developed recurrent respiratory distress and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and was treated for bacterial pneumonia but was eventually diagnosed with severe parainfluenza bronchitis, causing mucus plug obstruction and lobar lung collapse.",,1602
657,35975830,Resolving the structure of V3O7·H2O and Mo-substituted V3O7·H2O.,"Vanadate compounds, such as V3O7·H2O, are of high interest due to their versatile applications as electrode material for metal-ion batteries. In particular, V3O7·H2O can insert different ions such as Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Zn2+. In that case, well resolved crystal structure data, such as crystal unit-cell parameters and atom positions, are needed in order to determine the structural information of the inserted ions in the V3O7·H2O structure. In this work, fundamental crystallographic parameters, i.e. atomic displacement parameters, are determined for the atoms in the V3O7·H2O structure. Furthermore, vanadium ions were substituted by molybdenum in the V3O7·H2O structure [(V2.85Mo0.15)O7·H2O] and the crystallographic positions of the molybdenum ions and their oxidation state are elucidated.",,1603

1030,35974589,Stability limits for modes held in alternating trapping-expulsive potentials.,"We elaborate a scheme of trapping-expulsion management (TEM), in the form of the quadratic potential periodically switching between confinement and expulsion, as a means of stabilization of two-dimensional dynamical states against the backdrop of the critical collapse driven by the cubic self-attraction with strength g. The TEM scheme may be implemented, as spatially or temporally periodic modulations, in optics or BEC, respectively. The consideration is carried out by dint of numerical simulations and variational approximation (VA). In terms of the VA, the dynamics amounts to a nonlinear Ermakov equation, which, in turn, is tantamount to a linear Mathieu equation. Stability boundaries are found as functions of g and parameters of the periodic modulation of the trapping potential. Below the usual collapse threshold, which is known, in the numerical form, as g<g_{c}^{(num)}≈5.85 (in the standard notation), the stability is limited by the onset of the parametric resonance. This stability limit, including the setup with the self-repulsive sign of the cubic term (g<0), is accurately predicted by the VA. At g>g_{c}^{(num)}, the collapse threshold is found with the help of full numerical simulations. The relative increase of g_{c} above g_{c}^{(num)} is ≈1.5%. It is a meaningful result, even if its size is small, because the collapse threshold is a universal constant which is difficult to change.",,1605
1326,35969981,Integrating Citizens Juries and Discrete Choice Experiments: Methodological issues in the measurement of public values in healthcare priority setting.,"All health systems struggle with unlimited needs for healthcare, yet limited resources with which to address them. Under national health insurance systems, policymakers must make explicit and potentially contested decisions around resource allocation. Policymakers have recognized the need to include public values in decisions regarding the distribution of resources across competing health priorities. Given the complex nature of these decisions, however, research into how to effectively measure public preferences is underdeveloped. Measuring community values poses special challenges since they involve normative judgments that can be interpreted differently across individuals and communities. Researchers have previously proposed integrating two methods that are currently used for measuring public preferences around healthcare services: i) an individual survey instrument, the Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) and ii) a group-based model that incorporates informed opinions and deliberative dialogue, Citizen Juries (CJs). This current paper proposes a framework for implementing that integration and assesses methodological issues in the integration of DCEs and CJs, including issues of generalizability and validity. CJs and DCEs have conflicting epistemological and methodological foundations, which impact how researchers might analyze results of the integrated method. Researchers and policymakers interested in measuring social values should determine the philosophical orientation of their research question prior to study design, which will assist in choosing an appropriate research method. Further research is needed to investigate the empirical validity of the integrated method and how it may be implemented to maximize public acceptance. Advancing these methods can provide an improved instrument for capturing public preferences for policymakers tasked with priority setting in diverse contexts.",,1606
1206,35971608,"Pathogenesis, Evaluation, and Management of Osteolysis After Total Shoulder Arthroplasty.","Radiographic osteolysis after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) remains a challenging clinical entity, as it may not initially manifest clinically apparent symptoms but can lead to clinically important complications, such as aseptic loosening. A thorough consideration of medical history and physical examination is essential to rule out other causes of symptomatic TSA-namely, periprosthetic joint infection-as symptoms often progress to vague pain or discomfort due to subtle component loosening. Once confirmed, nonoperative treatment of osteolysis should first be pursued given the potential to avoid surgery-associated risks. If needed, the current surgical options include glenoid polyethylene revision and conversion to reverse shoulder arthroplasty. The current article provides a comprehensive review of the evaluation and management of osteolysis after TSA through an evidence-based discussion of current concepts.",,1607
2125,35967393,Pretransplantation seroreactivity in kidney donors and recipients as a predictive factor for posttransplant BKPyV-DNAemia.,"BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) often reactivates after kidney transplantation, causing BKPyV-associated nephropathy (BKPyVAN) in 1%-10% of cases with a potential detrimental effect on allograft survival. Kidney transplant recipients are regularly screened for BKPyV DNA in plasma. As this strategy may not always reduce the risk of BKPyVAN, other predictive markers are needed. To evaluate the role of pretransplant BKPyV-specific antibody, 210 kidney transplant recipients and 130 donors were screened for BKPyV DNA and BKPyV-specific antibodies. We found that the donor BKPyV immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroprevalence and antibody level were strongly associated with BKPyV-DNAemia and BKPyVAN, although multivariant analysis found the presence of anti-BKPyV-specific antibodies as a predictive factor only for BKPyV-DNAemia. The pretransplant recipient status had no effect on posttransplant BKPyV-DNAemia and BKVAN. BKPyV IgG levels remained stable in BKPyV-negative recipients during 1-year follow-up, while a considerable increase was observed in BKPyV-positive patients. The presence of anti-BKPyV-specific antibodies in kidney allograft donors is a good and reliable predictive marker for posttransplant BKPyV replication with relevance to risk stratification in transplant recipients.",,1608
2267,35967164,Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia With Kidney and Spleen Herniation in the United Arab Emirates: A Case Report.,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a severe congenital anomaly that leads to herniation of abdominal viscera to the chest, which presents with respiratory distress shortly after birth. Spleen herniation is a rare finding, and kidney herniation is even more exceedingly rare. We hereby report a case of a neonate that developed severe respiratory distress secondary to CDH. After confirming the diagnosis with chest and abdominal X-ray and initial stabilization, the patient underwent laparotomy, which revealed a large diaphragmatic defect with herniation of the ileum, colon, spleen, and left kidney. Contents were reduced to the abdomen, and the defect was repaired. The patient had a complete recovery with no complications. After reviewing the literature, we noticed the paucity of data in the Middle East region regarding the disease burden and the increased rate of complications with delayed diagnosis. Therefore, we believe that this case, which was presented in the United Arab Emirates with kidney and spleen herniation and received prompt management, is a valuable addition to the literature.",,1609
805,35975020,Association of baseline hemoglobin A1c levels with bleeding in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome underwent percutaneous coronary intervention: insights of a multicenter cohort study from China.,"To investigate the association between baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and bleeding in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This observational cohort study enrolled 6283 consecutive NSTE-ACS patients undergoing PCI from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2014. Based on baseline HbA1c levels, the patients were divided into the group with HbA1c < 7% ( n = 4740) and the group with HbA1c ≥ 7% (n = 1543). The primary outcomes are major bleeding (BARC grades 3-5) and all-cause death during follow-up. Of patients enrolled, 4705 (74.9%) were male, and 2143 (34.1%) had a history of diabetes mellitus, with a mean (SD) age of 64.13 (10.32) years. The median follow-up duration was 3.21 years. Compared with the patients with HbA1c < 7%, the risk of major bleeding events during follow-up was higher in patients with HbA1c ≥ 7% (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-2.44; P = 0.044), while the risk of all-cause death during follow-up was not associated with the higher HbA1c levels (adjusted HR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.66-1.18; P = 0.398). Compared with the lower baseline HbA1c levels, the higher baseline HbA1c levels were associated with an increase in long-term bleeding risk in NSTE-ACS patients undergoing PCI, though higher baseline HbA1c levels were not associated with the higher risk in all-cause death.",,1610
331,35979534,Negative Requests Within Hair Salons: Grammar and Embodiment in Action Formation.,"Although requests constitute a type of action that have been widely discussed within conversation analysis-oriented work, they have only recently begun to be explored in relation to the situated and multimodal dimensions in which they occur. The contribution of this paper resides in the integration of bodily-visual conduct (gaze and facial expression, gesture and locomotion, object manipulation) into a more grammatical account of requesting. Drawing on video recordings collected in two different hair salons located in the French-speaking part of Switzerland and in France (23 h in total), this paper analyzes clients' negative requests by exploring how they interface with the participants' embodied conducts. Contrary to what the literature describes for positively formulated requests, with negative requests clients challenge an expectable next action (or ongoing action) by the hairdresser. One linguistic format constitutes the focus of this article, roughly glossable as 'You don't do [action X] too much (huh)'. Our analysis of a consistent collection of such formatted turns will show that clients present them (and hairdressers tend to treat them) in different ways, depending on how they relate to embodied conduct: When these turns are used by the client as instructions, they are accompanied by manipulations of the client's own hair and tend to occur toward the initial phase of the encounter, at a stage when hairdressers and clients collaboratively negotiate the service in prospect. When uttered as directives, these turns are not accompanied by any touching practices from the client and are typically observable in subsequent phases of the encounter, making relevant an immediate linguistic or/and bodily response from the professional, as shown by the client who is actively pursuing mutual gaze with him/her. Therefore, an action cannot be distinguished from another on the basis of the turn format alone: Its sequential placement and the participants' co-occurring embodied conduct contribute to its situated and shared understanding. By analyzing the clients' use of a specific linguistic format conjointly with the deployment of specific embodied resources, this study will advance our understanding of how verbal resources and embodiment operate in concert with each other in the formation and understanding of actions, thereby feeding into new areas of research on the grammar-body interface.",,1611
1674,35968099,Molecular markers-based DNA fingerprinting coupled with morphological diversity analysis for prediction of heterotic grouping in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.).,"Cultivated sunflower holds a very narrow genetic base and the efficient utilization of available genetic diversity is very important for a successful breeding program. In the present study, 109 sunflower genotypes were assessed for diversity paneling through a combined approach of morphological and molecular markers analysis. Morphological parameters including days to flower initiation, days to flower completion, plant height, stem curvature, number of leaves per plant, leaf area, head diameter, hundred seed weight, and seed yield per plant were studied. Simple sequence repeats (40 DNA markers) were deployed for diversity profiling. Data were analyzed by both univariate and multivariate statistics. SD and coefficient of variation confirm the presence of significant amounts of genetic variation for all the morphological parameters. Cluster Analysis and Principal Component Analysis further confirm the presence of distinct grouping patterns in the studied material. Cluster analysis of both morphological and molecular analysis revealed that restorer lines tend to group separately from A, B, and open-pollinated lines. Further grouping, at the sub-cluster level, revealed six distinct sub-clusters in each of the two major clusters. In total, 12 genotypes, 6 CMS lines (CMS-HAP-12, CMS-HAP-54, CMS-HAP-56, CMS-HAP-99, CMS-HAP-111, and CMS-HAP-112) and 6 restorer lines (RHP-38, RHP-41, RHP-53, RHP-68, RHP-69, and RHP-71) could be used as potential parents for hybrid development. As genotypes of similar genetic backgrounds tend to group closer, it is deduced that one genotype with the highest seed yield per plant could be used for further hybrid breeding programs in sunflowers.",,1612
2169,35967349,IFNAR2 relevance in the clinical outcome of individuals with severe COVID-19.,"Interferons (IFNs) are a group of cytokines with antiviral, antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and immunomodulatory activities. Type I IFNs amplify and propagate the antiviral response by interacting with their receptors, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. In COVID-19, the IFNAR2 (interferon alpha and beta receptor subunit 2) gene has been associated with the severity of the disease, but the soluble receptor (sIFNAR2) levels have not been investigated. We aimed to evaluate the association of IFNAR2 variants (rs2236757, rs1051393, rs3153, rs2834158, and rs2229207) with COVID-19 mortality and to assess if there was a relation between the genetic variants and/or the clinical outcome, with the levels of sIFNAR2 in plasma samples from hospitalized individuals with severe COVID-19. We included 1,202 subjects with severe COVID-19. The genetic variants were determined by employing Taqman® assays. The levels of sIFNAR2 were determined with ELISA in plasma samples from a subgroup of 351 individuals. The rs2236757, rs3153, rs1051393, and rs2834158 variants were associated with mortality risk among patients with severe COVID-19. Higher levels of sIFNAR2 were observed in survivors of COVID-19 compared to the group of non-survivors, which was not related to the studied IFNAR2 genetic variants. IFNAR2, both gene, and soluble protein, are relevant in the clinical outcome of patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19.",,1613
396,35979278,Mills' syndrome is a unique entity of upper motor neuron disease with N-shaped progression: Three case reports.,"Mills' syndrome is an extremely rare degenerative motor neuron disorder first described by Mills in 1900, but its nosological status is still not clear. We aimed to analyze the clinical features of Mills' syndrome. Herein, we present 3 cases with similar features as those described in Mills' original paper and review the related literature. Our patients showed middle- and older-age onset, with only upper motor neuron symptoms evident throughout the course of the disease. Spastic hemiplegia began in the lower extremity with a unique progressive pattern. We consider that Mills' syndrome is a unique entity of motor neuron disorder with an N-shaped progression. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis of Mills' syndrome when the onset involves lower extremity paralysis without evidence of lower motor neuron or sensory involvement.",,1614
175,35982932,"Addiction in the time of COVID-19: Longitudinal course of substance use, psychological distress, and loneliness among a transnational Tyrolean sample with substance use disorders.","Next to an increased use of alcohol, the current pandemic has been associated with increased psychological distress among the general population. Research on its effects on individuals suffering from substance use disorders (SUD) is scarce. This study aimed at expanding the existing literature on this topic with a focus on the impact of loneliness and perceived social support. Sixty-eight people diagnosed with SUD according to ICD-10 from the Austrian state of Tyrol and from the Italian Province of South Tyrol who had been treated in a psychiatric hospital in 2019 and one hundred and thirty-six matched reference subjects of the same regional background participated in an online survey. Sociodemographic variables and scores on the Brief Symptom Checklist, the Three-Item Loneliness Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were collected at baseline and 5 months thereafter. Baseline took place after the first wave, while follow-up largely coincided with the second wave of the pandemic. Among both patients and the matched reference group, substance use as a means to feel better facing the pandemic rose and predicted higher levels of psychological distress. Patients were less likely to receive specific care at follow-up than at baseline and presented with a significantly higher prevalence of clinically relevant psychological distress and loneliness than the matched reference group at both assessment times. Among both groups, psychological burden remained unchanged over time. Perceived social support was generally significantly higher in the matched reference group than in patients. Loneliness and, to a lesser degree, low perceived social support predicted psychological distress. These findings emphasize the need of preventive and educational measures regarding substance use behavior for both individuals suffering from SUD and those without mental health disorders.",,1615

We also observed modest increases in health literacy, self-efficacy, and quality of life. To examine long-term participant knowledge retention over a six-month follow-up period following completion of the Understanding MS MOOC, a freely available six-week online health education intervention. We conducted pre-post analysis using paired t-tests to determine the effect of the course on MS knowledge (primary outcome), health literacy, resilience, self-efficacy, quality of life, and MS symptom severity among pwMS and not living with MS. We assessed the effect of participant characteristics on the change in MS knowledge using linear regression. Both pwMS (N=139) and not living with MS (N=164) significantly increased MS knowledge over the follow-up period. PwMS also showed increases in health literacy and self-efficacy. These increases were largely maintained from the post-course assessment. There was no effect on resilience or quality of life. The Understanding MS MOOC significantly increased MS knowledge and this knowledge was maintained six months after course completion. Our results reinforce the importance and potential impact of health education in the MS community.",,1616
1143,35973823,Bilateral versus unilateral total knee replacement - comparison of clinical and functional results in two-year follow-up.,"Total knee replacement is one of the most common surgical methods in diagnosis of end staged osteoarthritis. In this retrospective analysis, we focus on comparison of functional and clinical outcome in patients undergoing unilateral and bilateral replacement within a single surgical procedure. 54 patients (bilateral 19, unilateral 35) underwent total knee replacement in our clinic participated in the current study. The length of hospital stay was monitored in all patients. Assessment of functional results was based on the WOMAC score, KSS 1, KSS2, range of motion and presence of complications in both groups. Both groups of patients were homogeneous with age, body mass index and sex. The length of hospital stay in the unilateral group was 4.7±1.3 and 5.6±2.0 in the bilateral group. Patients operated on unilaterally achieved flexion of 114.9±9.3 after one year, bilateral group 112.6±8.6, the difference was insignificant. In both groups, there is a significant improvement one year postoperatively at WOMAC, KSS1 and KSS2. Comparing WOMAC, KSS1 and KSS2 between the unilateral and bilateral groups 3, 6, 12 months postoperatively, the differences are insignificant. The revision of implants in two-year follow-up reached 1.5% in unilateral group and 1.4% in bilateral group. Unilateral and bilateral knee joint endoprosthesis implantation is a successful surgical method in orthopedic practice. With conscious selection of patients, bilateral implantation may be more advantageous alternative, as the patient undergoes one operation and the associated risks.",,1617
245,35982602,Text Mining of Biomedical Articles Using the Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) Platform: Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome as a Case Study.,"Automated systems for information extraction are becoming very useful due to the enormous scale of the existing literature and the increasing number of scientific articles published worldwide in the field of medicine. We aimed to develop an accessible method using the open-source platform KNIME to perform text mining (TM) on indexed publications. Material from scientific publications in the field of life sciences was obtained and integrated by mining information on hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) as a case study. Text retrieved from Europe PubMed Central (PMC) was processed using specific KNIME nodes. The results were presented in the form of tables or graphical representations. Data could also be compared with those from other sources. By applying TM to the scientific literature on HUS as a case study, and by selecting various fields from scientific articles, it was possible to obtain a list of individual authors of publications, build bags of words and study their frequency and temporal use, discriminate topics (HUS vs. atypical HUS) in an unsupervised manner, and cross-reference information with a list of FDA-approved drugs. Following the instructions in the tutorial, researchers without programming skills can successfully perform TM on the indexed scientific literature. This methodology, using KNIME, could become a useful tool for performing statistics, analyzing behaviors, following trends, and making forecast related to medical issues. The advantages of TM using KNIME include enabling the integration of scientific information, helping to carry out reviews, and optimizing the management of resources dedicated to basic and clinical research.",,1618
1174,35973353,"Meta-nudging honesty: Past, present, and future of the research frontier.","Achieving successful and long-lasting behavior change via nudging comes with challenges. This is particularly true when choice architects attempt to change behavior that is collectively harmful but individually beneficial, such as dishonesty. Here, we introduce the concept of meta-nudging and illustrate its potential benefits in the context of promoting honesty. The meta-nudging approach implies that instead of nudging end-users directly, one would nudge them indirectly via social influencers. That is, one can arguably achieve better success by changing the behavior of those who have the ability to enforce other's behavior and norm adherence. We argue that this represents a promising new behavior change approach that helps overcome some of the challenges that the classical nudging approach has faced. We use the case of nudging honesty to develop the theoretical foundation of meta-nudging and discuss avenues for future work.",,1619

1751,35967991,Anogenital scent-marking signals fertility in a captive female Alaotran gentle lemur.,"The Lake Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) is one of the 25 most endangered primates in the world and shows low success rate in captive breeding programmes. It is therefore vital to further understand its reproductive biology. We studied a captive troop consisting of five individuals hosted at Jersey Zoo during breeding and non-breeding periods over 1 year. We collected behavioural data (n = 318 h) using all occurrence of some behaviours and ad libitum sampling methods, as well as faecal (n = 54) and anogenital scent (n = 35) samples of the breeding female. We measured sex hormone levels using enzyme immunoassay technique and investigated the volatile component of odour signals using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We observed sexual and aggressive behaviours occasionally during the breeding period. Our regression analysis showed that only period significantly predicted rates of female anogenital scent-marking, whereby the female performed anogenital scent-marking more frequently during the breeding rather than the non-breeding period. In contrast, female hormone levels did not significantly explain variation in rates of neither male nor female olfactory, sexual and affiliative behaviours, suggesting that individuals' behaviour alone is not an effective indicator of the ovulation window. The volatile chemical profile of anogenital odour secretions changed over the study, with four compounds distinguishing the fertile window during the breeding period. In conclusion, our findings suggest that anogenital scent-marking may signal the reproductive status of captive female gentle lemurs.",,1621
939,35974751,Modular and hierarchical self-assembly of siRNAs into supramolecular nanomaterials for soft and homogeneous siRNA loading and precise and visualized intracellular delivery.,"siRNA therapeutics are challenged by homogeneous and efficient loading, maintenance of biological activities, and precise, dynamic and monitorable site-release. Herein, supramolecular nanomaterials of WP5⊃G-siRNA were constructed by modular and hierarchical self-assembly of siRNA with guest (3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione derivative, G) and host (pillar[5]arene, WP5) molecules in the same system. Demonstrated by experiments and theoretical calculations, WP5⊃G-siRNA was constructed via comprehensive weak interactions including electrostatic, hydrophobic-hydrophilic, host-guest and π-π interactions. Therefore, siRNAs were efficiently loaded, maintaining good stability, bioactivities and biocompatibilities. At pH 6.8, G was protonated to give weak acidic-responsive turn-on fluorescent signals, which realized the precise location of cancer sites. This triggered a subsequent delivery and a dynamic release of siRNA in cancer cells under acidic conditions for the entire collapse of WP5⊃G-siRNA by the protonation of both WP5 and G. By both in vitro and in vivo experiments, precise and visualized delivery to cancer sites was achieved to exhibit effective tumour inhibition. This provided an efficient and soft strategy of siRNA therapies and expanded the application of supramolecular nanomaterials in diagnosis and treatment.",,1622
2320,35967058,Short-Term Sea-Level Changes and Sequence Stratigraphy of the Mid-Cretaceous Kharita Formation Reservoirs in Egypt: Insights from Geochemical and Palynological Data.,"Widespread deposition of siliciclastic sediments with consequent alternations between fine-grained siltstones and shales versus coarse-grained sandstones in the north Western Desert of Egypt provides an archive for mid-Cretaceous sea-level oscillations. This study presents elemental geochemical data as well as palynofacies and palynomorph components of upper Albian reservoirs in the Abu Gharadig Basin, north Western Desert. During the mid-Cretaceous, the studied area is located in the transition zone between the fluvio-deltaic and shallow marine settings at the southern margin of the Tethys Ocean. Thirty rock cutting samples were collected from the Kharita Formation and analyzed for major and trace elements, total organic carbon, and palynological composition. These data, together with geophysical gamma ray log values and lithological composition, allowed us to reconstruct the changes in relative sea level at this time in the framework of a third-order transgressive-regressive (T-R) sequence stratigraphic model. Palynomorph composition, represented by a fairly diverse assemblage of terrestrial plant spores and pollen grains versus marine dinoflagellate cysts and other microplankton, was employed along with the variation in the particulate organic matter composition. Chemical proxies, including Si, Ti, and often K and Fe, and their ratios normalized to Al, as well as the carbonate content and the Sr/Ca ratio, provided significant stratigraphic variations with respect to sea-level changes. The above proxies allowed for the subdivision of the studied reservoir intervals into three T-R sequences.",,1623
1628,35968150,Discrimination of Panax ginseng from counterfeits using single nucleotide polymorphism: A focused review.,"Discrimination of plant species, cultivars, and landraces is challenging because plants have high phenotypic and genotypic resemblance. Panax ginseng is commonly referred to as Korean ginseng, which contains saponins with high efficacy on cells, and has been reported to be worth billions in agroeconomic value. Korean ginseng's increasing global agroeconomic value includes additional species and cultivars that are not Korean ginseng but have physical characteristics close to it. This almost unidentifiable physical characteristic of Korean ginseng-like species is discriminated via molecular markers. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), found across the plant species in abundance, is a valuable tool in the molecular mapping of genes and distinguishing a plant species from adulterants. Differentiating the composition of genes in species is quite evident, but the varieties and landraces have fewer differences in addition to single nucleotide mismatch. Especially in the exon region, there exist both favorable and adverse effects on species. With the aforementioned ideas in discriminating ginseng based on molecular markers, SNP has proven reliable and convenient, with advanced markers available. This article provides the simplest cost-effective guidelines for experiments in a traditional laboratory setting to get hands-on SNP marker analysis. Hence, the current review provides detailed up-to-date information about the discrimination of Panax ginseng exclusively based on SNP adding with a straightforward method explained which can be followed to perform the analysis.",,1624
30,35985061,Defining Foundational Competence for Prelicensure and Graduate Nursing Students: A Concept Analysis and Conceptual Model.,"To define the concept of foundational competence as it pertains to prelicensure and graduate nursing students during their educational program, thereby informing pedagogical and assessment practices. Competence has many definitions and uses, however a lack of consensus of a clear and useful definition in nursing persists. Without shared language, competence remains open for interpretation across and among groups and impedes the ability to teach and assess it in a competency-based education framework. Using the Walker & Avant method of concept analysis, literature was reviewed and synthesized to define and explain the concept of foundational competence in nursing using evidence and practice from various disciplines. Antecedents, attributes, empirical referents and consequences of foundational competence were identified. The components and uses of the concept of foundational competence are presented to guide pedagogical and assessment practices necessary for competency-based education in nursing.",,1625
1985,35967621,Prospective memory assessment: Scientific advances and future directions.,"Prospective Memory (PM), the ability to remember to realize intended actions in the future, is crucial for maintaining autonomy. Decades of research has focused on a so-called age PM paradox, where older adults outperformed younger adults on some PM tasks, but not others. Contributing to this paradox is heterogeneity in and a lack of valid assessment methods. Previous research showed a lack of convergent validity between performance-based PM and both self-report and informant-report measures. We argue that questionnaires may be relevant to obtain information regarding patients' awareness of their PM difficulties but need to be used in conjunction with performance-based tools. Within performance-based PM tools there are also difficulties in measurement: 15-60 min experimental tasks and batteries have a good reliability but cannot usually fit in a standard clinical evaluation, while shorter PM measures have lower reliability and sensitivity. In this perspective paper, we encourage researchers to develop more ecologically valid tools. Innovative PM paradigms that allow participants to generate their own intentions and that take task costs into consideration should be developed. Future research will also need to focus on cognitive factors, personality and online evaluation, to improve PM assessment and develop ad-hoc rehabilitation programs.",,1626
919,35974771,Carbocation catalysis in confined space: activation of trityl chloride inside the hexameric resorcinarene capsule.,"Carbocation catalysis can be performed inside the confined space of the hexameric resorcinarene capsule. The inner cavity of the capsule can host the trityl carbocation, which catalyses the Diels-Alder reaction between dienes and unsaturated aldehydes. Experimental results and in silico calculations show that the hexameric resorcinarene capsule C6 can promote the formation of the trityl carbocation from trityl chloride through the cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond promoted by OH⋯X- hydrogen bonding. Here it is shown that the combination of the nanoconfined space and the latent carbocation catalysis provides a convenient complementary strategy for the typical carbocation catalysis. The latent strategy bypasses the typical pitfalls associated with active carbocations and provides control of the reaction efficiency in terms of reaction rate, conversion, and selectivity.",,1627
940,35974750,Theoretical prediction of a graphene-like 2D uranyl material with p-orbital antiferromagnetism.,"Versatile graphene-like two-dimensional materials with s-, p- and d-block elements have aroused significant interest because of their extensive applications while there is a lack of such materials with f-block elements. Herein we report a unique one composed of the f-block element moiety of uranyl (UO2 2+) through a global-minimum structure search. Its geometry is found to be similar to that of graphene with a honeycomb-like hexagonal unit composed of six uranyl ligands, where each uranyl is bridged by two superoxido groups and a pair of hydroxyl ligands. All the uranium and bridging oxygen atoms form an extended planar 2D structure, which shows thermodynamic, kinetic and thermal stabilities due to σ/π bonding as well as electrostatic interactions between ligands. Each superoxido ligand has one unpaired (2pπ*)1 electron and is antiferromagnetically coupled through uranyl bridges with 2pπ*-5f δ -2pπ* superexchange interactions, forming a rare type of one-dimensional Heisenberg chain with p-orbital antiferromagnetism, which might become valuable for application in antiferromagnetic spintronics.",,1628
2050,35967525,Does Laparoscopic Omentectomy Reduce CAPD Catheter Malfunction: A Three-arm Pilot Randomized Trial.,"Catheter malfunction secondary to omental wrapping is a frequent complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Of the various methods of peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion (PDCI), open surgical insertion under local anesthesia is most widely practiced. Laparoscopic omentectomy is often undertaken as a salvage procedure in case of malfunctioning catheters. However, there is no randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the role of prophylactic laparoscopic omentectomy on catheter function. This pilot RCT was undertaken to evaluate the impact of laparoscopic omentectomy on the incidence of catheter malfunction. Consecutive patients were randomized into three groups: laparoscopic PDCI with omentectomy (Group A), laparoscopic PDCI without omentectomy (Group B) and open surgical PDCI (Group C). The primary outcome was the incidence of catheter malfunction at 6 weeks and 3 months. Forty-one patients completed follow-up, with 16, 11, and 14 patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. Incidence of catheter malfunction was 6.2%, 27.3%, and 14.3% in Groups A, B, and C, respectively, at 6 weeks and 6.2%, 36.4%, and 21.4% at 3 months, respectively. In patients with previously failed catheter insertion (n = 23), malfunction at 3 months was 8.3% (1/12) in patients who had omentectomy, compared with 45.5% (5/11) in those who did not (P = 0.069). Operating time was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in Group A. Laparoscopic omentectomy may be associated with a lower incidence of catheter malfunction, especially in patients with previously failed peritoneal dialysis catheter. Data from this pilot RCT can be used to design a large trial with an adequate number of patients.",,1629

A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted with adult patients with diabetes in Alberta, Canada, asking two open-ended questions to describe the most helpful and difficult components of their diabetes management. Responses were analyzed using directed content analysis using the Theoretical Domains Framework as a template. The most frequently cited facilitator was care context and information, and the most frequently cited barriers were cognitive challenges and structural barriers, with patient-perceived barriers and facilitators varying by individual-level factors.",,1630
720,35975164,Exposure to natural vegetation in relation to mammographic density in a Massachusetts-based clinical cohort.,"Inverse associations between natural vegetation exposure (i.e., greenness) and breast cancer risk have been reported; however, it remains unknown whether greenness affects breast tissue development or operates through other mechanisms (e.g., body mass index [BMI] or physical activity). We examined the association between greenness and mammographic density-a strong breast cancer risk factor-to determine whether greenness influences breast tissue composition independent of lifestyle factors. Women (n = 2,318) without a history of breast cancer underwent mammographic screening at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, from 2006 to 2014. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) satellite data at 1-km2 resolution were used to estimate greenness at participants' residential address 1, 3, and 5 years before mammogram. We used multivariable linear regression to estimate differences in log-transformed volumetric mammographic density measures and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each 0.1 unit increase in NDVI. Five-year annual average NDVI was not associated with percent mammographic density in premenopausal (β = -0.01; 95% CI = -0.03, 0.02; P = 0.58) and postmenopausal women (β = -0.02; 95% CI = -0.04, 0.01; P = 0.18). Results were similar for 1-year and 3-year NDVI measures and in models including potential mediators of BMI and physical activity. There were also no associations between greenness and dense volume and nondense volume. Greenness exposures were not associated with mammographic density. Prior observations of a protective association between greenness and breast cancer may not be driven by differences in breast tissue composition, as measured by mammographic density, but rather other mechanisms.",,1631
1936,35967673,Behavioural Psychology of Unique Family Firms Toward R&D Investment in the Digital Era: The Role of Ownership Discrepancy.,"This study examines the R&D investment behaviour of different types of family-controlled firms with the moderating role of ownership discrepancy between cash-flow rights and excess voting rights by using the sufficiency conditions' theoretical framework of ability and willingness developed by De Massis. It uses data from family firms that have issued A-shares from 2008 to 2018. They used pooled OLS regression for data analysis and Tobit regression for robustness checks. This study classifies family firm types into two categories, namely, the lone-controller family firms (LCFFs) and the multi-controller family firms (MCFFs), with each being further classified as excess or no excess voting rights. Both LCFFs without excess voting rights and MCFFs with excess voting rights have the ability and willingness toward R&D investment. LCFFs with excess voting rights and MCFFs without excess voting rights only have the ability but low willingness to invest in R&D. The study also establishes that Chinese family-controlled firms are heterogeneous toward risky investment. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to differentiate Chinese family firms by their unique ownership structure characteristics in investigating the effect of the family firm structure on R&D investment. The study is a novel attempt to test the willingness and ability framework of LCFFs and MCFFs. Previous studies based on agency theory have tacitly assumed that ability and willingness exist in family-controlled firms. However, this study challenges this implicit assumption.",,1632
987,35974632,Perturbing the catenoid: Stability and mechanical properties of nonaxisymmetric minimal surfaces.,"Minimal surface problems arise naturally in many soft matter systems whose free energies are dominated by surface or interface energies. Of particular interest are the shapes, stability, and mechanical stresses of minimal surfaces spanning specific geometric boundaries. The catenoid is the best-known example where an analytical solution is known which describes the form and stability of a minimal surface held between two parallel, concentric circular frames. Here we extend this problem to nonaxisymmetric, parallel frame shapes of different orientations by developing a perturbation approach around the known catenoid solution. We show that the predictions of the perturbation theory are in good agreement with experiments on soap films and finite element simulations (Surface Evolver). Combining theory, experiment, and simulation, we analyze in depth how the shapes, stability, and mechanical properties of the minimal surfaces depend on the type and orientation of elliptic and three-leaf clover shaped frames. In the limit of perfectly aligned nonaxisymmetric frames, our predictions show excellent agreement with a recent theory established by Alimov et al. [Phys. Fluids 33, 052104 (2021)1070-663110.1063/5.0047461]. Moreover, we put in evidence the intriguing capacity of minimal surfaces between nonaxisymmetric frames to transmit a mechanical torque despite being completely liquid. These forces could be interesting to exploit for mechanical self-assembly of soft matter systems or as highly sensitive force captors.",,1633
409,35979251,Dorfman-Chanarin Syndrome: A Rare Cause of Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease Related to Homozygosity of the Nonsense Mutation c.934C>T (p.R312*).,"Metabolic associated fatty liver disease became the most common form of chronic liver disease, in the vast majority of the cases related to increased insulin resistance or metabolic dysregulation. Yet, other causes may be implied. We report the late diagnosis of Dorfman-Chanarin syndrome in a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis previously labeled cirrhotic middle-aged man, with consanguineous parents, complicated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Congenital ichthyosis, neurosensory hearing loss and elevated muscular enzymes hit on the track of Dorfman-Chanarin syndrome. The genetic analysis uncovered a first-time described homozygotic nonsense mutation in the ABHD5 gene, responsible for coding the ABHD5 protein. The patient was successfully submitted to liver transplantation. Inborn errors of metabolism are a rare cause of metabolic associated fatty liver disease, but they need to be kept in consideration in all patients who present with atypical clinical features. This shall raise the awareness of physicians to rare forms of presentation since it may imply not only a different prognosis, but also other actions, like particular therapies as liver transplantation due to related complications of cirrhosis, or familial screening. A doença hepática gorda dismetabólica tornou-se a forma mais comum de doença hepática crónica, estando mais vezes relacionada com o aumento da insulinorresistência ou desregulação metabólica. Contudo, outras causas podem estar também implicadas. Apresentamos o caso clínico de um doente com um diagnóstico de síndrome de Dorfman-Chanarin estabelecido tardiamente num homem de meia-idade com um diagnóstico prévio de cirrose associada a esteatohepatite não alcoólica, com pais consanguíneos, e complicada de carcinoma hepatocelular. A presença de ictiose congénita, a perda de audição neurosensorial, e a elevação de enzimas musculares, colocaram na pista de diagnóstico de síndrome de Dorfman-Chanarin. O estudo genético demonstrou a presença de uma mutação nonsense descrita pela primeira vez em homozigotia no gene ABHD5, responsável pela codificação da proteína ABHD5. O doente foi submetido a transplante hepático com sucesso. Os erros inatos do metabolismo são uma causa rara de doença hepática gorda, mas necessitam de ser tidos em consideração em todos os doentes que se apresentem com características clínicas atípicas. Isto deve aumentar a consciencialização dos médicos para formas raras de apresentação, uma vez que pode implicar não apenas um prognóstico diferente, mas também outras ações, como o transplante hepático por complicações associadas à cirrose, ou despiste familiar.",,1634
2228,35967265,Urban agriculture in São Paulo: an analysis from the sociology of public action.,"How can one analyze the public actions of organizations and actors from different sectors? Studies using a policy analysis perspective have shed light on the role of the state in making and implementing urban agriculture (UA) policy. However, this perspective has limitations when it comes to explaining the interactions between the state, civil society, and the business organizations that support it. This article provides an analytical framework derived from the sociology of public action (SPA) to understand how multiple organizations support UA. We have applied the SPA framework to the city of São Paulo and our analysis indicates that civil society has mobilized significant meanings, ideas, and networks to reinforce the importance of UA. As a result, there has been a paradigm shift in terms of UA: it has gone from a state of invisibility within an institutional void to an improved state of policy planning. However, civil society organizations still lead the delivery of services for farmers with intermittent state support, which indicates that there has been a paradigm shift in UA policy planning, but not in policy implementation.",,1635
1025,35974594,Directional locking in a two-dimensional Yukawa solid modulated by a two-dimensional periodic substrate.,"Directional depinning dynamics of a two-dimensional (2D) dusty plasma solid modulated by a 2D square periodic substrate are investigated using Langevin dynamical simulations. We observe prominent directional locking effects when the direction of the external driving force is varied relative to the underlying square substrate. These locking steps appear when the direction of the driving force is close to the symmetry direction of the substrate, corresponding to the different dynamical flow patterns and the structures. In the conditions between the adjacent locking steps, moving ordered states are observed. Although the discontinuous transitions often occur between the locking steps and the nonlocking portion, the continuous transitions are also found around the locking step associated with the disordered plastic flow close to its termini. Our results show that directional locking also occurs for underdamped systems, which could be tested experimentally in dusty plasmas modulated by 2D substrates.",,1636
155,35983220,Impact of digitalization on clean governance: An analysis of China's experience of 31 provinces from 2019 to 2021.,"The goal of deepening institutional reforms was to bring transparency and accountability, address corruption, and establish a clean government (CG) in China. The first step toward this transparency is considered to be the free development and transmission of Open Data (OD). In this regard, China has set up open data centers in provincial governments. Considering that OD can have an impact on CG and bring new ideas for CG construction, ODs of 31 provincial governments have been analyzed through fsQCA3.0 to test these assumptions. To see how much it can contribute to the development of the Technology Organization Environment Framework (TOE). To this end, between 2019 and 2021, 31 provincial government data have been clustered into low, medium, and high corruption case enrollment areas to determine the impact of OD. The study mentioned that improvements in ODs in 31 provinces could strengthen cooperation with the disciplinary inspection department in the fight against corruption. The study, on the other hand, made two assumptions that environmental barriers and internal pressures could affect data's reliability.",,1637
1975,35967632,Research on correlation between English writing self-efficacy and psychological anxiety of college students.,"English writing is not only a cognitive process for college students, it is also influenced by factors related to the emotional or psychological level. With the continuous improvement of the quality of university education cultivation, the pressure faced by college students has increased significantly, which has also given rise to general anxiety among college student groups. In order to investigate the correlation between college students' English writing self-efficacy and English writing psychological anxiety, we conducted a questionnaire survey on 595 current college students who were not majoring in English at a university in China, and used SPSS 25.0 software to make an empirical analysis of the collected data. The results showed that college students' English writing self-efficacy was at a moderate level, and they lacked self-confidence in their English writing skills and tended to complete writing tasks; college students generally had a moderate level of psychological anxiety in English writing, among which avoidance behavior was the most significant; college students' English writing self-efficacy was significantly negatively related to English writing psychological anxiety. English writing self-efficacy can reduce psychological anxiety level by enhancing college students' English writing motivation. Therefore, we suggest that we should set up English writing courses based on the process teaching method, change college students' English writing psychology in teaching, set reasonable writing goals, mobilize their enthusiasm and motivation in English writing, reduce college students' writing anxiety, and enhance their self-confidence in English writing.",,1638
2341,35967035,Trapping Hydrogen Atoms in Vacancies of Li2TiO3 Crystal: A First-Principles Study.,"The hydrogen atom capacity in the vacancies of the Li2TiO3 crystal is systematically studied by the first-principles method to evaluate its tritium release performance as a solid breeder material in nuclear fusion reactors. The adsorption process of adding hydrogen atoms one by one in the vacancy are investigated to find the possible adsorption sites of the hydrogen atoms in the vacancy. The charge transfer and density of states analysis are performed to reveal the form of a hydrogen-hydrogen dimer in the vacancy. Also, the trapping energy and formation energy are defined and calculated to determine the hydrogen atom capacity of the system. According to the simulations, the Ti vacancies have the strongest hydrogen atom capacity followed by Li vacancies, and O vacancies are the weakest. The influence of hydrostatic pressure on the hydrogen atom capacity is also investigated. Our results reveal the hydrogen capacity of vacancies in the Li2TiO3 crystal from the atomic scale, which also provide a theoretical guide to the related tritium release experiments.",,1639
795,35975042,A cyanide-catalyzed imino-Stetter reaction enables the concise total syntheses of rucaparib.,"Two routes toward the synthesis of rucaparib, an FDA-approved drug used for the treatment of ovarian and prostate cancers, have been developed from commercially available starting materials utilizing the cyanide-catalyzed imino-Stetter reaction as the key step for the construction of the indole motif bearing all the desired substituents in their correct positions. In the first-generation synthesis, meta-fluorobenzoate, the starting material currently used in the process chemistry route of rucaparib, was converted into 4,6-disubstituted 2-aminocinnamic acid derivatives (ester or amide). The cyanide-catalyzed imino-Stetter reaction of aldimines derived from the resulting 2-aminocinnamic acid derivatives and a commercially available aldehyde afforded the desired indole-3-acetic acid derivatives. The final azepinone formation completed the total synthesis of rucaparib in 27% overall yield. To resolve the issues raised in the first-generation synthesis, we further developed a second-generation synthesis of rucaparib. The Heck reaction of a commercially available ortho-iodoaniline derivative with acrylonitrile provided 4,6-disubstituted 2-aminocinnamonitrile, which was subjected to the imino-Stetter reaction with the same aldehyde to provide the desired indole-3-acetonitrile product. Subsequent construction of the azepinone scaffold completed the total synthesis of rucaparib in 59% overall yield over three separation operations. The synthetic strategy reported herein can provide a highly practical route to access rucaparib from commercially available starting materials (5.2% overall yield in the current process chemistry route vs. 59% overall yield in the second-generation synthesis).",,1640
1843,35967797,Visceral adiposity-related dietary patterns and the risk of cardiovascular disease in Iranian adults: A population-based cohort study.,"Visceral obesity is a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Diet may associate with CVD risk through its effects on visceral adiposity. This study aimed to find dietary patterns (DPs) related to indicators of visceral adiposity and to determine whether the DPs were associated with CVD risk. This prospective study included 2,496 participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) without CVD, who were followed from the third study examination (2005-2008; baseline) to March 2018. DPs at baseline were determined using reduced rank regression (RRR) and partial least squares regression (PLS). The response variables were age and BMI-adjusted waist circumference (WC) and age-adjusted visceral adiposity index (VAI). Two and three DPs were retained with RRR and PLS, respectively. The first patterns of each method were mainly characterized by adjusted-WC (RRR: 10.8%, PLS: 8.6%); none of them were associated with CVD risk. The second pattern of RRR and the third pattern of PLS were mainly explained by adjusted-VAI (RRR: 3.3, PLS: 2.1%). After adjusting for CVD risk factors, the hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals (CI)] for CVD in the second and third tertiles of the RRR-pattern 2 were 1.76 (1.15, 2.69) and 1.55 (1.00, 2.43) vs. the first tertile (p-trend: 0.058). This pattern had high positive loadings for non-leafy vegetables, pickled vegetables, fried vegetables, and bread and high negative loadings for eggs, cakes, butter, jam-honey, red meat, poultry, fish, juice, non-fermented dairy, and fruits. Per one SD increase in PLS-pattern 3 score, the risk of CVD was 19% higher (95%CI = 3-38%). This positive association was also observed across tertiles of the pattern (p-trend: 0.032). This pattern was characterized by high intakes of leafy vegetables, non-leafy vegetables, organ meat, soft drinks, olive oil, pickled vegetables, fried vegetables, and bread and low intakes of biscuits, cakes, butter, eggs, and non-fermented dairy. For each of the RRR and PLS approaches, a visceral-related DP that was positively linked to CVD was identified. These two patterns had a modest correlation. The pattern generated by PLS explained more variations in food groups and offered stronger evidence of association with CVD than the RRR-derived pattern.",,1641
510,35978749,Comparing the Effectiveness and Image Quality of Musculoskeletal Ultrasound of First-Year Medical Students After Training by Student Tutors Versus Ultrasound Instructors: A Pilot Study.,"Background Ultrasound is a vital part in many medical schools' curriculum. Although there is strong support for the use of student tutors (STs), there is a lack in gauging their effectiveness with more difficult organ systems such as the musculoskeletal (MSK) system. We aim to determine the effectiveness of using STs versus expert ultrasound instructors (UIs) when teaching MSK ultrasound. Methodology Medical students were recruited to participate in an MSK workshop to identify superficial volar arm structures (radial nerve, radial artery, median nerve, ulnar artery, ulnar nerve) using Butterfly iQ. In total, 14 participants were taught by STs and 10 participants were taught by UIs. Participants imaged the five structures and answered surveys gauging their confidence via five-point Likert scales. Results There was no significant difference in confidence or identification accuracy for all five structures between the two groups. However, there was a significant difference in confidence in the understanding of basic ultrasound concepts in favor of the UI group (p < 0.05). A greater number of students were more confident in identifying all five structures when taught by STs, but more students correctly identified the structures when taught by UIs. Conclusions The results on confidence could be due to positive peer perception. Both groups scored relatively high in their identification accuracies, promoting the successful use of STs. The successful use of STs in teaching MSK ultrasound opens the possibility to developing peer-led ultrasound curriculum on more complex ultrasound topics in the future.",,1642
524,35978735,Posterior Cervical Fusion of Occiput-T3 for Unstable Complex Odontoid Fracture in an 80-Year-Old Male With C2-Sacrum Synostosis From Ankylosing Spondylitis: A Case Report.,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an autoimmune arthritic condition that presents with inflammation of the axial skeleton and oligoarthritis of the peripheral joints. While its pathophysiology is not fully understood, the condition can lead to kyphosis and spontaneous intervertebral synostosis of the spine. AS is managed through both non-operative and operative means, but fractures in patients with AS are more complicated in those with synostosis. We present a case of a patient who is a tribal elder and Salish language instructor, with kyphotic AS with synostosis of C2-sacrum, and mobility confined to occiput-C1 and C1-C2. The patient suffered a low-energy fall backward from bed and presented to the orthopedic clinic approximately a month after his injury complaining of torticollis and neck pain. He was diagnosed to have a dens fracture, a right C2 pars/facet fracture, and a right lateral mass fracture with C1-C2 stenosis and cervical myelopathy. After the failure of conservative management, the patient required a full occiput-T3 fusion due to the osteoporosis and fragile AS synostosis of the spine, to mitigate transitional zone stresses that can occur with a shorter fusion. The fusion was successful, and it minimized the pain, corrected the torticollis, and allowed the patient to resume his tribal roles.",,1643
1274,35971330,Stochastic accretion of the Earth.,"Chondritic meteorites are thought to be representative of the material that formed the Earth. However, the Earth is depleted in volatile elements in a manner unlike that in any chondrite, and yet these elements retain chondritic isotope ratios. Here we use N-body simulations to show that the Earth did not form from chondrites, but rather by stochastic accretion of many precursor bodies whose variable compositions reflect the temperatures at which they formed. Earth's composition is reproduced when initial temperatures of planetesimal- to embryo-sized bodies are set by disk accretion rates of (1.08±0.17)×10-7 solar masses/yr, although they may be perturbed by 26Al heating on bodies formed at different times. Our model implies that a heliocentric gradient in composition was present in the protoplanetary disc and that planetesimals formed rapidly within ~1 Myr, in accord with radiometric volatile depletion ages of the Earth.",,1644
1667,35968107,Cacao agroforestry systems beyond the stigmas: Biotic and abiotic stress incidence impact.,"Low technological knowledge in production chains, global climate change, and misinformation are concrete threats to food security. In addition, these combined threats also trigger ecological instability in megadiverse areas of the world, especially in some cacao-producing countries in South America, where this crop plays an important socio-economic role, even being used to replace illicit crops. Accordingly, the use of agroforestry systems approaches has emerged as a good alternative to maintain productivity, add high-value commodities to producers, and provide important ecosystem services for sustainable agriculture. However, limitations associated with the competition for resources between the species composing the system, and the higher incidence of some diseases, have led many producers to abandon this strategy, opting for monoculture. In this review, we seek to gather the main information available in the literature, aiming to answer the question: what is the real scientific evidence that supports the benefits and harms of adopting agroforestry systems in cacao production? We seek to make critical scrutiny of the possible negative effects of certain associations of the agroforestry system with biotic and abiotic stress in cacao. Here, we review the possible competition for light and nutrients and discuss the main characteristics to be sought in cacao genotypes to optimize these inter-specific relationships. In addition, we review the research advances that show the behavior of the main cacao diseases (Witch's broom disease, frosty pod rot, black pod rot) in models of agroforestry systems contrasted with monoculture, as well as the optimization of agronomic practices to reduce some of these stresses. This compendium, therefore, sheds light on a major gap in establishing truly sustainable agriculture, which has been treated much more from the perspective of negative stigma than from the real technological advantages that can be combined to the benefit of a balanced ecosystem with generating income for farmers.",,1645

Stabilization within the crystal structure is provided via a system of O-H⋯O and N-H⋯O hydrogen bonding, which determines the formation of a two-dimensional architecture along the a-axis direction.",,1646
937,35974753,A bis(silylene)pyridine pincer ligand can stabilize mononuclear manganese(0) complexes: facile access to isolable analogues of the elusive d7-Mn(CO)5 radical.,"Using the potentially tridentate N,N'-bis(N-heterocyclic silylene)pyridine [SiNSi] pincer-type ligand, 2,6-N,N'-diethyl-bis[N,N'-di-tert-butyl(phenylamidinato)silylene] diaminopyridine, led to the first isolable bis(silylene)pyridine-stabilized manganese(0) complex, {κ3-[SiNSi]Mn(dmpe)} 4 (dmpe = (Me2P)2C2H4), which represents an isolobal 17 VE analogue of the elusive Mn(CO)5 radical. The compound is accessible through the reductive dehalogenation of the corresponding dihalido (SiNSi)Mn(ii) complexes 1 (Cl) and 2 (Br) with potassium graphite. Exposing 4 towards the stronger π-acceptor ligands CO and 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide afforded the related Mn(0) complexes κ2-[SiNSi]Mn(CO)3 (5) and κ3-[SiNSi]Mn(CNXylyl)2(κ1-dmpe) (6), respectively. Remarkably, the stabilization of Mn(0) in the coordination sphere of the [SiNSi] ligand favors the d7 low-spin electronic configuration, as suggested by EPR spectroscopy, SQUID measurements and DFT calculations. The suitability of 4 acting as a superior pre-catalyst in regioselective hydroboration of quinolines has also been demonstrated.",,1647
1064,35974555,Morphological transformation from fibers to sheets in embiopteran silk.,"Embioptera (webspinners) are insects that construct domiciles using silk produced from their front feet. This silk is the finest known with measured single fiber diameters in the 30-140 nm range. In the wild, some webspinner silk on trees is observed to have a clothlike or shiny sheetlike appearance. Both forms of silk shield the occupants from rain water effectively: presumably valuable in tropical environments. In this article we elucidate the mechanism by which silk fibers are transformed into these structures through interaction with water. We quantify the evaporation rates of single water droplets which have been suspended on unmodified as-spun silk for two Trinidadian arboreal species: Antipaluria urichi (Clothodidae) and Pararhagadochir trinitatis (Scelembiidae). These rates are compared to those of droplets suspended on rose petals due to similar wetting properties (both hydrophobicity and pinning). We observe that on sufficiently thick silk, droplet evaporation rates decrease with time. This behavior is a result of a thin soluble film developing on the drop surface that later becomes a solid residual film. Experimentally verified theoretical models are invoked to support the results.",,1648
2206,35967312,Multidimensional overview of neurofilament light chain contribution to comprehensively understanding multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease characterized by demyelination, progressive axonal loss, and varying clinical presentations. Axonal damage associated with the inflammatory process causes neurofilaments, the major neuron structural proteins, to be released into the extracellular space, reaching the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the peripheral blood. Methodological advances in neurofilaments' serological detection and imaging technology, along with many clinical and therapeutic studies in the last years, have deepened our understanding of MS immunopathogenesis. This review examines the use of light chain neurofilaments (NFLs) as peripheral MS biomarkers in light of the current clinical and therapeutic evidence, MS immunopathology, and technological advances in diagnostic tools. It aims to highlight NFL multidimensional value as a reliable MS biomarker with a diagnostic-prognostic profile while improving our comprehension of inflammatory neurodegenerative processes, mainly RRMS, the most frequent clinical presentation of MS.",,1649
167,35983111,The clinical efficiency and safety of 60W superpulse thulium fiber laser in retrograde intrarenal surgery.,"Our aim is to evaluate the clinical efficiency and safety of 60W Thulium fiber laser (TFL) during retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). The performance of the TFL across different ranges of stone volumes and stone densities is assessed. Between October 2019 and August 2020, a prospective study was done on 135 patients with < 20 mm renal stones, who underwent RIRS using TFL. Stone parameters, total laser time, total energy delivered (kJ), and fiber burn-back were recorded. Laser efficacy (J/mm3) and ablation speed (mm3/s) were calculated. Data of 126 of 135 patients included in the study were analyzed. The mean patient age was 45.04 ± 12.30 years. Mean stone size was 15.19 ± 4.52 mm, and mean stone volume was 1061.85 ± 806.81 mm3. Mean laser time was 19.78 ± 12.32 min. At higher stone volume (>1000 mm3), J/mm3 decreased significantly from 16.18 ± 5.90 to 10.92 ± 3.21 (P < 0.001) and the ablation speed increased significantly (0.77 ± 0.28-1.04 ± 0.28 mm3/s [P < 0.001]). Stone density did not have a significant influence on the laser efficacy [B = -0.31 (-2.45 to 1.82, p=0.771)] or on the ablation speed [B = -0.06 (-0.17 to 0.05, p=0.278)]. Overall SFR was 93.6%. The complication rate was 16.6% (21/126). Out of the 21, 12 patients had hematuria and 9 had fever, which were of Clavien grades 1-2. Superpulse TFL is efficient and safe. The work efficiency increases for larger volume stones. The work efficiency remains the same across different stone densities. No complication more than Clavien grade 2 was encountered.",,1650
724,35975159,Iridium-catalyzed α-selective deuteration of alcohols.,"The development of chemoselective C(sp3)-H deuteration is of particular interest in synthetic chemistry. We herein report the α-selective, iridium(iii)-bipyridonate-catalyzed hydrogen(H)/deuterium(D) isotope exchange of alcohols using deuterium oxide (D2O) as the primary deuterium source. This method enables the direct, chemoselective deuteration of primary and secondary alcohols under basic or neutral conditions without being affected by coordinative functional groups such as imidazole and tetrazole. Successful substrates for deuterium labelling include the pharmaceuticals losartan potassium, rapidosept, guaifenesin, and diprophylline. The deuterated losartan potassium shows higher stability towards the metabolism by CYP2C9 than the protiated analogue. Kinetic and DFT studies indicate that the direct deuteration proceeds through dehydrogenation of alcohol to the carbonyl intermediate, conversion of [IrIII-H] to [IrIII-D] with D2O, and deuteration of the carbonyl intermediate to give the α-deuterated product.",,1651
515,35978744,Sclerosing Osteomyelitis of Garré: A Clinico-Radiological Correlation.,"Sclerosing osteomyelitis of Garré is a rare and very specific type of chronic osteomyelitis that mainly affects children and young adults. To date, there is no clear etiology for the disease. Clinical findings and laboratory results are usually unremarkable with commonly negative blood and tissue cultures. Cortical thickening and periosteal reaction are common radiological findings. Biopsy often shows chronic non-specific inflammatory changes. It is a well-described entity in the dental literature, but to the best of our knowledge, there are no distinctive diagnostic criteria for long bones. We report a case of sclerosing osteomyelitis of Garré in a young lady involving the right tibia, for which the diagnosis was made based on clinico-radiological correlation.",,1652
687,35975524,"The Frequency and Typing of HPV Virus Among Suspected Women Referred to HPV Genotyping Test in Mazandaran, Northern Iran.","Human papilloma viruses are a group of the Papillomaviridae family (ds DNA viruses), which infect basal epithelial cells. So far, 228 types of HPV have been identified, in which about 40 types infect the genital mucosa. In Iran, cervical cancer has been reported as the second most common malignancy in women which is approximately 8.8% of all cancers in women. HPV genotypes are classified as high-risk and low-risk according to cervical cancer. According to previous reports, nearly 70% of cervical cancers occur by HPV genotypes 16 and 18, of which genotype 16 is known as the most prevalent type. The main goal of this study was determining the frequency of HPV virus and its genotypes in the female population of Mazandaran. This study was performed on 91 pathological samples. DNA was extracted from 500 μL of liquid-based cytology samples and PCR was performed for all of the samples. Genotyping step was performed based on strip assay method. HPV 39 (6.55%), 56 (3.27%), 51 (3.27%), and 68 (3.27%) were the most frequent types respectively. Also, HPV 11 (8.19%) and 6 (3.27%) show the most frequency among LR-HPV genotypes. HPV type 6 (16.39%), 56 (14.75%), 11 (14.75%), 16 (13.11%), and 66 (11.47%) were the four most common types seen in mixed infection samples. Differences among the types of HPV can be due to various geographical distributions of HPV. Our results revealed HPV 39 (6.55%) is the most common type among of HR-HPV followed by HPV 56, 51, 68 (3.27%); however, HPV 16 and HPV 18 were seen in just one case. HPV 11 (8.19%) and HPV 6 (3.27%) were the most common type among of LR-HPV.",,1653
783,35975054,Development of nitrile rubber/eucommia ulmoides gum composites for controllable dynamic damping and sound absorption performance.,"Aiming at enhancing the damping and sound absorption performances of nitrile rubber (NBR) incorporated Eucommia ulmoides gum (EUG), a series of NBR/EUG composites were successfully fabricated using an open mixing mill. The co-vulcanization behaviors, fracture surface morphology observations, mechanical and thermal properties and damping and sound absorption performances of NBR/EUG composites were investigated systematically. It was shown that the crystalline area and the amorphous area in NBR/EUG composites displayed a sea-island phase distribution and most of the EUG crystals were β-form crystals. Compared to that of neat NBR, the tensile strength and storage modulus of NBR/EUG composites increased dramatically with the increasing EUG content, owing to the gradually increasing number of crystals in the NBR/EUG composites. In addition, the incorporation of EUG into the NBR matrix distinctly improved the sound absorption performance of NBR/EUG composites. This work is expected to provide a new insight into the fabrication of other composite materials with controllable damping and sound absorption properties.",,1654
615,35977784,Hybridization and the Coexistence of Species.,"AbstractIt is thought that two species can coexist if they use different resources present in the environment, yet this assumes that species are completely reproductively isolated. We simulate coexistence outcomes for two sympatric species that are ecologically differentiated but have incomplete reproductive isolation. The consequences of interbreeding crucially depend on hybrid fitness. When hybrid fitness is high, just a small rate of hybridization can lead to collapse of two species into one. Low hybrid fitness can cause population declines, making extinction of one or both species likely. High intrinsic growth rates result in higher reproductive rates when populations are below carrying capacity, reducing the probability of extinction and increasing the probability of stable coexistence at moderate levels of assortative mating and hybrid fitness. Very strong but incomplete assortative mating can induce low hybrid fitness via a mating disadvantage to rare genotypes, and this can stabilize coexistence of two species at high but incomplete levels of assortative mating. Given these results and evidence that it may take many millions of years of divergence before related species become sympatric, we postulate that coexistence of closely related species is more often limited by insufficient assortative mating than by insufficient ecological differentiation.",,1655
1187,35973109,"One-year functional outcomes of patients aged 80 years or more undergoing colonic cancer surgery: prospective, multicentre observational study.","Older patients are at high risk of experiencing delayed functional recovery after surgical treatment. This study aimed to identify factors that predict changes in the level of support for activities of daily living and mobility 1 year after colonic cancer surgery. This was a multicentre, observational study conforming to STROBE guidelines. The prospective data included pre-and postoperative mobility and need for support in daily activities, co-morbidities, onco-geriatric screening tool (G8), clinical frailty scale (CFS), operative data, and postoperative surgical outcomes. A total of 167 patients aged 80 years or more with colonic cancer were recruited. After surgery, 30 per cent and 22 per cent of all patients had increased need for support and decreased motility. Multivariableanalysis with all patients demonstrated that preoperative support in daily activities outside the home (OR 3.23, 95 per cent c.i. 1.06 to 9.80, P = 0.039) was associated with an increased support at follow-up. A history of cognitive impairment (3.15, 1.06 to 9.34, P = 0.038) haemoglobin less than 120 g/l (7.48, 1.97 to 28.4, P = 0.003) and discharge to other medical facilities (4.72, 1.39 to 16.0, P = 0.013) were independently associated with declined mobility. With functionally independent patients, haemoglobin less than 120 g/l (8.31, 1.76 to 39.2, P = 0.008) and discharge to other medical facilities (4.38, 1.20 to 16.0, P = 0.026) were associated with declined mobility. Increased need for support before surgery, cognitive impairment, preoperative anaemia, and discharge to other medical facilities predicts an increased need for support or declined mobility 1 year after colonic cancer surgery. Preoperative assessment and optimization should focus on anaemia correction, nutritional status, and mobility with detailed rehabilitation plan.",,1656
1653,35968121,Characteristics and candidate genes associated with excellent stalk strength in maize (Zea mays L.).,"Lodging is a major problem in maize production, which seriously affects yield and hinders mechanized harvesting. Improving stalk strength is an effective way to improve lodging. The maize inbred line Jing2416 (J2416) was an elite germplasm in maize breeding which had strong stalk mechanical strength. To explore the characteristics its stalk strength, we conducted physiological, metabolic and transcriptomic analyses of J2416 and its parents Jing24 (J24) and 5237. At the kernel dent stage, the stalk rind penetrometer strength of J2416 was significantly higher than those of its two parents in multiple environments. The rind thickness, sclerenchyma tissue thickness, and cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents of J2416 were significantly higher than those of its parents. Based on the significant differences between J2416 and 5237, we detected metabolites and gene transcripts showing differences in abundance between these two materials. A total of 212 (68.60%) metabolites and 2287 (43.34%) genes were up-regulated in J2416 compared with 5237. The phenylpropanoid and glycan synthesis/metabolism pathways were enriched in metabolites and genes that were up-regulated in J2416. Twenty-eight of the up-regulated genes in J2416 were involved in lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose synthesis pathways. These analyses have revealed important physiological characteristics and candidate genes that will be useful for research and breeding of inbred lines with excellent stalk strength.",,1657
1759,35967977,Variation in TAS2R receptor genes explains differential bitterness of two common antibiotics.,"For pharmaceuticals to deliver their full benefits with maximum efficacy, patients need to follow recommended dosing schedules, in terms of amount and frequency. Unfortunately, the aversive taste of many drugs, especially bitterness, can reduce patient compliance in oral liquid formulations. Given common genetic differences in bitter taste receptor genes (TAS2Rs), some individuals may be at increased risk for poor compliance due to heightened bitterness that becomes a barrier to proper use. Here we report on the sensory profile of two antibiotics, chloramphenicol and ofloxacin, investigating whether bitterness intensity associates with nominally functional TAS2R variants. Participants (n = 143) rated suprathreshold intensity on a general Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS) for chloramphenicol and ofloxacin; propylthiouracil (PROP) was included as a control, given robust prior associations with TAS2R38 variants. The dominant sensation from chloramphenicol and ofloxacin was bitterness, falling just below moderate on a gLMS. TAS2R38 diplotype associated with variable bitterness of chloramphenicol and PROP, but not ofloxacin. The bitterness of ofloxacin associated with a TAS2R9 SNP (V187A). This pilot study provides novel evidence on differences in the bitterness from two antibiotics, which are associated with TAS2R variants. Improved understanding of individualized barriers to patient compliance, especially for oral formulations, can guide future efforts to optimize delivery systems for improved compliance.",,1658
2307,35967073,"Chromatographic Purification of Lithium, Vanadium, and Uranium from Seawater Using Organic Composite Adsorbents Composed of Benzo-18-Crown-6 and Benzo-15-Crown-5 Embedded in Highly Porous Silica Beads.","The use of the composite adsorbents composed of benzo-15-crown-5 (abbreviated as BC15) and benzo-18-crown-6 (BC18) for the simultaneous recovery of vanadium (V), uranium (U), and lithium (Li) from seawater has been proposed for industrial applications. The adsorption and desorption behavior of these elements on BC15 and BC18 has been examined in various types of aqueous solutions over a wide temperature range. As a result, it was shown that BC15 and BC18 have sufficient adsorption ability for the simultaneous recovery of V, U, and Li from seawater. Moreover, it was seen that the distribution coefficients (K d) of V decrease with an increase in [HCl]T (subscript T: total concentration), indicating that the anionic V species such as H2V4O13 4- are exponentially changed into the cationic V species such as V3+, VO2+, and VO2 + under the condition [HCl]T = 1.0 M, and the complexation reactions between BC15 (or BC18) and the initial V structures are inhibited. Besides, it was reasonably shown that the adsorption mechanism is the path through the electrostatic interaction between the anionic V species such as H2V4O13 4-, and the -C-O-C- single bond that the electron density is eccentrically located in ether functional groups in crown ether rings in BC15 and BC18 (or the -C-OH single bond that the electron density is eccentrically located in bisphenol A in BC15 and BC18). Then, the chromatography experiment of V, U, and Li on BC15 (or BC18) at 298 K was carried out by flowing seawater, 1.0 × 10-2 M HCl, and 1.0 M HCl in sequence. The first peak of V can be separated from the plateau of Li and the first and second peaks of U in the case of the BC15 system. The recovery ratios of V and U were more than 80%. On the other hand, entirely overlapping chromatograms were obtained in the case of the BC18 system, and accordingly, the recovery ratios of V and U were much lower. In short, the separation efficiency of V with BC15 is more pre-eminent than that with BC18. Judging from these results, the durability of BC15 was finally assessed for industrial applications, that is, the aforementioned chromatography experiment was repeatedly carried out to check whether V, U, and Li were stably and mutually separated from seawater or not. The evidence that the recovery performances of V, U, and Li from seawater do not decrease at all after at least five cycle tests was provided. This indicates that this information will be valuable for the development of a practical chromatographic technology to simultaneously recover V, U, and Li from seawater.",,1659
2318,35967060,Advances in Noble-Metal Nanoparticle-Based Fluorescence Detection of Organophosphorus Chemical Warfare Agents.,"Efficient and simple detection of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) is an essential step in minimizing the potentially lethal consequences of chemical weapons. CWAs are a family of organic chemicals that are used as chemical weapons because of their enormous severity and lethal effects when faced with unforeseen challenges. To stop the spread of CWAs, it is critical to develop a platform that detects them in a sensitive, timely, selective, and minimally invasive manner. Rapid advances in the demand for on-site sensors, metal nanoparticles, and biomarker identification for CWAs have made it possible to use fluorescence as a precise real-time and point-of-care (POCT) testing technique. For POCT-based applications, the new capabilities of micro- and nanomotors offer enormous prospects. In recent decades, significant progress has been made in the design of fluorescent sensors and the further development of noble metal nanoparticles for the detection of organophosphorus CWAs, as described in this review. Through this work, recent attempts to fabricate sensors that can detect organophosphorus CWAs through changes in their fluorescence properties have been summarized. Finally, an integrated outlook on how noble metal nanoparticles could be used to develop smart sensors for organophosphorus CWAs that communicate with and control electronic devices to monitor and improve the health of individuals.",,1660

Despite the importance, often there is a lack of knowledge, particularly among young women. This cross-sectional study aims to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and health status of young women regarding preconception health in the Italian context. From July 2020 until April 2021 a validated questionnaire (systematic review, Delphi procedure and pilot study) was administered to a sample of 340 women aged 18 to 25 years, without previous pregnancy and not planning it, attending secondary grade schools and universities. It collected information on knowledge, physical, sexual and mental health. T-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to determine a significant difference in knowledge mean score (KMS) among different groups. KMS was 67.6% (SD = 18.1). Participants with Italian nationality, enrolled in a health-field university, with a full-time job, a family income higher than 35,000 €/year and teachers or health providers as information source, had a significantly higher KMS. Only 15.9% of women who saw a gynaecologist in the last year (47.7%) asked about preconception health. 56.5% knew that folic acid is effective in reducing the risk of neural tube defects, while 5.9% was taking it. 82.3% was living in stressing environment. Gender-based discrimination at work, school or family was felt by 25.1%, while 38.2% experienced at least one type of violence.

718,35975167,Short-term ambient air pollution exposure and risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with intracardiac devices.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been causally linked to higher risk of cardiovascular disease, but the association with atrial fibrillation (AF) is less clear. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study to estimate the association between short-term air pollution levels and risk of AF episodes. The episodes were identified among patients with paroxysmal AF and an intracardiac devices able to register and store AF episodes. We obtained air pollution and temperature data from fixed monitoring stations and used conditional logistic regression to quantify the association of PM2.5, particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) with onset of AF episodes, adjusting for temperature and public holidays.. We analyzed 584 episodes of AF from 91 participants and observed increased risk of AF episodes with PM2.5 levels for the 48-72 hours lag (OR 1.05; CI [1.01,1.09] per IQR)] and 72-96 hours (OR 1.05 CI [1.00,1.10] per IQR). Our results were suggestive of an association between O3 levels and AF episodes during the warm season. We did not observe any statistically significant associations for PM10 nor NO2. Short-term increases in PM2.5 in a low-pollution level environment were associated with increased risk of AF episodes in a population with intracardiac devices. Our findings add to the evidence of a potential triggering of AF by short-term increases in air pollution levels, well below the new WHO air quality guidelines.",,1662
1618,35968233,Institutional modelling: Adding social backbone to agent-based models.,"Institutional modelling is a branch of agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) that pays special attention to the social structure by incorporating institutions into these models. Institutions, in this regard, are the rules of the system that shape individual behaviour and interaction. Institutional modelling can make use of the Institutional Grammar (IG), which has 6 pre-specified components to conceptualize institutions. The IG can be used for collecting institutional data for modelling purposes, for coding institutions, and for integrating them into different parts of an agent-based model. This modelling approach helps capture the structural complexities of social systems in agent-based models. It also supports the explanation of the emergence and dynamics of institutions, not only for better understanding institutions but also for studying social systems, especially for policy analysis.•Institutional modelling is a branch of agent-based modelling that focuses on and explicitly models the social aspects of socio-ecological-technical systems.•Institutional modelling supports theory development by enabling modellers to study institutions, and institutional change within, the systems they are embedded in.•While agent-based modelling is a bottom-up (individual-based) simulation approach, institutional modelling also incorporates top-down institutional structures and aims at studying interactions between bottom-up processes and top-down structural patterns.",,1663

Results from prospective studies with long-term follow-up can provide further evidence for dietary guideline messaging to consume nuts. Therefore, we examined the associations of walnut, other nut, and no nut consumption with diet quality and CVD risk factors over 30 years of follow-up. Data were analyzed from 3092 young adults enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Dietary intake, including walnuts and other nuts, was assessed 3 times over 20 years. CVD risk factors were measured at multiple exams. General linear regression evaluated the associations of walnut, other nut, and no nut consumption with CVD risk factors over 30 years (Y30) of follow-up. The 20-year cumulative mean intake of walnuts (0.74 oz/d), other nuts (1.6 oz/d), or no nut consumption was differentially associated with HEI-2015 and CVD risk factors by Y30. Generally, walnut consumers had significantly higher HEI-2015, lower body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, and triglyceride concentration, and gained less weight since baseline than other nut consumers (p ≤ 0.05 for all). Further, walnut consumers had lower fasting blood glucose than no nut consumers (p ≤ 0.05). Study findings that walnut and other nut consumption was associated with better CVD risk factors and diet quality aligns with the 2020-2025 US.

Supplementing a device-centered regulatory scheme with a regulatory scheme that considers A-AI products as a 'physician extender' may improve the real-world monitoring of these technologies and produce other benefits, such as increased access to the services offered by these products. In this article, we review the three approaches to the oversight of nurse practitioners, one type of physician extender, in the USA and extrapolate these approaches to produce a framework for the oversight of A-AI products. Under the framework, the US Food and Drug Administration would evaluate A-AI products and determine whether they are allowed to operate independently of physician oversight; required to operate under some physician oversight via a 'collaborative protocol' model; or required to operate under direct physician oversight via a 'supervisory protocol' model.",,1666
1445,35968453,"COVID-19 testing, infection, and vaccination among deported Mexican migrants: Results from a survey on the Mexico-U.S. border.","Migrants detained and held in immigration and other detention settings in the U.S. have faced increased risk of COVID-19 infection, but data on this population is scarce. This study sought to estimate rates of COVID-19 testing, infection, care seeking, and vaccination among Mexican migrants detained by U.S. immigration authorities and forcibly returned to Mexico. We conducted a cross-sectional probability survey of Mexican migrants deported from the U.S. to three Mexican border cities: Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and Matamoros (N = 306). Deported migrants were recruited at Mexican migration facilities after being processed and cleared for departure. A two-stage sampling strategy was used. Within each city, a selection of days and shifts were selected during the operating hours of these deportation facilities. The probability of selection was proportional to the volume of migrants deported on each day of the month and during each time period. During the selected survey shifts, migrants were consecutively approached, screened for eligibility, and invited to participate in the survey. Survey measures included self-reported history of COVID-19 testing, infection, care seeking, vaccination, intentions to vaccinate, and other prevention and risk factors. Weighted data were used to estimate population-level prevalence rates. Bivariate tests and adjusted logistic regression models were estimated to identify associations between these COVID-19 outcomes and demographic, migration, and contextual factors. About 84.1% of migrants were tested for COVID-19, close to a third were estimated to have been infected, and, among them, 63% had sought care for COVID-19. An estimated 70.1% had been vaccinated against COVID-19 and, among those not yet vaccinated, 32.5% intended to get vaccinated. Close to half (44.3%) of respondents had experienced crowdedness while in detention in the U.S. Socio-demographic (e.g. age, education, English fluency) and migration-related (e.g. type of detention facility and time in detention) variables were significantly associated with COVID-19 testing, infection, care seeking, and vaccination history. Age, English fluency, and length of detention were positively associated with testing and vaccination history, whereas detention in an immigration center and length of time living in the U.S. were negatively related to testing, infection, and vaccination history. Survey city and survey quarter also showed adjusted associations with testing, infection, and vaccination history, reflecting potential variations in access to services across geographic regions and over time as the pandemic unfolded. These findings are evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection, insufficient access to testing and treatment, and missed opportunities for vaccination among Mexican migrants detained in and deported from the U.S. Deportee receiving stations can be leveraged to reduce disparities in testing and vaccination for deported migrants. In addition, decarceration of migrants and other measures informed by public health principles must be implemented to reduce COVID-19 risk and increase access to prevention, diagnostic, and treatment services among this underserved population.",,1667
87,35983396,A Case of Bilateral Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis: More Than Meets the Eye.,"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare etiology of stroke that results from inherited and/or acquired conditions, which can present in a variety of symptoms. CVST in the setting of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rarely been observed. Herein, we present the case of a 32-year-old female with a recent history of COVID-19 subsequently found to have CVST involving bilateral transverse sinuses. Further workup demonstrated several hypercoagulable conditions, which were likely exacerbated by the viral infection. This case demonstrates an atypical outcome for young, COVID-19-positive patients, which emphasizes the importance of diligence when examining symptomatic patients with a history of COVID-19 infection. The patient was treated with apixaban therapy with radiographic resolution of bilateral CVST and improved vision.",,1668
1461,35968437,Occupational safety of janitors in Ethiopian University during COVID-19 pandemic: Results from observational study.,"Janitors are at high risk of COVID-19 infection, as they are among the frontline workers for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Poor occupational safety practices could contribute to loss of lives of janitors and the general public. However, there are no detailed investigations on occupational safety practices of janitors involved in different settings, such as universities where there are crowds of people. In addition, although observation is recognized as a better tool to investigate occupational safety practices, previous studies mainly employed self-administered questionnaires and/or face-to-face interviews as data collection mechanisms. Therefore, this study aimed to assess occupational safety practices to prevent COVID-19 transmission and associated factors among Ethiopian University janitors using an observation tool and a self-administered questionnaire. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 410 janitors of Bule Hora University (Ethiopia) from November to December, 2021. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the independent factors associated with occupational safety practices. Occupational safety practices for COVID-19 were good only among 53.9% of the janitors. Training on COVID-19 prevention measures (AOR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.57-4.37), availability of policy and protocol in the work place (AOR = 5.46; 95% CI: 3.57-8.36), and availability of soap/bleach (AOR = 2.71; 95% CI: 1.64-4.46) were found to significantly increase the likelihood of occupational safety of the janitors. A significant proportion of the janitors had poor occupational safety practices. Therefore, an adequate supply of PPE and regular training and awareness creation on COVID-19 should be strengthened. Close follow-up and regular supervision of safety procedures should also be conducted as controlling strategies.",,1669
1637,35968139,Perennials as Future Grain Crops: Opportunities and Challenges.,"Perennial grain crops could make a valuable addition to sustainable agriculture, potentially even as an alternative to their annual counterparts. The ability of perennials to grow year after year significantly reduces the number of agricultural inputs required, in terms of both planting and weed control, while reduced tillage improves soil health and on-farm biodiversity. Presently, perennial grain crops are not grown at large scale, mainly due to their early stages of domestication and current low yields. Narrowing the yield gap between perennial and annual grain crops will depend on characterizing differences in their life cycles, resource allocation, and reproductive strategies and understanding the trade-offs between annualism, perennialism, and yield. The genetic and biochemical pathways controlling plant growth, physiology, and senescence should be analyzed in perennial crop plants. This information could then be used to facilitate tailored genetic improvement of selected perennial grain crops to improve agronomic traits and enhance yield, while maintaining the benefits associated with perennialism.",,1670
1467,35968431,"Measuring, Modeling, and Forecasting the Mental Wealth of Nations.","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the deep links and fragility of economic, health and social systems. Discussions of reconstruction include renewed interest in moving beyond GDP and recognizing human capital, brain capital, mental capital, and wellbeing as assets fundamental to economic reimagining, productivity, and prosperity. This paper describes how the conceptualization of Mental Wealth provides an important framing for measuring and shaping social and economic renewal to underpin healthy, productive, resilient, and thriving communities. We propose a transdisciplinary application of systems modeling to forecast a nation's Mental Wealth and understand the extent to which policy-mediated changes in economic, social, and health sectors could enhance collective mental health and wellbeing, social cohesion, and national prosperity. Specifically, simulation will allow comparison of the projected impacts of a range of cross-sector strategies (education sector, mental health system, labor market, and macroeconomic reforms) on GDP and national Mental Wealth, and provide decision support capability for future investments and actions to foster Mental Wealth. Finally, this paper introduces the Mental Wealth Initiative that is harnessing complex systems science to examine the interrelationships between social, commercial, and structural determinants of mental health and wellbeing, and working to empirically challenge the notion that fostering universal social prosperity is at odds with economic and commercial interests.",,1671
2391,35966981,The Development of the Mesenteric Model of Abdominal Anatomy.,"Recent advances in mesenteric anatomy have clarified the shape of the mesentery in adulthood. A key finding is the recognition of mesenteric continuity, which extends from the oesophagogastric junction to the mesorectal level. All abdominal digestive organs develop within, or on, the mesentery and in adulthood remain directly connected to the mesentery. Identification of mesenteric continuity has enabled division of the abdomen into two separate compartments. These are the mesenteric domain (upon which the abdominal digestive system is centered) and the non-mesenteric domain, which comprises the urogenital system, musculoskeletal frame, and great vessels. Given this anatomical endpoint differs significantly from conventional descriptions, a reappraisal of mesenteric developmental anatomy was recently performed. The following narrative review summarizes recent advances in abdominal embryology and mesenteric morphogenesis. It also examines the developmental basis for compartmentalizing the abdomen into two separate domains along mesenteric lines.",,1672

319,35980414,Improving Uptake of Emergency Department-initiated Buprenorphine: Barriers and Solutions.,"Emergency departments (ED) are increasingly providing buprenorphine to persons with opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine programs in the ED have strong support from public health leaders and emergency medicine specialty societies and have proven to be clinically effective, cost effective, and feasible. Even so, few ED buprenorphine programs currently exist. Given this imbalance between evidence-based practice and current practice, proven behavior change approaches can be used to guide local efforts to expand ED buprenorphine capacity. In this paper, we use the theory of planned behavior to identify and address the 1) clinician factors, 2) institutional factors, and 3) external factors surrounding ED buprenorphine implementation. By doing so, we seek to provide actionable and pragmatic recommendations to increase ED buprenorphine availability across different practice settings.",,1674
1616,35968252,3DPointCaps++: Learning 3D Representations with Capsule Networks.,"We present 3DPointCaps++ for learning robust, flexible and generalizable 3D object representations without requiring heavy annotation efforts or supervision. Unlike conventional 3D generative models, our algorithm aims for building a structured latent space where certain factors of shape variations, such as object parts, can be disentangled into independent sub-spaces. Our novel decoder then acts on these individual latent sub-spaces (i.e. capsules) using deconvolution operators to reconstruct 3D points in a self-supervised manner. We further introduce a cluster loss ensuring that the points reconstructed by a single capsule remain local and do not spread across the object uncontrollably. These contributions allow our network to tackle the challenging tasks of part segmentation, part interpolation/replacement as well as correspondence estimation across rigid / non-rigid shape, and across / within category. Our extensive evaluations on ShapeNet objects and human scans demonstrate that our network can learn generic representations that are robust and useful in many applications.",,1675
975,35974644,Stochastic representation of processes with resetting.,"In this paper we introduce a general stochastic representation for an important class of processes with resetting. It allows to describe any stochastic process intermittently terminated and restarted from a predefined random or nonrandom point. Our approach is based on stochastic differential equations called jump-diffusion models. It allows to analyze processes with resetting both, analytically and using Monte Carlo simulation methods. To depict the strength of our approach, we derive a number of fundamental properties of Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting, such as the Itô lemma, the moment-generating function, the characteristic function, the explicit form of the probability density function, moments of all orders, various forms of the Fokker-Planck equation, infinitesimal generator of the process, and its adjoint operator. Additionally, we extend the above results to the case of time-nonhomogeneous Poissonian resetting. This way we build a general framework for the analysis of any stochastic process with intermittent random resetting.",,1676
2493,35966757,Molecular Thermal Motion Modulated Room-Temperature Phosphorescence for Multilevel Encryption.,"The stimulus-responsive room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have become an increasingly significant topic in the fields of bioimaging, sensing, and anticounterfeiting. However, this kind of materials is scarce to date, especially for the ones with delicate stimulus-responsive behavior. Herein, a universal strategy for multilevel thermal erasure of RTP via chromatographic separation of host-guest doping RTP systems is proposed. The tunable host-guest systems, matrix materials, heating temperature, and time are demonstrated to allow precise six-level data encryption, QR code encryption, and thermochromic phosphorescence encryption. Mechanistic study reveals that the thermal-responsive property might be attributed to molecular thermal motion and the separation effect of the silica gel, which provides expanded applications of host-guest RTP materials such as cold chain break detection. This work offers a simple yet universal way to construct advanced responsive RTP materials.",,1677
979,35974640,Fast particles overtaking shock front in two-dimensional Yukawa solids.,"High-speed particles overtaking the shock front during the propagation of compressional shocks in two-dimensional (2D) Yukawa solids are investigated using molecular dynamical simulations. When the compressional speed is lower, all particles around the shock front are almost accelerated synchronously. However, when the compressional speed is much higher, some particles penetrate the shock front to enter the preshock region. Around the shock front, it is found that the particle velocity profile at the first peak of the dispersive shock wave (DSW) is able to be described using the Gaussian distribution, so that the amplitudes of the DSW can be well characterized. As the compressional speed increases, the particle velocity corresponding to these DSW's amplitudes increase more substantially than the shock front speed. These amplitudes of the DSW are found to be able to predict the occurrence of the fast particles. Combined with the previous study of the DSW's period, it is demonstrated that the properties of the DSW are nearly not affected by the conditions of the 2D Yukawa systems, but only related to the compressional speed.",,1678
1912,35967697,The current situation and strategy of Olympic education for primary and secondary school students based on Science- Technology- Engineering- Art- Mathematics education in the context of physical literacy.,"The purpose of this paper is the influence of Science- Technology- Engineering- Art- Mathematics (STEAM) education on the Olympic education of primary and middle school students. The research object is the Beijing Olympic model school. The frame structure and educational concept of STEAM education are studied, and a questionnaire survey on the current situation of Olympic education is conducted. Finally, improvement measures based on the survey results are provided combined with STEAM education, and the teaching effect is analyzed. The results show that after the improvement of the educational model, the student's mastery of the Olympic knowledge has been greatly improved. The proportion of students who can master all knowledge increases from 5.78 to 8.45%, by 2.67%. The proportion of students with knowledge of most Olympic sports increases from 48.6 to 55.67%, by 7.07%. The proportion of students with little or no knowledge drops to 1.54%. Meanwhile, students are increasingly interested in Olympic events, especially after being inspired by the STEAM education model. The proportion of students who are very concerned about Olympic events has increased by 6.45%. The proportion of students who are more concerned about Olympic events has increased by 5.11%. Thus, the Olympic education work has achieved some results. Students gradually become interested in the Olympic events. They begin to actively pay attention to the Olympic events and learn the Olympic spirit. Then, their physical literacy is improved.",,1679
2053,35967522,Tunneled Femoral Vein Catheterization for Long-term Hemodialysis - Experience from a Tertiary Care Center.,"Tunneled femoral vein hemodialysis catheters are used when all other options for permanent vascular access or jugular central vein catheter are exhausted. There is little published literature on the outcome and survival of tunneled femoral vein catheters. Using a retrospective database, we identified all tunneled femoral dialysis catheters placed in the Nephrology department of our institute over a one-and-half year period. The outcomes, complications, and patency of these procedures was retrospectively evaluated. Out of total 21 patients, 14 were female and 7 males with a mean age of 45 (range 17-73 years) and about one-fourth had diabetes mellitus (26%). Right-sided femoral catheter insertion was performed in 18 patients (85.7%) and 3 patients underwent left-sided insertion. Technical success of placement was 100% with no immediate complications. Median follow up period was 24 days. Primary catheter patency at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days were 81, 29, 18, and 12.5%, respectively. Three patients (15.7%) developed catheter-related deep venous thrombosis. Three catheters (14.2%) were removed for catheter-related infection and seven (33.3%) were removed because of absent blood flow. Our experience with tunneled femoral catheters revealed low catheter survival and significant complications (deep venous thrombosis and malfunction/occlusion).",,1680

1434,35968464,Leveraging big data for improving the estimation of close to reality travel time to obstetric emergency services in urban low- and middle-income settings.,"Maternal and perinatal mortality remain huge challenges globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where >98% of these deaths occur. Emergency obstetric care (EmOC) provided by skilled health personnel is an evidence-based package of interventions effective in reducing these deaths associated with pregnancy and childbirth. Until recently, pregnant women residing in urban areas have been considered to have good access to care, including EmOC. However, emerging evidence shows that due to rapid urbanization, this so called urban advantage is shrinking and in some LMIC settings, it is almost non-existent. This poses a complex challenge for structuring an effective health service delivery system, which tend to have poor spatial planning especially in LMIC settings. To optimize access to EmOC and ultimately reduce preventable maternal deaths within the context of urbanization, it is imperative to accurately locate areas and population groups that are geographically marginalized. Underpinning such assessments is accurately estimating travel time to health facilities that provide EmOC. In this perspective, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of approaches commonly used to estimate travel times to EmOC in LMICs, broadly grouped as reported and modeled approaches, while contextualizing our discussion in urban areas. We then introduce the novel OnTIME project, which seeks to address some of the key limitations in these commonly used approaches by leveraging big data. The perspective concludes with a discussion on anticipated outcomes and potential policy applications of the OnTIME project.",,1682
2343,35967033,Practical and Highly Efficient Synthesis of Remdesivir from GS-441524.,"A three-step sequence for preparing remdesivir, an important anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, is described. Employing N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMF-DMA) as a protecting agent, this synthesis started from (2R,3R,4S,5R)-2-(4-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-furan-2-carbonitrile (GS-441524) and consisted of three reactions, including protection, phosphoramidation, and deprotection. The advantages of this approach are as follows: (1) the protecting group could be removed under a mild deprotection condition, which avoided the generation of the degraded impurity; (2) high stereoselectivity was achieved in the phosphorylated reaction; (3) this synthesis could be performed successively without purification of intermediates. Moreover, the overall yield of this approach on a gram scale could be up to 85% with an excellent purity of 99.4% analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).",,1683

The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the polymeric structure crystallizes in the centrosymmetric monoclinic C2/c space group. The ZnII atom is coordinated to two S and two N atoms from four crystallographically independent (L) ligands, forming zigzag chains along the [001] direction. This polymer complex forms an eight-membered [Zn-S-C-N-Zn-S-C-N] chair-like ring with two ZnII atoms and two ligand mol-ecules. On the Hirshfeld surface, the largest contributions come from the short contacts such as van der Waals forces, including H⋯H, C⋯H and S⋯H. Inter-actions including N⋯H, O⋯H and C⋯C contacts were also observed; however, their contribution to the overall stability of the crystal lattice is minor.",,1684
1122,35974497,Absorbing phase transition in a unidirectionally coupled layered network.,"We study the contact process on layered networks in which each layer is unidirectionally coupled to the next layer. Each layer has elements sitting on (i) an Erdös-Réyni network, and (ii) a d-dimensional lattice. The top layer is not connected to any layer and undergoes an absorbing transition in the directed percolation class for the corresponding topology. The critical infection probability p_{c} for the transition is the same for all layers. For an Erdös-Réyni network the order parameter decays as t^{-δ_{l}} at p_{c} for the lth layer with δ_{l}∼2^{1-l}. This can be explained with a hierarchy of differential equations in the mean-field approximation. The dynamic exponent z=0.5 for all layers and ν_{∥}→2 for larger l. For a d-dimensional lattice, we observe a stretched exponential decay of the order parameter for all but the top layer at p_{c}.",,1685
1459,35968439,Effects of traditional Chinese mind-body exercise-Baduanjin for type 2 diabetes on psychological well-being: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Type 2 diabetes is considered one of the most psychologically demanding chronic conditions. Patients suffering from this disease often have poor psychological well-being due to emotional stress. Baduanjin exercises, a traditional Chinese mind-body exercise, are used in the management of type 2 diabetes, especially for mental health. However, the effect of Baduanjin exercises on psychological well-being of patients with type 2 diabetes maintains controversial. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effects on psychological well-being of Baduanjin exercises for type 2 diabetes. Six electronic databases were searched from their inception to March 2022 for randomized controlled trials of Baduanjin exercises for type 2 diabetes. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality based on PEDro scale. The subgroup analysis was conducted based on different control interventions. The Cochran Q statistic and I 2 were applied to assess the heterogeneity. Twenty-seven studies between 2005 and 2019 were included in our review. Most of them exceeded the cutoff score 6 based on the PEDro scale. In psychological well-being, the aggregated results indicated that Baduanjin exercises showed positive effects in psychological well-being (SMD, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.36; p < 0.00001), depression (SMD, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.97; p = 0.03), anxiety (SMD, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.46; p = 0.003), and mental health (SMD, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.02; p < 0.00001). In glycemic control, Baduanjin exercises showed better improvements in FBG (SMD, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.72; p < 0.00001), HbA1c (SMD, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.75; p < 0.00001), and 2-hPBG (SMD, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.03; p = 0.02) compared with usual care/education. However, Baduanjin exercises only showed better improvements in HbA1c when compared with other exercises.

1114,35974505,Information conduction and convection in noiseless Vicsek flocks.,"Physical interactions generally respect certain symmetries, such as reciprocity and energy conservation, which survive in coarse-grained isothermal descriptions. Active many-body systems usually break such symmetries intrinsically, on the particle level, so that their collective behavior is often more naturally interpreted as a result of information exchange. Here we study numerically how information spreads from a leader particle through an initially aligned flock, described by the Vicsek model without noise. In the low-speed limit of a static spin lattice, we find purely conductive spreading, reminiscent of heat transfer. Swarm motility and heterogeneity can break reciprocity and spin conservation. But what seems more consequential for the swarm response is that the dispersion relation acquires a significant convective contribution along the leader's direction of motion.",,1688
1134,35973887,Relative validity of a glycemic index extended food-frequency questionnaire.,"The dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) are increasingly recognized as important for the prevention and management of diabetes mellitus. To extend the portfolio of assessment methods for large-scale epidemiological studies, we propose a GI-specific addition to an already established FFQ. The German version of the EPIC-FFQ was extended by GI-specific questions for major carbohydrate sources varying notably in GI (breakfast cereals, bread, pasta, rice, potato etc.). We performed relative validation analyses comparing the GI-extended FFQ to three to four 3-day weighted dietary records (3-d WDR) in 100 middle-aged individuals with diabetes mellitus participating in the German Diabetes Study (GDS). Level of agreement between the two methods was assessed by correlation and cross-classification analyses as well as Bland-Altman-Plots, conducted separately for women and men. Spearman correlation analysis for female participants suggested good agreement between the GI-extended FFQ and 3-d WDRs for energy adjusted dietary GL (r = 0.52, p = 0.0004). For both women and men, agreement with the estimations of dietary GI, GL (for men) and carbohydrates from low and higher-GI food sources from the GI-extended FFQ was acceptable (r: 0.28-0.45). Classification of the dietary GI and GL in the opposite quartile was <10% comparing the GI-extended FFQ and 3-d WDR. Bland-Altman plots suggested a tendency for an overestimation of the dietary GI from the GI-extended FFQ in the lower GI-ranges, particularly for men. Compared to the 3-d WDR, the GI-extended FFQ showed a moderate to good relative validity for parameters of carbohydrate quality.",,1689
2019,35967567,Management of neuropathic bladder secondary to spina bifida: Twenty years' experience with a conservative approach.,"Treatment of neuropathic bladder secondary to spina bifida is an ongoing challenge. Although different management strategies and protocols are available in the literature, reliance on expert opinion remains fundamental. A conservative approach can be utilized, but patients must be closely monitored throughout the management process. The objective of this study was to review the management and outcomes of neuropathic bladder in spina bifida by appraising long-term bladder and renal function in patients treated at a medical center utilizing a conservative management style. This is a single-center retrospective review of urology care for all spina bifida patients 5-19 years of age with a neuropathic bladder who attended follow-ups between April 2000 and April 2020. Only patients with more than 5 years of follow-up were included. Renal functions, continence and results of invasive video urodynamics (IUD) and any surgical interventions were recorded. Seventy-one patients (mean age = 10.5 years) were identified after exclusions. Bladder compliance between first and last IUDs increased significantly (p = 0.0056). Anticholinergic treatment was started at the first outpatient appointment. Intravesical botulinum toxin injection was the second line treatment in ten patients. 94% of patients had an end fill pressure below 40 cm H2O in their last IUD. 82% were socially continent (dry or occasional damp patches) with or without catheterisations at the age of 11.5 years. One patient in the cohort had bladder augmentation. The optimal management of neuropathic bladder secondary to spina bifida remains controversial. Bladder and renal functional outcomes can be improved with close monitoring and less invasive management.",,1690
1432,35968467,Analysis of the impact of the armed conflict in Ukraine on the population of Romania.,"The study aims to highlight the behavior of people in a state in the vicinity of a military conflict zone. Specifically, it highlights the psychological behavior of Romanian citizens after the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. It was considered appropriate to carry out this study, given the novelty of such a situation, since, after the end of the Second World War, Europe has no longer faced major problems of insecurity caused by armed conflicts of this magnitude. The study was based on the questionnaire applied to a number of 1,193 people with permanent residence in Romania and a minimum age of 18 years. The data were collected in the beginning phase of the invasion of Ukraine by the troops of the Russian Federation, i.e. between March 1-17, 2022. The aim was to obtain information that would allow the observation of re-spondents' opinions on the conflict in Ukraine and its potential escalation, and on the other hand, to allow the assessment of quality of life, using the WHQOL-BREEF measurement instrument. Based on the results of the study, the highest average satisfaction among the four domains of WHOQOL-BREF is represented by the Psychological domain, of the category of people with the lowest fear about a potential future war between Romania and the Russian Federation (83.62 ± 17.48). On the contrary, the lowest average is represented by the Environment domain, for the category of persons who do not feel protected by the fact that Romania is a NATO member state (61.77 ± 20.96). The results of the study show that the indices of the quality of life of the people in Romania, as a state in the proximity of a military conflict with the potential to escalate, are negatively influenced by the fears of people who believe that the war in Ukraine will escalate into a regional or global conflict, or that the Russian Federation is going to use its nuclear arsenal against Ukraine or another NATO member state.",,1691
2167,35967351,Belimumab in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus: A review of available data.,"Childhood systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) is a complex multisystem autoimmune disease. In 2019, belimumab was approved for the clinical treatment for cSLE, making it the only biological agent approved for cSLE children aged 5 and older in 60 years. To review emerging evidence on belimumab in cSLE published up to April 2022, so as to provide information for clinical decision-making. A comprehensive search of relevant publications up to the date of April 2022 in PUBMED, EMBASE, WOS, COCHRANE, ClinicalTrials.gov, CBM, CNKI and WANFANG was performed using the following criteria: (a) English and Chinese language studies; (b) RCT studies, cohort studies, or case-control studies; (c) patients with age <18; (d) Observational studies or case series studies contain more than 5 patients. All relevant literature was independently screened and reviewed by at least two reviewers and the obtained literature data were extracted and reviewed by two authors. Five publications met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for cSLE: one randomized controlled trial, one retrospective cohort study, and three case series. There was a high degree of heterogeneity among several studies, and the availability of baseline and outcome data provided was uneven. At present, there is a lack of high-quality clinical trials of belimumab in the treatment of cSLE. Based on the current research, it is believed that the use of belimumab can inhibit cSLE activity, reduce the dose of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, and delay kidney damage. Also it shows clinical benefit in alleviating symptoms of monogenic cSLE refractory to standard therapy. More studies are urgently needed to validate the clinical efficacy of belimumab in cSLE and to evaluate its long-term safety in pediatric populations to promote evidence-based practice.",,1692

206,35982815,High dose Radioiodine Therapy Preceded by Fertility Preservation Surgery in Metastatic Malignant Struma Ovarii: A Tale of Endurance and Prudent Management.,"Struma ovarii is a type of mature ovarian teratoma which accounts for roughly 0.5%-1% (1) of all ovarian tumours and approximately 3% of all ovarian teratomas (2). To be classified as struma ovarii, more than 50% of the tumour must be comprised of thyroid tissue (3). Malignant struma ovarii being rare, no proper guidelines exists regarding its surgical approach or postoperative management. Metastatic malignant struma ovarii, in addition to radical surgery for ovarian mass will require total thyroidectomy to facilitate high dose radioiodine therapy. Here we present the case of a newly married, nulliparous, young lady in her third decade who was diagnosed with malignant struma ovarii with metastatic deposits in fallopian tube and extensive deposits in mesentery and peritoneum., She underwent cryopreservation of embryos followed by bilateral salphingo-oopherectomy + omentectomy + stripping of peritoneum over bladder, abdominal side walls, pelvic peritoneum + appendectomy with preservation of uterus. Total thyroidectomy was done simultaneously. Subsequently she underwent high dose radioiodine therapy. Complete ablation of the residual metastatic deposits were achieved by one sitting of therapy.",,1694
44,35983569,Current and emerging biologic therapies targeting eosinophilic disorders.,"Eosinophilic disorders include a wide array of conditions in which eosinophils play a primary pathophysiologic role. While historically treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, knowledge of eosinophil biology has led to the development of several biologics targeting eosinophils. In this review, we discuss the current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved eosinophil-specific biologics targeting IL-5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab) and IL-5R (benralizumab) along with biologics under investigation targeting siglec-8 (lirentelimab). We discuss efficacy and safety data from trials of these medications in conditions including eosinophilic asthma, hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease (EGID). Additionally, we discuss case reports utilizing these medications in conditions including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and eosinophilic pneumonia, among others. While eosinophilic targeting biologic therapy has been successful in eosinophilic asthma, HES, EGPA, and CRSwNP leading to FDA approval for these conditions, trials treating EoE and EGID have been disappointing to date. Given the increasing number of trials utilizing these biologics, it will be imperative for the allergist-immunologist to stay up to date on the latest treatment options to provide the most optimal care for eosinophilic disorders.",,1695
1857,35967783,Implementation of sugar-sweetened beverages tax and its perception among public health stakeholders. A study from Poland.,"One of tools to tackle growing problem of overweight and obesity are the taxation mechanisms applied to sugar-sweetened beverages, which are expected to influence the common eating behaviors, but also they have impact on the market and public finances. The solution is therefore highly entangled in the complex of social and intersectoral interests generating a number of opportunities and threats affecting its feasibility. The study aims to depict the views of Polish stakeholders on the implementation of the sugar tax in Poland, particularly the perception of success determinants, barriers, as well as views on the features of the implemented solutions and possible alternatives. We used semi-structured interviews with 18 individuals representing key public health stakeholders in Poland. The interview consisted of four parts, where first concentrated on the advantages and disadvantages of the SSB tax, the second part explored stakeholder involvement and stances, third concerned the feasibility of the project, and in the fourth part respondents were asked for suggestions for decision-makers regarding the content of the project and its implementation process. To reconstruct position of 4 main political parties we applied desk research. We used MAXQDA v2020 to analyse the collected data. Stakeholders tend to expressed conflicting views on the effectiveness, relevance and socio-economic impact of the SSB tax. All of them agreed that the tax may appear severe for the poorest groups, children and adolescents, while disagreeing about the economic impact of the levy. The allocation of additional tax revenues was raising doubts, with stakeholders believing that the fiscal aim is the basic reason for implementing the tax, while these resources should be primarily dedicated to health promotion intervention and prevention of diet-related diseases. On the other hand, the political debate on the tax was highly superficial with strong populism arising of the presented positions. There is a need to conduct a thorough public debate and improvements in terms of public communication to increase social awareness, sealing and refining the implemented solutions. Close cooperation with market players and non-governmental organizations is highly recommended.",,1696
1423,35968477,"Effects of vaccination, new SARS-CoV-2 variants and reinfections on post-COVID-19 complications.","Post-COVID-19 complications involve a variety of long-lasting health complications emerging in various body systems. Since the prevalence of post-COVID-19 complications ranges from 8-47% in COVID-19 survivors, it represents a formidable challenge to COVID-19 survivors and the health care system. Post-COVID-19 complications have already been studied in the connection to risk factors linked to their higher probability of occurrence and higher severity, potential mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of post-COVID-19 complications, and their functional and structural correlates. Vaccination status has been recently revealed to represent efficient prevention from long-term and severe post-COVID-19 complications. However, the exact mechanisms responsible for vaccine-induced protection against severe and long-lasting post-COVID-19 complications remain elusive. Also, to the best of our knowledge, the effects of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV-2 reinfections on post-COVID-19 complications and their underlying pathogenesis remain to be investigated. This hypothesis article will be dedicated to the potential effects of vaccination status, SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, and new SARS-CoV-2 variants on post-COVID-19 complications and their underlying mechanisms Also, potential prevention strategies against post-COVID complications will be discussed.",,1697

We provide accurate empirical evidence that the mean-squared displacement of the momentum for generic perturbation parameter settings increases sublinearly in time, and that the distribution of the momentum obeys a time-fractional diffusion equation. We show that the diffusion properties in the GTM do not follow any of the known stochastic processes generating sublinear diffusion since two seemingly incompatible features, non-Markovian yet stationary, coexist in the dynamics.",,1699

858,35974865,Two PerPLEXing Cases of Hashimoto's Encephalopathy Unresponsive to Steroid and Intravenous Immunoglobulin Therapy.,"Hashimoto's encephalopathy is a nebulous entity over which much controversy exists. Often referred to as steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT), it describes a myriad of neurological sequelae that typically are observed to occur in patients with the presence of thyroid antibodies. We aim to raise clinical awareness of this seldom diagnosed entity as a potential etiology for altered mental status in patients who present with supporting clinical features and elevated thyroid antibodies. While steroid responsiveness is deemed a typical presenting feature of this medical condition, our cases aim to describe two cases that required escalation of therapy to intravenous immunoglobulins, and ultimately, plasmapheresis therapy for improvement in their clinical status. Our patients had a dramatic improvement in their mentation within three to four sessions of plasmapheresis, improving rapidly toward their baseline. Such a dramatic improvement, coupled with the corresponding reduction in their thyroid antibody titer supports the diagnosis of Hashimoto's encephalopathy and highlights the importance of having a low clinical threshold for the diagnosis of this entity in patients who, despite extensive evaluation, reveal no apparent cause for their altered mental status.",,1701
738,35975126,Long-acting paliperidone in Ekbom's syndrome in Lewy body dementia: A case report.,"Ekbom Syndrome (ES) is characterised by fixed, delusional beliefs that one's body is infested by parasites or other vermin in absence of supporting clinical evidence. Antipsychotic (AP) treatment, including long-acting injectable (LAI) AP in subjects with poor compliance, is prescribed to manage behavioural and psychotic symptomatology. We describe a 70-year-old woman who was hospitalised after experiencing new-onset delusions of infestation with visual and tactile hallucinations that led to bizarre behaviours and progressive social withdrawal. She was diagnosed with ES and was initially treated with risperidone 3 mg; however, due to poor compliance and a lack of insight, she was switched to LAI palmitate paliperidone (LAI-PP). She was followed up for 8 months, administering Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Global Assessment of Functioning, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, neurocognitive assessment, and neuroimaging. After a progressive cognitive deterioration, she was diagnosed with an ES secondary to Lewy body dementia (DLB). The LAI-PP treatment determined a complete clinical remission of psychotic symptoms despite the emergence of an iatrogenic akinetic-rigid syndrome. The delay of confirmatory neurological diagnosis, the associated risky behaviours of the patient, and poor treatment adherence led clinicians to prescribe LAI-PP following a good clinical response to oral paliperidone. However, in the case of a suspected DLB diagnosis, the prescription of an LAI-PP as a first-line strategy should be carefully evaluated.",,1702
41,35983581,Association of State COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates With Staff Vaccination Coverage and Staffing Shortages in US Nursing Homes.,"Several states implemented COVID-19 vaccine mandates for nursing home employees, which may have improved vaccine coverage but may have had the unintended consequence of staff departures. To assess whether state vaccine mandates for US nursing home employees are associated with staff vaccination rates and reported staff shortages. This cohort study performed event study analyses using National Healthcare Safety Network data from June 6, 2021, through November 14, 2021. Changes in weekly staff vaccination rates and reported staffing shortages were evaluated for nursing homes in states with mandates after the mandate announcement compared with changes in facilities in nonmandate states. An interaction between the mandates and county political leaning was considered. Data analysis was performed from February to March 2022. Weeks after announcement of a state's COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Weekly percentage of all health care staff at a nursing home who received at least 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose, and a weekly indicator of whether a nursing home reported a staffing shortage. Among 38 study-eligible states, 26 had no COVID-19 vaccine mandate for nursing home employees, 4 had a mandate with a test-out option, and 8 had a mandate with no test-out option. Ten weeks or more after mandate announcement, nursing homes in states with a mandate and no test-out option experienced a 6.9 percentage point (pp) increase in staff vaccination coverage (95% CI, -0.1 to 13.9); nursing homes in mandate states with a test-out option experienced a 3.1 pp increase (95% CI, 0.5 to 5.7) compared with facilities in nonmandate states. No significant increases were detected in the frequency of reported staffing shortages after a mandate announcement in mandate states with or without test-out options. Increases in vaccination rates in states with mandates were larger in Republican-leaning counties (14.3 pp if no test-out option; 4.3 pp with option), and there was no evidence of increased staffing shortages. The findings of this cohort study suggest that state-level vaccine mandates were associated with increased staff vaccination coverage without increases in reported staffing shortages. Vaccination increases were largest when mandates had no test-out option and were also larger in Republican-leaning counties, which had lower mean baseline vaccination rates. These findings support the use of state mandates for booster doses for nursing home employees because they may improve vaccine coverage, even in areas with greater vaccine hesitancy.",,1703
1079,35974540,Brownian motion theory of the two-dimensional quantum vortex gas.,"A theory of Brownian motion is presented for an assembly of vortices. The attempt is motivated by a realization of Dyson's Coulomb gas in the context of quantum condensates. By starting with the time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg (LG) theory, the dynamics of the vortex gas is constructed, which is governed by the canonical equation of motion. The dynamics of point vortices is converted to the Langevin equation, which results in the generalized Fokker-Planck (GFP) (or Smolkovski) equation using the functional integral on the ansatz of the Gaussian white noise. The GFP, which possesses a non-Hermitian property, is characterized by two regimes called the overdamping and the underdamping regimes. In the overdamping regime, where the dissipation is much larger that the vortex strength, the GFP becomes the standard Fokker-Planck equation, which is transformed into the two-dimensional many-particle system. Several specific applications are given of the Fokker-Planck equation. An asymptotic limit of small diffusion is also discussed for the two-vortices system. The underdamping limit, for which the vortex charge is much larger than the dissipation, is briefly discussed.",,1704
1401,35968616,Kinesiophobia and its association with functional outcome and quality of life 6-8 years after total hip arthroplasty.,"The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and severity of kinesiophobia, and to determine the relationship between Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) scores, functional outcome and quality of life (QoL) 6-8 years after Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). 161 patients (78 male and 83 female) with unilateral primary osteoarthritis (OA) treated with THA between September 2010 and December 2013 were included in this study. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) and EQ-5D scores were measured preoperatively. At 6-8 years follow-up, these scores were repeated and TSK scores were also measured. According to the TSK, patients were divided into two groups for further comparisons and analysis: without kinesiophobia (TSK-score ≤ 36) and with kinesiophobia (TSK-score >36). There were 99 patients (61.5%) with no kinesiophobia (TSK score ≤ 36, TSK mean 28.4, SD 4.7) and 62 patients (38.5%) with kinesiophobia (TSK score > 36, TSK mean 42.8, SD 5.3). Patients with and without kinesiophobia were not statistically different regarding age, sex or body mass index. (P = 0.20, P = 0.99, P = 0.22, respectively). In the group with no kinesiophobia, the mean 6-8 years WOMAC was 12.4 (SD 15.6), while the absolute delta (Δ) value between preoperative and 6-8 years WOMAC was 46.2 (SD 20.4), compared to the group with kinesiophobia where the mean 6-8 years WOMAC was 32.2 (SD 23.4), while the absolute delta (Δ) value between preoperative and 6-8 years WOMAC was 32.3 (SD 25.5): both P < 0.001. The group with no kinesiophobia had a mean 6-8 years EQ-5D of 0.81 (SD 0.22), while the absolute delta (Δ) value between preoperative and 6-8 years EQ-5D was 0.44 (SD 0.26), compared to the group with kinesiophobia where the mean 6-8 years EQ-5D was 0.57 (SD 0.23), while the absolute delta (Δ) value between preoperative and 6-8 years EQ-5D was 0.33 (SD 0.26): P < 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively. TSK scores were associated with worse WOMAC and EQ-5D scores, higher proportion of dependence on walking aids and increased THArelated adverse events (all P < 0.05). This study has shown us that there is a high incidence of kinesiophobia 6-8 years after surgery and treating kinesiophobia early after THA might improve the outcome.

580,35978507,Type 1 diabetes with immune checkpoint inhibitors: A systematic analysis of clinical trials and a pharmacovigilance study of postmarketing data.,"To estimate the risk of type 1 diabetes associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI-T1DM), and to describe its clinical features. ICI-T1DM events in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) available in electronic databases were systematically reviewed. The primary outcome was the summary risk of T1DM related to ICIs, a meta-analysis was conducted to obtain Peto odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % CIs. In pharmacovigilance study, ICI-T1DM cases were extracted from FAERs. Disproportionality analyses were performed by calculating reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information components (IC). A total of 29 RCTs (20,234 patients) were included, treatment with ICIs significantly increased the risk of all-grade ICI-T1DM (OR: 4.54, 95 % CI: 2.66-7.72), and high-grade (grade 3 or above) ICI-T1DM (OR: 4.26, 95 % CI: 2.12-8.58). No significant differences among subgroup analyses were observed: ICIs treatment schedule, tumor type, case of events (T1DM vs F-T1DM), study design (double blind vs open label) or median PFS (PFS favours ICIs vs PFS favours Control). A total of 978 case reports form FAERS was extracted, treatment with ICIs significantly increased the reporting of ICI-T1DM (n = 978; ROR = 38.45, 95 %CI:35.70-41.41; IC = 4.77, 95 %CI:4.43-5.14). In cases with available data, the median latency period was 10.4 weeks, drug interruption was recorded in 82.3 % of cases, with a positive dechallenge in 76 % of cases, and death was recorded as outcome in 3.6 % of reports. Both data from clinical trials and postmarketing suggested that ICIs was associated with increased risk of ICI-T1DM. As ICIs gain greater clinical use, practitioners must be aware of ICI-T1DM events.",,1706
613,35977786,"Multituberculate Mammals Show Evidence of a Life History Strategy Similar to That of Placentals, Not Marsupials.","AbstractThe remarkable evolutionary success of placental mammals has been partly attributed to their reproductive strategy of prolonged gestation and birthing of relatively precocial, quickly weaned neonates. Although this strategy was conventionally considered derived relative to that of marsupials with highly altricial neonates and long lactation periods, mounting evidence has challenged this view. Until now the fossil record has been relatively silent on this debate, but here we find that proportions of different bone tissue microstructures in the femoral cortices of small extant marsupials and placentals correlate with length of lactation period, allowing us to apply this histological correlate of reproductive strategies to Late Cretaceous and Paleocene members of Multituberculata, an extinct mammalian clade that is phylogenetically stemward of Theria. Multituberculate bone histology closely resembles that of placentals, suggesting that they had similar life history strategies. A stem-therian clade exhibiting evidence of placental-like life histories supports the hypothesis that intense maternal-fetal contact characteristic of placentals is ancestral for therians. Alternatively, multituberculates and placentals may have independently evolved prolonged gestation and abbreviated lactation periods. Our results challenge the hypothesis that the rise of placental mammals was driven by unique life history innovations and shed new light on early mammalian diversification.",,1707
193,35982845,A model of green investment decision making for societal well-being.,"To ensure the sustainable development, the sustainable capital market comes into picture as companies require substantial amount to develop or implement the green initiatives. The main purpose of this study is to examine the motivational factors to trust and trust to the intention to invest in the green initiatives companies among Malaysia retail investors. Partial least square modelling technique is employed to perform the data analysis. The findings suggested that the greater control as perceived by investors, the greater the trust towards investing in green initiatives companies. The element of trust appeared to be critical to encourage investors to invest in companies with green initiatives. In other words, trust has become the key component to ensure the sustainable capital among the green initiatives companies. Hence, the finding suggested the companies' management to promote the green incentive activities to create awareness among the investors. Finally, collaboration between companies and policy makers played an importance role in encouraging investment among investors towards green initiatives companies.",,1708
2033,35967553,"Cystatin C, renal resistance index, and kidney injury molecule-1 are potential early predictors of diabetic kidney disease in children with type 1 diabetes.","Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the main cause of end-stage renal disease in patients with diabetes mellitus type I (DM-T1). Microalbuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are standard predictors of DKD. However, these predictors have serious weaknesses. Our study aimed to analyze cystatin C, renal resistance index, and urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) as predictors of DKD. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2019 on a consecutive sample of children and adolescents (10-18 years) diagnosed with DM-T1. The outcome was a risk for DKD estimated using standard predictors: age, urinary albumin, eGFR, serum creatinine, DM-T1 duration, HbA1c, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI). We conducted the analysis using structural equation modeling. We enrolled 75 children, 36 girls and 39 boys with the median interquartile range (IQR) age of 14 (11-16) years and a median (IQR) duration of DM-T1 of 6 (4-9) years. The three focal predictors (cystatin C, resistance index, and urinary KIM-1) were significantly associated with the estimated risk for DKD. Raw path coefficients for cystatin C were 3.16 [95% CI 0.78; 5.53; p = 0.009, false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%], for renal resistance index were -8.14 (95% CI -15.36; -0.92; p = 0.027; FDR < 5%), and for urinary KIM-1 were 0.47 (95% CI 0.02; 0.93; p = 0.040; FDR < 5%). Cystatin C, renal resistance index, and KIM-1 may be associated with the risk for DKD in children and adolescents diagnosed with DM-T1.

2398,35966958,OpenSAFELY: Representativeness of electronic health record platform OpenSAFELY-TPP data compared to the population of England.,"Background: Since its inception in March 2020, data from the OpenSAFELY-TPP electronic health record platform has been used for more than 20 studies relating to the global COVID-19 emergency. OpenSAFELY-TPP data is derived from practices in England using SystmOne software, and has been used for the majority of these studies. We set out to investigate the representativeness of OpenSAFELY-TPP data by comparing it to national population estimates.    Methods: With the approval of NHS England, we describe the age, sex, Index of Multiple Deprivation and ethnicity of the OpenSAFELY-TPP population compared to national estimates from the Office for National Statistics. The five leading causes of death occurring between the 1st January 2020 and the 31st December 2020 were also compared to deaths registered in England during the same period.  Results: Despite regional variations, TPP is largely representative of the general population of England in terms of IMD (all within 1.1 percentage points), age, sex (within 0.1 percentage points), ethnicity and causes of death. The proportion of the five leading causes of death is broadly similar to those reported by ONS (all within 1 percentage point).  Conclusions: Data made available via OpenSAFELY-TPP is broadly representative of the English population. Users of OpenSAFELY must consider the issues of representativeness, generalisability and external validity associated with using TPP data for health research. Although the coverage of TPP practices varies regionally across England, TPP registered patients are generally representative of the English population as a whole in terms of key demographic characteristics.",,1711
1305,35970147,KARYOTYPING OF LYMPHOCYTES AND EPITHELIAL CELLS OF DISTINCT EMBRYONIC ORIGIN DOESN'T HELP TO PREDICT THE TURNER SYNDROME FEATURES.,"In Turner syndrome (TS), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) karyotyping offers an alternative to classical karyotyping. We tested the added value of FISH karyotyping from lymphocytes (mesodermal origin), buccal cells (ectodermal origin) and a rear-tongue smear (endodermal origin) to determine the 45,X cell line fraction and its impact on patient phenotype. Classical karyotyping and three FISH assays were done in 153 girls and women previously diagnosed with TS in four university hospitals. The 45,X cell line fraction was determined for each method and correlated with the major phenotypic signs. Classical karyotyping identified 45,X/46,XX mosaicism in 77/153 subjects (50%), 45,X monosomy in 52/153 (34%), and other karyotypes in 24/153 (16%). FISH from lymphocytes verified 45,X in 47/52 original cases, whereas 4/52 had 45,X/46,XX and 1/52 45,X/47,XYY mosaicism. The 45,X cell line fraction was higher in FISH from lymphocytes compared to classical karyotyping (median 86.4% versus 70.0%; p<0.001), while there was no difference for FISH from buccal or rear-tongue smear cells. The mean 45,X cell line fraction was more abundant in patients with several of the characteristic phenotypic signs compared to patients without them (p<0.01), but the predictive power was insufficient. FISH analysis confirmed the findings of classical karyotyping; only a few 45,X monosomy cases were reclassified as mosaics. The 45,X cell line fraction did not show clinically meaningful prediction of the phenotype. FISH analysis of buccal or rear-tongue epithelial cells may be a non-inferior, less invasive alternative to classical karyotyping.",,1712
1427,35968472,"A cross-sectional study to assess the epidemiological situation and associated risk factors of dengue fever; knowledge, attitudes, and practices about dengue prevention in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan.","Dengue fever has been responsible for around 12 countrywide large outbreaks in Pakistan, resulting in 286,262 morbidities and 1,108 deaths. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) is the most recently impacted province. This study aimed to investigate the molecular, epidemiological, and potential elements that contribute to increasing dengue transmission patterns, and knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward dengue in KP province. This cross-sectional community-based study was conducted (June-December, 2021) in two phases. Phase I involved the epidemiological (n = 5,242) and molecular analysis of DENV in 500 randomly collected blood samples of the 2021 dengue outbreak in KP. Phase II focused on assessing dengue-KAP levels in healthy communities (n = 14,745, aged >18 years), adopting a cross-sectional clustered multistage sampling in eight districts (dengue-hotspot vs. non-hotspot) of KP. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis were applied. Peshawar district had the highest dengue cases (60.0%) associated with the predominant co-circulation of DENV-2 (45.8%) and DENV-3 (50.4%) serotypes. A rise in cases was reported in October (41.8%) followed by September (27.9%) and August (14.4%; p < 0.001). Males (63.7%, p < 0.001) and individuals aged 16-30 years (37.0%, p < 0.001) were highly affected. General workers (18.0%), families with a monthly income of 10,000-20,000 Pak rupees (50.5%), unmarried (71.0%), uneducated (31%), families with higher human density (>10 individuals per household), and those (29.0%) who faced power outages for more than 7/24 h were the most affected. Moreover, co-morbidities like renal failure and bronchial asthma were associated with disease severity. A community survey on KAP revealed that an average of 74, 60, and 43% of the participants demonstrated good knowledge, attitudes, and dengue preventive practices, respectively. Multiple poor socioeconomic elements are influencing dengue fever transmission in the province. Higher KAP levels may explain the low frequency of dengue in non-hotspot districts. Our study emphasizes the need for effective and long-term public health education, strengthened vector surveillance, and expanded laboratory capacity for better diagnosis and management of dengue cases to better predict the burden and seasonality of disease in the country.",,1713
1943,35967666,Status and strategies of college English teaching using adaptive deep learning from the perspective of multiculturalism.,"The aim is to deeply understand the current situation of College English Teaching (CET). By consulting the theories of Deep Learning (DL) and Edge Computing (EC), this work designs a Questionnaire Survey (QS) to understand the current situation of college English learning and teaching. Then, Adaptive Deep Learning (ADL) and EC are introduced into CET. Finally, the corresponding conclusions and suggestions are drawn. Specifically, the purpose and time of college students' vocabulary learning are investigated. The results suggest that students' English vocabulary learning is shallow. They have not really mastered the meaning and usage of vocabulary. Simultaneously, teachers' vocabulary teaching methods are analyzed from three aspects: root affixes, vocabulary collocation, or repeated reading and memory. The teaching method is excellent from the teacher's perspective but far from perfect from the students' perspective. Introducing ADL and EC into CET enhances students' class concentration time, homework submission efficiency, and academic performance. More than half of the students believe that the new teaching method introducing ADL and EC can make them more confident and motivated in English learning. Therefore, it has great reference significance for applying ADL and EC in CET.",,1714

1097,35974522,Helical flow states in active nematics.,"We show that confining extensile nematics in three-dimensional (3D) channels leads to the emergence of two self-organized flow states with nonzero helicity. The first is a pair of braided antiparallel streams-this double helix occurs when the activity is moderate, anchoring negligible, and reduced temperature high. The second consists of axially aligned counter-rotating vortices-this grinder train arises between spontaneous axial streaming and the vortex lattice. These two unanticipated helical flow states illustrate the potential of active fluids to break symmetries and form complex but organized spatiotemporal structures in 3D fluidic devices.",,1716
658,35975829,The bond valence model as a prospective approach: examination of the crystal structures of copper chalcogenides with Cu bond valence excess.,"Bond valence analysis has been applied to various copper chalcogenides with copper valence excess, i.e. where the formal valence of copper exceeds 1. This approach always reveals a copper bond valence excess relative to the unit value, correlated to an equivalent ligand bond valence deficit. In stoichiometric chalcogenides, this corresponds to one ligand electron in excess per formula unit relative to the valence equilibrium considering only CuI. This ligand electron in excess is 50/50 shared between all or part of the Cu-atom positions, and all or part of the ligand-atom positions. In Cu3Se2, only one of the two Cu positions is involved in this sharing. It would indicate a special type of multicentre bonding (`one-electron co-operative bonding'). Calculated and ideal structural formulae according to this bond valence distribution are presented. At the crystal structure scale, Cu-ligand bonds implying the single electron in excess form one-, two- or three-dimensional subnetworks. Bond valence distribution according to two two-dimensional subnets is detailed in covellite, CuS. This bond valence description is a formal crystal-chemical representation of the metallic conductivity of holes (mixing between Cu 3d bands and ligand p bands), according to published electronic band structures. Bond valence analysis is a useful and very simple prospective approach in the search for new compounds with targeted specific physical properties.",,1717
831,35974940,Challenges of the Medical Ethics PhD curriculum in Iran: A qualitative study.,"Bioethics is the foundation of medical practices, and can be applied in the different levels of medicine. In Iran, Medical Ethics started to be taught in the form of PhD course in Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) in 2007. Although many aspects of this plan are successfully implemented, some deficits also are frequently pointed out by many professors and students. The purpose of this study was to recognize the deficits and weaknesses of the current curriculum. This study was a qualitative descriptive type which was conducted based on semi-structured deep interview with open questions. The sample population of this research was composed of faculty members in Medical Ethics department of TUMS, students and graduates of PhD in Medical Ethics and also, the experts who worked on codification of the initial curriculum. Overall, eleven individuals were interviewed. In general, Practical application, Feeling the Need, Professional Doctorate, Human Sciences, Paramedical, Possible, Impossible, Defining the Discipline Nature, Student Attraction, Professor, Training, Evaluation Procedure, Student Admission, Educational Content, Teaching Method, :Student Evaluation, and Course Management were the main themes. With regard to the deficiencies in Medical Ethics training and also, the problems identified through interviews, it seems that a great deal of problems are possible to solve if Medical Ethics is considered an interdisciplinary field instead a monodisciplinary one. One of the main purposes in interdisciplinary fields is investigating, analyzing and introducing measures for issues and problems that cannot be known and solved by a single discipline.",,1718

813,35974985,Comparing Vector-Borne Disease Surveillance and Response in Beijing and the Netherlands.,"Climate change, environmental change, and globalization affect the geographical distribution of vector-borne diseases. Temperate regions should be prepared for emerging diseases and learn from each other's experiences. The vector-borne disease preparedness in two regions, Beijing and the Netherlands, were compared in order understand their similarities and differences leading to learning points on this complex topic. A comparative study was performed using interviews with vector-borne disease experts from Beijing and the Netherlands and supplemented by literature. In Beijing, syndromic surveillance is a priority for the identification of suspected vector-borne disease cases. In the Netherlands, the main surveillance emphasis is on laboratory confirmed vector-borne disease cases. Vector-surveillance at potential points of entry and other high-risk locations is performed according to the International Health Regulation (2005) in both settings. Beijing controls invasive and native mosquitos, which is not the case in the Netherlands. In Beijing, vector surveillance is performed to measure mosquito density around hospitals, this is not observed in the Dutch setting. Health risks posed by ticks are a priority in urban areas in the Netherlands, and the public is educated in self-protection. In contrast, ticks seem to occur less often in Beijing's urban areas. The vector-borne disease context framework allowed us to compare the vector-borne disease preparedness between Beijing and the Netherlands, despite differences in vector-borne disease challenges. We can learn valuable lessons concerning surveillance and early detection of emerging vector-borne diseases when comparing the preparedness between different regions.",,1720
1958,35967649,The interplay of ADHD characteristics and executive functioning with the GPA and divergent thinking of engineering students: A conceptual replication and extension.,"Characteristics of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and executive functioning difficulties have been found to correspond with poorer academic outcomes on the one hand and enhanced divergent thinking on the other hand. The current study was conducted to better understand the relationship between ADHD characteristics, executive functioning difficulties, divergent thinking, and academic outcomes by conceptually replicating and expanding on a previous study. Undergraduate engineering students (N = 199) at a public university in the northeastern United States completed self-report measures of ADHD characteristics and daily executive functioning, as well as divergent thinking (figural and verbal) and intelligence quotient (IQ) tests. The results of a series of multiple regression models showed that (1) executive functioning difficulties negatively, and non-verbal IQ and figural divergent thinking positively, predicted engineering grade point average (GPA; obtained from the university registrar's office), (2) GPA and verbal IQ positively predicted figural divergent thinking scores, and (3) verbal IQ positively predicted verbal divergent thinking scores. A series of multiple regression models testing the assertion that controlling for IQ would strengthen the relationship between divergent thinking and ADHD characteristics or executive functioning were not supported but did show associations between select components of characteristics and divergent thinking. Taken together, these results support previous conclusions that students with ADHD characteristics and executive functioning difficulties may struggle academically yet exhibit select enhanced divergent thinking abilities.",,1721
652,35975835,Formation of contact and multiple cyclic cassiterite twins in SnO2-based ceramics co-doped with cobalt and niobium oxides.,"Contact and multiple cyclic twins of cassiterite commonly form in SnO2-based ceramics when SnO2 is sintered with small additions of cobalt and niobium oxides (dual doping). In this work, it is shown that the formation of twins is a two-stage process that starts with epitaxial growth of SnO2 on CoNb2O6 and Co4Nb2O9 seeds (twin nucleation stage) and continues with the fast growth of (101) twin contacts (twin growth stage). Both secondary phases form below the temperature of enhanced densification and SnO2 grain growth; CoNb2O6 forms at ∼700°C and Co4Nb2O9 at ∼900°C. They are structurally related to the rutile-type cassiterite and can thus trigger oriented (epitaxial) growth (local recrystallization) of SnO2 domains in different orientations on a single seed particle. While oriented growth of cassiterite on columbite-type CoNb2O6 grains can only result in the formation of contact twins, the Co4Nb2O9 grains with a structure comparable with that of corundum represent suitable sites for the nucleation of contact and multiple cyclic twins with coplanar or alternating morphology. The twin nucleation stage is followed by fast densification accompanied by significant SnO2 grain growth above 1300°C. The twin nuclei coarsen to large twinned grains as a result of the preferential and fast growth of the low-energy (101) twin contacts. The solid-state diffusion processes during densification and SnO2 grain growth are controlled by the formation of point defects and result in the dissolution of the twin nuclei and the incorporation of Nb5+ and Co2+ ions into the SnO2 matrix in the form of a solid solution. In this process, the twin nuclei are erased and their role in the formation of twins is shown only by irregular segregation of Co and Nb to the twin boundaries and inside the cassiterite grains, and Co,Nb-enrichment in the cyclic twin cores.",,1722
1195,35972081,Initial Experience With the NICO Myriad Device for Minimally Invasive Endoscopic Evacuation of Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke for which there is no consensus treatment. Although open craniotomy has been explored as a surgical treatment option, multiple minimally invasive (MIS) techniques have been developed including endoscopic evacuation. An adjunctive aspiration device can be used through the working channel to provide an additional degree of freedom and increased functionality regarding clot manipulation and morcellation. To report our single-center technical experience with the Myriad device used as an adjunctive aspiration device during endoscopic ICH evacuation in an exploratory case series. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic data were collected on patients who underwent MIS endoscopic ICH evacuation using the Myriad aspiration device from December 2018 to March 2019. Eight patients underwent ICH evacuation with the Myriad aspiration device. Bleeding was confined to the cortex in 4 patients, subcortical region in 2 patients, and the cerebellum in 2 patients. One of the cerebellar cases also underwent suboccipital craniotomy. The mean preoperative hematoma volume was 65.1 ± 68.9 mL, and the median postoperative volume was 7.6 ± 9.0 mL, for an average evacuation percentage of 88.1% ± 12.1%. In 75% of the cases, a bleeding vessel was identified and treated with either cautery or irrigation alone. There was no hemorrhagic recurrence or mortality within 30 days. Data from this initial experience suggest that MIS endoscopic ICH evacuation with the NICO Myriad aspiration device is feasible and technically effective. Multicenter exposure is necessary to verify broader applicability.",,1723
684,35975527,Methylation of DNA Repair Genes as a Prognostic Biomarker in AML of a TCGA-LAML Cohort.,"Dysregulation of DNA damage response and altered DNA methylation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been reported, but the impact of methylation of DNA repair genes has not yet been researched. We aimed to predict the prognosis of non-APL AML patients based on the known CpG site methylation levels of DNA repair genes through The Cancer Genome Atlas AML project (TCGA-LAML). We utilized TCGA-LAML cohort (174 non-APL AML) for the methylation data of 22 DNA repair genes. In univariate analysis among 174 non-APL AML patients of the TCGA-LAML cohort, the hypermethylation of MLH1, RAD51, and ATM showed superior overall survival (OS) than non-hypermethylated groups, while hypermethylation of RAD23A, RAD23B, MLH1, MSH2, BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD50, and PARP1 was associated with poor OS. We demonstrated that CpG hypermethylation levels of DNA repair genes differed according to the AML cytogenetic risk groups. In multivariate analysis, hypermethylation of MLH1 and RAD51 showed better OS than non-hypermethylated patients, but hypermethylation of MSH2 and RAD50 showed worse OS than non-hypermethylated patients. Methylation of 4 DNA repair genes, such as MLH1, RAD51, MSH2, and RAD50, have the potential to be independent risk factors in non-APL AML patients.",,1724
1420,35968481,Prevalence of hyperuricemia and the population attributable fraction of modifiable risk factors: Evidence from a general population cohort in China.,"Data on updated hyperuricemia prevalence in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region in China, which is one of the world-class urban agglomerations, is sparse. Overweight/obesity, alcohol consumption, smoking and sedentary behavior are modifiable risk factors (MRFs) for elevated serum uric acid (SUA), but their population attributable fractions (PAFs) for hyperuricemia is still unclear. Using baseline data from the BTH Physical Examination General Population Cohort, we calculated the crude- and adjusted-prevalence of hyperuricemia based on the 30,158 participants aged 18-80 years. Hyperuricemia was defined as SUA >420 μmol/L in men and >360 μmol/L in women, or currently use of uric acid lowering drugs. Overweight/obesity, alcohol consumption, smoking and sedentary behavior were considered as MRFs and their adjusted PAFs were estimated. The prevalence of hyperuricemia was 19.37%, 27.72% in men and 10.69% in women. The PAFs and 95% confidence intervals for overweight, obesity were 16.25% (14.26-18.25%) and 12.08% (11.40-12.77%) in men, 13.95% (12.31-15.59%) and 6.35% (5.97-6.74%) in women, respectively. Alcohol consumption can explain 4.64% (2.72-6.56%) hyperuricemia cases in men, but with no statistical significance in women. Cigarette smoking contributed to 3.15% (1.09-5.21%) cases in men, but a much lower fraction in women (0.85%, 0.49-1.22%). Compared with sedentary time <2 h per day, the PAFs of 2-4 h, 4-6 h, and more than 6 h per day were 3.14% (1.34-4.93%), 6.72% (4.44-8.99%) and 8.04% (4.95-11.13%) in men, respectively. Sedentary time was not found to be associated with hyperuricemia in women. These findings concluded that hyperuricemia is prevalent in this representative Chinese adult general population with substantial sex difference. Four MRFs (overweight/obesity, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking and sedentary behavior) accounted for a notable proportion of hyperuricemia cases. The PAF estimations enable the exploration of the expected proportion of hyperuricemia cases that could be prevented if the MRFs were removed, which warrants the public health significance of life-style intervention.",,1725
553,35978581,Influence of amorphous carbon interlayers on nucleation and early growth of lithium metal at the current collector-solid electrolyte interface.,"Nucleation and early growth of Li metal is critical to the performance of anode-free solid-state batteries. We report the use of amorphous carbon deposited by direct current magnetron sputtering as an intermediate layer between the Cu current collector and the Lipon solid electrolyte. The density, conductivity, and microstructure of the carbon interlayer are varied and their influence on the reversible formation and removal of the Li metal anode is investigated. It is shown that thin films of amorphous carbon act as seed layers, reducing the overpotential for Li plating and increasing the critical current density for Li plating and stripping from 2 up to 8 mA cm-2. It is further demonstrated that the ionic conductivity of the Li ions in the carbon interlayers determines their optimum thickness to be 100 nm or less, and that the initial Li loss due to interphase formation can be reduced to a few tens of nm by decreasing the density of the carbon films.",,1726
545,35978604,"Final Results of TACTICS: A Randomized, Prospective Trial Comparing Transarterial Chemoembolization Plus Sorafenib to Transarterial Chemoembolization Alone in Patients with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.","Several clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus molecular-targeted agents versus TACE alone revealed no clinical benefits in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). Here, we report the final OS analysis from the TACTICS trial, which previously demonstrated significant improvement in PFS with TACE plus sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (NCT01217034). Patients with unresectable HCC were randomized to a TACE plus sorafenib group (N = 80) or a TACE alone group (N = 76). Patients in the combination treatment group received sorafenib 400 mg once daily for 2-3 weeks before TACE, followed by 800 mg once daily during on-demand conventional TACE sessions until time to untreatable progression. In this trial, TACE-specific PFS was used. TACE-specific PFS is defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, and PD was defined as untreatable progression, caused by the inability of a patient to further receive or benefit from TACE for reasons that include intrahepatic tumor progression (25% increase vs. baseline) according to response evaluation criteria in cancer of the liver, the detection of extrahepatic spread, vascular invasion, or transient deterioration of liver function to Child-Pugh C after TACE. At the cut-off date of July 31, 2020, 131 OS events were observed. The median OS was 36.2 months with TACE plus sorafenib and 30.8 months with TACE alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.861; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.607-1.223; p = 0.40, ΔOS, 5.4 months). The updated PFS was 22.8 months with TACE plus sorafenib and 13.5 months with TACE alone (HR = 0.661; 95% CI, 0.466-0.938; p = 0.02). Post-trial treatments with active procedures/agents were received by 47 (58.8%) patients in the TACE plus sorafenib group and 58 (76.3%) in the TACE alone group (p = 0.01). In post hoc analysis, PFS and OS benefit were shown in HCC patients with tumor burden beyond up-to-7 criteria. In TACTICS trial, TACE plus sorafenib did not show significant OS benefit over TACE alone; however, clinical meaningful OS prolongation and significantly improved PFS was observed. Thus, the TACE plus sorafenib can be considered a choice of treatment in intermediate-stage HCC, especially in patients with high tumor burden. Trial Registration: NCT01217034.",,1727
1428,35968471,The worst thing that has happened to me: Healthcare and social services professionals confronting death during the COVID-19 crisis.,"This study analyzes the subjective emotional impact COVID-19 deaths have had on healthcare, social services, and funeral services professionals, it explores the different implications, and analyzes the different reactions of health and social care professionals and funeral professionals to the volume of deaths. This work is based on a qualitative, phenomenological, and interpretative approach through in-depth interviews with 42 informants, including 36 social and healthcare professionals, as well as 6 family members of those who died from COVID-19 in Madrid. The interviews were processed through a qualitative, interpretative, categorical analysis. Healthcare professionals were overexposed to a significant number of deaths under dramatic circumstances. Many of these professionals had difficulties processing their experiences and expressed the need for psychological help. The fact that certain professionals had previous exposure to high mortality rates was not a protective factor. Some coping differences were seen between healthcare professionals and professionals dedicated to the care of the deceased (undertakers or firemen), particularly in the degree to which they personalized the care they provided. The overexposure to death with the circumstances that existed during the state of emergency had a significant emotional impact on the professionals, which can lead to mental health problems in the near term.",,1728
2443,35966853,It's about the patients: Practical antibiotic stewardship in outpatient settings in the United States.,"Antibiotic-resistant pathogens cause over 35,000 preventable deaths in the United States every year, and multiple strategies could decrease morbidity and mortality. As antibiotic stewardship requirements are being deployed for the outpatient setting, community providers are facing systematic challenges in implementing stewardship programs. Given that the vast majority of antibiotics are prescribed in the outpatient setting, there are endless opportunities to make a smart and informed choice when prescribing and to move the needle on antibiotic stewardship. Antibiotic stewardship in the community, or smart prescribing as we suggest, should factor in antibiotic efficacy, safety, local resistance rates, and overall cost, in addition to patient-specific factors and disease presentation, to arrive at an appropriate therapy. Here, we discuss some of the challenges, such as patient/parent pressure to prescribe, lack of data or resources for implementation, and a disconnect between guidelines and real-world practice, among others. We have assembled an easy-to-use best practice guide for providers in the outpatient setting who lack the time or resources to develop a plan or consult lengthy guidelines. We provide specific suggestions for antibiotic prescribing that align real-world clinical practice with best practices for antibiotic stewardship for two of the most common bacterial infections seen in the outpatient setting: community-acquired pneumonia and skin and soft-tissue infection. In addition, we discuss many ways that community providers, payors, and regulatory bodies can make antibiotic stewardship easier to implement and more streamlined in the outpatient setting.",,1729
606,35977855,Contrast Enhanced Mammography in Routine Clinical Practice: Frequency and Malignancy Rates of Enhancing Otherwise Occult Findings.,"In routine clinical practice, contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) examinations identify enhancing findings seen only on subtraction images that have no low-energy mammographic or sonographic correlate. The purpose of this study is to report the frequency and malignancy rates of enhancing findings seen only on subtraction images in a tertiary care breast imaging practice. Consecutive review of CEM exams from December 2015 to May 2020. Chi square tests were used to determine associations between cancer diagnosis and clinical characteristics of enhancing findings seen only on subtraction images, P < .05 indicating a statistically significant difference. Four percent (100/2464) of CEM examinations identified 108 enhancing findings seen only on subtraction images. Twenty of those CEM enhancing findings were directly managed as a multifocal disease. Of those further evaluated with MR, 23% (19/78) with associated MR correlates were treated surgically as presumed multicentric or multifocal disease following multidisciplinary review. The remaining 76% (59/78) of enhancing findings were seen only on subtraction images, these included: 20% (12/59) and downgraded to benign on MR 80% (47/59) with suspicious findings which underwent MR vacuum assisted breast biopsy yielding: 26% (12/47) malignancy, 9% (4/47) high risk, and 66% (31/47) benign diagnoses. Enhancing findings seen on subtraction only CEM images are seen in 4% of cases in clinical practice. MR correlation can help characterize CEM findings to: (1) avoid unnecessary biopsy for benign findings, and (2) guide tissue sampling or empiric surgical planning for suspicious findings.",,1730
2003,35967584,Clinical presentation of pediatric patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in a single center in Mexico City.,"The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is broad, from asymptomatic to severe cases and death. The objective of this study is to analyze the clinical course of patients attended during the first months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a third-level pediatric hospital. Design: prospective cohort study. Patients with viral respiratory disease or suspected cases of COVID-19 were evaluated at the Pediatric Hospital, National Medical Center XXI Century, Mexico City, from 21 March 2020 to 13 January 2021. Statistical analysis: Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used for comparisons; a logistic regression model was constructed to identify clinical or laboratory characteristics associated with critical disease. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 697 patients met the operational definition of viral respiratory disease or suspected cases of COVID-19 and underwent real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 testing. Patients with a positive result were included. Of the 181 patients (26%), 121 (66.8%) had mild disease and were treated as outpatients and 60 (33.1%) were hospitalized. A total of six patients met the criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Of the 60 inpatients, 65% were males, and 82% had one or more comorbidities. The main comorbidities were cancer (42%) and overweight (15%). The median hospital stay was 9 days. The inpatients had a higher frequency of fever, general malaise, dyspnea, chills, polypnea, and cyanosis than the outpatients (p < 0.05). Only 21.4% of the outpatients had one or more comorbidities, which were lower than in the hospitalized patients (p < 0.001). Laboratory data at admission were similar between critically ill and those with moderate and severe disease. The patients who developed pneumonia were at higher risk of critical disease, while older age was associated with a better prognosis. A total of 13 of the 60 inpatients died (mortality 7.1%). All but one had one or more comorbidities: four had cancer, four congenital heart disease, one chronic kidney disease and epilepsy, one Epstein-Barr virus-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, one obesity, and one diabetes mellitus. Hospital mortality is high, especially in children with comorbidities. Despite 2 years having passed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the epidemiological and clinical data on children are still helpful to improve their prognosis.",,1731
1269,35971346,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Survivors in Early Pandemic: A Single Healthcare System Retrospective Study.," Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) management in the intensive care unit (ICU) has attracted strong interest since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our retrospective study aims to describe the outcomes and predictors of mortality of ARDS associated with COVID-19 within one university-based healthcare system.  We identified 165 patients within our healthcare system during the months of April 2020 through July 2020, who were admitted to our medical ICUs and eligible for our study. Baseline patient characteristics, ICU and hospital course information, ICU interventions, ventilator settings, and hospital complications were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques.  Our cohort had an average age of 64. No significant difference in mortality was identified with male vs. female gender or BMI. Most of the patient cohort was identified as black (68.2%). The overall mortality of our cohort was 38.2%. Hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were all associated with higher mortality. There was a significant difference in mortality between those with higher observed ventilator plateau pressures at 24 hours and higher driving pressures at 24 hours.  COVID-19-associated ARDS is associated with significant mortality. Physicians should be aware of pre-existing conditions potentially related to worse outcomes so that they receive an appropriate level of care in a timely manner. Ventilator management should focus on maintaining low intra-thoracic pressure changes. Prospective studies are needed to guide COVID-19-associated ARDS management.",,1732
1933,35967676,Hierarchy and diffusion of organizational forms.,"In this paper we first of all summarize and rationalize current typologies of organizational forms, arranging available classifications in a hierarchy of increasing generality. The ensuing structure parallels the classification of living beings into classes of increasing generality such as species, genus, family, order, and so on. Subsequently, we analyze the structure of communications that favored the diffusion of each organizational form. We isolate a few stylized communication structures, pointing to the presence of several sources endowed with global connections as the most efficient diffusion mode. The empirical research that is being carried out on single organizations is close to observing their T-patterns, whereas nothing comparable is in sight for organizational forms as yet. However, at least in some cases, we dare to formulate tentative hypotheses on certain features that the ensuing T-patterns-of-patterns might exhibit.",,1733
703,35975298,Experiences of health care personnel with promoting a sense of home for older adults living in residential care facilities: a qualitative systematic review.,"The objective of this review was to evaluate the experiences of health care personnel with promoting a sense of home for older adults living in residential care facilities. Moving to a residential care facility represents a critical moment for older adults. It disrupts the continuity of their lives and distances them from significant people and objects. Health care personnel working in residential care facilities can help create a sense of home for residents. There is a lack of qualitative reviews reporting health care personnel's experiences with promoting a sense of home for older adults living in residential care settings. Qualitative studies exploring the experiences of health care personnel with promoting a sense of home for people aged 65 and older living in residential care facilities, including, but not limited to, nursing homes, residential care homes, retirement homes, assisted-living facilities, and skilled nursing facilities. This review followed a meta-aggregation approach according to JBI methodology for systematic reviews of qualitative evidence. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and ILISI databases were searched, as well as Google Scholar, OpenGrey, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. Studies published in English, Italian, French, Portuguese, or Spanish were considered. Study selection, critical appraisal, data extraction, and data synthesis were conducted by two independent reviewers using the JBI approach and JBI standardized tools. Finally, the ConQual approach was used to assess the confidence level in the study findings. Seven studies conducted in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, or the Netherlands between 2014 and 2020 were included. The studies reported the experiences of nurses, nurse aides, and directors of facilities. From the aggregation of 69 findings, 14 categories were generated that were then grouped into three synthesized findings describing the experiences of health care personnel as follows: the promotion of residents' sense of home in residential care facilities is influenced by i) the built environment, including private, single rooms with bathrooms, homelike-domestic spaces, personalization of residents' rooms, homelike interior and exterior design, and non-hospital-like environment; ii) the national and local policy and regulations, and work organization, as well as leadership of managers and directors; and 3) the facilities' care culture, including philosophy of care, maintaining autonomy of residents and ties with the community, participation in domestic and recreational activities, and family relationships. Based on ConQual scores, the confidence level in the synthesized findings was graded as low. According to health care personnel, the physical environment, interpersonal and social aspects, regulations, work organization, and facilities' care culture can contribute to creating a sense of home for older adults in residential care facilities. The evidence derived from this review can help health care personnel, facility directors, and policy-makers identify the changes that should be implemented to promote a sense of home in older adults residing in care facilities.

This case report describes a patient who was advised to proceed with digital amputation following the traumatic segmental bone loss with a non-salvageable distal interphalangeal joint surface complicated by osteomyelitis but refused amputation and requested alternative treatment. We suggested and performed the Masquelet procedure and arthrodesis to salvage the digit. The first stage consisted of surgical debridement and placement of an antibiotic cement spacer, and the second stage included the replacement of the antibiotic cement spacer with an iliac crest autograft and arthrodesis eight weeks after the primary procedure. The Masquelet technique led to the resolution of osteomyelitis, successful osseous union, finger ray salvage, and distal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis.",,1735
509,35978750,Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in a Patient With Multiple Sclerosis: A Case Report.,"Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare neurodegenerative condition and a human prion disease. Rapid progressive dementia, myoclonus, visual disturbances, cerebellar signs, and pyramidal/extrapyramidal symptoms are observed in such patients. However, these are non-specific symptoms and can manifest in a variety of other conditions. The occurrence of sporadic CJD in a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS) is rare. This is the case of a 54-year-old man on natazulimab for MS who developed rapid neurocognitive changes along with visual changes, imbalance issues, and mood changes. Diagnosis of sporadic CJD (sCJD) was confirmed through clinical features, physical examination and electroencephalogram findings, cerebral spinal fluid analysis, and later magnetic resonance imaging findings. sCJD with MS being a rare phenomenon, its recognition requires a high index of suspicion, careful chronological evaluation of the patient's symptoms, and relevant investigations that can aid in reaching the diagnosis.",,1736
1826,35967814,Dregs of Cardamine hupingshanensis as a feed additive to improve the egg quality.,"Natural plant herbs have many active compounds to prevent poultry diseases and improve poultry products. However, most herbs are supplied for human medicine. Thus, for economic and sustainable development purposes, the dregs of Cardamine hupingshanensis (DCH) were developed as a feed additive to improve the egg quality of laying hens in this work. Results showed that the contents of selenium in hen serum and eggs were increased under DCH feeding. Subsequently, DCH also promotes the antioxidant capacity and immunity of laying hens through the increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) by ELISA detection. Finally, production performance and egg quality were further graded by monitoring the product condition and scoring the indexes of egg quality, which also displayed that DCH as a feed additive significantly improved the egg quality by enhancing yolk color, eggshell thickness, and egg shape index.",,1737
629,35977222,Association Between Self-reported Health-Related Social Needs and Acute Care Utilization Among Older Adults Enrolled in Medicare Advantage.,"There is increased focus on identifying and addressing health-related social needs (HRSNs). Understanding how different HRSNs relate to different health outcomes can inform targeted, evidence-based policies, investments, and innovations to address HRSNs. To examine the association between self-reported HRSNs and acute care utilization among older adults enrolled in Medicare Advantage. This cross-sectional study used data from a large, national survey of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries to identify the presence of HRSNs. Survey data were linked to medical claims, and regression models were used to estimate the association between HRSNs and rates of acute care utilization from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019. Self-reported HRSNs, including food insecurity, financial strain, loneliness, unreliable transportation, utility insecurity, housing insecurity, and poor housing quality. All-cause hospital stays (inpatient admissions and observation stays), avoidable hospital stays, all-cause emergency department (ED) visits, avoidable ED visits, and 30-day readmissions. Among a final study population of 56 155 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 74.0 [5.8] years; 32 779 [58.4%] women; 44 278 [78.8%] White; and 7634 [13.6%] dual eligible for Medicaid), 27 676 (49.3%) reported 1 or more HRSNs. Health-related social needs were associated with statistically significantly higher rates of all utilization measures, with the largest association observed for avoidable hospital stays (incident rate ratio for any HRSN, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.35-1.74; P < .001). Compared with beneficiaries without HRSNs, beneficiaries with an HRSN had a 53.3% higher rate of avoidable hospitalization (incident rate ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.35-1.74; P < .001). Financial strain and unreliable transportation were each independently associated with increased rates of hospital stays (marginal effects of 26.5 [95% CI, 14.2-38.9] and 51.2 [95% CI, 30.7-71.8] hospital stays per 1000 beneficiaries, respectively). All HRSNs, except for utility insecurity, were independently associated with increased rates of ED visits. Unreliable transportation had the largest association with increased hospital stays and ED visits, with marginal effects of 51.2 (95% CI, 30.7-71.8) and 95.5 (95% CI, 65.3-125.8) ED visits per 1000 beneficiaries, respectively. Only unreliable transportation and financial strain were associated with increased rates of 30-day readmissions, with marginal effects of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.0%-4.0%) and 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.6%), respectively. In this cross-sectional study of older adults enrolled in Medicare Advantage, self-reported HRSNs were common and associated with statistically significantly increased rates of acute care utilization, with variation in which HRSNs were associated with different utilization measures. These findings provide evidence of the unique association between certain HRSNs and different types of acute care utilization, which could help refine the development and targeting of efforts to address HRSNs.",,1738
1065,35974554,Stokes traction on an active particle.,"The mechanics and statistical mechanics of a suspension of active particles are determined by the traction (force per unit area) on their surfaces. Here we present an exact solution of the direct boundary integral equation for the traction on a spherical active particle in an imposed slow viscous flow. Both single- and double-layer integral operators can be simultaneously diagonalized in a basis of irreducible tensorial spherical harmonics and the solution, thus, can be presented as an infinite number of linear relations between the harmonic coefficients of the traction and the velocity at the boundary of the particle. These generalize Stokes laws for the force and torque. Using these relations we obtain simple expressions for physically relevant quantities such as the symmetric-irreducible dipole acting on, or the power dissipated by, an active particle in an arbitrary imposed flow. We further present an explicit expression for the variance of the Brownian contributions to the traction on an active colloid in a thermally fluctuating fluid.",,1739
48,35983540,The disease-specific clinical trial network for primary ciliary dyskinesia: PCD-CTN.,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder characterised by impaired mucociliary clearance leading to irreversible lung damage. In contrast to other rare lung diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), there are only few clinical trials and limited evidence-based treatments. Management is mainly based on expert opinions and treatment is challenging due to a wide range of clinical manifestations and disease severity. To improve clinical and translational research and facilitate development of new treatments, the clinical trial network for PCD (PCD-CTN) was founded in 2020 under the framework of the European Reference Network (ERN)-LUNG PCD Core. Applications from European PCD sites interested in participating in the PCD-CTN were requested. Inclusion criteria consisted of patient numbers, membership of ERN-LUNG PCD Core, use of associated standards of care, experience in PCD and/or CF clinical research, resources to run clinical trials, good clinical practice (GCP) certifications and institutional support. So far, applications from 22 trial sites in 18 European countries have been approved, including >1400 adult and >1600 paediatric individuals with PCD. The PCD-CTN is headed by a coordinating centre and consists of a steering and executive committee, a data safety monitoring board and committees for protocol review, training and standardisation. A strong association with patient organisations and industrial companies are further cornerstones. All participating trial sites agreed on a code of conduct. As CTNs from other diseases have demonstrated successfully, this newly formed PCD-CTN operates to establish evidence-based treatments for this orphan disease and to bring new personalised treatment approaches to patients.",,1740

In the last 5 years, per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has proved highly successful in treating primary achalasia over the long term, but its long-term performance has not been certified by achalasia related to Triple A syndrome. Triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by adrenocorticotropic hormone-resistant adrenal insufficiency, alacrima and achalasia. In the past 5 years, POEM has proved highly successful in treating primary achalasia over the long term, but its long-term performance has not been certified by achalasia related to Triple A syndrome. Eckardt scores and esophageal manometry improved significantly during the 2 years following POEM; however, grade-A reflux esophagitis recurred in 66.7% of patients in 12 mo post-procedure. Based on these case studies, POEM is efficacious and safe for a treatment of achalasia associated with Triple A syndrome.",,1741
1311,35970097,Awake together: Sociopsychological processes of engagement in conspiracist communities.,"Research on conspiracy theories tends to frame conspiracy believers as isolated individuals falling prey to irrational beliefs caused by a variety of pathological traits and cognitive shortcomings. But evidence is accumulating that conspiracy theory believers are also linked together in social movements capable of effectively coordinated collective action. We propose that conspiracy theory beliefs evolve over time, as part of a process of increasing disengagement from mainstream groups, and concomitant engagement in a community of like-minded individuals, capable of coordinated collective action. This approach allows portraying extreme conspiracism as attractive not despite its apparent irrationality, but precisely because of it. As such, conspiracy theories could not only be conceived as beliefs but also as social signals advertising a subversive counter-elite posture.",,1742
839,35974932,Intake of food groups and cervical cancer in women at risk for cervical cancer: A nested case-control study.,"The risk of cervical cancer was reported to be influenced by dietary components. This study aimed to illustrate the association between cervical cancer with the intake of food groups in women with a history of cervical neoplasia. This nested case-control study was conducted in 558 people with a history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), including 279 women with cervical cancers and 279 controls with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). A validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess the intake of food groups. The intake of fruits and vegetables in the case group was significantly lower than the control group (P=0.001). Low intake of dairy products, vegetables, and fruits was associated with cervical cancer risk (OR=4.67; 95% CI 1.2-9.49, P=0.001; OR=9.75, 95% CI 1.36-19. 51, P=0.001; and OR=4.82, 95% CI 1.09-7.25, P=0.001, respectively). After adjusting for age, family history, age at first menstruation, number of children, history of vaginal infection, and age at first sexual intercourse, the results were still significant. Additional adjustments to BMI did not change the results. The results indicate that the risk of cervical cancer can be affected by the intake of certain food groups. Further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine the underlying mechanism of the influence of dietary components on cervical cancer risk.",,1743
742,35975108,The Mesentery in Robot-Assisted Total Mesorectal Excision.,"In recent decades, surgery for rectal cancer has evolved from an operation normally performed under poor vision with a lot of blood loss, relatively high morbidity, and mortality to a safer operation. Currently, minimally invasive rectal procedures are performed with limited blood loss, reduced morbidity, and minimal mortality. The main cause is better knowledge of anatomy and adhering to the principle of operating along embryological planes. Surgery has become surgery of compartments, more so than that of organs. So, rectal cancer surgery has evolved to mesorectal cancer surgery as propagated by Heald and others. The focus on the mesentery of the rectum has led to renewed attention to the anatomy of the fascia surrounding the rectum. Better magnification during laparoscopy and improved optimal three-dimensional (3D) vision during robot-assisted surgery have contributed to the refinement of total mesorectal excision (TME). In this chapter, we describe how to perform a robot-assisted TME with particular attention to the mesentery. Specific points of focus and problem solving are discussed.",,1744
1248,35971367,Virtual Trauma Meeting as a Component of Undergraduate Orthopaedic Education.,"Virtual teaching has proven effective for medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is the first to describe an undergraduate orthopaedic teaching strategy in the format of virtual trauma meetings (VTM). Clinical medical students from the Universities of Bristol and Cardiff were invited to attend five VTM between October and November 2020. These were delivered by consultants and speciality doctors via Zoom software. An 11-item feedback form was distributed after each session to assess the relevance of teaching material, student confidence in asking and answering questions, and if students would benefit from further sessions. Several open-ended questions were designed to evaluate aspects of the session that were most useful, which orthopaedic topics were of high priority and if they had any suggestions for improvement. Our initial aim was to assess student acceptance of the virtual format. Several months later pre-recorded material was uploaded onto YouTube and post hoc questionnaires were analysed. A total of 50 students attended, with a median of 11±6 attending per session, producing a total of 26 feedback responses. Among the responders, there were 10 males and nine females and 63% of the students were in their third year. 100% of students felt comfortable asking questions and 96% felt comfortable answering questions. X-ray interpretation and management of fractures were the highest priority subjects. The majority of students considered the interaction between senior and junior doctors most valuable, and the most common improvement suggested was the inclusion of polls or OSCE-styled questions. VTM could be a useful resource to enhance undergraduate trauma and orthopaedic (T&O) education by providing student-focused material in an open learning environment.",,1745

One case was treated with marginal excision without requiring bone excision; the second patient required amputation of the first ray; and the third patient, with advanced disease, required amputation through Chopart's joint. Metatarsalgia is a recurrent reason for consultation in orthopaedics. Even so, patients with persistent symptoms should be studied further in depth. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can detect tumor pathology, such as SS, of insidious development.",,1746
486,35978869,"Inflammation, microbiome and colorectal cancer disparity in African-Americans: Are there bugs in the genetics?","Dysregulated interactions between host inflammation and gut microbiota over the course of life increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). While environmental factors and socio-economic realities of race remain predominant contributors to CRC disparities in African-Americans (AAs), this review focuses on the biological mediators of CRC disparity, namely the under-appreciated influence of inherited ancestral genetic regulation on mucosal innate immunity and its interaction with the microbiome. There remains a poor understanding of mechanisms linking immune-related genetic polymorphisms and microbiome diversity that could influence chronic inflammation and exacerbate CRC disparities in AAs. A better understanding of the relationship between host genetics, bacteria, and CRC pathogenesis will improve the prediction of cancer risk across race/ethnicity groups overall.",,1747
1526,35968360,Cases report: MRI findings of asymptomatically familial subependymal heterotopia with filamin A gene abnormality.,"Subependymal heterotopia (SEH) is a rare neuronal migration disorder consisting of gray matter nodules along the lateral ventricular walls and is often associated with other brain malformations. Despite most SEH cases showing epilepsy during their lifetimes, very few patients with asymptomatically familial SEH tend to cause misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. We present four familial SEH cases without any positive symptoms and medical history, including two fetuses, who were diagnosed by MRI and confirmed by genetic testing with mutation of filamin A. This report emphasizes the role of MRI in the recognition of SEH at an early age of gestation and in asymptomatically familial SEH. MRI provides a fast, repeatable, reliable, and cheap choice for detecting and screening familial SEH.",,1748
1957,35967650,The influence of gratitude on pre-service teachers' career goal self-efficacy: Chained intermediary analysis of meaning in life and career calling.,"The aim of the study was to explore the relationship among gratitude, meaning in life (MIL), career calling, and career goal self-efficacy (CGSE) of the pre-service teachers in the Free Teacher Education program in China and the internal mechanism of action. In this study, gratitude, MIL, career calling, and CGSE questionnaires were used to investigate 801 pre-service teachers. IBM SPSS 25.0 and AMOS 24.0 were used for data processing, and SPSS macro program Model 6 was used for the mediating mechanism. (1) Gratitude was positively correlated with MIL and career calling. MIL was positively correlated with career calling. Gratitude, MIL, and career calling were significantly and positively associated with CGSE. (2) Gratitude influences pre-service teachers' CGSE mainly through the independent intermediary of MIL and career calling, and the chain intermediary of MIL→career calling, three indirect effects. Gratitude indirectly predicts CGSE of pre-service teachers not only through the independent intermediary of MIL and career calling but also through the chain intermediary of MIL and career calling.",,1749
2440,35966856,Sulfonylureas or biguanides is associated with a lower risk of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with diabetes: A nationwide cohort study.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with immune dysregulation, while sulfonylureas or biguanides have been linked to anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to examine the occurrence rate of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among DM patients and its incidence rate between different treatments. This cohort study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 1997 and 2013 to evaluate the primary outcomes of the preventive role of sulfonylureas or biguanides in the development of RA. We used the Chi-square test for categorical variables and Cox proportional hazard regression and log-rank test to explore the time for development of RA in DM patients. Logistic regression was adopted to estimate the odds ratio of RA in different dosages of medication exposure. Our cohort study included 94,141 DM cases. The risk of RA development of non-sulfonylureas/biguanides users among the DM group in each analysis was set as the reference, and the adjusted hazard ratio of RA in DM patients who were using sulfonylureas or biguanides was 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.60-0.90). Within 1 year before the index date, compared with no-biguanides users, patients with more than 180 days of prescription of biguanides had a significantly lower RA risk. Similarly, the significantly lower risk of RA was still observed in DM patients who had more than 365 days of prescription of sulfonylurea within 2 or 3 years before the index date of first RA visit (all p < 0.05). Our data suggest that sulfonylureas or biguanides are associated with a lower rate of RA development in patients with DM; the effect of biguanides appeared more rapid than that of sulfonylureas, but the sulfonylureas might have a longer effect on lowering RA development incidence.",,1750
101,35983382,The Impacts of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages (SSB) on Cardiovascular Health.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been a prominent global health challenge in the last decade, and many risk factors and outcomes of CVD have been studied in that timeframe. Recent research has explored the association between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and CVD; however, there is a lack of updated reviews regarding SSB consumption impacts on CVD outcomes and the possible mechanisms affecting the disease state. In turn, this review aims to summarize the relevant published research from the last decade regarding linkages between SSB consumption and CVD outcomes and the potential underlying mechanisms, as well as to highlight opportunities for future exploration with respect to those outcomes and mechanisms. In this review, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles published from January 2012 to March 2022 regarding SSB consumption and its association with CVD. The results of our search reveal strong evidence that the consumption of SSB is positively associated with increased risks of CVD and that the magnitude of that risk is increased in a dose-dependent manner. These increased risks range from elevated triglyceride levels to inclined risk of CVD-related mortality. Although the depth of the mechanisms responsible for these increased risks have been less explored thus far, there is some evidence supporting SSB implications in cardiovascular factors, including vascular function, coronary artery calcification, triglyceride levels, inflammatory processes, arterial stiffness, and genetic polymorphisms.",,1751
1132,35973891,Real-World Persistence and Time to Next Treatment With Ibrutinib in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma Including Patients at High Risk for Atrial Fibrillation or Stroke.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a recognized adverse consequence associated with all Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL); however, real-world time to discontinuation (TTD) and time to next treatment (TTNT) of CLL/SLL patients with a high baseline AF/stroke risk remain unknown. Patients with CLL/SLL from a nationwide electronic health record-derived database (February 12, 2013-January 31, 2021) initiating first-line (1L) or second or later-line (2L+) treatment with ibrutinib or other regimens on or after February 12, 2014 (index date) were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess TTD and TTNT among all patients, patients with high AF risk (CHARGE-AF risk score ≥10.0%), and patients at high risk of stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc risk score ≥3 [females] or ≥2 [males]). In 1L/2L+, 2190/1851 patients received ibrutinib and 4388/4135, were treated with other regimens. Median TTD for ibrutinib was similar regardless of AF/stroke-related risk (1L: all patients, 15.7 months; high AF risk, 11.7 months; high stroke risk, 13.7 months; similar results in 2L+). Median TTNT was significantly longer for ibrutinib vs. other regimens (1L: not reached vs. 45.9 months; 2L+: not reached vs. 23.6 months; both P < .05), including among those with high AF/stroke risk. TTNT was similar between all patients and high-risk cohorts in 1L and 2L+ (all P > .05). This study highlights that elevated baseline AF/stroke-related risk does not adversely impact TTD and TTNT outcomes associated with ibrutinib use. Additionally, TTNT was significantly longer for patients treated with ibrutinib vs. other regimens.",,1752
96,35983387,Facial Nerve Anomalies as an Obscure Co-occurrence With External Ear Malformations: A Case Report.,"This study reports an infant with a rare triad of congenital facial palsy, bilateral aural atresia, and middle ear malformations. We highlight the audiological test battery in detail that led to identifying this obscure co-occurrence in a 6-month-old infant. The challenges associated with identifying such rare conditions, especially in infants, can be overcome only by incorporating a meticulous and vigilant approach. The infant was subjected to a series of subjective and objective audiological evaluations, through which rare asymmetric facial grimaces were vigilantly observed. This observation warranted radiologic investigation, which confirmed the suspicion that the anomaly may not be restricted to auditory structures alone. As facial nerve anomalies were confirmed, diversified recommendations, including speech, language, and swallow evaluation, were made apart from the auditory management. Hence in cases of external ear anomalies, although rare, it is essential to rule out facial nerve abnormalities as they can be a concealed problem.",,1753
1381,35969066,Preparation of Contiguous Bisaziridines for Regioselective Ring-Opening Reactions.,"Aziridines, a class of reactive organic molecules containing a three-membered ring, are important synthons for the synthesis of a large variety of functionalized nitrogen-containing target compounds through the regiocontrolled ring-opening of C-substituted aziridines. Despite the tremendous progress in aziridine synthesis over the past decade, accessing contiguous bisaziridines efficiently remains difficult. Therefore, we were interested in synthesizing contiguous bisaziridines bearing an electronically diverse set of N-substituents beyond the single aziridine backbone for regioselective ring-opening reactions with diverse nucleophiles. In this study, chiral contiguous bisaziridines were prepared by organocatalytic asymmetric aziridination of chiral (E)-3-((S)-1-((R)-1-phenylethyl)aziridin-2-yl)acrylaldehyde with N-Ts-O-tosyl or N-Boc-O-tosyl hydroxylamine as the nitrogen source in the presence of (2S)-[diphenyl(trimethylsilyloxy)methyl]pyrrolidine as a chiral organocatalyst. Also demonstrated here are representative examples of regioselective ring-opening reactions of contiguous bisaziridines with a variety of nucleophiles such as sulfur, nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen, and the application of contiguous bisaziridines to the synthesis of multi-substituted chiral pyrrolidines by Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation.",,1754
439,35979141,Push-pull organic dyes and dye-catalyst assembly featuring a benzothiadiazole unit for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production.,"In this work, we report the design and the preparation of two new dyes and a molecular dyad for the photoelectrochemical hydrogen production from water in a dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPEC). We designed dyes that include a benzothiadiazole (BTD) and an indacenodithiophene (IDT) units, and we obtained a new molecular dyad by covalent coupling with the cobalt diimine-dioxime catalyst. The introduction of the benzothiadiazole core in the structure improves the absorption properties and leads to an extension of the spectrum in the visible range up to 650 nm. The photoelectrochemical properties of the new dyad were evaluated on pristine and lithium-doped NiO electrodes. We demonstrate that increasing the light harvesting efficiency of the dyad by introducing a IDT-BTD chromophore is clearly beneficial for the photoelectrochemical activity. We also demonstrate that lithium doping of NiO, which improves the electronic conductivity of the mesoporous film, leads to a significant increase in performance, in terms of TON and F.E., more than doubled with our new dyad. This BTD-based molecular system outperforms the results of previously reported dyads using the same catalyst.",,1755
653,35975834,The tetrel bonding role in supramolecular aggregation of lead(II) acetate and a thiosemicarbazide derivative.,"A new PbII coordination complex [PbL(OAc)], which was readily synthesized from a mixture of Pb(OAc)2·3H2O and 1-(pyridin-2-yl)benzylidene-4-phenylthiosemicarbazide (HL) is reported. The crystal structure analysis of [PbL(OAc)] showed that the PbII cation is N,N',S-chelated by the tridentate pincer-type ligand L and by the oxygen atoms of the acetate anion. In addition, the metal centre forms Pb...O and Pb...S tetrel bonds with an adjacent complex molecule, yielding a 1D zigzag polymeric chain, which is reinforced by N-H...O hydrogen bonds and π...π interactions. These chains are interlinked by C-H...py non-covalent interactions, realized between one of the acetate hydrogen atoms and the pyridine rings. According to the Hirshfeld surface analysis, the crystal packing is mainly characterized by intermolecular H...H, H...C and H...O contacts, followed by H...N, H...S, C...C, C...N, Pb...H, Pb...O and Pb...S contacts. The FTIR and 1H NMR spectra of [PbL(OAc)] testify to the deprotonation of the parent ligand HL, while the acetate ligand exhibits an anisobidentate coordination mode as established by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy. Lastly, theoretical calculations at the PBE0-D3/def2-TZVP level of theory have been used to analyze and characterize the Pb...O and Pb...S tetrel bonds observed in the crystal of [PbL(OAc)], using a combination of QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules) and NCIPlot (Non-Covalent Interaction Plot) computational tools.",,1756

2413,35966883,Exploring public values through Twitter data associated with urban parks pre- and post- COVID-19.,"Since school and business closures due to the evolving COVID-19 outbreak, urban parks have been a popular destination, offering spaces for daily fitness activities and an escape from the home environment. There is a need for evidence for parks and recreation departments and agencies to base decisions when adapting policies in response to the rapid change in demand and preferences during the pandemic. The application of social media data analytic techniques permits a qualitative and quantitative big-data approach to gain unobtrusive and prompt insights on how parks are valued. This study investigates how public values associated with NYC parks has shifted between pre- COVID (i.e., from March 2019 to February 2020) and post- COVID (i.e., from March 2020 to February 2021) through a social media microblogging platform -Twitter. A topic modeling technique for short text identified common traits of the changes in Twitter topics regarding impressions and values associated with the parks over two years. While the NYC lockdown resulted in much fewer social activities in parks, some parks continued to be valued for physical activity and nature contact during the pandemic. Concerns about people not keeping physical distance arose in parks where frequent human interactions and crowding seemed to cause a higher probability of the coronavirus transmission. This study demonstrates social media data could be used to capture park values and be specific per park. Results could inform park management during disruptions when use is altered and the needs of the public may be changing.",,1758
1711,35968059,Advancing nursing in Italy through the development and evaluation of an innovative postgraduate programme in Family and Community Nursing - A pilot study.,"Due to the impact on the public health systems of the ageing and the increasing frailty of the population, the European Union and the World Health Organisation have emphasised how family and community nurses (FCNs) could play an important role in supporting the ageing process through prevention, promotion, and protection in the territory. This study describes the first experience in Italy of a one-year postgraduate blended-learning master course divided into 5 modules for FCNs piloted as part of the EuropeaN curriculum for fAmily aNd Community nursE (ENhANCE) 2018-2020 project, funded by the European Commission. The 5 modules focused on: Epidemiology and Prevention (14 ECTS); Fundamentals of care (19 ECTS); Organisational Models and Priority Health Problems (12 ECTS); Communication Models and Continuity of Care (5 ECTS); and Nursing Research (10 ECTS). Participants included a total of 45 students and 23 lecturers and a team of clinical tutors. The Italian pilot course for the FCNs proved to be a successful example of innovative teaching methods using blended didactic methods, which enabled participants to achieve high-standard learning outcomes and competencies in the field of family and community nursing. The pilot course is well suited to preparing competent family and community nurses to meet the growing healthcare needs of the population. Therefore, we have planned to replicate this course to increase the workforce of family and community nurses, who through their healthcare services aimed at prevention, promotion and protection, will ensure high quality services to the public and consequently relieve the burden on acute hospitals.",,1759
1020,35974599,Nonmonotonic heat dissipation phenomenon in close-packed hotspot systems.,"Transient heat dissipation in close-packed quasi-two-dimensional nanoline and three-dimensional nanocuboid hotspot systems is studied based on the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. It is found that, counterintuitively, the heat dissipation efficiency is not a monotonic function of the distance between adjacent nanoscale heat sources but reaches the highest value when this distance is comparable to the phonon mean free path. This is due to the competition of two thermal transport processes: quasiballistic transport when phonons escape from the nanoscale heat source and the scattering among phonons originating from the adjacent nanoscale heat source.",,1760
1604,35968280,Clinical Features Differ Between Patients With Vertigo Attack Only and Weakness Attack Accompanying Vertigo Before Vertebrobasilar Stroke: A Retrospective Study.,"To determine the different clinical features of patients with vertigo attacks alone and of those with weakness accompanying vertigo attacks before the vertebrobasilar ischemic stroke. In this 4-year retrospective study, we manually screened the medical records of 209 patients, hospitalized with vertigo attack as the main complaint who were finally diagnosed with acute vertebrobasilar ischemic stroke. Patients were divided into two groups according to their symptoms: patients who only experienced vertigo attacks prior to the vertebrobasilar stroke (VO group) and patients who had both vertigo and weakness attacks (VW group) prior to the stroke. Clinical parameters, such as infarction site and volume, relative risk factors, ABCD2 score, and medical intervention, were compared between the two groups. The prevalence of hypertension was higher in the Vertigo attacks only (VO) group (42.2 vs. 29.0%, p < 0.05). The total cerebral infarction volume in the VO group was larger than the Vertigo and weakness attacks (VW) group (4.44 vs. 2.12 cm3, p < 0.05). Additionally, the cerebellum was more likely to be affected in the VO group. In contrast, patients in the VW group had higher carotid stenosis (14.2 vs. 27.2%, p < 0.05) and ABCD2 score (2.1 ± 1.2 vs. 3.6 ± 1.5, p = 0.02). The percentage of patients with medullary infarctions also increased in the VW group. Vertigo attack events occurred more frequently in the VW group (median 2.4 vs. 4.3, p < 0.04). We also found that the patients in the VW group were more likely to seek medical intervention after vertigo. Clinical parameters, such as infarction location, relative risk factors, and ABCD2 score, differed between patients with vertigo symptoms with or without weakness attacks. These findings highlight the different clinical features of patients with vertigo attack only and those with weakness attacks accompanying vertigo prior to vertebrobasilar ischemic stroke.",,1761
1940,35967669,"Mental Representation of Word Family Structure: The Case of German Infinitives, Conversion Nouns and Other Morphologically Related Forms.","This study investigates how two non-finite forms, infinitives and conversion nouns, are represented in the mind of L1 and L2 speakers and what is their relationship to other members of the corresponding word family. German native speakers and proficient German learners with Czech as L1 participated in four overt priming experiments involving a grammatical judgement task. We investigated the relationship between infinitives (Experiment 1) and conversion nouns (Experiment 2) and formally identical verbal or noun forms. We further focussed on the relationship between conversion nouns and regular nominal derivation forms with two derivational suffixes: -er and -ung (Experiments 3 and 4). Our results show that the two non-finite forms differ in their relations to other members of a word family and do not constitute a special class of non-finites as suggested in previous literature. While German infinitives seem to be closer related to finite verbal forms, conversion nouns behave in the same way as other regular nominal derivatives within the same word family. As for the German L1 and L2 contrast, no significant difference in the mental representation of the examined forms was found. This finding suggests that with respect to the explored phenomena, proficient learners rely on the same linguistic organisation as L1 speakers.",,1762

The sub-Saharan region of Africa bears a disproportionate burden of infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS. Needle and syringe programs have been shown to be effective in preventing transmission of infections among injection drug users by providing them with sterile injection equipment. The programs may also serve as avenues for addressing other issues that affect injection drug users. This review will consider published and unpublished studies on needle and syringe programs as a method of preventing blood-borne infections among injection drug users in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, systematic reviews and text and opinion papers will be considered for inclusion in the review. The electronic databases to be searched include MEDLINE, African Journals Online (AJOL), CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Embase, and TRoPHI. We will search for studies in English with no date limit as well as sources of unpublished studies and gray literature (conference abstracts, theses, etc). Data extraction will be done by two independent reviewers guided by an extraction tool developed by the reviewers. Key information, such as author, reference, and findings relevant to the review questions will be obtained. The results will be presented as graphs, figures, and tables accompanied by a narrative summary.",,1764
151,35983232,BEtarget: A versatile web-based tool to design guide RNAs for base editing in plants.,"CRISPR-dependent base editors enable direct nucleotide conversion without the introduction of double-strand DNA break or donor DNA template, thus expanding the CRISPR toolbox for genetic manipulation. However, designing guide RNAs (gRNAs) for base editors to enable gene correction or inactivation is more complicated than using the CRISPR system for gene disruption. Here, we present a user-friendly web tool named BEtarget dedicated to the design of gRNA for base editing. It is currently supported by 46 plant reference genomes and 5 genomes of non-plant model organisms. BEtarget supports the design of gRNAs with different types of protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM) and integrates various functions, including automatic identification of open reading frame, prediction of potential off-target sites, annotation of codon change, and assessment of gRNA quality. Moreover, the program provides an interactive interface for users to selectively display information about the desired target sites. In brief, we have developed a flexible and versatile web-based tool to simplify complications associated with the design of base editing technology. BEtarget is freely accessible at https://skl.scau.edu.cn/betarget/.",,1765

2436,35966860,Liver fibrosis progression in a cohort of young HIV and HIV/ HBV co-infected patients: A longitudinal study using non-invasive APRI and Fib-4 scores.,"The risk of liver fibrosis increases over time in HIV and HIV-HBV individuals even under antiretroviral treatment (ART), warranting a rigorous and periodic monitorization. Given the lower availability of transient elastography, we aimed to assess the longitudinal variation of two non-invasive liver fibrosis scores, APRI and Fib-4, in cases with HIV monoinfection, HIV-HBV co-infection and individuals with HBsAg-seroclearance. We performed an observational retrospective study between 2013 and 2019 on 212 HIV patients including 111 individuals with HIV mono-infection, 62 individuals with HIV-HBV co-infection and positive HBsAg and 39 cases with HIV-HBV infection and HBsAg-loss. The groups were followed at 36, 48, and 60 months. Liver fibrosis was indicated by an APRI >0.5 or Fib-4≥1.45 score and advanced fibrosis by an APRI score >1.5 or Fib-4 >3.25. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to assess the predictors for the presence of liver fibrosis over time. During a median follow-up of 58.5 months the prevalence of liver fibrosis in all patients increased with 0.5% reaching 11.3% using an APRI score and with 0.9% reaching 10.8% using the Fib-4 score. At the visit corresponding to 60 months the prevalence of liver fibrosis was higher in all HIV-HBV patients compared with individuals with HIV mono-infection, namely: 16.1% on APRI and 12.9% on the Fib-4 score in HIV-HBV/HBsAg-positive individuals, 12.8% on both APRI and Fib-4 scores in HIV-HBV/HBsAg-negative individuals vs. 8.1 and 9%, respectively in HIV mono-infection. The presence of liver fibrosis over the study period was independently associated with plasma HIV RNA, CD4+T cell counts, HIV-HBV co-infection (for APRI >0.5) and ART non-adherence (for Fib-4 >1.45). At the final visit, non-adherence to ART and CD4+T cell counts remained associated with liver fibrosis. The study found a slow progression of APRI and Fib-4 scores over time in young PLWH with extensive ART. Liver fibrosis scores continued to increase in patients with HIV mono-infection yet remained lower than in HIV-HBV patients irrespective on the presence of HBsAg. The periodic follow-up using non-invasive scores on the long-term could help improve the surveillance in low-income settings and high scores should be followed by additional diagnostic methods.",,1767
1283,35970739,45 years' experience with early childhood anatomical technique of feminising genitoplasty for 46 XX Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia -observations of vaginal introital anatomy and its relationship to the perineal body.,"In Manchester, feminising genitoplasty is offered to children with 46XX Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) when there is a single perineal opening and/or enlarged clitoris. Our aims are to describe the anatomical reconstructive technique and present long-term outcomes. Our hypothesis is that 'the common channel (CC) length and distance to the vagina from perineal skin is mostly due to virilisation and hypertrophy of perineal tissue over the almost normally positioned vaginal introitus (V-I) in relation to the perineal body (PB)'. METHOD AND RESULTS: This is a retrospective notes review of all consecutive 46XX CAH operations from 1976 to December 2021. 99 patients, who had feminising genitoplasty and being followed-up, were included. 15 patients who were lost to follow up were excluded. Median age at surgery was 15 months. In 91, midline division of the labia majora, spongiosum, bulbo-spongiosus muscle (BSM) and CC down to PB was performed. This was sufficient to expose the V-I at the same level or within 5 mm depth of PB in 88. In 78 V-I was adequate taking 10/12fr dilator (Type 1). In 10, CC resembled a male urethra and V-I was narrow (Type 2), requiring widening by 5-10 mm incision at 6 o'clock position. Dartos of labia majora was attached to BSM to reduce the distance to V-I from perineal skin and the gap was lined with inner foreskin to create a vestibule. Out of 70 who were post-pubertal, 75% (53/70) had adequate calibre vaginal openings. 5 had introitoplasty and 2 had dilatation under anaesthesia. 10 needed self dilators only. 29 patients, of one of the three surgeons, had measurements of clitoris, CC, urethra and vagina. A hymen was found in 86% (25/29). There was significant strong, inverse correlation between the CC length and the urethral length (r = -0.708, p < 0.001, n = 27) but not between CC and vaginal lengths. After adjusting for age, the urethral length of Type 2 patients was 3.825 mm shorter than those of Type 1 (p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Our data show that 'high' confluence is mostly due to virilisation of genitalia; and the anatomical technique of reversing the fusion of the urethral folds, spongiosum and bulbo-spongiosus muscle could be performed with all degrees of virilisation with success in early childhood with no need of local flaps or mobilisation of the urethro-vaginal complex. About 10% require surgery to treat narrowing of vaginal opening post puberty.",,1768
1413,35968489,Addressing health corruption during a public health crisis through anticipatory governance: Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Corruption in the health sector costs over 500 billion USD annually, weakening health system preparedness and response to health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of resources to deal with a shock limits the capacity to protect the population, exposing them to a greater risk of infection and mortality. There is an urgent need to improve health policy to reduce corruption in the health sector during times of crisis. This article aims to propose a prepare and response strategy to address corruption during times of health crises. We first explore the inherent characteristics of health systems that make them vulnerable to corruption and present the different faces corrupt practices take. We then explain why anticipatory governance is fundamental in addressing corruption in health systems and draw upon examples of corruption during COVID-19. Finally, we conclude by proposing that anticipatory governance could decrease the impact of corruption during health crises by increasing the availability of resources required to improve the population's health.",,1769
1200,35971917,Current situation of endemic mycosis in the Americas and the Caribbean: Proceedings of the first international meeting on endemic mycoses of the Americas (IMEMA).,"The Americas are home to biologically and clinically diverse endemic fungi, including Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Emergomyces, Histoplasma, Paracoccidioides and Sporothrix. In endemic areas with high risk of infection, these fungal pathogens represent an important public health problem. This report aims to summarise the main findings of the regional analysis carried out on the status of the endemic mycoses of the Americas, done at the first International Meeting on Endemic Mycoses of the Americas (IMEMA). A regional analysis for the Americas was done, the 27 territories were grouped into nine regions. A SWOT analysis was done. All territories reported availability of microscopy. Seventy percent of territories reported antibody testing, 67% of territories reported availability of Histoplasma antigen testing. None of the territories reported the use of (1-3)-β-d-glucan. Fifty two percent of territories reported the availability of PCR testing in reference centres (mostly for histoplasmosis). Most of the territories reported access to medications such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B (AMB) deoxycholate. Many countries had limited access to liposomal formulation of AMB and newer azoles, such as posaconazole and isavuconazole. Surveillance of these fungal diseases was minimal. A consensus emerged among meeting participants, this group concluded that endemic mycoses are neglected diseases, and due to their severity and lack of resources, the improvement of diagnosis, treatment and surveillance is needed.",,1770
1466,35968432,Consumers' decoy effect when purchasing pork with traceability technologies.,"Despite government investment, policy guidance, and publicity, it has been difficult to establish a traceable food market in China over the past 2 decades. Once a food safety problem occurs, it is difficult to implement effective traceability, recall, and accountability along the food supply chain. How to use the decoy effect to promote the development of China traceable food market? As bounded rationality, a decoy effect exists when adding an alternative to a choice set increases the chance an existing alternative to be chosen. However, few studies have examined the decoy effect in food purchases. Based on consumers in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China, we show the decoy effect in traceable pork hindquarter purchases and that the effects differ across product quality and price attributes. The effects are heterogeneous across consumers and are less likely to occur among those who had a personal annual income of more than 50,000 yuan (USD $7,000), were married, and had minor children in the family. These findings have implications on leveraging the influence of the decoy effect on consumer behavior and facilitating the construction of food traceability systems.",,1771
682,35975529,Clinical Significance of miRNA-145 and -126 in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Pulmonary Embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) a consequence of hypercoagulability status associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and worsens its course. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been linked to PE in COPD settings. We aimed to measure expression levels of miRNAs145 and 126 in COPD patients with and without PE. Herein, miRNA (145 and 126) expression levels were measured in 250 COPD patients with PE by quan-titative real-time PCR, and their data were compared with 300 COPD patients without PE. Our results showed that miRNA-145 expression was downregulated in COPD patients with PE compared to those without PE. The reverse was observed in miRNA-126 expression that was higher in COPD patients with PE than in those without PE. miRNA-145 correlated positively with FEV1/FVC and correlated negatively with D-dimer in all patients regardless of the presence of PE. In addition, miRNA-126 positively correlated with D-dimer and negatively correlated with FEV1/FVC in all studied COPD patients. Lower levels of miRNA-145 and higher levels of miRNA-126 associated with worse diagnosis PE in patients with COPD. Extensive studies are mandated to bring a better understanding of the role of these miRNAs in the mechanism of thrombosis in COPD patients.",,1772

1662,35968112,Selection of parental lines for plant breeding via genomic prediction.,"A set of superior parental lines is imperative for the development of high-performing inbred lines in any biparental crossing program for crops. The main objectives of this study are to (a) develop a genomic prediction approach to identify superior parental lines for multi-trait selection, and (b) generate a software package for users to execute the proposed approach before conducting field experiments. According to different breeding goals of the target traits, a novel selection index integrating information from genomic-estimated breeding values (GEBVs) of candidate accessions was proposed to evaluate the composite performance of simulated progeny populations. Two rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome datasets were analyzed to illustrate the potential applications of the proposed approach. One dataset applied to the parental selection for producing inbred lines with satisfactory performance in primary and secondary traits simultaneously. The other one applied to demonstrate the application of producing inbred lines with high adaptability to different environments. Overall, the results showed that incorporating GEBV and genomic diversity into a selection strategy based on the proposed selection index could assist in selecting superior parents to meet the desired breeding goals and increasing long-term genetic gain. An R package, called IPLGP, was generated to facilitate the widespread application of the approach.",,1774
322,35980410,Virtual Town Hall Meetings to Convey Emergency Medicine Residency Program Information to Students.,"Applying to emergency medicine (EM) residency programs as a medical student is challenging and complicated in a normal year, but the 2020/2021 application cycle was further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the decrease of in-person opportunities for students to connect with residency programs, virtual town-hall meetings were developed. In this study our primary objective was to determine whether attendance at a virtual residency program information session improved the perceived knowledge of curriculum information and program exposure to medical students applying to an EM residency. Four study sites hosted a total of 12 virtual events consisting of residents, faculty, or both. Standardized pre-event/post-event surveys were conducted to capture medical student perceptions before/after each of the virtual sessions. Apart from measuring the improvement in students' perceived knowledge of a program by gauging their responses to each question, we used a 10-question composite score to compare pre- vs post-event improvement among the participants. The pre-event survey was completed by 195 attendees, and the post-event survey was completed by 123 attendees. The median and mean composite score to this 10-question survey improved from 32.19 to 45, and 31.45 to 44.2, respectively, in the pre- to post-event survey. This study showed improvement of medical students' perceived knowledge of residency programs (reflected as increased agreement from pre- to post-event survey). The data demonstrates through question responses that students not only obtained information about the programs but also were able to gain exposure to the culture and feel of a program. In a non-traditional application season in which students are unable to pursue their interest in a program through audition rotations, virtual town hall events, along with other asynchronous events, may be a reasonable approach to increasing medical student understanding and awareness of a program and its culture.",,1775
2345,35967031,Hybrid Metal Oxide/Biochar Materials for Wastewater Treatment Technology: A Review.,"This paper discusses the properties of metal oxide/biochar systems for use in wastewater treatment. Titanium, zinc, and iron compounds are most often combined with biochar; therefore, combinations of their oxides with biochar are the focus of this review. The first part of this paper presents the most important information about biochar, including its advantages, disadvantages, and possible modification, emphasizing the incorporation of inorganic oxides into its structure. In the next four sections, systems of biochar combined with TiO2, ZnO, Fe3O4, and other metal oxides are discussed in detail. In the next to last section probable degradation mechanisms are discussed. Literature studies revealed that the dispersion of a metal oxide in a carbonaceous matrix causes the creation or enhancement of surface properties and catalytic or, in some cases, magnetic activity. Addition of metallic species into biochars increases their weight, facilitating their separation by enabling the sedimentation process and thus facilitating the recovery of the materials from the water medium after the purification process. Therefore, materials based on the combination of inorganic oxide and biochar reveal a wide range of possibilities for environmental applications in aquatic media purification.",,1776
1915,35967694,Personality Traits and Entrepreneurial Intentions: Financial Risk-Taking as Mediator.,"The interaction between environment and individual personality determines career. Over the past decades, the role of personality traits in explaining entrepreneurship cannot get much attention of researchers. To fill this gap, this study aims to investigate the effect of personality traits (extraversion, openness to experience, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and agreeableness) on the entrepreneurial intentions (EI) along with the mediating role of financial risk taking (FRT). Sample size consists of 500 students of business and management of different universities of Pakistan, out of which 466 useable questionnaires were collected and analyzed. The results of the study are consistent with conventional wisdom as explored by past studies. In line with past studies and proposed hypothesis, we found that both extraversion and openness to experience have a positive association with FRT, whereas neuroticism, conscientiousness, and agreeableness have negative association with FRT. The results also revealed that there is positive association between FRT and EI; however, FRT did not mediate the relationship between agreeableness and EI.",,1777
619,35977780,The Demographic Costs of Sexually Antagonistic Selection in Partially Selfing Populations.,"AbstractWhen selection differs between the sexes, genes expressed by both males and females can experience sexually antagonistic (SA) selection, where beneficial alleles for one sex are deleterious for the other. Classic population genetics theory has been fundamental to understanding how and when SA genetic variation can be maintained by balancing selection, but these models have rarely considered the demographic consequences of coexisting alleles with deleterious fitness effects in each sex. In this article, we develop a stage-structured Mendelian matrix model and jointly analyze the evolutionary and demographic consequences of SA selection in obligately outcrossing (i.e., dioecious/gonochorous) and partially selfing hermaphrodite populations. We focus on identifying when SA polymorphisms are maintained by balancing selection and the population growth rate remains positive. Additionally, we analyze the effects of inbreeding depression manifesting at different life history stages and give an illustrative example of the potential for SA polymorphism in real populations using empirically estimated demographic rates for the hermaphroditic flowering plant Mimulus guttatus. Our results show that when population intrinsic growth rates approach 1, extinction occurs across large swathes of parameter space, favoring SA polymorphism or the fixation of male-beneficial alleles, and that inbreeding depression is a significant problem for maintaining SA polymorphism in partially selfing populations. Despite these demographic challenges, our example with M. guttatus appears to show that demographic rates observed in some real populations can sustain large regions of viable SA polymorphic space.",,1778
1678,35968095,"Protein S-acyltransferases and acyl protein thioesterases, regulation executors of protein S-acylation in plants.","Protein S-acylation, also known as palmitoylation, is an important lipid post-translational modification of proteins in eukaryotes. S-acylation plays critical roles in a variety of protein functions involved in plant development and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. The status of S-acylation on proteins is dynamic and reversible, which is catalyzed by protein S-acyltransferases (PATs) and reversed by acyl protein thioesterases. The cycle of S-acylation and de-S-acylation provides a molecular mechanism for membrane-associated proteins to undergo cycling and trafficking between different cell compartments and thus works as a switch to initiate or terminate particular signaling transductions on the membrane surface. In plants, thousands of proteins have been identified to be S-acylated through proteomics. Many S-acylated proteins and quite a few PAT-substrate pairs have been functionally characterized. A recently characterized acyl protein thioesterases family, ABAPT family proteins in Arabidopsis, has provided new insights into the de-S-acylation process. However, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling the S-acylation and de-S-acylation process is surprisingly incomplete. In this review, we discuss how protein S-acylation level is regulated with the focus on catalyzing enzymes in plants. We also propose the challenges and potential developments for the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling protein S-acylation in plants.",,1779
1398,35968619,Impact of the unplanned excision on the oncological outcomes of patients with soft tissue sarcomas: a single-center retrospective review of 490 patients.,"This study aimed to (1) compare the oncological results of patients who underwent re-excision after unplanned excision with those who underwent planned excision and (2) analyze the impact of local recurrences on oncological outcomes. Patients with soft tissue sarcoma who had been treated in our center between 2000 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: Group PE (Planned excision; n=345) and group UE (Unplanned excision; n=145). Two groups were compared in terms of local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and overall survival (OS). Local recurrences effects over MFS and OS were also analyzed. There were 26 (17.9%) local recurrences in the UE group and 30 (8.7%) local recurrences in the PE group (P=0.005). There was no difference in MFS and OS between study groups (P=0.278 and P=0.848, respectively). Five years MFS rates of UE and PE groups were 76.4% and 73.6%, and five-year OS rates of UE and PE groups were 70.3% and 73.9%, respectively (P=0.417, P=0.656). Patients with local recurrence had a 1.96 times higher risk of metastasis than patients without local recurrence (P=0.008). Patients with local recurrence had 1.65 times higher risk of mortality than patients without local recurrence (P=0.047). Although local recurrence is much more common in the UE group, this outcome does not seem to affect MFS or OS. These results indicate that similar outcomes can be achieved if UE patients are referred and appropriately treated with wide re-resections. Level III, Therapeutic Study.",,1780
2020,35967566,Low-Cost Telesimulation Training Improves Real Patient Pediatric Shock Outcomes in India.,"Pediatric shock, especially septic shock, is a significant healthcare burden in low-income countries. Early recognition and management of shock in children improves patient outcome. Simulation-based education (SBE) for shock recognition and prompt management prepares interdisciplinary pediatric emergency teams in crisis management. COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on in-person simulation led us to the development of telesimulation for shock. We hypothesized that telesimulation training would improve pediatric shock recognition, process of care, and patient outcomes in both simulated and real patient settings. We conducted a prospective quasi-experimental interrupted time series cohort study over 9 months. We conducted 40 telesimulation sessions for 76 participants in teams of 3 or 4, utilizing the video telecommunication platform (Zoom©). Trained observers recorded time-critical interventions on real patients for the pediatric emergency teams composed of residents, fellows, and nurses. Data were collected on 332 pediatric patients in shock (72% of whom were in septic shock) before, during, and after the intervention. The data included the first hour time-critical intervention checklist, patient hemodynamic status at the end of the first hour, time for the resolution of shock, and team leadership skills in the emergency room. There was a significant improvement in the percent completion of tasks by the pediatric emergency team in simulated scenarios (69% in scenario 1 vs. 93% in scenario 2; p < 0.001). In real patients, completion of tasks as per time-critical steps reached 100% during and after intervention compared to the pre-intervention phase (87.5%), p < 0.05. There was a significant improvement in the first hour hemodynamic parameters of shock patients: pre (71%), during (79%), and post (87%) intervention (p < 0.007 pre vs. post). Shock reversal time reduced from 24 h pre-intervention to 6 h intervention and to 4.5 h post intervention (p < 0.002). There was also a significant improvement in leadership performance assessed by modified Concise Assessment of Leader Management (CALM) instrument during the simulated (p < 0.001) and real patient care in post intervention (p < 0.05). Telesimulation training is feasible and improved the process of care, time-critical interventions, leadership in both simulated and real patients and resolution of shock in real patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies where telesimulation has shown improvement in real patient outcomes.",,1781
534,35978699,Innovation Experiences from Africa-Led Drug Discovery at the Holistic Drug Discovery and Development (H3D) Centre.,"As the so-called next frontier in global economic terms, Africa's disease burden continues to choke and cripple economic growth across the continent. The highest burden is attributable to malaria and tuberculosis (TB), which also remain among the deadliest infectious diseases affecting mankind the world over (Malaria, 627,000 deaths; TB, 1.5 million deaths, in 2020). In achieving self-determination with respect to the health needs of all who live on the continent, Africa must align with global north efforts and be a source of health innovation. This will in part require the creation of an ecosystem of innovative pharmaceutical R&D and expanding it across the continent by scaling up through sustained performance and excellence. To this end, the Holistic Drug Discovery and Development (H3D) Centre at University of Cape Town in South Africa has risen to this challenge. Here, we highlight the innovation experiences gained at H3D, covering the advances made in our quest to contribute to a global pipeline of therapeutic interventions against malaria and TB. We discuss selected chemical series starting from their identification, structure-activity relationships, mode of action, safety, proof-of-concept studies, and lessons learned.",,1782
1452,35968446,Identifying factors associated with COVID-19 related deaths during the first wave of the pandemic in Europe.,"To clarify the high variability in COVID-19-related deaths during the first wave of the pandemic, we conducted a modeling study using publicly available data. We used 13 population- and country-specific variables to predict the number of population-standardized COVID-19-related deaths in 43 European countries using generalized linear models: the test-standardized number of SARS-CoV-2-cases, population density, life expectancy, severity of governmental responses, influenza-vaccination coverage in the elderly, vitamin D status, smoking and diabetes prevalence, cardiovascular disease death rate, number of hospital beds, gross domestic product, human development index and percentage of people older than 65 years. We found that test-standardized number of SARS-CoV-2-cases and flu vaccination coverage in the elderly were the most important predictors, together with vitamin D status, gross domestic product, population density and government response severity explaining roughly two-thirds of the variation in COVID-19 related deaths. The latter variable was positively, but only weakly associated with the outcome, i.e., deaths were higher in countries with more severe government response. Higher flu vaccination coverage and low vitamin D status were associated with more COVID-19 related deaths. Most other predictors appeared to be negligible. Adequate vitamin D levels are important, while flu-vaccination in the elderly and stronger government response were putative aggravating factors of COVID-19 related deaths.

The aim of this study was to examine the association of risk factors including scar characteristics on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with clustered VA and VA cycle length in nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). Data from 329 primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator recipients (mean age 57 years, 26% women) were analyzed from the Left Ventricular Structural Predictors of Sudden Cardiac Death study. Twenty-one patients developed clustered VA (median time 2.7 years after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement). Men had the greatest risk for recurrent VA. Patients with NICM and scar had the highest incidence rate of clustered VA. In patients with NICM, each 1-g increase in core scar correlated with greater clustered VA risk (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.07-1.32). Gray scar was similar among subgroups. Patients with NICM with clustered VA had the longest mean VA cycle length (297 ± 40 milliseconds). Higher core scar burden correlated with longer VA cycle length in patients with NICM (P = 0.002), and higher body mass index correlated with shorter VA cycle length in those with ICM (P = 0.02). Type of VA was similar between cardiomyopathy subgroups, and no scar pattern predominated. Clustered VA was most common in patients with NICM and scar, with greatest risk among those with larger core scar. Core scar correlated with slower VA in patients with NICM, and higher body mass index correlated with faster VA in those with ICM. Type of VA was similar by cardiomyopathy etiology, and no dominant scar pattern was associated with clustered VA.",,1784
1210,35971604,YouTube videos provide low-quality educational content about rotator cuff disease.,"YouTube has become a popular source of healthcare information in orthopedic surgery. Although quality-based studies of YouTube content have been performed for information concerning many orthopedic pathologies, the quality and accuracy of information on the rotator cuff have yet to be evaluated. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the reliability and educational content of YouTube videos concerning the rotator cuff. YouTube was queried for the term rotator cuff. The first 50 videos from this search were evaluated. Video reliability was assessed using the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria (range, 0-5). Educational content was assessed using the global quality score (GQS; range, 0-4) and the rotator cuff-specific score (RCSS; range, 0-22). The mean number of views was 317,500.7±538,585.3. The mean JAMA, GQS, and RCSS scores were 2.7±2.0, 3.7±1.0, and 5.6±3.6, respectively. Non-surgical intervention content was independently associated with a lower GQS (β=-2.19, p=0.019). Disease-specific video content (β=4.01, p=0.045) was the only independent predictor of RCSS. The overall quality and educational content of YouTube videos concerned with the rotator cuff were low. Physicians should caution patients in using such videos as resources for decision-making and should counsel them appropriately.",,1785
1446,35968452,Attitude and Needs Toward MTM Applications of Chronic Disease in China: A Questionnaire Survey.,"Chronic diseases are characterized by high incidence, long-term medication, and complex types of medication. There are also many corresponding medication therapy management (MTM) applications on the market, such as iCarea, and Medisafe. However, the existing research mainly focuses on how to choose high-quality MTM applications, and few researchers consider the expectations of MTM applications from potential users. The aims of this study were to investigate the demand, attitude, and expectations of the Chinese patients for the MTM applications to support. From August 2019 to December 2019, we created a questionnaire to have knowledge of user needs, preferences, and expectations for MTM applications among 302 chronic patients in Hunan, Guangdong, and other provinces in China. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the risk factors of affecting patients' attitudes toward MTM applications. Then, respondents' expectations and preferences for MTM applications were statistically analyzed. The survey data were merged to provide information for the design of targeted chronic disease MTM applications. A total of 260 (86.09%) out of 302 patients the respondents were willing to use the MTM applications of chronic disease. The independent influencing factors for using the MTM applications were long-term medication history (OR = 4.45, P < 0.001), willing to learn about medicine knowledge (OR = 3.01, P = 0.04), and wanting to get more professional medication knowledge via Internet (OR = 2.86, P = 0.005). It was worth noting that among those willing to use MTM applications, 55.00% of respondents were willing to use the WeChat applet for MTM, while only 23.46% of respondents preferred other applications. As to the more prevalent WeChat applet for MTM, the majority of participants expected the inclusion of useful modules, such as medication log (62.81%), medication reminder (62.81%), and medication recommendations (57.79%). The participants are willing to use MTM applications of chronic disease, with a preference for the WeChat applet. Patients tended to use MTM applications if they had a long-term medication history or a desire for medical knowledge, especially if they want to get more professional medication knowledge via the Internet. Participants are expected to include in the WeChat applet as medication logs, medication reminders, and medication recommendations which should be taken into serious account for the further development of MTM applications.",,1786
501,35978758,The Case of the Missing Dentures: A Case Report and Review of Esophageal Foreign Body as a Cause of Chest Pain.,"Esophageal foreign body ingestion is a cause of non-cardiac chest pain and can be associated with significant mortality. Typically, esophageal foreign body ingestion is managed with endoscopic retrieval to prevent complications. The most commonly ingested foreign bodies in adults are food boluses. However, sometimes we see patients after the ingestion of more atypical and dangerous objects. Here, we present a case of a 66-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with chest pain. Quickly after admission to the emergency department, the patient was noted to have an esophageal foreign body on the chest radiograph. The patient was subsequently taken for endoscopic management of the foreign body and intubated for airway protection. With careful manipulation of the mystery object, the foreign body was removed and the patient was able to be discharged safely from the hospital without complications. This case emphasizes the importance of keeping a broad differential for one of the most commonly seen chief complaints in the emergency department to ensure timely triage of patients.",,1787
827,35974944,Quality assessment of pathologic data in cancer registry centers based on ICD-O-3.,"Prerequisite for achieving the goals of the registration program is the existence of valid and accurate data, and the usability of this data is possible if they are coded correctly. This study assets the quality of pathological data of the population-based cancer registration centers based on ICD-O-3. This applied study was performed descriptively and retrospectively. The study population included 20129 pathology reports sent to the population-based cancer registration center of Mazandaran Province during 2018-2020. A total of 2015 out of, 2050 samples of the received reports were examined according to stratified random sampling method. A researcher checklist was made to collect the data, and STATA 13 and Cohen's Kappa agreement coefficient were used to analyze the data. Among the 2015 reports of pathology, 1114 (55.3%) pathology reports were related to government centers, (42.9%) 865 cases were registered with their topographic code, morphology and behavior. Based on the registration of the exact topographic code, the kappa coefficient and the total agreement were 0.266 and 27.70%, respectively. Kappa coefficient in all received reports and reports with topographic code was 0.346 and 0.906, respectively. In the reports with topographic code, the most reports of cancers were related to cancers of the gastrointestinal organs (97.6%) 246. The accuracy of the codes given in the pathology centers in terms of topographic, morphological, behavioral and grade codes based on the percentage of agreement with the coding was above average, which were higher in governmental centers and also in some cancers.",,1788
1026,35974593,Preparation of quantum correlations assisted by a steering Maxwell demon.,"A Maxwell demon can reduce the entropy of a quantum system by performing measurements on its environment. The nonsignaling theorem prevents the demon from affecting the average state of the system. We study the preparations of quantum correlations from a system qubit and an auxiliary qubit, assisted by a demon who obtains information of the system qubit from measurements on its environment. The demon can affect the postmeasured states of system by choosing different measurements, which establishes the relationships between quantum steering and other correlations in the thermodynamic framework. We present the optimal protocols for creating mutual information, entanglement, and Bell-nonlocality. These maximal correlations are found to relate exactly to the steerable boundary of the system-environment state with maximally mixed marginals. We also present upper bounds of the prepared correlations by utilizing classical environment-system correlation, which can be regarded as steering-type inequalities bounding the correlations created with the aid of classical demons.",,1789
648,35976230,Effects of physiotherapy interventions for home-based rehabilitation on physical function after primary total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review protocol.,"The objective of this review is to provide a systematic and transparent overview of the effects of common physiotherapy techniques and exercises for the rehabilitation of patients following total knee arthroplasty. Many protocols exist for the rehabilitation of patients after total knee arthroplasty, but there is a lack of systematic evidence on rehabilitation components, including precise exercise descriptions and their parameters. This review will fill in some of the gaps in reporting on scientific rehabilitation protocol components and the evaluation of their effectiveness. We will include randomized controlled trials investigating active and passive physiotherapy techniques and exercises employed after primary total knee arthroplasty, and which report concrete parameters, such as dosage, duration, frequency, intensity, and function-related measurements. We will exclude other study types and randomized controlled trials reporting on techniques and exercises without precise descriptions. This review will aim to find both published and unpublished studies. The key information sources to be searched are MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PEDro, Cochrane CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Two independent reviewers will screen titles, abstracts, and full texts; assess the methodological quality; and extract the data.

66,35983463,Dermatitis Cruris Pustulosa et Atrophicans: Scarring Alopecia Beyond Scalp Hair.,"Dermatitis Cruris Pustulosa et Atrophicans (DCPA) was first described in 1952 in Nigeria and is nowadays regarded as a type of chronic folliculitis of tropical areas. It is often limited to the lower limbs of young adults, mostly in the second to third decades, with a unique clinical picture characterized by chronicity, relentless progression, therapy refractoriness, and permanent cicatricial changes. Trauma, occlusion, and microorganism selection contribute for its etiopathogenesis, which is deemed multifactorial but still incompletely understood. Despite its conspicuous clinical features, awareness of DCPA is apparently low, hence probably overlooked. We herein summarize the current state of knowledge regarding this distinct entity, and further present the first report in a patient from Bangladesh, and concurrently the first in Europe. Paucity of data, and unraveled definite etiology and treatment, highlight the need for further studies.",,1791
2023,35967563,Pediatric Surgery and Anesthesia in Low-Middle Income Countries: Current Situation and Ethical Challenges.,"Low-middle income countries (LMICs) are currently experiencing an important population growth, leading to a substantial raise in the number of children living in those areas. As a consequence, the existing gap between the need for surgical and anesthetic care and the available therapeutic options will increase. To overcome this, an improvement in the available expertise, infrastructures, and supplies will be mandatory. The implementation of educational and training programs for local healthcare providers should be a top priority. Alongside, the population's awareness on the necessity to seek for medical care should be deployed, together with an eased access to health facilities.

1410,35968492,Influence of Social Workers' Empathy Ability on Suicidal Ideation of Cancer Patients.,"The nursing goal of patients with cancer is to provide them with holistic care, including physical, psychological, and social adaptation, and spirituality. This research aimed to explore the influence of the social workers' empathy ability on suicidal ideation of patients with cancer and its path. There was a sum of 358 patients with cancer and the 45 social workers serving them participated in the survey. Data of their self-efficacy, depression symptom, stigma, and suicidal ideation were measured before the social work provided (T1) and 3 months after the social work finished (T2) were collected and compared. Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationships between social workers' empathy ability and patient indicators at T2. The influence path of social workers' empathy ability on cancer patients' suicidal ideation was explored by path analysis at T2. At T2, patients reported higher self-efficacy and lower depression symptoms, stigma, and suicidal ideation than at T1. At T2, social workers' empathy ability was positively related to patients' self-efficacy and was negatively related to depression symptoms, stigma, and suicidal ideation. Social workers' empathy ability affected patients' suicidal ideation directly. In addition, patients' self-efficacy, depression symptoms, and stigma played mediating roles in the influence of social workers' empathy abilities on their suicidal ideation. Social workers' empathy ability not only directly affected cancer patients' suicide ideation but also affected suicide ideation through the mediating roles of self-efficacy, depression symptoms, and stigma. Therefore, the improvement of the empathy ability of medical social workers needs to be paid attention to.",,1793
1414,35968488,Search term One Health remains of limited use to identify relevant scientific publications: Denmark as a case study.,"One Health has become a popular approach, and scientific advancements in the field should be easily findable and accessible to a wide range of relevant audiences, from researchers to policymakers, and across sectors. We conducted a systematic narrative review of available scientific publications concerning One Health in the setting of Denmark that were retrievable using One Health as the key search term. Three searches in two databases yielded 30 retrieved publications, 13 of which were included in the review. The included publications had been published between 2015 and 2021. Twelve of the included publications were co-authored in collaboration across institutes from different sectors. Three of the included publications had focus on antimicrobial resistance, three on disease surveillance and/or control, and five were assessments or evaluations. The overall number of publications identified by a search using One Health as the key search term was small, and the search identified some publications that were not relevant to One Health. Our work thus highlights a missed scientific and communication opportunity of signposting articles as relevant to One Health. Using the expression One Health as keyword could help making One Health research more easily findable and thereby obtaining an overview of research in the field.",,1794
1363,35969100,Line Shape Analysis of Dynamic NMR Spectra for Characterizing Coordination Sphere Rearrangements at a Chiral Rhenium Polyhydride Complex.,"Dynamic solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the typical method of characterizing the dynamic rearrangements of atoms within the coordination sphere for transition metal polyhydride complexes. Line shape fitting of the dynamic NMR spectra can lead to estimates for the activation parameters of the dynamic rearrangement processes. A combination of dynamic 31P-{1H} NMR spectroscopy of metal-bound phosphorus atoms with dynamic 1H-{31P} NMR spectroscopy of hydride ligands may identify hydride ligand rearrangements that occur in conjunction with a phosphorus atom rearrangement. For molecules that exhibit such a coupled pair of rearrangements, dynamic NMR spectroscopy can be used to test theoretical models for the ligand rearrangements. Dynamic 1H-{31P} NMR spectroscopy and line shape fitting can also identify the presence of an exchange process that moves a specific hydride ligand beyond the metal's inner coordination sphere through a proton exchange with a solvent molecule such as adventitious water. The preparation of a new compound, ReH5(PPh3)2(sec-butyl amine), that exemplifies multiple dynamic rearrangement processes is presented along with line shape fitting of dynamic NMR spectra of the complex. Line shape fitting results can be analyzed by the Eyring equation to estimate the activation parameters for the identified dynamic processes.",,1795

2288,35967143,Surgical Intervention in Neglected Ankle Fracture: A Case Report.,"Ankle fracture is common in active young males. Treating ankle fractures can be straightforward or much more complicated; treatment options include nonoperative management or open anatomical reduction with rigid internal fixation. Successful treatment will allow early mobilization to avoid complications. Inadequate treatment, either nonoperative or operative management, may result in malunited ankle fractures. However, malunited ankle fractures due to the delayed presentation are very rare. An 18-year-old male presented to the clinic with a history of twisting injury to his right ankle two years ago. The patient sought medical advice once after injury, applied a back slab, and was advised for operative intervention. He refused the surgical intervention and was lost in follow-up. After two years, he presented again with ankle deformity and swelling. Assessment at initial presentation includes fibula malunion, medial malleolus malunion, and widening of the ankle mortise with talar tilt. Fogel and Morrey's performance index was used to evaluate the biomechanical result postoperatively. Delayed open anatomical reduction and rigid internal fixation of malunited ankle fractures to achieve normal ankle alignment will delay the onset of future degenerative changes and minimize the chance for early arthrodesis.",,1797

Like all other revolutionary changes, digital transformation involves intense adjustment/readjustment. University sustainability must be the active concern of all higher education institutions. Thus, the present research aims to analyse teachers' acceptance of new technologies and the impact on their wellbeing and university sustainability. The main objective was to analyse the acceptance of technology in special the e-learning opportunities and the wellbeing of teacher in an emergent country like Romania. To achieve our goal, we created a questionnaire based on the literature, and with the help of the technology acceptance model, we tested our hypotheses. The results indicate several discontents on the part of teachers concerning adapting to new technologies and even a personal discomfort in adapting to these new technologies. Thus, we can note that wellbeing significantly influences job satisfaction and teachers' involvement in sustainable development.",,1798
1948,35967660,Word reading skills in autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review.,"A growing body of research suggests that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at risk of reading and learning difficulties. However, there is mixed evidence on their weaknesses in different reading components, and little is known about how reading skills characterize in ASD. Thereby, the current study aimed to systematically review the research investigating this function in children with ASD. To this purpose, we reviewed 24 studies that compared (1) children with ASD and children with typical development (TD) in word and nonword reading performance, (2) children with ASD and normative data of word and nonword reading tests, and (3) the results obtained by children with ASD in word and nonword reading tests. Most of the comparisons (62%) contrasting the reading performance of children with ASD and children with TD did not find significant differences between groups in both word and nonword reading. However, all the comparisons that reported standardized results showed that children with ASD had scores that fell within population norms. Regarding the third comparison of interest, about 54% of the studies presented data for both word and nonword reading, but only one study tested the difference between them and showed that children with ASD had higher levels of word than of nonword reading. Despite these results, the heterogeneous and small samples do not allow to draw sound conclusions regarding the strategies that children with ASD use to read words. As consequence, the nature of reading difficulties presented by children with ASD are still unknown, requiring future research conducted with larger and well-characterized samples of ASD and TD, using homogeneous specific tasks designed to assess word reading strategies.",,1799

They differ in the twist of the phenyl and benzene rings of the 1,1'-biphenyl ring with respect to the plane of the 1,4-di-hydro-pyridine ring. In all three mol-ecules, the 1,4-di-hydro-pyridine ring adopts a distorted boat conformation. The cyclo-hexene ring has an envelope conformation in mol-ecules A and B, while it exhibits a distorted half-chair conformation for both the major and minor components in the disordered mol-ecule C. In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked by C-H⋯O and N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, forming layers parallel to (100) defining R 1 4(6) and C(7) graph-set motifs. Additional C-H⋯π inter-actions consolidate the layered structure. Between the layers, van der Waals inter-actions stabilize the packing, as revealed by Hirshfeld surface analysis. The greatest contributions to the crystal packing are from H⋯H (69.6% in A, 69.9% in B, 70.1% in C), C⋯H/H⋯C (20.3% in A, 20.6% in B, 20.3% in C) and O⋯H/H⋯O (8.6% in A, 8.6% in B, 8.4% in C) inter-actions.",,1800
339,35979429,"Unraveling Origin, History, Genetics, and Strategies for Accelerated Domestication and Diversification of Food Legumes.","Domestication is a dynamic and ongoing process of transforming wild species into cultivated species by selecting desirable agricultural plant features to meet human needs such as taste, yield, storage, and cultivation practices. Human plant domestication began in the Fertile Crescent around 12,000 years ago and spread throughout the world, including China, Mesoamerica, the Andes and Near Oceania, Sub-Saharan Africa, and eastern North America. Indus valley civilizations have played a great role in the domestication of grain legumes. Crops, such as pigeon pea, black gram, green gram, lablab bean, moth bean, and horse gram, originated in the Indian subcontinent, and Neolithic archaeological records indicate that these crops were first domesticated by early civilizations in the region. The domestication and evolution of wild ancestors into today's elite cultivars are important contributors to global food supply and agricultural crop improvement. In addition, food legumes contribute to food security by protecting human health and minimize climate change impacts. During the domestication process, legume crop species have undergone a severe genetic diversity loss, and only a very narrow range of variability is retained in the cultivars. Further reduction in genetic diversity occurred during seed dispersal and movement across the continents. In general, only a few traits, such as shattering resistance, seed dormancy loss, stem growth behavior, flowering-maturity period, and yield traits, have prominence in the domestication process across the species. Thus, identification and knowledge of domestication responsive loci were often useful in accelerating new species' domestication. The genes and metabolic pathways responsible for the significant alterations that occurred as an outcome of domestication might aid in the quick domestication of novel crops. Further, recent advances in omics sciences, gene-editing technologies, and functional analysis will accelerate the domestication and crop improvement of new crop species without losing much genetic diversity. In this review, we have discussed about the origin, center of diversity, and seed movement of major food legumes, which will be useful in the exploration and utilization of genetic diversity in crop improvement. Further, we have discussed about the major genes/QTLs associated with the domestication syndrome in pulse crops and the future strategies to improve the food legume crops.",,1801

2390,35966982,Anatomy of the Mesentery.,"It is clear that despite the importance of multimodal therapy, the most impactful weapon in the arsenal of treatment in a patient with colorectal cancer is high-quality surgery. This has been shown time and time again and surgery remains the bedrock in the management of visceral, and particularly colorectal, cancer. The reason for this is an anatomical one, based upon embryological planes. One cannot truly understand and perform high-quality surgery without an appreciation of the fascial and mesenteric anatomy of the abdomen and pelvis. R. J. (Bill) Heald greatly advanced the management of rectal cancer with his description of the anatomical foundation of total mesorectal excision. He popularized usage of the term mesorectum and was an early pioneer in the commitment to mesenteric-based surgery. This concept has been extended by Werner Hohenberger to mesocolic excision for colon cancer surgery. These all rely on the principle that, in general, cancer tends to remain within its embryological compartment of origin, making it amenable to dissecting out as an oncological surgical envelope or package. There have been some theories put forth as to why, but it remains the fact that, far more often than not, an excision within the mesenteric plane affords better outcomes than the one that breaches it. Thus an understanding of the anatomy of the mesentery is important and is the scientific foundation of the art that is cancer surgery. Herein the author outlines the history of the development of our understanding of mesenteric anatomy and where we are today.",,1803

For the result without 1tR and 2tR data of alkane references (1tR(n) and 2tR(n)), the following steps were applied: (1) curve fitting based on van den Dool and Kratz relationship in order to simulate 1tR(n) using a training set of volatile compounds in a sample with their experimental 1tR data, and (2) simulation of 2tR(n) at different 1tR(n) to construct their isovolatility curves based on a nonlinear equation with p1-p5 parameters and a constant (within the ranges of -0.0052 to 0.0049, -0.6181 to -0.0230, -26.4775 to -0.2698, 0.0050 to 9.6259, -7.2976 to -3.9524 and 0.9157 to 4.0779, respectively). These parameters were obtained by performing curve fitting according to the experimental 2tR data of the same training set with the least square values ranging from 4.58×10-15 to 32.55. Simulation of 1tR and 2tR of target analytes (1tR,sim and 2tR,sim) with known 1I and 2I were performed using 1tR(n) and the simulated isovolatility curves. All the calculations and curve fittings were carried out by using Solver in Microsoft Excel. The approach was applied to simulate results for 542 compounds in several samples including analysis of saffron (Crocus sativas L.), Boswellia papyrifera, acacia honey and incense powder/smoke, perfume and cannabis either reported from literature or from the experiments in this work using different experimental approaches. These were compared with the experimental data showing correlation with the R2 ranges of 0.98-1.00 and 0.80-0.97 for 1tR and 2tR, respectively.

To test these assumptions, the aim of the present study was twofold: to determine whether the different sources of support explained significantly different amounts of variance in autonomy satisfaction when compared and to understand the psychological process through which autonomy support from three sources influenced performance, more specifically, whether autonomy support indirectly affected performance through perceived autonomy satisfaction and work engagement in serial. In a sample of 278 employees, autonomy support from others (especially managers) and autonomy crafting played a role in autonomy satisfaction. Furthermore, the results indicated that autonomy support was associated with performance through its serial associations with autonomy satisfaction and work engagement. The results emphasized the importance of autonomy support for performance, enabling organizations to proactively design interventions to improve engagement and performance.

1406,35968535,Characterization of 2S albumin allergenic proteins for anaphylaxis in common buckwheat.,"2S albumin (2SA) is responsible for anaphylaxis following consumption of buckwheat in allergic individuals. To reduce allergen incidents, characterization of 2SA polypeptides is prerequisite, thus was analyzed in this study. Of the five 2S albumin genes (g03, g11, g13, g14, and g28), g03 was seemingly non-functional. The g14 content was 3- and 40-fold higher than that of g11/g28 and g13, respectively. The g11/g28 were more processed to a ∼8 kDa band from a 16 kDa band than g14 in seeds, agreeing with that g11/g28 have high similarity with Fag e 8kD. Meanwhile, anti-g13 produced only a single ∼10 kDa band. Modification of g13 and domain exchange between g13 and g14 suggested that the hydrophobicity of the first domain and the nature of some amino acids in g13 contributed, at least in part, to the lower apparent molecular weight of g13 than expected. Thus, g13 might be an unexplored and noteworthy allergen.",,1810
1066,35974553,Equation of state of hard lenses: A combined virial series and simulation approach.,"We provide highly accurate equation-of-state data for the isotropic phase of hard lenses obtained by means of cluster Monte Carlo simulations. This data is analyzed using a virial approach considering coefficients up to the order eight and Carnahan-Starling type closure relations for the virial series. The comparison with previously investigated systems consisting of hard, oblate ellipsoids of revolution allows insights into the detailed influence of the particle geometry. We propose a generalized Carnahan-Starling approach as a heuristic equation of state for the isotropic phase of hard lenses that in first approximation shows the same dependence on the excess part of the excluded volume as identified for oblate, hard lenses of revolution.",,1811
1605,35968279,Feasibility and Safety of Flow Diversion in the Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms via Transradial Approach: A Single-Arm Meta-Analysis.,"While studies have confirmed that flow diversion (FD) can treat intracranial aneurysms via transradial approach (TRA), it remains unclear whether their treatment ultimately impacts safety and feasibility. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the safety and feasibility after FD treatment of intracranial aneurysms via TRA. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically reviewed. The primary outcomes were the success rate and the access-related complications of deploying FD via TRA. Meta-analysis was performed using a random or fixed effect model based on heterogeneity. And the publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42021244448. Data from 8 studies met inclusion criteria (250 non-duplicated patients). The success rate was 93% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.98; I 2 = 61.05%; p = 0.01). The access-related complications rate was 1% (95% CI 0-0.03; I 2 = 0.00%; p < 0.01). The mainly access-related complications included radial artery spasm (85.7%) and radial artery occlusion (14.3%). The TRA convert to transfemoral approach (TFA) was 7% (95% CI 0.02-0.14; I 2 = 61.05%; p = 0.01). Although TFA is still the main access for FD in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, the TRA also has a higher success rate and lower access-related complications rate. With the improvement of future experience and equipment, the TRA may become the main access for FD which has more advantages. Future studies should design prospective, multicenter randomized controlled studies for long-term follow-up.",,1812
1972,35967635,Reassessment of sustainable rural tourism strategies after COVID-19.,"This study aimed to develop indicators that measure rural tourism destinations in a sustainable framework during the COVID-19 process. In order to achieve this goal, the A'WOT and TOWS hybrid method was used in the study. In line with this goal, the priority order was calculated by determining the factors for strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities. Once these factors have been identified, strategies have been developed to build on strengths and eliminate weaknesses, while taking advantage of the opportunities and countering threats. In the study, Gökçeada-Turkey, which has recently come to the fore with its rural tourism potential, has been considered as a destination area, and strategies have been developed that adopt sustainable and responsible tourism approaches and increase the roles and capabilities of local communities. The results obtained in the study are expected to be meaningful for other rural destinations that are similar to Gökçeada.",,1813

The accurate identification of the underlying condition can be difficult to achieve and relies mainly on patient history and clinical and histological evaluation. We present the case of a 30-year-old male referred to our hospital with a chief complaint of extensive pigmentation of the lingual dorsum. A diagnosis of physiologic pigmentation based on clinical and histological findings was made. Since some life-threatening diseases may present solely as pigmented lesions of the tongue, an early diagnosis is of utmost importance.",,1814
1160,35973711,Transitioning to virtual ambulatory care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study of faculty and resident physician perspectives.,"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a rapid shift from in-person to virtual care delivery for many medical specialties across Canada. The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of resident physicians and faculty related to teaching, learning and assessment during ambulatory virtual care encounters within the competency-based medical education model. In this qualitative phenomenological study, we recruited resident physicians (postgraduate year [PGY] 1-5 trainees) and faculty from the Departments of Surgery and Medicine at Queen's University, Ontario, via purposive sampling. Participants were not required to have exposure to virtual care. Interviews were conducted from September 2020 to March 2021 by 1 researcher, and 2 researchers conducted focus groups via Zoom to explore participants' experiences with the transition to virtual care. These were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim; qualitative data were analyzed thematically. There were 18 male and 19 female participants; 20 were resident physicians and 17 were faculty; 19 were from the Department of Surgery and 18 from the Department of Medicine. All faculty participants had participated in virtual care during ambulatory care; 2 PGY-1 residents in surgery had not actively participated in virtual care, although they had participated in clinics where faculty were using virtual care. The mean age of faculty participants was 38 (standard deviation [SD] 8.6) years, and the mean age of resident physicians was 29 (SD 5.4) years. Overall, 28 interviews and 4 focus groups (range 2-3 participants per group) were conducted, and 4 themes emerged: teaching and learning, assessment, logistical considerations, and suggestions. Barriers to teaching included the lack of direct observations and teaching time, and barriers to assessment included an absence of specific Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) and feedback focused on virtual care-related competencies. Logistical challenges included lack of technological infrastructure, insufficient private office space and administrative burdens. Both resident physicians and faculty did not foresee virtual care limiting resident physicians' ability to progress within competency-based medical education. Benefits of virtual care included increased accessibility to patients for follow-up visits, for disclosing patients' results and for out-of-town visits. Suggestions included faculty development, improved access to technology and space, educational guidelines for conducting virtual care encounters, and development of virtual care-specific competencies and EPAs. In the postgraduate program we studied, virtual care imposed substantial barriers on teaching, learning and assessment during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapting to new circumstances such as virtual care with suggestions from resident physicians and faculty may help to ensure the continuity of postgraduate medical education throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.",,1815

Leuceruthrus is unique by having oblique preovarian testes, a vitellarium that does not extend anteriad into the forebody, and a uterus that is intercecal and between the ovary and ventral sucker. We describe the cercaria of Leuceruthrus cf. stephanocauda from cercariae shed from Elimia cf. carinifera and Elimia cf. modesta from Big Canoe Creek, Alabama. Leuceruthrus ksepkai n. sp. is described from cercariae shed from rasp elimia, Elimia floridensis (Reeve, 1860) from Holmes Creek, Florida, and Elimia sp. 1 from the Chocktawhatchee River, Florida. It differs from its congeners by the combination of having broadly rounded furcae with slight marginal pigmentation in live cercariae, no spines on the tail stem, distinct anterior and posterior ridges that flank the tail stem portion accommodating the withdrawn distome, minute protuberances occupying the lateral margin of the tail stem for its entire length, and protuberances that encircle the anterior third of the posterior tail stem (immediately posterior to the tail stem portion containing the withdrawn distome). Leuceruthrus blaisei n. sp. infects Elimia sp. and is the only known congener having proportionally small furcae (>tail stem maximum width) with a nipple-like distal projection and numerous minute projections on the tail stem surface. Our phylogenetic analysis included all of our new sequences plus all publicly available ITS2 sequences for Leuceruthrus spp. and Proteromera spp., and supported the monophyly of Leuceruthrus. It recovered L. ksepkai and L. cf. ksepkai in a polytomy, and Leuceruthrus blaisei as monophyletic (identical sequences), with L. micropteri and L. cf. stephanocauda recovered as sister taxa. The present study comprises the first systematic treatment of Leuceruthrus in over a century, the first description of a new species of Leuceruthrus in 117 yr, and the first taxonomic characterization of a species of Leuceruthrus from the Mobile River Basin. It also increases the number of accepted congeners from 1 to 5 and provides new host records (E. cf. carinifera and E. floridensis) for Leuceruthrus spp.",,1816

One of the oxygen atoms of the nitro group in the 3,5-di-nitro-salicylate anion is disordered over two orientations with occupancy factors of 0.65 (7) and 0.35 (7) . The 2-meth--oxy-phenyl-piperazinium cation and 3,5-di-nitro-salicylate anion are linked in the asymmetric unit by a bifurcated N-H⋯O hydrogen bond, which formed is between the H atom in the protonated piperazinium unit of the cation and the carb-oxy-lic acid group in the anion. The piperazine ring adopts a chair conformation. The crystal structure features N-H⋯O and C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds inter-actions, which lead to the formation of a sandwich-like arrangement. Hirshfeld surface analysis was used to determine the relative contributions of various inter-molecular inter-actions, indicating that that H⋯O/O⋯H (38. 3%) and H⋯H (31. 8%) contacts are the major contributors.",,1817

2234,35967257,Leaf fossils of Sabalites (Arecaceae) from the Oligocene of northern Vietnam and their paleoclimatic implications.,"Recent paleobotanical investigations in Vietnam provide a good opportunity to improve our understanding of the biodiversity and paleoclimatic conditions in the geological past of Southeast Asia. Palms (Arecaceae) are a diverse family of typical thermophilous plants with a relatively low tolerance for freezing. In this study, we describe well-preserved fossil palm leaves from the Oligocene Dong Ho Formation of Hoanh Bo Basin, northern Vietnam. Characters of the fossil leaves, such as a fan-shaped costapalmate lamina, an unarmed petiole, a costa slightly enlarged at the base that then tapers distally into the blade, and well-preserved amphistomatic leaves with cuticles, suggest that they represent a new fossil species, which we herein designate Sabalites colaniae A.

1192,35972089,Stand-Alone Large Bore Aspiration Catheter (0.072 Inch) for Both Guide Support and Clot Aspiration in Transradial Posterior Circulation Stroke Thrombectomy: Technical Series.,"The large size of guide catheters in the traditional triaxial configuration can prove limiting during transradial vertebrobasilar thrombectomy. This is especially important for the direct aspiration technique because of the large aspiration catheters that can reach an inner diameter of 0.072 in. A strategy that strikes a balance between stable proximal vessel support and distal navigation for aspiration is conceptually attractive. To describe a series of transradial posterior circulation thrombectomy procedures in which the aspiration catheter served a dual role of guide support and clot aspiration in a coaxial configuration, thus obviating a larger guide catheter. Patients selected in the series underwent radial artery access and direct over-the-wire navigation of the aspiration catheter into the vertebral artery. With coaxial microcatheter navigation, the aspiration catheter reached distal enough to ingest the clot successfully. Along with clinical and angiographic data, imaging features such as angle of vertebral artery origin were calculated. Five patients underwent a stand-alone aspiration catheter technique for basilar artery occlusion through transradial access. All procedures resulted in thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 3 recanalization. The mean time to basilar artery recanalization was 10 minutes. No access site complications or vertebral artery dissection were noted. The mean subclavian artery-vertebral origin angle was 84.06° (range 78.2-90.2°). For patients selected properly based on vascular anatomy and a careful technique, a large bore aspiration catheter can fulfil a stand-alone dual-role, thus obviating the need for a guide catheter. This can potentially improve the technical feasibility and success of transradial vertebrobasilar thrombectomy.",,1820
2211,35967307,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 19 Randomized Controlled Trials of Iguratimod Combined With Other Therapies for Sjogren's Syndrome.,"To explore the efficacy and safety of Iguratimod intervention in Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS). Many databases were searched to collect the RCTs. Three independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the quality of the studies based on the Cochrane Handbook. The statistical analysis was done by RevMan 5.3 and STATA. The quality of evidence was evaluated by GRADE tool. Twenty-nine RCTs with 2258 participants were included in this review. The meta-analysis shows that: iguratimod experiment group can reduce the ESSPRI score (WMD -1.93 [-2.33, -1.52], P<0.00001), ESSDAI score (WMD -1.39 [-1.81, -0.98], P<0.00001), Schirmer's test (WMD 1.77 [0.85, 2.70], P=0.0002), RF (WMD -5.78 [-7.59, -3.97], P<0.00001), and decrease the ESR level (WMD -7.05 [-9.84, -4.26], P<0.00001). Meanwhile, the summary result showed the addiction of Iguratimod may not increase the adverse events. The adverse events were mainly gastrointestinal discomfort, abnormal liver function, and rash and itching. The quality of evidence of adverse events was moderate. Referring to minimal clinically important difference (MCID), the improvement of ESSPRI is clinically significant, and the improvement of ESSDAI for patients older than 60 years old may be clinically significant. Based on current evidence, iguratimod can effectively reduce ESSPRI score, ESSDAI score, Schirmer's test score and decrease systemic inflammatory response (such as ESR level and RF level) without increasing the probability of adverse events. The recommended course of treatment is at least 12 weeks. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?, identifier CRD42020220770.",,1821

Its diagnose is difficult due to its nonspecific and vague symptoms, and it should be differentiated from alcoholic cirrhosis and liver and pancreatic cancers. Misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis can easily occur when MPM presents with other diseases. To the best of our knowledge, no case of MPM concurrent with alcoholic cirrhosis has been reported. A 63-year-old man presented to our hospital with abdominal distension for 20days. He had a history of alcohol consumption for nearly 30 years and no history of special drug use or toxic exposure. After treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis in a community hospital, his symptoms did not improve significantly. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and surgical resection. Pathologic examination showed an epithelioid MPM. He was treated with chemotherapy and intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion after surgery. Currently, he is in a stable condition and tumor recurrence has not occurred. Misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis of MPM can easily occur because of its insidious onset. Therefore, there is a need to understand. MPM in clinical practice, make the correct diagnosis, and provide timely and effective treatment.",,1822

PM long-term characterisation allows identifying trends and evaluating the outcomes of environmental protection policies. This work is aimed to study the inter-annual variability of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations and chemical composition in an urban background site (Italy). A dataset of daily PM2.5 and PM10 was collected in the period 2016-2017, including the content of OC, EC, major water-soluble ions, main metals, and compared to a similar dataset collected in the period 2013-2014. Oxidative potential using DTT assay (dithiothreitol) was evaluated and expressed in DTTV as 0.39 nmol/min·m3 in PM10 and 0.29 in PM2.5 nmol/min·m3. PM source apportionment was computed using the EPA PMF5.0 model and source contributions compared with those of a previous dataset collected between 2013 and 2014. Multi linear regression analysis identified which source contributed (p < 0.05) to the oxidative potential of each size fraction. Inter-annual trends were more evident on PM2.5 with reductions of biomass burning contribution and increases in traffic contribution in the 2016-2017 period. Crustal contributions were similar for the two periods, in both size fractions. Carbonates were comparable in PM10 with a slight increase in PM2.5. Sea spray decreased in PM10. The DTTV of PM2.5 peaked during cold periods, while, the DTTV of the PM10-2.5 fraction peaked in summer, suggesting that different sources, with different seasonality, influence OP in the PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 fractions. Analysis showed that sea spray, crustal, and carbonates sources contribute ∼13.6% to DTTV in PM2.5 and ∼62.4% to DTTV in PM10-2.5. Combustion sources (biomass burning and traffic) contribute to the majority of DTTV (50.6%) in PM2.5 and contribute for ∼26% to DTTV in PM10-2.5. Secondary nitrate contributes to DTTV in both fine and coarse fraction; secondary sulphate contribute to DTTV in PM2.5 with negligible contributions to DTTV in PM10-2.5.",,1823

On review of previous records, negative findings were seen in microbiological studies, including acid-fast bacilli, cytology, flow cytometry, and pleural biopsy using video-assisted thoracoscopy. On transthoracic echocardiography performed during our evaluation, the expected respiratory variations across the mitral and tricuspid valves were not appreciated. This necessitated subsequent cardiac workup via magnetic resonance imaging, which showed a small pericardial fluid, thickened pericardium, and a septal bounce. The patient was surgically treated using a phrenic-to-phrenic pericardiectomy, following which his symptoms resolved completely. Pleural effusions occur in approximately 40-60% of patients with constrictive pericarditis, and despite the known association of pleural effusions with constrictive pericarditis, the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is not readily entertained in patients with undiagnosed pleural effusions.",,1824
50,35983538,Multidisciplinary care in chronic airway diseases: the Newcastle model.,"Chronic airway diseases including asthma and COPD are prevalent and high-burden conditions with the majority of patients successfully managed in the primary care setting. However, for some patients with more complex disease such as difficult-to-treat or severe asthma, or complex COPD, tertiary care is required. This review provides an overview of the successful tertiary care multidisciplinary respiratory service that operates in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, which has been integrated into the tertiary care outpatient clinics for almost three decades. The service is multifaceted in terms of the clinical care it provides; it includes an Inpatient Service, Asthma Management Service, Difficult Airways Clinic, Drug Administration Clinic, Rapid Access Clinic and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, and has an integrated research programme. The core of the multidisciplinary approach to airway diseases is a person-centred model of care, the Treatable Traits approach. The staffing of this service comprises consultant physicians, respiratory advanced trainees, respiratory scientists, physiotherapists, speech pathologists, nurse specialists and a nurse consultant. Patients that present to this service undergo an initial assessment and clinical review by team members, synthesis of relevant data, and development of a diagnosis and management plan. Based on this clinical review, specific interventions are determined according to the traits identified. Over time the service has evolved to accommodate the increasing numbers of patients requiring access to the Difficult Airways Clinic assessment and therapies. This has been facilitated by partnering with the Centres of Excellence in Severe Asthma and Treatable Traits to develop educational and practice management tools.",,1825
668,35975544,Establishment of Reference Values for Pepsinogens in Healthy Subjects of the Gansu Province: a Cross-Sectional Study.,"At present, the pepsinogen reference values applicable to subjects from Gansu province have not been established. Therefore, the current study aimed to establish reference values for PGI, PGII, and the PGI/ PGII ratio in Gansu Province, Northwest China. The present study was a cross-sectional study. Following screening in the physical examination center of Gansu Provincial Hospital, 2,130 healthy subjects were enrolled (age range 18 - 88 years; BMI range 15.35 - 38.89 kg/m2) from March 2018 to December 2020. Serum PGI and PG II concentration levels were detected by chemiluminescence. The reference values were defined according to age and gender by non-parametric 95th percentile intervals. The increase in age caused a gradual increase in the levels of PG I and PG II, while PG I/PG II ratio gradually decreased. The PG I, PG II and PG I/PG II ratio in males were significantly higher than those in females. The reference values for PG I, PG II and PG I/PG II ratio in males: < 40 years old were 22.79 - 119.79 ng/mL, 3.02 - 21.57 ng/mL, and 2.99 - 10.25, respectively; ≥ 40 years old were 17.58 - 125.12 ng/mL, 3.70 - 25.84 ng/mL, and 1.52 - 10.53, respectively. The reference values for PG I, PG II, and PG I/PG II ratio in females: < 40 years old were 22.57 - 103.90 ng/mL, 3.17 - 20.73 ng/mL, and 2.28 - 10.46, respectively; ≥ 40 years old were 14.24 - 117.81 ng/mL, 3.36 - 29.57 ng/mL, and 1.26 - 9.85, respectively.

2279,35967152,Pneumothorax in the Setting of Spinal Surgery: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"The purpose of this paper is to review the occurrence and management of a tension pneumothorax, which was exacerbated status post posterior spinal surgery. A retrospective review of intraoperative reports, imaging, and pertinent medical records was conducted for a patient who underwent posterior spinal surgery with a tiny apical pneumothorax, which subsequently developed into a major pneumothorax. The clinical signs imperative to recognition and prompt treatment are discussed. Our case report demonstrates that the unrecognized disruption of the pleural cavity during posterior spinal surgery caused the exacerbation of the patient's bilateral pneumothoraces. The patient was successfully treated with finger thoracostomy and chest tube insertion. In conclusion, posterior spinal surgery is an invasive procedure with the potential for serious complications such as the exacerbation of a previous non-surgical pneumothorax. A low index of suspicion is imperative due to the potentially lethal nature of pneumothoraces. Vital signs, pulmonary exam findings, portable radiography, and sonography equipment are all invaluable to the accurate diagnosis and early intervention of patients with pneumothoraces.",,1827
1330,35969958,'A longing for a sense of security' - Women's experiences of continuity of midwifery care in rural Sweden: A qualitative study.,"There is evidence that continuity models of midwifery care benefit women and babies in terms of less birth interventions and higher maternal satisfaction. Studies about continuity models in a Swedish context are lacking. The aim of this study was to describe how women experience continuity of midwifery care in a Swedish rural area, and thereby provide a deeper understanding of what this care entails for women. A qualitative interview study using thematic analysis was carried out. Telephone interviews were conducted with 33 women who participated in a continuity of midwifery care project in a rural area of Sweden. The overarching theme 'a longing for a sense of security', pervaded the three main themes: 'The importance of professional midwifery care', 'Continuity of midwifery - fulfilled expectations or full of disappointments' and 'New prerequisites - acceptable to some, but not a substitute for everyone', which explains different aspects affecting the feeling of security. The endeavour to feel secure during pregnancy, birth and postpartum was a continually recurring subject that cannot be overstated. Continuity of midwifery care strengthened women's feelings of security during pregnancy, birth and postpartum. The deepened relationship developed over time was a central part of the positive aspects of the experience of continuity in midwifery care. Expectations and prerequisite circumstances are important to consider when developing and introducing new care models. Service providers and decision makers should pay attention to and prioritise this relational aspect when planning care for women during the childbearing period.",,1828
1492,35968396,A pilot study of intraoperative intercostal nerve block during uniportal thoracoscopic wedge resection of the lung.,"Uniportal thoracoscopic surgery has been reported to result in alleviating the postoperative pain when compared with traditional video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). However, postoperative pain is still the main concerns associated with thoracic surgeries. The objective of this study is to evaluate the postoperative pain of patients undergoing uniportal VATS, especially wedge resection, with the use of intraoperative intercostal nerve block. All consecutive patients undergoing the uniportal VATS wedge resection between January 2019 and March 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty consecutive patients in Group A underwent the uniportal VATS wedge resection without intraoperative intercostal nerve block. The other 20 consecutive patients in Group B underwent the uniportal VATS wedge resection with intraoperative intercostal nerve block. The numeric pain rating scale (NRS) scores were recorded at 1, 12, and 24 h, postoperatively. The number of opioid consumption was also recorded until the time to chest tube removal. There was no difference between groups with regard to sex, age, chest tube duration, length of stay, operative time, laterality time, and diagnosis. There was a significant difference in postoperative NRS scores at 1 h (P = 0.001) and 12 h (P = 0.022) between the groups. The opioid consumption was significantly in Group B lower than those in Group A (P = 0.025). The intraoperative intercostal nerve block with bupivacaine provided immediate postoperative pain relief with reducing the postoperative opioid consumption compared in patients who underwent uniportal VATS, especially wedge resection of the lung.",,1829

The aim of this study is to investigate if peripheral leukocytosis following SAH impacts clinical outcomes. This is a retrospective, observational, single tertiary center study of patients with SAH who underwent microsurgical clipping between 2017 and 2020. The study's inclusion criteria were aneurysmal SAH on baseline computerized tomography (CT), age above 18 years, and hospital admission within 72 hours of bleeding. Traumatic SAH, arteriovenous malformations, and mycotic aneurysms were all excluded. On admission, leukocyte counts were recorded. Demographic and clinical variables were compared between the two groups (TLC ≤12,000 and >12,000). The impact of peripheral leukocytes on clinical outcomes in terms of the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) was analyzed. Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variable and Fisher exact test or chi-square test for categorical variables were used for calculation of P-value. A P-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. Among 90 patients who underwent clipping of ruptured aneurysms, 40 (44.4%) were anterior communicating artery (ACOMM) aneurysms, and 21 (23.3%) were middle cerebral artery(MCA), and 16 (17.8%) were posterior communicating artery (PCOMM). Clinically 57 patients (63.3%) had a World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grade 1, 17 patients (18.9%) had a grade 2, four patients (4.4%) had a grade 3, and two patients (2.2%) had a grade 4. On radiological examination, six patients (6.7%) had fisher grade 1, 23 patients (25.6%) had grade 2, 22 patients (24.4%) had grade 3, and 39 (43.4%) had grade 4 SAH distribution. Clinical results were poor in 30 individuals (33.3 %), but good in 60 patients (66.7 %). On admission leukocytosis (>12,000) was seen among 34 (37.8%). Leukocytosis (>12,000) was associated with poor WFNS grade (>2); however, statistical significance was not seen with clinical outcome in terms of GOS. Poor clinical grade of patients following aneurysmal SAH is associated with peripheral leukocytosis; however, peripheral leukocytosis is not associated with poor outcomes.",,1830
475,35978880,Four-year experience with more than 1000 cases of total laparoscopic liver resection in a single center.,"Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) has become a safe surgical procedure that needs additional summarization. To review 4 years of total LLR surgeries, exceeding 1000 cases, which were performed at a single center. Patients who underwent LLR at West China Hospital of Sichuan University between January 2015 and December 2018 were identified. Surgical details, including the interventional year, category of liver disease, and malignant liver tumors prognosis, were evaluated. The learning curve for LLR was evaluated using the cumulative sum method. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to perform survival analysis. Ultimately, 1098 patients were identified. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was the most common disease that led to the need for LLR at the center (n = 462, 42.08%). The average operation time was 216.94 ± 98.51 min. The conversion rate was 1.82% (20/1098). The complication rate was 9.20% (from grade II to V). The 1-year and 3-year overall survival rates of HCC patients were 89.7% and 81.9%, respectively. The learning curve was grouped into two phases for local resection (cases 1-106 and 107-373), three phases for anatomical segmentectomy (cases 1-44, 45-74 and 75-120), and three phases for hemihepatectomy (cases 1-17, 18-48 and 49-88). LLR may be considered a first-line surgical intervention for liver resection that can be performed safely for a variety of primary, secondary, and recurrent liver tumors and for benign diseases once technical competence is proficiently attained.",,1831

In the crystal, mol-ecules are connected along the c-axis direction via C-Br⋯π inter-actions, generating zigzag chains parallel to the (010) plane. C-H⋯N and C-H⋯O hydrogen-bonding inter-actions further connect the mol-ecules, forming a three-dimensional network and reinforcing the mol-ecular packing. Hirshfeld surface analysis indicates that the most important contributions to the crystal packing are from H⋯H (36.2%), C⋯H/H⋯C (21.6%), N⋯H/H⋯N (12.2%), and Br⋯H/H⋯Br (10.8%) inter-actions.",,1832

1763,35967961,Intraoperative Factors Associated with More Postoperative Opioid Use after Laparoscopic Hysterectomy.,To identify intraoperative factors during laparoscopic hysterectomy associated with postoperative opioid use and increased pain scores during the acute postoperative period. This is a prospective survey-based cohort study at two teaching hospitals in the Boston metropolitan area. A total of 125 patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy were enrolled. Surveys were administered by telephone at one-week postoperatively and in-person at their two-week postoperative visit to elicit opioid consumption converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) and pain scores. The median total opioid consumption was 37.5 MME (range 0-960 MMEs). Intraoperative factors associated with increased total MME consumption were lower uterine weight and resection of endometriosis at the time of surgery. Patients with uteri less than 250 grams used twice as much opioid compared to participants with uteri greater than 250 grams (median of 49.8 MME (interquartile range [IQR] 7.5-120.5) vs. 22.5 MME (IQR 7.5-61.0). The median opioid consumption by patients with resection or ablation of endometriosis was three times that of those who did not undergo surgical treatment of endometriosis (97.0 MME (IQR 53.1-281.3) vs. 30.0 MMEs (IQR 7.5-81.3 MME)). Maximum pain scores and reported pain score at one and two-week interviews were also significantly higher in patients with these characteristics. Several easily identified intraoperative factors may be correlated with opioid requirements during the acute postoperative period. This can allow surgeons to set expectations and dispense patient-specific opioid prescriptions. Individualizing prescriptions may lower the amount of excess circulating opioids and help combat the opioid epidemic.,,1834
382,35979292,Tumor-to-tumor metastasis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma to contralateral synchronous pheochromocytoma: A case report.,"Tumor-to-tumor metastasis (TTM) is an uncommon condition. Only a few cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as donor tumor of TTM have been reported in literature, and none of these studies have described RCC metastasizing to synchronous pheochromocytoma (PCC). The patient was a 54-year-old woman who presented with recurrent dull abdominal pain for six months, which was further aggravated for one more month. Enhanced computed tomography revealed a tumor mass in the right kidney and another mass in the left retroperitoneum/adrenal gland. Histopathology and immunochemistry of resected specimens confirmed the diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) of the right kidney, and the left retroperitoneum revealed a typical PCC with CCRCC metastasis. Whole exome sequencing revealed the presence of a c.529A>T somatic mutation of the Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene in the metastasized CCRCC, which was also present in the primary right kidney CCRCC, as confirmed by Sanger sequencing. No VHL mutation was detected in the PCC or in normal right kidney tissue. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed loss of chromosome 3p in both the primary right kidney CCRCC and CCRCC metastasized to PCC in the left kidney. This is the first case showing metastasis of CCRCC to PCC, thus leading to tumor-to-tumor metastasis.",,1835
341,35979402,Computing the sequence of k-cardinality assignments.,"The k-cardinality assignment (k-assignment, for short) problem asks for finding a minimal (maximal) weight of a matching of cardinality k in a weighted bipartite graph Kn,n , k≤n . Here we are interested in computing the sequence of all k-assignments, k=1,…,n . By applying the algorithm of Gassner and Klinz (2010) for the parametric assignment problem one can compute in time O(n3) the set of k-assignments for those integers k≤n which refer to essential terms of the full characteristic maxpolynomial χ¯W(x) of the corresponding max-plus weight matrix W. We show that χ¯W(x) is in full canonical form, which implies that the remaining k-assignments refer to semi-essential terms of χ¯W(x) . This property enables us to efficiently compute in time O(n2) all the remaining k-assignments out of the already computed essential k-assignments. It follows that time complexity for computing the sequence of all k-cardinality assignments is O(n3) , which is the best known time for this problem.",,1836
732,35975146,Understanding the factors governing the water oxidation reaction pathway of mononuclear and binuclear cobalt phthalocyanine catalysts.,"The rational design of efficient catalysts for electrochemical water oxidation highly depends on the understanding of reaction pathways, which still remains a challenge. Herein, mononuclear and binuclear cobalt phthalocyanine (mono-CoPc and bi-CoPc) with a well-defined molecular structure are selected as model electrocatalysts to study the water oxidation mechanism. We found that bi-CoPc on a carbon support (bi-CoPc/carbon) shows an overpotential of 357 mV at 10 mA cm-2, much lower than that of mono-CoPc/carbon (>450 mV). Kinetic analysis reveals that the rate-determining step (RDS) of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over both electrocatalysts is a nucleophilic attack process involving a hydroxy anion (OH-). However, the substrate nucleophilically attacked by OH- for bi-CoPc is the phthalocyanine cation-radical species (CoII-Pc-Pc˙+-CoII-OH) that is formed from the oxidation of the phthalocyanine ring, while cobalt oxidized species (Pc-CoIII-OH) is involved in mono-CoPc as evidenced by the operando UV-vis spectroelectrochemistry technique. DFT calculations show that the reaction barrier for the nucleophilic attack of OH- on CoII-Pc-Pc˙+-CoII-OH is 1.67 eV, lower than that of mono-CoPc with Pc-CoIII-OH nucleophilically attacked by OH- (1.78 eV). The good agreement between the experimental and theoretical results suggests that bi-CoPc can effectively stabilize the accumulated oxidative charges in the phthalocyanine ring, and is thus bestowed with a higher OER performance.",,1837
1286,35970728,Pharmacist-led telehealth tobacco cessation services compared with usual care in a community health center.,"Previous studies regarding tobacco cessation services (TCS) concluded that pharmacist interventions lead to higher or similar quit rates compared with usual care; however, little is known about patient satisfaction with these services. This study assessed 30-day point prevalence abstinence and patient satisfaction of TCS provided by pharmacists compared with primary care providers (PCPs) in a community health center. Secondary objectives assessed the number of encounters and time spent counseling and medications prescribed at each visit. Patients at the age of 18 years or older with tobacco use disorder and a new quit attempt were invited to complete a 9-question survey via e-mail, phone, and mail 7 months after their initial tobacco cessation visit. The survey assessed 30-day point prevalence abstinence and patient satisfaction. Chart reviews were conducted to assess time spent counseling and prescribing patterns. The response rate was 38.8% (50/129) overall, 43.9% in the pharmacist group and 36.3% in the PCP group. A 30-day point prevalence abstinence was reached by 22.2% (4/18) in the pharmacist group and 9.4% (3/32) in the PCP group (P = 0.23). Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the pharmacist group with regard to discussion around medications used to quit smoking (100% vs. 65.6%, P = 0.004), understanding how to properly use the medications (100% vs. 62.5%, P = 0.002), identifying behavioral changes to assist with quitting (94.4% vs. 65.6%, P = 0.036), and frequent follow-up visits (83.3% vs. 46.9%, P = 0.016). Pharmacists spent more time counseling patients and were more likely to prescribe dual nicotine replacement therapy and prescription medications. There was not a statistically significant difference in abstinence rates, and patient satisfaction with TCS provided by pharmacists and PCPs was high. Pharmacists provide a more intensive service by spending more time counseling patients and providing more follow-ups and are more likely to diversify medications prescribed to quit smoking.",,1838
1422,35968478,Mental health problems and needs of frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: A qualitative analysis.,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19 hotspots worldwide have reported poor mental health outcomes since the pandemic's beginning. The virulence of the initial COVID-19 surge in Spain and the urgency for rapid evidence constrained early studies in their capacity to inform mental health programs accurately. Here, we used a qualitative research design to describe relevant mental health problems among frontline HCWs and explore their association with determinants and consequences and their implications for the design and implementation of mental health programs. Following the Programme Design, Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation (DIME) protocol, we used a two-step qualitative research design to interview frontline HCWs, mental health experts, administrators, and service planners in Spain. We used Free List (FL) interviews to identify problems experienced by frontline HCWs and Key informant (KI) interviews to describe them and explore their determinants and consequences, as well as the strategies considered useful to overcome these problems. We used a thematic analysis approach to analyze the interview outputs and framed our results into a five-level social-ecological model (intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public health). We recruited 75 FL and 22 KI interviewees, roughly balanced in age and gender. We detected 56 themes during the FL interviews and explored the following themes in the KI interviews: fear of infection, psychological distress, stress, moral distress, and interpersonal conflicts among coworkers. We found that interviewees reported perceived causes and consequences across problems at all levels (intrapersonal to public health). Although several mental health strategies were implemented (especially at an intrapersonal and interpersonal level), most mental health needs remained unmet, especially at the organizational, community, and public policy levels. In keeping with available quantitative evidence, our findings show that mental health problems are still relevant for frontline HCWs 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic and that many reported causes of these problems are modifiable. Based on this, we offer specific recommendations to design and implement mental health strategies and recommend using transdiagnostic, low-intensity, scalable psychological interventions contextually adapted and tailored for HCWs.",,1839
547,35978602,Objective Response by mRECIST to Initial Lenvatinib Therapy Is an Independent Factor Contributing to Deep Response in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated with Lenvatinib-Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization Sequential Therapy.,"There is limited information regarding the benefits of Lenvatinib-transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (LEN-TACE) sequential therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC). We compared the efficacy and safety of LEN-TACE sequential therapy to LEN monotherapy and investigated the factors contributing to the LEN-TACE sequential therapy deep response. We enrolled a multicenter cohort of 247 patients with u-HCC treated with LEN between 2018 and 2020. Propensity score matching identified 63 matching pairs of patients with well-balanced characteristics. We retrospectively compared the clinical outcomes, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and incidence of adverse events (AEs), between the LEN-TACE and LEN monotherapy groups. Additionally, we evaluated the tumor response, change in albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, factors affecting PFS and OS, and independent predictors contributing to the LEN-TACE sequential therapy deep response. In this study, at eight weeks after resumption of LEN after initial TACE, deep response was defined as achieving complete response or partial response (PR) on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), and at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking the baseline sum diameters as the reference. The OS and PFS in the LEN-TACE group were significantly higher than those in the LEN monotherapy group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.037, respectively). The incidence of AEs related to LEN was not significantly different between the two groups. In LEN-TACE sequential therapy, the objective response rate was 61.9%, and the disease control rate was 74.6%, according to the mRECIST criteria. No significant change in the ALBI score was observed during sequential LEN-TACE therapy. Multivariable analyses revealed that deep response was independently associated with the outcome of the initial response to LEN by mRECIST: PR (odds ratio: 5.176, 95% confidence interval: 1.528-17.537, p < 0.001). LEN-TACE sequential therapy may provide more clinical benefits than LEN monotherapy in u-HCC patients who responded to initial LEN treatment. Objective response according to mRECIST to initial LEN is an independent factor contributing to LEN-TACE sequential therapy deep response.",,1840
109,35983345,Cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics in healthy pediatric subjects.,"To evaluate cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, using cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (cine-PC MRI), in healthy pediatric subjects, determining the normal flow values in this population, as well as identifying differences related to age, sex, and body surface area. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving 32 healthy children and adolescents, in whom the flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the cerebral aqueduct was evaluated quantitatively with cine-PC MRI. We used specialized software to analyze the images obtained with cine-PC MRI, drawing a region of interest on the aqueduct. A flow-time curve was obtained, as were automated measurements of the various parameters. The following normal (mean) values were obtained: net flow, 1.10 ± 0.99 mL/m; stroke volume, 12.2 ± 10.1 µL/cycle; mean velocity, 0.72 ± 1.00 cm/s; peak systolic velocity, 5.28 ± 2.30 cm/s; peak diastolic velocity, 4.51 ± 1.77 cm/s. These values were not affected by age or sex. In addition, body surface area was not found to correlate significantly with mean velocity or stroke volume. In children and adolescents, the basic cerebrospinal fluid flow parameters, as determined by cine-PC MRI, appear to be independent of age and sex. Avaliar a dinâmica do fluxo do líquido cerebrospinal por cine-ressonância magnética com contraste de fase em crianças saudáveis, para determinar os valores normais de fluxo nesta população, bem como a diferença entre medições distintas de acordo com idade, sexo ou área da superfície corporal. Convocamos 32 crianças saudáveis em uma análise descritiva de prevalência para a avaliação quantitativa do fluxo do líquido cerebrospinal pelo aqueduto de Sylvius. A análise foi realizada por meio de software especializado, desenhando uma região de interesse no aqueduto. Uma curva de fluxo-tempo e medições automáticas de diversos parâmetros foram obtidas. Os seguintes valores normais foram obtidos: fluxo efetivo de 1,10 ± 0,99 mL/m; volume médio de 12,2 ± 10,1 µL/ciclo; velocidade média de 0,72 ± 1,00 cm/s; pico de velocidade sistólica de 5,28 ± 2,30 cm/s; pico de velocidade diastólica de 4,51 ± 1,77 cm/s. Esses valores não foram afetados pela idade ou sexo das crianças. Além disso, não foi encontrada correlação significativa entre a área corporal, a velocidade média e o volume sistólico. De modo geral, os parâmetros básicos do fluxo do líquido cerebrospinal independem de idade e sexo em crianças.",,1841
1827,35967813,Prognostic value of the controlling nutritional status score in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous spectrum of clonal hematopoietic disorders with varying degrees of cytopenia and morphologic dysplasia. The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, an easy-to-use tool for assessing the nutritional status, was reported as an independent prognostic factor in cancer patients. However, its role in patients with MDS is unclear. We aimed to explore the impact of CONUT score on the prognosis of patients with MDS, which is of great significance for clinical treatment. A total of 121 patients with MDS were analyzed. The CONUT score was calculated prior to therapy. The bio-informatics tool X-tile was used to define the CONUT score and the threshold of 4 points was determined to predict the prognosis. Patients were divided into CONUTlow and CONUThigh groups, and the characteristics were compared between two groups. Results show that CONUTlow was associated with better overall survival (OS) than CONUThigh patients (Median OS, 30.20 vs. 19.63 months, p = 0.0003). However, there were no statistical differences in progression-free survival (PFS) between the two groups (p = 0.2683). Results of univariate and multivariate COX proportional hazard analysis adjusted for bone marrow blasts level, platelet count, International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) scores, gender, and hemoglobin (Hb) level showed that the CONUT score was useful in the evaluation standard of OS of MDS (hazard ratio (HR) 2.297, 95% CI 1.441-3.663, p < 0.001). The CONUT, as a novel immuno-nutritional biomarker, may be useful in predicting the OS of MDS.",,1842
806,35975019,"Renin-angiotensin system antagonists and mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lower respiratory disease in patients with hypertension.","It is controversial whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) have a potentially beneficial role in the respiratory system. This study investigated the association between ACEI/ARB medications and respiratory-related mortality in hypertensive patients in a real-world nationally representative cohort. This was a retrospective analysis based on a prospective cohort study. A total of 10,530 patients with hypertension aged ≥ 20 years were included. The data was extracted from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1988-1994 and 1999-2006. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards. Moreover, inform concent was taken form all the participants. Overall, 27.7% (n = 2920) patients took ACEI/ARB agents. During a median follow-up of 12.4 years, 278 individuals died of respiratory disease, including chronic lower respiratory disease (n = 155) and inﬂuenza or pneumonia (n = 123). Compared with the patients without ACEI/ARB use, those taking ACEI/ARB were not associated with respiratory-specific mortality in a multivariable-adjusted Cox model. After 1: 1 matching, taking ACEI/ARB was also not related to respiratory mortality (Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.79-1.43), inﬂuenza- or pneumonia-related (HR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.65-1.54) and chronic pulmonary mortality (HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.75-1.69). After separating ACEI and ARB from anti-hypertensive medications, those associations remained unchanged. We discovered no significant link between ACEI or ARB medication and pulmonary-related mortality in hypertensive patients. In hypertensive patients, standard ACEI/ARB administration may have little effect on the respiratory system.",,1843
617,35977782,Snared in an Evil Time: How Age-Dependent Environmental and Demographic Variability Contribute to Variance in Lifetime Outcomes.,"AbstractTo what degree is lifetime success determined by innate individual quality versus external events and random chance, whether success is measured by lifetime reproductive output, life span, years that a tree spends in the canopy, or some other measure? And how do external events and chance interact with development (survival and growth) to drive success? To answer these questions, we extend our earlier age partitioning of luck in lifetime outcomes in two ways: we incorporate effects of external environmental variation, and we subdivide demographic luck into contributions from survival and growth. Applying our methods to four case studies, we find that luck in survival, in growth, or in environmental variation can all be the dominant driver of success, depending on life history, but variation in individual quality remains a lesser driver. Luck in its various forms is most important at very early ages and again close to the time when individuals typically first begin to be successful (e.g., entering the canopy, reaching reproductive maturity), but different forms of luck peak at different times. For example, a favorable year can boost a tree into the canopy, while luck in survival is required to take full advantage of that fortunate event.",,1844
1557,35968329,The clinicopathological features and treatments of odontogenic keratocysts.,"An odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) is a benign but aggressive intraosseous tumor derived from the remains of the original tooth germ or dental lamina. It has a marked ability to recur and become cancerous. However, patients with early-stage OKC often have no symptoms and manifestations. The common clinical manifestation is swelling. Hence, it is critical to precisely diagnose the disease, to use differential diagnosis in combination with auxiliary examination methods, and to select the most appropriate treatment option to reduce the loss of bone tissue and the related damage to patients. In recent years, with the advancement in understanding the molecular basis of this disease and the development of early detection and targeted therapy, the diagnosis and the prognosis of OKC have been improved. The aim of this study was to provide an overview on the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of OKC. The molecular and genetic basis of this disease and the characteristics of malignant transformation of OKC were also discussed. Finally, we presented patient cases from our clinical practice to provide some advice on the diagnosis and treatment of OKC.",,1845
665,35975593,A comprehensive review of fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control techniques for modular multi-level converters.,"Many faults occur in the modular multi-level converters (MMCs), including unbalancing capacitor voltage, lower and upper arm unbalancing, the line to line voltage unbalancing, sensors and actuators fault, system fault, and sub-modules fault in high as well as medium voltage applications. Several fault-tolerant approaches are presented to overcome these problems, such as active fault-tolerant control system (AFTCS), passive fault-tolerant control system (PFTCS), hybrid fault-tolerant control system (HFTCS), redundant system technique, special power circuit with the controller, and zero sequence voltage methods, which we will explain extensively in this article. This review emphasizes the types of faults in the MMCs and discusses the protection methods under failure conditions. The MMC is more popular in high voltage applications because it not only improves the quality of the grid but also has good harmonic performance in high power transmission. There is no need for any isolated dc sources to operate it. When faults are removed, the efficiency and reliability of the system will be increased. This extensive explanation of the current literature on MMC fault diagnosis and control techniques will conclude which methods provide a more valuable solution. Finally, this paper discusses the best approach to reduce MMC faults and provides a future research direction to the readers.",,1846
504,35978755,Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Adults Undergoing Surgery for Brain Tumors.,"Introduction Early diagnosis and treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can improve outcomes. HIV prevalence in brain tumor patients and the impact of an HIV diagnosis on patient outcomes are poorly understood. Materials and methods This was a prospective study of 100 consecutive brain tumor patients admitted to a Greater London Tertiary Neurosurgical center for surgery between January 2021 and October 2021. All brain tumors were included. All patients have appropriately consented. Blood was tested to detect HIV antibodies and p24 antigen. Outcomes were noted at 30-day postoperative follow-up. Results In 100 patients, there was one case of a known HIV-positive, seronegative patient, and no new diagnosis was made, giving a prevalence of 1%. The mean age of patients included was 61.7 ± 13.3, with 57% female. The patient with HIV suffered a postoperative pseudomonas infection, requiring intensive care, additional surgery, and antibiotics. This resulted in an inpatient stay of 55 days - an increase of 274% compared to patients without HIV. Conclusion Literature regarding the prevalence of HIV in glioma patients is inconclusive, of low quality, and primarily out-of-date. Our literature search found no similar study of rates of HIV in brain tumor patients in the United Kingdom. The incidence of both HIV and brain tumors, particularly glioblastomas, is low.",,1847
2303,35967078,Securing future healthcare environments in a post-COVID-19 world: moving from frameworks to prototypes.,"The deployment of Internet of Things platforms as well as the use of mobile and wireless technologies to support healthcare environments have enormous potential to transform healthcare. This has also led to a desire to make eHealth and mHealth part of national healthcare systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the requirement to do this to reduce the number of patients needing to attend hospitals and General Practitioner surgeries. This direction, however, has resulted in a renewed need to look at security of future healthcare platforms including information and data security as well as network and cyber-physical security. There have been security frameworks that were developed to address such issues. However, it is necessary to develop a security framework with a combination of security mechanisms that can be used to provide all the essential security requirements for healthcare systems. In addition, there is now a need to move from frameworks to prototypes which is the focus of this paper. Several security frameworks for eHealth and mHealth are first examined. This leads to a new reference model from which an implementation framework is developed using new mechanisms such as Capabilities, Secure Remote Procedure Calls, and a Service Management Framework. The prototype is then evaluated against practical security requirements.",,1848
279,35981944,The gendered impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academics working in medical imaging and radiation therapy.,"Healthcare workers have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as have those educating them, albeit differently. Several papers have identified a gendered difference in the impact of the pandemic. This study aims to determine impact of COVID-19 on the health and wellbeing of Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy (MIRT) academics. An electronic survey was designed in English on Qualtrics and distributed via email and online platforms to MIRT academics. Fifty-one questions were used; demographic (n = 9), work patterns (n = 11), general health (n = 8), mental health (n = 2), physical health (n = 10), and workload (n = 11). Overall, 46 were quantitative and five were qualitative 'open-ended' questions. The survey was open between 3rd March 2021 to 1st May 2021. Quantitative analysis was carried out using MS Excel v 16.61.1ss and SPSS v26. The survey reached 32 countries globally and 412 participants; 23.5% identified as men (n = 97) and 76.5% as women (n = 315). Women reported worse sleep quality than men and overwhelmingly felt they would not like to work remotely again if given a choice. A higher percentage of males, 73% versus 40.5% of females reported getting outdoors less. The CORE-10 validated questionnaire found that 10.3% of males (n = 42) and 2.7% of females (n = 11) experienced severe psychological distress the week immediately before the survey was conducted. While the study has identified some gender-related differences in the impact of COVID-19 on the mental and physical health of MIRT academics, both males and females have experienced significant deterioration in health and wellbeing due to the pandemic. Developing mental health support for MIRT academics and defining optimum methods for raising awareness is recommended.",,1849
735,35975143,Chiral oxazolidines acting as transient hydroxyalkyl-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbenes: an efficient route to air stable copper and gold complexes for asymmetric catalysis.,"Optically pure oxazolidines were synthesized in nearly quantitative yields from chiral hydroxyalkyl-functionalized imidazolinium salts. Acting as transient chiral diamino N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), these oxazolidines allowed the efficient formation of well-defined copper(i) and gold(i) hydroxyalkyl-NHC complexes, which could be isolated, for the first time, as air stable complexes after silica gel chromatography. Interestingly, X-ray analysis of gold complexes revealed that the hydroxyl-function is not chelated to the metal. Computational studies suggested that both cyclisation to produce oxazolidine and O-H bond elimination to form the transient carbene (prior to coordination) occur through a concerted mechanism. The novel chiral copper-catalysts, as well as oxazolidines alone (copper free), demonstrated excellent performances in asymmetric conjugate addition and allylic alkylation with high regio- and enantio-selectivities (up to 99% ee).",,1850
1233,35971412,Combining X-ray and NMR Crystallography to Explore the Crystallographic Disorder in Salbutamol Oxalate.,"Salbutamol is an active pharmaceutical ingredient commonly used to treat respiratory distress and is listed by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine. Here, we establish the crystal structure of its oxalate form, salbutamol oxalate, and explore the nature of its crystallographic disorder by combined X-ray crystallography and 13C cross-polarization (CP) magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR. The *C-OH chiral center of salbutamol (note that the crystal structures are a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers of salbutamol) is disordered over two positions, and the tert-butyl group is rotating rapidly, as revealed by 13C solid-state NMR. The impact of crystallization conditions on the disorder was investigated, finding variations in the occupancy ratio of the *C-OH chiral center between single crystals and a consistency across samples in the bulk powder. Overall, this work highlights the contrast between investigating crystallographic disorder by X-ray diffraction and solid-state NMR experiment, and gauge-including projector-augmented-wave (GIPAW) density functional theory (DFT) calculations, with their combined use, yielding an improved understanding of the nature of the crystallographic disorder between the local (i.e., as viewed by NMR) and longer-range periodic (i.e., as viewed by diffraction) scale.",,1851
2403,35966950,Data on the techno-economic and financial analyses of hybrid renewable energy systems in 634 Philippine off-grid islands.,"This data article contains the location, energy consumption, renewable energy potential, techno-economics, and profitability of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) in 634 Philippine off-grid islands. The HRES under consideration consists of solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, lithium-ion batteries, and diesel generators. The islands were identified from Google Maps™, Bing Maps™, and the study of Meschede and Ocon et al. (2019) [1]. The peak loads of these islands were acquired from National Power Corporation - Small Power Utilities Group (NPC-SPUG), if available, or estimated from the island population otherwise. Hourly-resolution load profiles were synthesized using the normalized profiles reported by Bertheau and Blechinger (2018) [2]. Existing diesel generators in the islands were compiled from reports by NPC-SPUG, while monthly average global horizontal irradiance and wind speeds were taken from the Phil-LIDAR 2 database. Islands that are electrically interconnected were lumped into one microgrid, so the 634 islands were grouped into 616 microgrids. The HRES were optimized using Island System LCOEmin Algorithm (ISLA), our in-house energy systems modeling tool, which sized the energy components to minimize the net present cost. The component sizes and corresponding techno-economic metrics of the optimized HRES in each microgrid are included in the dataset. In addition, the net present value, internal rate of return, payback period, and subsidy requirements of the microgrid are reported at five different electricity rates. This data is valuable for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders who are working to provide sustainable energy access to off-grid communities. A comprehensive analysis of the data can be found in our article Techno-economic and Financial Analyses of Hybrid Renewable Energy System Microgrids in 634 Philippine Off-grid Islands: Policy Implications on Public Subsidies and Private Investments [3].",,1852
393,35979281,Penile metastasis from rectal carcinoma: A case report.,"Metastasis to the penis is an unusual event, and penile metastasis from rectal carcinoma (PMRC) is extremely rare and associated with a dismal prognosis. Thus far, approximately 80 cases have been reported. Herein, we report the case of a 49-year-old man with PMRC. The patient presented to the urology clinic with a complaint of penile pain during urination. The patient underwent the Dixon operation for rectal carcinoma 2 mo before the presentation. During hospitalisation, abdominal computed tomography revealed a nodular lesion on the left penis. The postoperative pathological examination revealed a typical intestinal-type adenocarcinoma. Previous cases of PMRC were retrieved from PubMed to characterise the clinicopathological features and identify the prognostic factors of PMRC. The analysis suggested that approximately 24 mo is the median time to metastasis occurrence and 150 d is the survival time after diagnosis. Furthermore, poor pathological differentiation, lymph node involvement of the primary RC, metastasis time < 6 mo, penile metastatic nodule diameter > 1 cm, and treatment abandonment are negative predictors of survival outcomes. Close follow-up, surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy may potentially improve the prognosis of patients.",,1853
876,35974847,Demographics and Academic Productivity of Cardiothoracic Imaging Fellowship Program Directors in the United States: A Cross-Sectional Review.,"Background In this study, we aimed to assess current demographics, measures of academic productivity, and other objective leadership characteristics among United States cardiothoracic imaging fellowship directors (FDs). Methodology A survey was sent to active members listed in the Society of Thoracic Radiology Cardiothoracic Imaging Fellowship Directory. Demographic, post-graduate training, and scholarly activity data were collected, including, but not limited to, age, sex, residency and fellowship training institutions, time since training completion until FD, length of time as FD, and Hirsch-index (h-index) to measure research activity. Results We identified 53 FDs from 50 cardiothoracic imaging fellowship programs. Of these, 31 (58.5%) were male and 22 (41.5%) were female with an average age of 48.5 years (standard deviation (SD) = 8.4, range = 35-67). There was no statistically significant difference between the mean age of male and female FDs (47.5 vs 50.2 years, p = 0.2811). The mean age of appointment to the FD role was 41.8 years. On average, FDs graduated from residency in 2005 and 2007 for fellowships. Most attended allopathic medical schools (52/53, 98.1%). The average Scopus h-index was 15.7 (SD = 17.4). Gender-wise comparison of mean h-indices revealed 16.2 for males and 15 for females, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.81). Ten (18.9%) FDs and 20 (37.7%) FDs were at the same location they completed residency and fellowship training, respectively. Conclusions This cross-sectional study shows the present demographics within the cardiothoracic radiology FD position. This field of radiology is observed to have FDs with research productivity that is comparable with other medical specialties. Some radiology residency and fellowship programs were shown to produce more FDs than others; however, we were not able to identify causality. Program directors appear to be selected from a familiar pool of applicants, and ultimately FDs are being replaced by individuals with similar distinctions. Overall, this research into cardiothoracic radiology FDs demographics and research productivity can add to the current body of literature on FDs in various medical specialties. It is important to continue to reflect on medical leadership as the field continues to advance.",,1854
258,35982572,Potentiality of recovering bioresource from food waste through multi-stage Co-digestion with enzymatic pretreatment.,"Food waste (FW) is not only a major social, nutritional and environmental issue, but also an underutilized resource with significant energy, which has not been fully explored currently. Considering co-digestion can adjust carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of the feedstock and improve the synergetic interactions among microorganisms, anaerobic co-digestion (AnCoD) is then becoming an emerging approach to achieve higher energy recovery from FW while ensuring the stability of the system. To obtain higher economic gain from such biodegradable wastes, increasing attention has been paid on optimizing the system configuration or applying enzymatic hydrolysis before digesting FW. A better understanding on the potentiality of correlating enzymatic pretreatment and AnCoD operated in various system configuration would enhance the bioresource recovery from FW and increase revenue through treating this organic waste. Specifically, the biobased chemicals outputs from FW-related co-digestion system with different configuration were firstly compared in this review. A deep discussion concerning the challenges for achieving bioresources recovery from FW co-digestion systems with enzymatic pretreatment was then given. Recommendations for future studies regarding FW co-digestion were then proposed at last.",,1855
1458,35968440,Impact of maternal neuraxial labor analgesia exposure on offspring's neurodevelopment: A longitudinal prospective cohort study with propensity score matching.,"Neuraxial analgesia is widely used to relieve labor pain; its effects on long-term neurodevelopment of offspring remain unclear. This study was designed to investigate the influence of maternal neuraxial labor analgesia on offspring mental development. This was a predefined secondary analysis of a 2-year prospective longitudinal study. Nulliparous women with single-term cephalic pregnancy preparing for vaginal delivery self-selected neuraxial analgesia or not during labor. Mothers and their offspring were followed up 2 years later. children's mental development was assessed with the bayley scales of infant development. A multivariable logistic model was used to identify factors associated with below-average mental development (Mental Development Index <90). A Total of 508 pairs of mothers and children completed a 2-year follow-up. after propensity score matching, 387 pairs were included in the analysis. In both cohorts, the proportions with below-average mental development were slightly lower in children whose mothers received neuraxial labor analgesia, although not statistically significant [in the full cohort: 9.8 % (36/368) vs. 15.7% (22/140), P = 0.060; In the matched cohort: 8.3% (21/254) vs. 14.3% (19/133), P = 0.065]. A higher 2-year depression score (in the full cohort: Odds Ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.08-1.22, P < 0.001; In the matched cohort: Odds Ratio 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18, P = 0.037), but not neuraxial analgesia exposure, was associated with an increased risk of below-average mental development. Maternal depression at 2 years was associated with the risk of below-average mental development, whereas maternal exposure to neuraxial labor analgesia was not. The study was registered with www.chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR-OCH-14004888) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02823418).",,1856
2357,35967019,IR-Spectroscopic and X-ray-Structural Study of Vinyl-Type Carbocations in Their Carborane Salts.,"The butylene carbocation in its salts with anions CHB11F11 - and CHB11Cl11 - forms isomers CH2=C+-CH2-CH3 (I) and CH3-C+=CH-CH3 (II), which were characterized here by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. The strongest influence on the structure of the cations is exerted by geometric ordering of their anionic environment. In the crystalline phase, the cations uniformly interact with neighboring anions, and the C=C bond is located in the middle part of the cations forming a -CH=C+- moiety with the highest positive charge on it and the lowest νC=C frequency, at 1490 cm-1. In the amorphous phase with a disordered anionic environment of the cations, contact ion pairs Anion-···CH2=C+-CH2-CH3 form predominantly, with terminal localization of the C=C bond through which the contact occurs. The positive charge is slightly extinguished by the anion, and the C=C stretch frequency is higher by ∼100 cm-1. The replacement of the hydrogen atom in cations I/II by a Cl atom giving rise to cations CH2=C+-CHCl-CH3 and CH3-C+=CCl-CH3 means that the donation of electron density from the Cl atom quenches the positive charge on the C+=C bond more strongly, and the C=C stretch frequency increases so much that it even exceeds that of neutral alkene analogues by 35-65 cm-1. An explanation is given for the finding that upon stabilization of the vinyl cations by polyatomic substituents such as silylium (SiMe3) and t-Bu groups, the stretching C=C frequency approaches the triple-bond frequency. Namely, the scattering of a positive charge on these substituents enhances their donor properties so much that the electron density on the C=C bond with a weakened charge becomes much higher than that of neutral alkenes.",,1857
1282,35970740,Functional recoverability post-pyeloplasty in children with ureteropelvic junction obstruction and poorly functioning kidneys: Systematic review.,"The management of poorly functioning kidneys (PFK) associated with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is controversial. There is contradictory information about how to best manage these cases: pyeloplasty or nephrectomy? To systematically summarize the available evidence concerning the effects of pyeloplasty on the differential renal function of PFK in children with unilateral UPJO, highlighting the ongoing challenges in their definition, management, and long-term follow-up. In addition, we aim to verify potential predictors of renal functional recoverability that could help clinicians choose candidates for pyeloplasty. We searched several databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library CENTRAL until August 20, 2021, according to the PRISMA guidelines. The following concepts were searched: pediatric, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, UPJO, pyeloplasty, recovery, split renal function, and differential renal function. We enrolled studies where the PFK was defined as preoperative differential renal function (DRF) ≤30% by renal scintigraphy. Potential predictors of renal functional recoverability were assessed and compared among studies. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). 1499 citations perceived as relevant to screening were retrieved. After screening, 20 studies were included, comprising a total of 625 cases. The number of patients in each study varied between 5 and 84, while the average post-surgical follow-up duration ranged between 3 months and 180 months. The most significant preoperative predictive factor for postoperative functional recoverability was the baseline DRF, especially when antenatally diagnosed. The quality was considered average in a significant portion of included studies. A significant proportion of PFK showed an increase of DRF post-pyeloplasty. However, no consistent predictive factors for functional recoverability have yet been determined apart from preoperative DRF. Until further evidence appears, pyeloplasty should be considered a valid option in the armamentarium of UPJO management in PFK.",,1858
1884,35967728,Psychological factors of college students' learning pressure under the online education mode during the epidemic.,"The emergence of the network environment is the product of the combination of the development of computer technology and the development of network technology. Internet technology is slowly penetrating into all aspects of people's lives and has had a huge impact and change on people's lives. With the repeated outbreak of the epidemic in recent years, online education has been increasingly applied to the study and life of college students. The epidemic has lasted for 3 years, while the life of college students is only 4 years. In recent years, most of the campus study and life of college students have been carried out in the online education mode. This not only changed the mode of class, but also changed the mental health of college students. Taking the online education model during the epidemic as the research background, this paper selects the psychological factors of college students' learning pressure to analyze, combined with the design and implementation of the questionnaire, to understand the impact of online education on college students' cognition, emotion, willpower, and social interaction. The purpose is to find out the psychological factors of college students' learning pressure under the online education mode, and to propose effective solutions. The analysis of the psychological factors of college students' learning pressure in the form of questionnaires is more accurate than other forms of experimental investigation, the efficiency is increased by 32%, and the accuracy is also increased by 18%.",,1859
332,35979526,Treatment of Fingernail Onychomycosis with Efinaconazole 10% Solution in a Patient with Scleroderma: A Case Report.,"Oral antifungals are typically preferred over topicals for moderate to severe onychomycosis due to efficacy and shorter treatment courses. However, systemics are contraindicated or cautioned in patients with liver dysfunction and with some autoimmune diseases, and in those taking interacting medications. Efinaconazole 10% solution is a topical antifungal therapy, but application for fingernail onychomycosis has not been adequately studied. We present a case of a 78-year-old female with scleroderma and moderate onychomycosis of the right 4th fingernail successfully treated with topical efinaconazole 10% solution. We review the literature on contraindications to oral antifungals for onychomycosis, precautions with terbinafine in patients with some autoimmune diseases, and topical onychomycosis therapies. Topical efinaconazole may represent an effective alternative for patients with fingernail onychomycosis who have contraindications to oral medications.",,1860
240,35982773,Maternal Warning Signs Education During Home Visiting: Results from a Formative Evaluation in Maryland.,"Maternal mortality rate reviews have identified the need for improved patient education regarding the warning signs of maternal complications to reduce preventable deaths. Maternal and child home visiting programs have the potential to deliver this education in communities. This study sought to evaluate the baseline provision of warning signs education among home visiting programs in Maryland and to assess the acceptability of and preferences for warning signs education materials among program staff. This sequential exploratory, mixed-methods study included qualitative interviews and focus group discussions followed by a web-based survey of all home visiting programs providing early postpartum visits in Maryland. Twenty-five home visiting program staff took part in qualitative data collection, and survey responses were submitted by a manager from 40 of 58 eligible home visiting programs (69% response rate). All survey respondents agreed that home visiting programs should provide warning signs education and more than 80% of programs provided some warning signs education during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Printed pamphlets were provided by 68% of programs for pregnancy complications and 43% for postpartum complications. Only 33% of respondents were satisfied with their existing warnings signs education materials; 98% were interested in new illustrated pamphlets and 88% were interested in education videos. Qualitative participants considered pamphlets with simple designs, limited text, and visuals, as the most accessible for home visiting clients. There are opportunities to strengthen and expand warning signs education in Maryland through home visiting programs using new printed and video education materials.",,1861
2450,35966842,Association between chronic disease multimorbidity and leisure-time physical activity: Evidence from the China Multiethnic Cohort study.,"To reveal the associations between multimorbidity and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) by ethnicities in China. Self-reported information on a range of occupational, household, transport, and LTPA was collected by interviewer-administered questionnaire. A total of 17 chronic diseases were assessed based on self-reported lifetime diagnoses or medical examinations. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between multimorbidity and the risks of low LTPA. The mean age of all participants was 51.2 years old. Of all, 61.4% were women and 57.9% were from the Han population. A significantly negative association (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.89-0.95) was found between multimorbidity and low LTPA, with a stronger association among minority populations (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.82-0.91) than among the Han population (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.92-1.01). For both the minority population and the Han population, digestive system multimorbidity and digestive-metabolic system multimorbidity had a significantly negative association with low LTPA. For the Han population, the association of intersystem multimorbidity for the circulatory-respiratory system (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.04-1.31) with low LTPA was stronger than that of intrasystem multimorbidity for the circulatory (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01-1.25) and respiratory systems (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.04-1.25). There are significant associations between multimorbidity and low LTPA based on this large multiethnic population. Our findings suggest that LTPA-tailored interventions should be designed for specific ethnic groups according to different types of multimorbidity.",,1862
158,35983124,Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy for moderate to highly complex renal masses. A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Multiple studies have been published recently assessing feasibility of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) for moderate to highly complex renal masses. Some studies have even compared partial nephrectomy (PN) performed through various modalities such as open PN (OPN) versus RAPN and laparoscopic PN (LPN) versus OPN. The primary aim of this review was to analyze perioperative outcomes such as warm ischemia time (WIT), duration of surgery, estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, blood transfusion, length of stay, and margin status following RAPN for complex renal masses. Another objective was to compare perioperative outcomes following various surgical modalities, i.e., OPN, LPN, or RAPN. Literature search was conducted to identify studies reporting perioperative outcomes following RAPN for moderate (Radius, Endophytic/Exophytic, Nearness, Anterior/posterior location [RENAL] score 7-9 or Preoperative Aspects of Dimension used for anatomic classification [PADUA] score 8-9) to high complexity renal masses (RENAL or PADUA score ≥ 10). Meta-analysis of robotic versus OPN and robotic versus LPN was also performed. Study protocol was registered with PROPSERO (CRD42019121259). In this review, 22 studies including 2,659 patients were included. Mean duration of surgery, WIT, and EBL was 132.5-250.8 min, 15.5-30 min, and 100-321 ml, respectively. From pooled analysis, positive surgical margin, need for blood transfusion, minor and major complications were seen in 3.9%, 5.2%, 19.3%, and 6.3% of the patients. No significant difference was noted between RAPN and LPN for any of the perioperative outcomes. Compared to OPN, RAPN had significantly lower EBL, complications rate, and need for transfusion. RAPN for moderate to high complexity renal masses is associated with acceptable perioperative outcomes. LPN and RAPN were equal in terms of perioperative outcomes for complex masses whereas, OPN had significantly higher blood loss, complications rate, and need for transfusion as compared to RAPN.",,1863

913,35974808,Making Emergency Surgical Decisions Without any Imaging Evidence: A Case Report of Complicated Diverticular Phlegmon.,"Acute left-sided diverticulitis is the third most common gastrointestinal disease after acute pancreatitis and cholecystitis requiring hospitalization. From those patients, 15% to 20% were diagnosed with abscess on the computed tomography (CT) scan. Usually, abscess larger than 5 cm are not amenable for medical treatment. A 61-year-old woman presented to emergency department of the general hospital in the remote island with 48-h history of fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Physical examination revealed 15 × 7 cm mass occupying the left mid-abdomen and iliac fossa. Patient did not report any unintentional loss of weight or change of bowel habits. She only reported that the last month she felt her lower tummy bloated. Due to absence of radiographer during this period in the hospital there was no possibility for any imaging investigations. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a phlegmon in the left abdomen consisting of the sigmoid colon, loops of the small bowel and wrapped by the omentum. Hartmann procedure was performed. Patient recovered uneventfully and was scheduled for reversal procedure. Surgical intervention is the treatment of choice for complicated large diverticular abscess; in the remote island, any delayed diagnosis may lead to life-threatening complications.",,1865
98,35983385,Severe Pertussis Infection With Hyperleukocytosis in a 10-Month-Old Unvaccinated Amish Female: A Case Report.,"Bordetellapertussis (B. pertussis) commonly infects individuals of all ages. However, pertussis, the disease caused by B. pertussis infection, is most severe in young infants. Severe pertussis, defined by the presence of refractory hypoxemia, pneumonia, cardiogenic shock, and hyperleukocytosis, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Both hyperleukocytosis and pulmonary hypertension have been found to be predictive of mortality in young infants. Leukoreductive strategies such as leukapheresis and exchange transfusion have been employed to treat these complications. Pulmonary hypertension is thought to be a result of aggregation of white blood cells in pulmonary vasculature; however, studies have suggested that the mechanism of pulmonary hypertension is multifactorial. We report a case of a 10-month-old unvaccinated Amish female with pertussis complicated by an initial hyperleukocytosis of 204,900 103/uL successfully treated with leukapheresis in our pediatric intensive care unit. This infant never showed signs of pulmonary hypertension, which is often associated with hyperleukocytosis in severe or fatal cases of pertussis in infants and neonates. To our knowledge, this is the most significant degree of hyperleukocytosis reported in pertussis. The findings in this case support the clinical utility of leukoreductive therapy in severe pertussis and provide some evidence that the mechanism of pulmonary hypertension in these patients is multifactorial.",,1866

The aim of this study was to present our results of upfront surgery and long-term survival in luminal A tumors as well as the rates of protection from axillary dissection. Material and Methods. 271 Luminal A breast cancer patients who had operated at our center were evaluated retrospectively. In patients with 2 or less sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy and underwent breast-conserving surgery, axillary lymph node dissection was omitted (OAD). Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed in patients with positive SLN who did not meet these criteria (axillary dissection after sentinel/ADAS). While Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) was performed in 212 (77.9%) patients, SLNB + Axillary Dissection (AD) was performed in 58 (21.3%), and direct axillary dissection was performed in 1 (0.8%) patient. OAD was applied to 18 (23.6%) of the positive patients. Discussion/Conclusions. ALND rates are still strikingly high in luminal A breast cancer treatment, despite the disease's milder clinical course. In order to avoid complications of axillary dissection, patients should be considered for NAC as much as possible. Novel neoadjuvant or other therapy options are also required.",,1867
2366,35967010,Engineering the ZIF-8 Pore for Electrochemical Sensor Applications-A Mini Review.,"Zinc imidazole framework-8, abbreviated as ZIF-8, is a member of the metal organic framework (MOF) family. The chemical architecture of ZIF-8 consists of zinc metal duly coordinated with an organic ligand/fragment, resulting in a cagelike three-dimensional network with unique porosity. Because of such a unique architecture and physicochemical property, ZIF-8 has recently been explored in various applications such as gas storage, catalysis, electrochemical sensing, drug delivery, etc. Electrochemical sensors are currently a hot topic in scientific advances, where small, portable, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices powered by electrochemical output show a newer path toward chemo and biosensor applications. The unique electrochemical property of ZIF-8 is hence explored widely for possible electrochemical sensor applications. The application and synthesis of the bare ZIF-8 have been widely reported for more than a decade. However, new scientific advancements depict tailoring the bare ZIF-8 structure to achieve smart hybrid ZIF-8 materials that show more advanced properties compared to bare ZIF-8. The framework is formed by joining inorganic (metal-containing) units with organic linkers by reticular synthesis, which results in the formation of a cross-linked crystalline network with permanent porosity. This unique porosity of ZIF-8 has recently been utilized for the encapsulation of suitable guest species to enhance the native physicochemical activity of ZIF-8. These engineered ZIF-8 materials show excellent results, especially for electrochemical sensing application. This review is intended to describe the research, including the one done by our group, where the ZIF-8 pore size is used for encapsulating nanoparticles, enzymes, and organic compounds to avail suitable sensor applications.",,1868

In particular, we derive equations of motion for the phase boundaries in a phase ordering system obeying this equation using a nearest-neighbor interaction approach. Using the equations of motion we explore kink binary and ternary interactions and analyze how the average domain size scale with respect to time. Further, we employ numerical techniques to perform a bifurcation analysis of the one-period stationary solutions of the equation. We then investigate the linear stability of the two-period solutions and thereby identify and study various coarsening modes.",,1870

After corticosteroid treatment, her pulmonary function improved. In such cases, our experience suggested that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and fiberoptic bronchoscopy should be used to diagnose airway chondritis as relapsing polychondritis in the early phase of disease.",,1871
697,35975313,"Effectiveness of telehealth versus standard care on health care utilization, health-related quality of life, and well-being in homebound populations: a systematic review protocol.","The objective of the review is to determine the effectiveness of telehealth versus in-person care on health care utilization, health-related quality of life and well-being in homebound populations. Globally, an increasing number of people are becoming homebound. These individuals experience high levels of social isolation and deterioration of their well-being. Reports from homebound people and recent publications suggest that this cohort may benefit from accessing telehealth solutions from their homes to treat and prevent serious issues affecting their health and well-being. This review will synthesize the evidence on the effectiveness of telehealth compared to standard care (in-person care) on health care utilization, health-related quality of life, and well-being in homebound populations. Studies including people living in community settings, whose daily life is physically limited to the boundary of their homes because of their ongoing health, energy, and psychosocial or socio-functional impairments will be considered for inclusion. This review will consider relevant, peer-reviewed primary experimental and quasi-experimental studies, with no limit on language or date, form: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, LILACS, JBI Evidence Synthesis (hand-searched for further studies), and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers will be involved in study selection and data extraction. Eligible studies will be critically appraised for methodological quality using the relevant JBI critical appraisal checklists, and statistical meta-analysis will be done (where possible). Findings will be presented in narrative form. PROSPERO CRD42021289578.",,1872
2151,35967367,Knowledge mapping and research hotspots of immunotherapy in renal cell carcinoma: A text-mining study from 2002 to 2021.,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most lethal urological malignancies, and because early-stage RCC is asymptomatic, many patients present metastatic diseases at first diagnosis. With the development of immunotherapy, the treatment of RCC has entered a new stage and has made a series of progress. This study mainly outlines the knowledge map and detects the potential research hotspots by using bibliometric analysis. Publications concerning RCC immunotherapy from 2002 to 2021 in the Web of Science Core Collection were collected. Visualization and statistical analysis were mainly performed by freeware tools VOSviewer, CiteSpace, R software, and Microsoft Office Excel 2019. A total of 3,432 papers were collected in this study, and the annual number of papers and citations showed a steady growth trend. The United States is the leading country with the most high-quality publications and is also the country with the most international cooperation. The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is the most productive organization. The Journal of Clinical Oncology is the highest co-cited journal, and Brian I. Rini is both the most prolific author and the author with the largest centrality. The current research hotspots may be focused on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), PD-1, and mammalian target of rapamycin. Immunotherapy has a bright future in the field of RCC treatment, among which ICIs are one of the most important research hotspots. The main future research directions of ICI-based immunotherapy may focus on combination therapy, ICI monotherapy, and the development of new predictive biomarkers.",,1873

1969,35967638,The Evolution of an Innovative Online Task to Monitor Children's Oral Narrative Development.,"Oral narrative abilities are an important measure of children's language competency and have predictive value for children's later academic performance. Research and development underway in New Zealand is advancing an innovative online oral narrative task. This task uses audio recordings of children's story retells, speech-to-text software and language analysis to record, transcribe, analyse and present oral narrative and listening comprehension data back to class teachers. The task has been designed for class teachers' use with the support of SLP or literacy specialists in data interpretation. Teachers are upskilled and supported in order to interpret these data and implement teaching practices for students through online professional learning and development modules, within the context of a broader evidence-based approach to early literacy instruction. This article describes the development of this innovative, culturally relevant, online tool for monitoring children's oral narrative ability and listening comprehension in their first year of school. Three phases of development are outlined, showing the progression of the tool from a researcher-administered task during controlled research trials, to wide-scale implementation with thousands of students throughout New Zealand. The current iteration of the tool uses an automatic speech-recognition system with specifically trained transcription models and support from research assistants to check transcription, then code and analyse the oral narrative. This reduces transcription and analysis time to ~7 min, with a word error rate of around 20%. Future development plans to increase the accuracy of automatic transcription and embed basic language analysis into the tool, with the aim of removing the need for support from research assistants.",,1875
1489,35968399,Comparison of radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial lung biopsy with distance measurement versus with guide sheath in diagnosing peripheral pulmonary lesions with a diameter ≥3 cm by thin bronchoscope.,"This study aims to explore the diagnostic values of radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial lung biopsy with distance (rEBUS-D-TBLB) measurement and with guide sheath (rEBUS-GS-TBLB) for peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) with a diameter ≥3 cm by thin bronchoscope. Six hundred and three patients with PPL (diameter ≥3 cm) were enrolled in this study. The subjects were divided into the rEBUS-D-TBLB and rEBUS-GS-TBLB groups by the random number table method. Patients were assigned to undergo rEBUS-D-TBLB or rEBUS-GS-TBLB, respectively. The histopathology, positive diagnosis rates, duration of the procedure, and postoperative adverse effects between the two groups were examined. A total of 569 patients were included in this study according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with 282 cases in the rEBUS-D-TBLB group and 287 cases in the rEBUS-GS-TBLB group. For malignant diseases, the positive diagnosis rates of PPL in the outer/inner-middle lung bands and the right-upper/-lower lung lobes by rEBUS-D-TBLB were noninferior to those of rEBUS-GS-TBLB. The duration of the procedure of rEBUS-D-TBLB was longer than that of rEBUS-GS-TBLB. There were 14 cases of hemorrhage >50 mL, 1 case of postoperative chest pain in the rEBUS-D-TBLB group, and 3 cases of hemorrhage >50 mL in the rEBUS-GS-TBLB group. REBUS-D-TBLB by thin bronchoscope has a high diagnostic value for PPL with a diameter ≥3 cm, which may be considered a useful alternative for rEBUS-GS-TBLB in the clinic.",,1876
271,35982553,Boiler ash utilization in the Canadian pulp and paper industry.,"Pulp and paper mill biomass boilers generate large quantities of ash in Canada with British Columbia (BC) being the highest ash generating province followed closely by Quebec. Generally, the generated ash is landfilled, particularly in BC, with only a small amount being used beneficially. It is anticipated that the difficulty associated with the management of ash will worsen over time as the industry increases its reliance on green fuel. Thus, there is a strong need to identify beneficial uses of pulp and paper boiler ash for the sake of environmental and economic sustainability. The purpose of this report is to provide the first step in this direction, a review of proposed or implemented uses for coal and hog (or wood) ash around the world. Considering both the properties of the ash and local opportunities, this could be the first step toward screening the applications that may apply to individual mills. Several large-scale practices use ash, such as land application (as a nutrient source or as a liming agent), use in the construction industry (as a replacement for cement or as a fill material), and reclamation of mine sites and stabilization of unpaved forest roads. In some cases, relatively small-scale applications have been used which included uses such as a compost component, agent for pH adjustment of liquid streams and slurries, blasting abrasive, and source of quartz for glass manufacturing to name a few. It is important to note that the chemical nature of both fly and bottom ashes can be quite variable due to the type of wood residues combusted as well as combustion equipment used and must be considered in identifying beneficial applications.",,1877

2241,35967190,Describing Prehospital Deliveries in the State of Michigan.,"Introduction We observed clinically that prehospital deliveries locally appeared to have a high rate of complications and appeared associated with midwife deliveries. There is scant literature that addresses prehospital deliveries across a state. We set out to describe utilization, complications, and short-term outcomes of EMS-attended prehospital deliveries in Michigan in 2015, and to describe the relationship between prehospital delivery and socioeconomic status (SES). Methods We identified candidate cases for prehospital deliveries through the Michigan EMS Information System (MI-EMSIS). To assess the relationship of SES with the frequency of EMS delivery, we utilized the mean income of the patient residences' zip codes. Results We identified 223 EMS-attended deliveries from 1.6 million MI-EMSIS records. Most births were normal vaginal deliveries on the scene or en route to the hospital (92, 40.0%) or delivered prior to EMS arrival (58, 25.4%). Maternal or fetal complications were identified in 69 (32.0%) deliveries. We identified a few midwife-attended deliveries (31), but these had a high rate of complications (19, 61.3%). The frequency of prehospital delivery was inversely related to estimated patient income (Pearson=-0.85). Conclusions EMS deliveries were rare and most were normal vaginal deliveries, but almost a third had complications. Midwife and EMS-attended deliveries were rare, but when they occurred, had high rates of complications. Although an imperfect measure of patient SES, frequency of delivery was inversely related to patient income, and agencies that provide care in these communities should have focused training.",,1879
835,35974936,A scientometric study of Iran and the world countries' contribution to internal medicine (1996-2019).,"Considering the importance of internal medicine and the lack of sufficient scientometric data on the research status of the field in Iran, the study aimed at investigating the state of scientific output in the country compared to the countries in the world. This applied research used a scientometric approach. The related MeSH-driven terms in internal medicine were selected as search phrases and searched in the SCImago database. SPSS and Excel software packages were used for statistical analysis. Geographical mapping was done with Google Maps for depicting country geographical distribution. Out of all 4,972,258 papers published by 230 countries worldwide in the field, about 60% belonged to the USA and Western European countries. These countries were at top of citation and self-citation counts as well as the h-index indicator. The citations per paper indicator were 27.1 and about 25.1% of total citations were self-citations. A significant positive correlation was found between the number of papers, citation count, and self-citation rate, and h-index in the field (p<0.001). The research status of internal medicine in developed regions and countries was quantitatively and qualitatively better than that of developing countries, including Iran.",,1880
959,35974711,"Burnout among midwives and attitudes toward midwifery: A cross-sectional study from Baden-Württemberg, Germany.","Midwifery services are a cornerstone of maternal care, but the mental health of midwives is at risk in many work settings. The aim of this study was to assess burnout and attitudes toward midwifery among midwives in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. A cross-sectional online survey among midwives was conducted from 16 October to 10 December 2017. Burnout was assessed using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). A total of 602 survey respondents were studied; 48.3%, 38.2%, and 23.3% of midwives reported moderate or high (CBI score ≥50) levels of personal burnout, work-related burnout, and client-related burnout, respectively. Midwives with moderate or high burnout in at least one CBI dimension worked more weekly hours, were more commonly employed, and worked more frequently in the hospital. In turn, midwives with low burnout levels worked fewer weekly hours, more commonly freelance, and more frequently community based (all p<0.001). Moderate or high burnout levels were associated with a reduced likelihood to recommend midwifery as a profession (OR=0.34; 95% CI: 0.23-0.49) and an increased likelihood to intent leaving the profession (OR=3.39; 95% CI: 2.0-5.9) in a multivariable regression adjusting for midwife characteristics and work practices. Burnout symptoms were common among midwives. Burnout could be a health risk for midwives and a challenge to the profession by discouraging present and future midwives from practicing midwifery.",,1881
1179,35973318,"Survival in patients diagnosed with SMA at less than 24 months of age in a population-based setting before, during and after introduction of nusinersen therapy. Experience from Sweden.","Clinical trials have demonstrated a positive effect of nusinersen therapy on survival of infants with SMA type 1. However, there is a lack of data outside clinical trials on how the introduction of nusinersen has affected the survival of patients with SMA. We therefore set out to analyse survival in patients diagnosed at less than 24 months before, during and after the introduction of nusinersen in a nationwide population-based real-world setting. SMA patients diagnosed before the age of 24 months in the time period between February 21, 2000 and December 19, 2019 were identified using ICD-codes, and medical procedures for identification of treatment utilizing information from the public available National Patient Registry held by the National Board of Health and Welfare. Data was divided into 3 different calendar periods (before, during, and after introduction of nusinersen treatment in Sweden). Time to Event analysis was then applied. A total of 155 patients were enrolled in the study, and median follow-up was 1.14 years (inter-quartile range (IQR): 0.27-8.37 years). Data did not provide conclusive evidence that survival differed between the calendar periods (P-value from the log-rank test = 0.419) and while hazards were lower in the middle period, HR 0.70 (95% CI: 0.34-1.47), and 3, HR 0.71 (95% CI: 0.28-1.77) compared to the first period, all confidence intervals were wide., However, nusinersen treatment was associated with a decreased mortality rate, HR 0.05 (95% CI: 0.01-0.37). SMA patients receiving nusinersen therapy had a dramatically increased overall survival compared to patients not receiving therapy. This indicates that nusinersen treatment has an effect on survival, in patients diagnosed with SMA, in a nationwide real-world setting. Larger studies are warranted.",,1882
489,35978866,Correlation of molecular alterations with pathological features in hepatocellular carcinoma: Literature review and experience of an Italian center.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the primary carcinoma of the liver and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The World Health Organization estimates an increase in cases in the coming years. The risk factors of HCC are multiple, and the incidence in different countries is closely related to the different risk factors to which the population is exposed. The molecular mechanisms that drive HCC tumorigenesis are extremely complex, but understanding this multistep process is essential for the identification of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic markers. The development of multigenic next-generation sequencing panels through the parallel analysis of multiple markers can provide a landscape of the genomic status of the tumor. Considering the literature and our preliminary data based on 36 HCCs, the most frequently altered genes in HCCs are TERT, CTNNB1, and TP53. Over the years, many groups have attempted to classify HCCs on a molecular basis, but a univocal classification has never been achieved. Nevertheless, statistically significant correlations have been found in HCCs between the molecular signature and morphologic features, and this leads us to think that it would be desirable to integrate the approach between anatomic pathology and molecular laboratories.",,1883
2055,35967516,Best practices in the measurement of circularly polarised photodetectors.,"Circularly polarised light will revolutionise emerging technologies, including encrypted light-based communications, quantum computing, bioimaging and multi-channel data processing. In order to make use of these remarkable opportunities, high performance photodetectors that can accurately differentiate between left- and right-handed circularly polarised light are desperately needed. Whilst this potential has resulted in considerable research interest in chiral materials and circularly polarised photodetecting devices, their translation into real-world technologies is limited by non-standardised reporting and testing protocols. This mini-review provides an accessible introduction into the working principles of circularly polarised photodetectors and a comprehensive overview of the performance metrics of state-of-the-art devices. We propose a rigorous device characterisation procedure that will allow for standardised evaluation of novel devices, which we hope will accelerate research and investment in this area.",,1884
1607,35968277,Tailored GuideLine Implementation in STrokE Rehabilitation (GLISTER) in Germany. Protocol of a Mixed Methods Study Using the Behavior Change Wheel and the Theoretical Domains Framework.,"Evidence-based guidelines are important for informing clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes. There is inconsistent usage of guidelines among physical therapists involved in stroke rehabilitation, suggesting the existence of a gap between theory and practice. Addressing the German guideline evidence-based rehabilitation of mobility after stroke (ReMoS), the aims of this project are (1) to describe the current physical therapy practice within the context of stroke rehabilitation in Germany, (2) to evaluate barriers and facilitators of guideline usage, (3) to develop, and (4) to pilot test a theory-based, tailored implementation intervention for the benefit of guideline recommendations. This study uses a stepwise mixed methods approach for implementing a local guideline. A self-reported online questionnaire will be used to survey the current physical therapy practice in stroke rehabilitation. The same survey and systematic-mixed methods review will be used to evaluate the barriers and facilitators of guideline usage quantitatively. Semi-structured interviews will add a qualitative perspective on factors that influence ReMoS guideline implementation. The Behavior Change Wheel and Theoretical Domains Framework will be used to support the development of a tailored implementation intervention which will be pilot tested in a controlled study. Patient and physical therapy-related outcomes, as well as the appropriateness, such as acceptance and feasibility of the tailored implementation intervention, will be analyzed. This will be the first endeavor to implement a guideline in German stroke rehabilitation with a focus on changing care provider behavior based on the knowledge of current practice and determining factors using a tailored and theory-based intervention.",,1885

428,35979156,Diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of lung ultrasound in coronavirus disease (COVID-19).,"This study aimed to assess the correlation between lung ultrasound (LUS) and computed tomography (CT) findings and the predictability of LUS scores to anticipate disease characteristics, lab data, clinical severity, and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Fifty consecutive hospitalized PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who underwent chest CT scan and LUS on the first day of admission were enrolled. The LUS score was calculated based on the presence, severity, and distribution of parenchymal abnormalities in 14 regions. The participants' mean age was 54.60 ± 19.93 years, and 26 (52%) were female. All patients had CT and LUS findings typical of COVID-19. The mean value of CT and LUS severity scores were 11.80 ± 3.89 (ranging from 2 to 20) and 13.74 ± 6.43 (ranging from 1 to 29), respectively. The LUS score was significantly higher in females (p = 0.016), and patients with dyspnoea (p = 0.048), HTN (p = 0.034), immunodeficiency (p = 0.034), room air SpO2 ≤ 93 (p = 0.02), and pleural effusion (p = 0.036). LUS findings were strongly correlated with CT scan results regarding lesion type, distribution, and severity in a region-by-region fashion (92-100% agreement). An LUS score of 14 or higher was predictive of room air SpO2 ≤ 93 and ICU admission, while an LUS score ≥ 12 was predictive of death (p = 0.011, 0.023, and 0.003, respectively). Our results suggested that LUS can be used as a valuable tool for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia and determining high-risk hospitalized patients, helping to triage and stratify high-risk patients, which waives the need to undertake irradiating chest CT and reduces the burden of overworked CT department staff.",,1887
769,35975068,The solvent-free mechano-chemical grinding of a bifunctional P25-graphene oxide adsorbent-photocatalyst and its configuration as porous beads.,"Owing to their use in water-cleaning technology, titanium-dioxide-based nanomaterials have dominated the photocatalysis scene, with so-called Degussa (P25) being the most promising under UV light. However, this is not the case under visible light, where it is necessary to combine titanium dioxide with other photosensitising nanomaterials. Unfortunately, most of the strategies aimed in this direction are chemically non-facile, energy-intensive, economically expensive, and not suitable for large-scale production. We herein describe a straightforward solvent-free approach for accessing visible-light-activated titanium-dioxide-based photocatalysts via the mechanochemical grinding of Degussa P25 with a second solid partner. Upon comparing several solid-material benchmarks, P25-graphene oxide is the best combination. The resulting material showed efficient performance for the adsorption and photodegradation of different dye pollutants, namely methylene blue, malachite green, Congo red, and methyl orange. The recorded performance was nearly comparable to that reached using sol-gel materials, with the ultimate advantage of being more sustainable and industrially scalable. The recyclability can be improved through a porous-bead configuration using biomass waste chitosan hydrogel, an approach that can further fulfill the requirement for more sustainable photocatalyst designs.",,1888
1219,35971495,Prevalence of refractive errors in school-going children of Taif region of Saudi Arabia.,"To determine the prevalence of refractive errors in the pediatric population in Taif, Saudi Arabia. This cross-sectional study included 7356 eyes of 3678 primary and secondary school children (males = 1837; females = 1841) with a mean age of 11.8 ± 2.2 years (range: 7-18) (males = 11.4 ± 2.0 [range: 8-16]; females = 12.2 ± 2.3 [range: 7-18]). All participants were selected from the school registers. The participants underwent noncycloplegic refraction to determine refractive errors. Students who refused visual acuity assessment or eye examination and were inconsistent in visual acuity assessment were excluded. The manifest refraction spherical equivalent of the study population was 0.37 ± 1.52 D (range from - 18.4 to 8.8 D) (males = -0.32 ± 1.4 D [range - 15.88-8.8 D]; females = -0.42 ± 1.6 D [range - 18.38-8.0 D]). The overall prevalence of uncorrected refractive errors among school children in this study was 50.91%. The overall distribution of astigmatism (cylinder error of ≥0.50 D) in the current study population was found to be 50.14% (3688/7356 eyes). Nearly half of the study population in this area was affected with at least one type of refractive error. The findings reveal the necessity for implementing timely and sensitive screening programs/methods to identify and correct refractive errors in this age group.",,1889
1126,35974493,Generalization of stochastic-resonance-based threshold networks with Tikhonov regularization.,"Injecting artificial noise into a feedforward threshold neural network allows it to become trainable by gradient-based methods and also enlarges the parameter space as well as the range of synaptic weights. This configuration constitutes a stochastic-resonance-based threshold neural network, where the noise level can adaptively converge to a nonzero optimal value for finding a local minimum of the loss criterion. We prove theoretically that the injected noise plays the role of a generalized Tikhonov regularizer for training the designed threshold network. Experiments on regression and classification problems demonstrate that the generalization of the stochastic-resonance-based threshold network is improved by the injection of noise. The feasibility of injecting noise into the threshold neural network opens up the potential for adaptive stochastic resonance in machine learning.",,1890
141,35983259,Epidemiology of Surgical Site Infection Following Abdominal Surgeries at a Reference Hospital in North-West Cameroon.,"Though abdominal surgery is a risk factor for surgical site infection (SSI), limited data exist in this environment on the burden and risk factors of SSI following abdominal surgeries in our setting. The aim of this article is to study the prevalence, risk factors, and outcome of SSI following abdominal surgeries at the Mbingo Baptist Hospital, Bamenda, North-West Region, Cameroon. This was a hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study. We reviewed records of all patients who underwent an abdominal surgery at the Mbingo Baptist Hospital from January 2020 to December 2020. We excluded patients under the age of 18 and patients who died in the early post-op without developing an SSI. For each participant, we collected socio-demographic data, clinical features, and factors related to the surgery and its outcome. A total of 304 (25.7% males) participants with a mean age of 40.8 years (SD ±15 years) were enrolled. In all, 37/304 participants developed SSI giving an overall prevalence of 12.2%. The incidence was higher in males and in emergency procedures. The spectrum of infection ranged from superficial (19%) to organ space (64%) through deep SSI (14%). Human immunodeficiency virus, operatory time >4 h, contaminated/dirty procedures, and gastrointestinal perforation repair were independently associated with SSI. Length of hospital stay (days) was significantly higher in patients who developed SSI (18.0 vs. 4.0). An overall mortality of 2% with case fatality of 19% was recorded. SSI remains a common complication of abdominal surgeries. Prompt recognition and control of potentially modifiable risk factors may improve the burden and outcomes in this high-risk population.",,1891
960,35974710,Self-compassion and professional quality of life among midwives and nurse assistants: A cross-sectional study.,"Self-compassion and satisfaction derived from helping others is part of healthcare providers' professional quality of life. The aim of this study was to explore and psychometrically test two instruments measuring self-compassion and professional quality of life among midwives and nurse assistants. This was a cross-sectional study with midwives and nurse assistants working with intrapartum care at five different labor wards in Sweden. The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) and the modified Professional Quality of Life Measurement (ProQOL) were validated and correlation analyses were calculated between the different subscales. Descriptive statistics, t-test, were calculated to analyze associations between the subscales of the SCS, the ProQOL and the background variables. Midwives were more self-critical than nurse assistants, and the midwives who were negative towards the new clinical practice scored higher for compassion fatigue. The principal component analysis showed a two-factor solution for both the SCS and the modified ProQOL. The two SCS subscales were named 'self-criticism' (α=0.85) and 'self-kindness' (α=0.87). The two ProQOL subscales were named 'compassion satisfaction' (α=0.83) and 'compassion fatigue' (α=0.78). A negative correlation was found between self-kindness and compassion fatigue subscales, between compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue, and between self-kindness and self-criticism. The SCS and modified ProQOL are considered as valid questionnaires for use in a Swedish maternity setting and a correlation between the scales was found. Midwives are more self-critical than nurse assistants. Understanding and identifying compassion fatigue among midwives is important to managers responsible for quality improvement and practice changes.",,1892

802,35975028,Equity in temporary street closures: The case of London's Covid-19 'School Streets' schemes.,"School Streets are a street space reallocation scheme that has proliferated since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK, reducing motor traffic on streets outside many schools. Utilising a minimum-standards approach to equity, this paper examines the distribution of School Streets closures across social and environmental indicators of equity, and spatially across London's administrative geography. Using a multi-level regression analysis, we show that although School Streets have been equally distributed across several socio-demographic indicators, they are less likely to benefit schools in car-dominated areas of poor air quality, and their spatial distribution is highly unequal. This study presents an example of using environmental and spatial variables alongside more typical sociodemographic indicators in measuring the equity of school travel provision. For policymakers, the findings signal the need to implement complementary policies that can benefit schools with worse air quality, and to accelerate School Street implementation in slower districts.",,1894
1140,35973826,Atraumatic acute compartment syndrome - case report.,"The publishing of our case report on an idiopathic compartment syndrome of both upper limbs after icing a contusion trauma was motivated by another article on the acute spontaneous compartment syndrome of upper limb published in Rozhledy v chirurgii 8/2021. We present the case of a 43-year-old man admitted in the evening for painful massive swelling of both upper extremities. The swelling developed immediately after icing his bruises suffered due to a probable fall on the previous day in a state of inebriety. Compartment syndrome of the left hand and right forearm was diagnosed; subsequently, adequate dermatofasciectomy resulted in normalization of the condition in both upper limbs. The patients condition was cured to a full extent without any disorders of perfusion, mobility or sensation in both upper extremities. Only few reports on the atraumatic compartment syndrome of upper extremity can be found in the literature and it is an acute condition encountered quite rarely at outpatient offices of surgery. Nevertheless, we need to be able to recognize this nosological unit and provide proper treatment in time, otherwise the patient may suffer serious permanent damage.",,1895
1095,35974524,Adiabatic lapse rate of real gases.,"We derive a formula for the dry adiabatic lapse rate of atmospheres composed of real gases. We restrict our study to those described by a family of two-parameter cubic equations of state and the recent Guevara-Rodríguez noncubic equation. Since our formula depends on the adiabatic curves, we compute them all at once, considering molecules that can move, rotate, and vibrate, for any equation of state. To illustrate our results, we estimate the lapse rate of the troposphere of Titan, obtaining a better approximation to the observed data in some instances, when compared to the estimation provided by the virial expansion up to the third order.",,1896
140,35983260,"Prevalence of COVID-19 Infection Among Asymptomatic Ophthalmic Surgical Patients Undergoing Ophthalmic Procedures at University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, Abuja.","The aim of this article is to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among asymptomatic ophthalmic patients undergoing ophthalmic procedures at University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, Abuja, Nigeria. A retrospective review of records of all consecutive ophthalmic patients who had pre-operative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for COVID-19 screening before an elective surgical procedure between July 2020 and January 2021 was done. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to extract the following information from eligible patients' case records: age, gender, results of COVID-19 tests, type of ophthalmic surgical procedure done, and ocular examination findings and diagnosis. Out of the 150 patients scheduled for surgical procedures within the study period, only 14 (9.3%) returned a positive test result. These patients had their surgeries postponed and were asked to return with negative results 2 weeks later. No association was found between gender, age, or type of surgical procedure and the prevalence of COVID-19 infection. This study found that 1 in 11 patients scheduled for elective ophthalmic procedure was a carrier of COVID-19 infection, highlighting the need for regular pre-operative testing in order to reduce the risk of spread of infection to healthcare workers and other hospitalized patients.",,1897

Both mol-ecules (I and II) have chiral centers at the carbon atoms where the triazine rings of mol-ecules I and II are attached to the phenyl ring. In the crystal, mol-ecules I and II are linked by inter-molecular N-H⋯N, N-H⋯O and C-H⋯N hydrogen bonds through the solvent di-methyl-formamide mol-ecule into layers parallel to (001). In addition, C-H⋯π inter-actions also connect adjacent mol-ecules into layers parallel to (001). The stability of the mol-ecular packing is ensured by van der Waals inter-actions between the layers. The Hirshfeld surface analysis indicates that N⋯H/H⋯N (38.3% for I; 35.0% for II), H⋯H (28.2% for I; 27.0% for II) and C⋯H/H⋯C (23.4% for I; 26.3% for II) inter-actions are the most significant contributors to the crystal packing.",,1898
324,35980406,"Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual Assault, and Child Abuse Resource Utilization During COVID-19.","Key measures in preventing spread of the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are social distancing and stay-at-home mandates. These measures along with other stressors have the potential to increase incidences of intimate partner violence (IPV), sexual assault, and child maltreatment. We performed a retrospective review of county police dispatches, emergency department (ED) visits, Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) consults, Domestic Violence Healthcare Project (DVHP) team consults, and Child Protection Team consults at a large, tertiary, Level I trauma center. We queried International Classification of Diseases Revision 10 codes most specific to IPV, sexual assault, and child maltreatment from March-October 2020 compared to 2019. Similarly, the number of consults performed by SANE, DVHP, and our Child Protection Team were collected. We compared all ED visits and consultations to total ED visits for the reviewed time period. Finally, the total number of calls and referrals to a child advocacy center and resource call line for victims were recorded during this timeframe. Police dispatches for IPV-related assaults increased by 266 reports from 2019 to 2020 (P = 0.015). Emergency department visits related to IPV increased from 0.11% of visits in 2019 to 0.15% in 2020 (P = 0.032), and DVHP consults increased from 0.31% in 2019 to 0.48% in 2020 of ED visits in the first three months (P < 0.001). Child maltreatment visits increased from 0.47% of visits in 2019 to 0.81% of visits in 2020 (P = 0.028), and a higher percentage of patients required Child Protection team consults from 1% in 2019 to 1.6% in 2020 (P = 0.004). Sexual assault-related visits and SANE consults both showed a small increase that was not statistically significant. Fewer calls and referrals were made to our child advocacy center and resource call line, decreasing by 99 referrals and 252 calls, respectively. Despite decreased ED volumes throughout the pandemic, we observed an increase in police dispatches, ED visits, and utilization of hospital consult services related to IPV and child maltreatment following the initiation of stay-at-home orders.

Aside from α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with auxiliary groups, common chalcone substrates are also well compatible with this organocatalytic system. This method proceeds through an organocatalytic enantioselective radical sulfonylation under photoinduced conditions, and represents a rare example of asymmetric transformation involving sulfur dioxide insertion.",,1900
1415,35968487,Assessing Canadian women's preferences for cervical cancer screening: A brief report.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is recommended for primary screening for cervical cancer by several health authorities. Several countries that have implemented HPV testing programs have encountered resistance against extended screening intervals and older age of initiation. As Canada prepares to implement HPV testing programs, it is important to understand women's preferences toward cervical cancer screening to ensure a smooth transition. The objective of this study was to assess Canadian women's current preferences toward cervical cancer screening. Using a web-based survey, we recruited underscreened ( > 3 years since last Pap test) and adequately screened (< 3 years since last Pap test) Canadian women aged 21-70 who were biologically female and had a cervix. We used Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) methodology to collect data on women's preferences for different screening methods, screening intervals, and ages of initiation. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate preferences in both subgroups. In both subgroups, women preferred screening every three years compared to every five or ten years, and initiating screening at age 21 compared to age 25 or 30. Adequately screened women (n = 503) most preferred co-testing, while underscreened women (n = 524) preferred both co-testing and HPV self-sampling over Pap testing. Regardless of screening status, women preferred shorter screening intervals, an earlier age of initiation, and co-testing. Adequate communication from public health authorities is needed to explain the extended screening intervals and age of initiation to prevent resistance against these changes to cervical cancer screening.",,1901

A definitive correlation between each toxin and its effects is difficult to establish due to concomitant potential toxins in the circulation. This article highlights an uncommon case of concomitant nitrofurantoin-induced autoimmune hepatitis and lung fibrosis that fulfills the definitive clinical criteria for diagnosis, presenting histological, imagiological, and immunological evidence of nitrofurantoin-induced toxicity. It occurred in a 68-year-old woman with extended nitrofurantoin intake for urinary tract infection prophylaxis who presented with progressive exercise dyspnea and jaundice. Similar published cases are also reviewed in this article. Os antibióticos são causas conhecidas de reações adversas, mas o envolvimento multiorgânico associado à sintomatologia inespecífica pode conduzir ao atraso diagnóstico.

1924,35967685,Examining ecotourism intention: The role of tourists' traits and environmental concerns.,"The study offers new insights by examining the influence of personality traits (extraversion and neuroticism) on tourists' intentions to visit ecotourism sites using the lens of the theory of planned behavior. It also investigates whether environmental knowledge moderates the effect of extraversion, neuroticism, and environmental concern on tourists' ecotourism intentions. We applied structural equation modeling on 350 responses collected through the Amazon M-Turk platform. Results highlight that extroverts are more likely to express ecotourism intentions than neurotic tourists. However, it was also noted that neurotic tourists' intention to visit ecotourism sites could be influenced if their environmental concerns were emphasized. The study offers important new insights to managers, policy-makers, and practitioners about the roles of personality traits, environmental knowledge, and environmental concern vis-a-vis their relative significance in shaping tourists' decision-making and choices for ecotourism sites. As a result, managers/practitioners need to devise specific communication strategies to enhance awareness and a sense of responsibility among neurotic tourists.",,1903

633,35977218,Evaluation of Prior Authorization in Medicare Nonemergent Ambulance Transport.,"Some Medicare-reimbursed services are overused or improperly used, resulting in payments for unnecessary services. To determine if prior authorization of services vulnerable to improper use is associated with reduced use and costs without changing patient access or health outcomes. This study involved repeated cross-sectional evaluation with a state-level matched control group construction and inverse propensity score weighting at the Medicare beneficiary level. Eight states plus the District of Columbia requiring prior authorization were compared with 13 matched comparison group states not subject to prior authorization. Observations on approximately 1.7 million Medicare beneficiaries spanned January 2012 through December 2019. Depending on their state of residence, this included 3 or 4 preintervention years and 4 or 5 postintervention years. Data analysis was performed from September 2020 to July 2021. Ambulance suppliers were directed to request prior authorization for Repetitive, Scheduled, Non-Emergent Ambulance Transport (RSNAT) services; failure to do so resulted in prepayment claim review. The goal of prior authorization is to reduce use of nonemergency ambulance transports that do not meet Medicare coverage criteria. Primary outcomes included total cost of care, RSNAT use rates and expenditures, unplanned hospital admission, emergency department admission, and emergency ambulance use per beneficiary-year. All measures were constructed from Medicare claims. Approximately 1.7 million Medicare beneficiaries were observed in the study (mean [SD] age, 71 [15] years; 50% female beneficiaries; 30% Black beneficiaries, 64% White beneficiaries; 20% rural residence; 35% dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid; 58% with end-stage renal disease; and 44% with severe [stage 3 or 4] pressure ulcers). After controlling for covariates, the results showed that prior authorization was associated with a 2.4% reduction in total annual expenditures for a total of $1530 per beneficiary-year (95% CI, -$1775 to -$1285; P < .001); a 61% reduction in the probability of RSNAT use for a total of 4.1 percentage points per beneficiary-year (95% CI, -4.26 to -3.94; P < .001); a 77% reduction in RSNAT expenditures for a total of $1136 per beneficiary-year (95% CI, -$1179 to -$1093; P < .001); a 1.4% reduction in the probability of emergency department use by 0.99 percentage points per beneficiary-year (95% CI, -1.17 to -0.81; P < .001); no change in the probability of emergency ambulance use (0.07 percentage points, 95% CI, -0.15 to 0.29; P = .50); a 2.6% reduction in the probability of unplanned hospital admission for a total of 1.53 percentage points per beneficiary-year (95% CI, -1.71 to -1.35; P < .001); and a 19% annual increase in the probability of emergency dialysis use for a total of 1.4 percentage points per beneficiary with end-stage renal disease (95% CI, 1.28 to 1.60; P < .001). In this difference-in-differences analysis of Medicare beneficiaries, the results suggest that the RSNAT Prior Authorization Model was associated with reduced costs with little or no change in the quality or access indicators examined. Targeted approaches to prior authorization may be an appropriate control measure for Medicare services vulnerable to improper use.",,1905
1901,35967708,Resumes vs. application forms: Why the stubborn reliance on resumes?,"The focus of this Perspective article is on the comparison of two of the most popular initial applicant screening methods: Resumes and application forms. The viewpoint offered is that application forms are superior to resumes during the initial applicant screening stage of selection. This viewpoint is supported in part based on criterion-related validity evidence that favors application forms over resumes. For example, the biographical data (biodata) inventory, which can contain similar questions to those used in application forms, is one of the most valid predictors of job performance (if empirically keyed), whereas job experience and years of education, which are often inferred from resumes and cover letters, are two of the least valid predictors of job performance (among commonly used screening criteria). In addition to validity evidence, making decisions based on application forms as opposed to resumes is likely to help organizations defend against claims of discriminatory hiring while enhancing their ability to hire in a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive manner. For example, applicant names on resumes can lead to screening bias against members of identifiable subgroups, whereas an applicant's name can be easily and automatically hidden from decision-makers when reviewing application forms (particularly digital application forms). Despite these convincing arguments focused on applicant quality and diversity, a substantial research-practice gap regarding the use of resumes and cover letters remains.",,1906
1686,35968086,Study of genetic variation and its association with tensile strength among bamboo species through whole genome resequencing.,"Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) is a versatile plant species that is widely used as a construction material by many low-income countries due to the lack of major construction materials such as steel and reinforced concrete. It is also widely used in China. Bamboo is an economically sustainable material that behaves exceptionally in natural disasters such as earthquakes and it can offer viable solutions for contemporary engineering challenges. Despite bamboo's potential in the engineering sector, biological features such as its long generation time, its large genome size, and its polyploidy are constraining factors for genetic and genomic studies that potentially can assist the breeding efforts. This study re-sequenced 8 Phyllostachys species and 18 natural accessions of Ph. edulis, generating a large set of functionally annotated molecular markers (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and InDels) providing key genomic resource information. Moreover, all this genomic information was used to carry out a preliminary genome-wide association analysis and several candidate genes were identified to be correlated with a mechanical property that is of high interest to structural engineers: its tensile strength normal to its fibers (i.e., splitting).",,1907

Here we report a case of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea. The patient was a 54-year-old male, who presented with bacterial meningitis and was referred to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology for a detailed examination of the nose and sinuses. Reconstructed thin-slice computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple fistulae on the clivus. The defect was successfully repaired by transnasal endoscopic surgery, with the assistance of virtual endoscopic images, which were created by the surgical planning and navigation system from thin-slice CT images. This incremental improvement in the imaging technique helped with the diagnosis and surgical treatment of CSF rhinorrhea.",,1908
1084,35974535,Microseismic event detection in noisy environments with instantaneous spectral Shannon entropy.,"The detection of information-bearing signals in a time series is very important for describing and analyzing a wide variety of complex physical systems. However, identifying events in low signal-to-noise ratio circumstances remains a challenge once heavy data preprocessing is usually required. In this work, we propose a robust methodology based on the instantaneous-spectral Shannon entropy for capturing microseismic events in noisy environments without the requirement of data preprocessing. We call our proposal the instantaneous spectral entropy detection (ISED) method. We tested the ISED in a couple of real empirical seismic records to detect microseismic events. Our methodology detects microseismic patterns even without any preprocessing, in contrast to usual methods in the literature which need appreciable data preprocessing.",,1909
1550,35968336,Prognostic impact of the preoperatory neutrophil/lymphocyte index on early surgical complications of patients with colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is found among those with greatest frequency and exponential increase worldwide, with high mortality rates, which are observed as increasing due to the postsurgical complications that come to present. Systemic inflammation participates in the development and progression of cancer; therefore, inflammatory and/or immunological response markers such as the neutrophil/lymphocyte index (NLI) can aid us in predicting the poor results of our interventions. The purpose of our study was to determine the impact of an NLI of ≥2.6 as a predictor of early postsurgical complications. By means of a prospective cohort, we analyzed 158 patients with CRC who were submitted to elective surgery with a later 30-day follow-up. We found that the preoperatory NLI of ≥2.6 obtained an odds ratio (OR) = 2.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-4.36) as a prognostic factor of early postsurgical complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification scale, which represents a low prognostic impact due to its predictive yield with low accuracy, which is the opposite of what other reports have previously published. The use of chemotherapy before the surgical procedure was also determined to be a risk factor for post-surgical complications.",,1910
1188,35973060,PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS OF ANAL HPV INFECTION IN MSM LIVING WITH HIV: IDENTIFYING THE TARGET GROUPS TO PRIORITIZE FOR IMMUNIZATION.,"Aims of the study are assessing prevalence of anal HPV genotypes in male who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV over a period of 5 years and determining risk factors for anal infection from high-risk (HR) HPV genotypes or included in vaccine Gardasil-9. Time-trend, monocentric study on MSM living with HIV who underwent HPV test at anal site from 2015 to 2019. Anal swabs were processed by multiplex real-time PCR to detect HPV genotypes. Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess linear trend in HPV prevalence over time and logistic regression models to estimate risk factors. Of the 1352 MSM living with HIV, 168 (12%) were not infected by any HPV genotypes and only 6 were infected with a maximum of 6 genotypes; prevalence of HR-HPV genotypes or those included in the 9-valent vaccine remained stable over time. At multivariable analysis, the risk of carrying at least one genotype classified as HR or included in Gardasil-9 was associated with younger age (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) for age< 30 vs > 45 (95% confidence interval) 2.714 (1.484-4.961), p=0.001 and 1.868 (1.141-3.060), p<0.013, respectively) and a history of gonorrhea (aOR 2.118 (1.100-4.078), p=0.025 and 1.785 (1.056-3.018), p=0.031, respectively). Our findings suggest that prevalence remained stable over time and that all MSM with HIV would benefit from Gardasil-9 immunization, particularly the youngest and those with a prior gonococcal infection.",,1911
1438,35968460,Developing healthy eating promotion mass media campaigns: A qualitative study.,"Involving consumers in the development and assessment of mass media campaigns has been advocated, though research is still lacking. This study aimed to explore opinions and attitudes of citizens, health professionals, communication professionals, and digital influencers regarding the development and implementation of healthy eating promotion mass media campaigns. We conducted five semi-structured focus groups, where participants were exposed to the first nationwide mass media campaign promoting healthy eating in Portugal. Through criteria-based purposive sampling, 19 citizens, five health professionals, two communication professionals, and four digital influencers were included. Transcripts were analyzed using Charmaz's line-to-line open coding process. Main identified themes were: considerations about informative-centered campaigns, health/nutritional issues to address, campaign formulation, target audiences, dissemination channels, and influencers' involvement. Participants favored campaigns focused on practical, transformative, and useful information with simple, innovative, activating, and exciting messages instead of strictly informative campaigns. Health and communication professionals mentioned the importance of adapting the message and dissemination channels to the target audience, addressing the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach individuals, and highlighted the importance of short video format. Active involvement of the health promotion target audience is crucial for the development and effectiveness of health campaigns. Campaigns need to convey health messages on simple though exciting communication materials, targeted to the most vulnerable subgroups, including deprived, less educated, younger, and older generations.",,1912

497,35978762,Examining D-dimer and Empiric Anti-coagulation in COVID-19-Related Thrombosis.,"Objective Thrombosis is thought to occur frequently in the setting of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We aimed to elucidate the relationship between macro/microvascular thrombosis, D-dimer levels, and empiric anticoagulation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods This was an exploratory prospective, single-site, observational study. Adult emergency department patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization received a point-of-care lower extremity venous duplex ultrasound. The primary endpoint was thromboembolism and associated D-dimer level. Secondary endpoints included rates of micro and macro thrombotic complications as well as empiric anticoagulant use. Results Between January 13th and April 12th 2021, 52 patients were enrolled. Median D-dimer at presentation was 650 ng/mL (range 250-10,000 ng/mL) among patients with negative duplex studies. During hospitalization, 18 patients underwent 20 additional studies assessing for venous thromboembolism (VTE). These studies yielded one deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosis. Among patients with negative studies median D-dimer was 1,246 ng/mL (range 329-10,000 ng/mL). Two patients experienced microvascular complications. Seven patients were started on empiric full dose anticoagulation. Conclusion While VTE remains a major concern amongst patients with COVID-19, the normal D-dimer cut off of >500 ng/mL likely should not be used to initiate further VTE workup. Additionally, moderately elevated D-dimer did not correlate strongly with microvascular complications and may not be relevant in the decision to initiate empiric anticoagulation.",,1914

The transmission of FZTi is linked to human behavior patterns. The aims to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding FZTi among local people. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a mixed method, which included a baseline survey and in-depth interviews. 375 participants were interviewed face-to-face in the survey, and 27 participants had the in-depth interviews. The results showed that 36.3% passed the knowledge assessment, 86.7% passed the attitude assessment, and 24% passed the practical assessment. There were differences in average knowledge scores among gender (men higher than women, p = 0.006), ethnicities (Kinh higher than Dao and Tay, p < 0.001), and educational level (higher education, higher knowledge score, p < 0.001). There were differences in the frequency of eating raw fish between men and women (men higher than women, p < 0.001), and in the average practice score between men and women (women higher than men, p = 0.028). Eating raw fish and/or undercooked fish, raw vegetables, and drinking untreated water from Thac Ba lake in Yen Bai province were identified as FZTi risk behaviors. The occurrence of these risky habits can be explained by the lack of knowledge on FZTi, poor economic conditions and typical social features of local people. The current knowledge of local people in regard to safe eating practices is poor. They keep performing unsafe practices, which lead to infection with FZTi; therefore, an integrated control of FZTi is essential.",,1915

The new Essentials coupled with the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic deem it necessary to address the intersection of SDOH and population health. The impact of COVID 19 disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic families. Couple the disproportionate numbers of COVID 19 among these groups with the growing incidence of food insecurity, and there is a need to explore intersecting links. Emerging research link the lack of social support systems and loneliness to food insecurity. In alignment with addressing competency-based education, it is critical to assess factors such as social support systems and loneliness and the intersection of its effects on such determinants as food insecurity. The article provides an overview for its readers in examining the incidence of food insecurity in older ethnic minority women along with postulated social attributes as contributing factors to the growth rates of food insecurity. The incidence of food insecurity among older ethnic minority women has grown exponentially amid the pandemic. The authors illustrate the role nurses can play in addressing primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions using Neuman's Theory.

Furthermore, weighted effect size analyses showed a significant correlation between QOL and variables such as patients' age, gender, disease duration and depression (pvalue: 0.00). As the symptoms of BD worsen over time, patients confront with more severe body pain, mobility restrictions, and difficulties in chewing, eating, speaking and swallowing which negatively affect social interactions of patients and reduce their QOL. Furthermore, depression was proved to act as a deteriorating factor for Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) among BD patients. Thus, patients need to be psychologically supported by a specialized team and be informed during the course of treatment to gain useful information about the disease, treatment approaches and coping strategies.",,1917
661,35975826,Formation and crystallization of TiO2 nanostructures on various surfaces.,"A comparative study of the synthesis of TiO2 nanorods on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass, Si, SiO2, Si/Ta, Si/TiN, Si/TiN/Ti and Si/HFO2 substrates by hydrothermal reaction is presented. Detailed analysis on the growth of TiO2 on pre-annealed Si/TiN/Ti and HfO2 (HFO) surfaces is also given. For Si/TiN/Ti, a pre-annealing procedure led to the transformation of Ti to a TiO2 layer which acts as a seed for aligned growth of TiO2 nanorods. In contrast, Si/HFO does not provide a nucleation site for the formation of aligned nanorods. Various samples were prepared by varying the synthesis conditions, i.e. pre- and post-annealing temperatures and hydrothermal reaction time to figure out the optimum conditions which lead to unidirectional and highly aligned nanorods. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to study structural, morphological and optical properties of synthesized samples. It is found that TiO2 nanorods exhibit a rutile phase on the Si/Ti/TiN and Si/HFO substrates, but highly oriented vertical growth of nanorods has been observed only on pre-annealed Si/TiN/Ti substrates. On the other hand, TiO2 nanorods form dandelion-like structures on Si/HFO substrates. Growth of vertically oriented TiO2 nanorods on Si/TiN/Ti is attributed to the TiO2 seed layer which forms after the process of pre-annealing of substrates at a suitable temperature. Variation in hydrothermal reaction time and post-annealing temperature brings further improvement in crystallinity and morphology of nanorods. This work shows that the pre-annealed Si/TiN/Ti substrate is the optimal choice to achieve vertically oriented, highly aligned TiO2 nanorods.",,1918
1042,35974577,Intrinsic equilibrium of stably autorotating samaras.,"During descent, a single-winged maple seed (samara) can naturally reach a delicate equilibrium state, stable autorotation, before landing. This article reveals the intrinsic equilibrium of a particular type of samaras in terms of measurable aerodynamic and geometric parameters. To this end, we conducted a series of in situ measurements for the rate of vertical descent (exclusive of crosswind) of an autorotating samara in a natural range of samara sizes and masses. We then extended the range of size and mass by introducing artificial samaras, with discrete mass elements purposely designed to approximate the asymmetrical and nonuniform distribution of mass found with natural samaras. Based on the widened range, a fundamental nondimensional correlation of dynamic pressure and disc loading was generalized, where all stable autorotation descent profiles collapse to a single descent characteristic curve, irrespective of the size and mass of the natural and artificial samara's specimens. Results reveal that for stably autorotating (both natural and artificial) samaras, their terminal descent velocity (expressed as dynamic pressure) and disc loading attained equilibrium at a value that is inversely proportional to the coefficient of lift.",,1919

435,35979149,The impact of COVID-19 on radiological findings in patients accessing the emergency department: a multicentric study.,"The aim of this multicentric study is to illustrate how the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown affected the workload and outcomes of radiological examinations in emergency radiology. The exams performed in the radiology departments of 4 Italian hospitals during 3 weeks of the Italian lockdown were retrospectively reviewed and compared to the exams conducted during the same period in 2019. Only exams from the emergency department (ED) were included. Two radiologists from each hospital defined the cases as positive or negative findings, based on independent blind readings of the imaging studies. In the case of differences in the evaluation, consensus was reached amongst them via discussion. Continuous measurements are presented as median and interquartile range, while categorical measurements are presented as frequency and percentage; p-values were calculated using the t-test, Mann-Whitney test, and the c2 test. There were 745 patients (53% male; 62 years [44-78]) who underwent radiological examinations in 2020 vs. 2623 (52% male; 56 years [35-76]) in 2019 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the total number of ED exams dropped from 3206 (2019) to 939 (2020), with a relative increase of CT examinations from 23% to 33% (p < 0.001). The percentage of patients with a positive finding was significantly higher in 2020 (355, 48%) compared to 2019 (684, 26%) (p < 0.001). Our findings show that despite the reduction of emergency radiological examinations, there was a rela-tive increase in the number of positive cases. These significant findings are crucial to ensure better organization of radiology departments and improve patient management during similar health emergencies in the future.",,1921

1409,35968493,Potential Barriers of Patient Involvement in Health Technology Assessment in Central and Eastern European Countries.,"Patients' perspectives are important to identify preferences, estimate values and appreciate unmet medical needs in the process of research and development and subsequent assessment of new health technologies. Patient and public involvement in health technology assessment (HTA) is essential in understanding and assessing wider implications of coverage and reimbursement decisions for patients, their relatives, caregivers, and the general population. There are two approaches to incorporating the patients' voice in HTA, preferably used in a mix. In the first one, patients, caregivers and/or their representatives directly participate at discussions in different stages of the HTA process, often at the same table with other stakeholders. Secondly, patient involvement activities can be supported by evidence on patient value and experience collected directly from patients, caregivers and/or their representatives often by patient groups Patient involvement practices, however, are limited in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries without clear methodology or regulatory mechanisms to guide patient involvement in the HTA process. This poses the question of transferability of practices used in other countries, and might call for the development of new CEE-specific guidelines and methods. In this study we aim to map potential barriers of patient involvement in HTA in countries of the CEE region.",,1924
482,35978873,Fecal gene detection based on next generation sequencing for colorectal cancer diagnosis.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Given its insidious onset, the condition often already progresses to advanced stage when symptoms occur. Thus, early diagnosis is of great significance for timely clinical intervention, efficacy enhancement, and prognostic improvement. Featuring high throughput, fastness, and rich information, next generation sequencing (NGS) can greatly shorten the detection time, which is a widely used detection technique at present. To screen specific genes or gene combinations in fecal DNA that are suitable for diagnosis and prognostic prediction of CRC, and to establish a technological platform for CRC screening, diagnosis, and efficacy monitoring through fecal DNA detection. NGS was used to sequence the stool DNA of patients with CRC, which were then compared with the genetic testing results of the stool samples of normal controls and patients with benign intestinal disease, as well as the tumor tissues of CRC patients. Specific genes or gene combinations in fecal DNA suitable for diagnosis and prognostic prediction of CRC were screened, and their significances in diagnosing CRC and predicting patients' prognosis were comprehensively evaluated. High mutation frequencies of TP53, APC, and KRAS were detected in the stools and tumor tissues of CRC patients prior to surgery. Contrastively, no pathogenic mutations of the above three genes were noted in the postoperative stools, the normal controls, or the benign intestinal disease group. This indicates that tumor-specific DNA was detectable in the preoperative stools of CRC patients. The preoperative fecal expression of tumor-associated genes can reflect the gene mutations in tumor tissues to some extent. Compared to the postoperative stools and the stools in the two control groups, the pathogenic mutation frequencies of TP53 and KRAS were significantly higher for the preoperative stools (χ 2 = 7.328, P < 0.05; χ 2 = 4.219, P < 0.05), suggesting that fecal TP53 and KRAS genes can be used for CRC screening, diagnosis, and prognostic prediction. No significant difference in the pathogenic mutation frequency of the APC gene was found from the postoperative stools or the two control groups (χ 2 = 0.878, P > 0.05), so further analysis with larger sample size is required. Among CRC patients, the pathogenic mutation sites of TP53 occurred in 16 of 27 preoperative stools, with a true positive rate of 59.26%, while the pathogenic mutation sites of KRAS occurred in 10 stools, with a true positive rate of 37.04%. The sensitivity and negative predictive values of the combined genetic testing of TP53 and KRAS were 66.67% (18/27) and 68.97%, respectively, both of which were higher than those of TP53 or KRAS mutation detection alone, suggesting that the combined genetic testing can improve the CRC detection rate. The mutation sites TP53 exon 4 A84G and EGFR exon 20 I821T (mutation start and stop positions were both 7579436 for the former, while 55249164 for the latter) were found in the preoperative stools and tumor tissues. These undetected mutation sites may be new types of mutations occurring during the CRC carcinogenesis and progression, which needs to be confirmed through further research. Some mutations of unknown clinical significance were found in such genes as TP53, PTEN, KRAS, BRAF, AKT1, and PIK3CA, whose clinical values is worthy of further exploration. NGS-based fecal genetic testing can be used as a complementary technique for the CRC diagnosis. Fecal TP53 and KRAS can be used as specific genes for the screening, diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and recurrence monitoring of CRC. Moreover, the combined testing of TP53 and KRAS genes can improve the CRC detection rate.",,1925
1560,35968326,Overexpression of glucocorticoid receptor promotes the poor progression and induces cisplatin resistance through p38 MAP kinase in cervical cancer patients.,"Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is activated by synthetic glucocorticoid or endogenous cortisol which were released by the physical and psychosocial stress, and recent studies reported that it is involved in tumor initiation and metastasis in various solid cancers. However, role of GR in cervical cancer has not been elucidated yet. Therefore, here we aim to unveil the role of GR in cervical cancer with cervical cancer clinical specimen and cervical cancer cell lines. We found that overexpression of GR was associated with poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients. Also, GR knockdown in cervical cancer cell lines showed diminished proliferation, invasion and EMT properties. Besides, we found that GR was positively associated with FoxP3 expression, and combination of GR and FoxP3 overexpression revealed as more reliable biomarker for poor prognosis and poor response to chemotherapy of cervical cancer patient than GR alone. Moreover, FACS-based Annexin-V/PI double staining and cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) showed that siGR enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis, which was mediated by p38 MAP kinase. Collectively, our findings established that the combination of high GR and FoxP3 was associated with cervical cancer progression and platinum resistance, suggesting a potential predictive biomarker for clinical management in patients with cervical cancer.",,1926

It has been regarded as an essential discipline that is indispensable in language acquisition. It helps learners to figure out the word structure and meaning, particularly the meaning changing of morphemes, which is pivotal for defining words. The present study focuses on developing morphological knowledge with online corpora which are the useful tools for teaching and learning the changes happened in English. Given this light, this research reports an ESL vocabulary classroom in which the instructor designs vocabulary classroom activities with COCA, BNC, TIME MAGAZINE corpus to enrich students' English vocabulary knowledge, help them master word usage, and foster their corpus literacy. This study is oriented by the framework of Classroom Action Research (CAR). Students' classroom performances were recorded and their self-reflections of learning experiences were collected for thematic analysis. The results indicate that, firstly, students' morphological knowledge has been developed as well as their vocabulary knowledge; secondly, their vocabulary self-regulated learning motivation has been incentivised that they are able to answer their own queries about words; thirdly, students' corpus literacy has been fostered, which facilitates their ongoing vocabulary learning; last but not least, a community of inquiry has been established in which students collaborate to construct vocabulary knowledge. The study has wider implications for constructing the student-centered vocabulary classroom and implementing corpus-based instruction in other second language vocabulary classrooms.",,1928
1900,35967709,"Perceived corporate social responsibility and pro-environmental behaviour: Insights from business schools of Peshawar, Pakistan.","Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and environmental sustainability have become urgent concerns for contemporary businesses. This study focuses on the interplay between corporate social responsibility perceptions and pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) in response to experts' call for research on the micro-foundations of corporate social responsibility. In addition, it reveals the mechanism underpinning how perceived CSR shapes pro-environmental behaviour in an understudied developing context. Empirically, a qualitative multiple-case research design is utilised by selecting three business schools from Peshawar, Pakistan. Fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior management and faculty to collect data. Besides primary data, a qualitative documentary review is used to enhance the research. Data analysis is done through the thematic network technique. Plantation, cleanliness, waste reduction, and energy conservation are the environmental aspects of CSR as regarded by employees. In addition, perceived CSR shapes pro-environmental behaviour via environmental knowledge and awareness, eco-civic sense, environmental values, personality traits, religious perspective, and perceived organisational support for the environment. This study provides original additions to the CSR literature by suggesting eco-civic sensibility and religious perspective as new CSR drivers for pro-environmental conduct. Incorporating stakeholder salience into the context of the present study also advances CSR research. The findings are also valuable for management to make the CSR agenda of business schools more strategic, comprehensive, and centred on the priorities of salient stakeholders.",,1929

1876,35967741,Limited Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic-related Lockdowns and Reduced Population Mobility on Preterm Birth Rates: A Secondary Analysis of Bavarian Obstetric Quality Parameters from 2010 to 2020.,"Introduction International studies on preterm birth rates during COVID-19 lockdowns report different results. This study examines preterm birth rates during lockdown periods and the impact of the mobility changes of the population in Bavaria, Germany. Material and Methods This is a secondary analysis of centrally collected data on preterm births in Bavaria from 2010 to 2020. Preterm births (< 37 weeks) in singleton and twin pregnancies during two lockdowns were compared with corresponding periods in 2010 - 2019. Fisher's exact test was used to compare raw prevalence between groups. Potential effects of two fixed lockdown periods and of variable changes in population mobility on preterm birth rates in 2020 were examined using additive logistic regression models, adjusting for long-term and seasonal trends. Results Unadjusted preterm birth rates in 2020 were significantly lower for singleton pregnancies during the two lockdown periods (Lockdown 1: 5.71% vs. 6.41%; OR 0.88; p < 0.001; Lockdown 2: 5.71% vs. 6.60%; OR = 0.86; p < 0.001). However, these effects could not be confirmed after adjusting for long-term trends (Lockdown 1: adj. OR = 0.99; p = 0.73; Lockdown 2: adj. OR = 0.96; p = 0.24). For twin pregnancies, differences during lockdown were less marked (Lockdown 1: 52.99% vs. 56.26%; OR = 0.88; p = 0.15; Lockdown 2: 58.06% vs. 58.91%; OR = 0.97; p = 0.70). Reduced population mobility had no significant impact on preterm birth rates in singleton pregnancies (p = 0.14) but did have an impact on twin pregnancies (p = 0.02). Conclusions Reduced preterm birth rates during both lockdown periods in 2020 were observed for singleton and twin pregnancies. However, these effects are reduced when adjusting for long-term and seasonal trends. Reduced population mobility was associated with lower preterm birth rates in twin pregnancies. Einleitung Internationale Studien zu Frühgeburtenraten während den COVID-19-Lockdowns kommen zu unterschiedlichen Ergebnissen. Diese Studie untersucht die Frühgeburtenraten während den Lockdowns sowie die Auswirkungen von Änderungen der Bevölkerungsmobilität in Bayern auf die Frühgeburtenraten. Material und Methoden Es handelt sich um eine Sekundäranalyse von zentral erhobenen Daten zu Frühgeburten in Bayern zwischen 2010 und 2020. Die Frühgeburten (< 37. Schwangerschaftswoche) bei Einlings- und Zwillingsschwangerschaften, die in der Zeit der beiden Lockdowns auftraten, wurden den Frühgeburten in den Vergleichszeiträume der Jahre 2010 – 2019 gegenübergestellt. Die Rohprävalenzen der Gruppen wurden mit dem exakten Test nach Fisher verglichen. Additive logistische Regressionsmodelle wurden eingesetzt, um die potenziellen Auswirkungen von 2 Lockdowns sowie von Änderungen der Bevölkerungsmobilität auf die Frühgeburtenraten im Jahre 2020 zu untersuchen. Die Effekte wurden dann zusätzlich auf langfristige und saisonbedingte Trends adjustiert. Ergebnisse Die unbereinigten Frühgeburtenraten von Einlingsschwangerschaften während den 2 Lockdowns im Jahre 2020 waren signifikant niedriger (Lockdown 1: 5,71% vs. 6,41%; OR 0,88; p < 0,001; Lockdown 2: 5,71% vs. 6,60%; OR = 0,86; p < 0,001). Nachdem die Effekte auf langfristige und saisonbedingte Trends adjustiert worden waren, konnten die Auswirkungen aber nicht bestätigt werden (Lockdown 1: ber. OR = 0,99; p = 0,73; Lockdown 2: ber. OR = 0,96; p = 0,24). Die Unterschiede während der Lockdownzeiträume waren bei Zwillingsschwangerschaften weniger ausgeprägt (Lockdown 1: 52,99% vs. 56,26%; OR = 0,88; p = 0,15; Lockdown 2: 58,06% vs. 58,91%; OR = 0,97; p = 0,70). Eine geringere Bevölkerungsmobilität hatte keine signifikanten Auswirkungen auf die Frühgeburtenraten bei Einlingsschwangerschaften (p = 0,14), dafür aber auf die Frühgeburtenraten bei Zwillingsschwangerschaften (p = 0,02). Schlussfolgerungen Es wurden niedrigere Frühgeburtenraten bei Einlings- und Zwillingsschwangerschaften während den beiden Lockdowns im Jahre 2020 beobachtet. Diese Effekte wurden teilweise gemindert, wenn sie auf langfristige und saisonale Trends adjustiert wurden. Die geringere Bevölkerungsmobilität war mit einer niedrigeren Frühgeburtenrate bei Zwillingsschwangerschaften assoziiert.",,1932
1567,35968319,Consensus on early detection of disease progression in patients with multiple sclerosis.,"Early identification of the transition from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) can be challenging for clinicians, as diagnostic criteria for SPMS are primarily based on physical disability and a holistic interpretation. To establish a consensus on patient monitoring to identify promptly disease progression and the most useful clinical and paraclinical variables for early identification of disease progression in MS. A RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was used to establish the level of agreement among a panel of 15 medical experts in MS. Eighty-three items were circulated to the experts for confidential rating of the grade of agreement and recommendation. Consensus was defined when ≥66% agreement or disagreement was achieved. Consensus was reached in 72 out of 83 items (86.7%). The items addressed frequency of follow-up visits, definition of progression, identification of clinical, cognitive, and radiological assessments as variables of suspected or confirmed SPMS diagnosis, the need for more accurate assessment tools, and the use of promising molecular and imaging biomarkers to predict disease progression and/or diagnose SPMS. Consensus achieved on these topics could guide neurologists to identify earlier disease progression and to plan targeted clinical and therapeutic interventions during the earliest stages of SPMS.",,1933
1191,35972092,Stereotactic-Guided Transcerebellar Cisternoperitoneal Shunt Placement for Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.,"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can cause debilitating symptoms and optic nerve ischemia if untreated. Cerebrospinal fluid diversion is often necessary to reduce intracranial pressure; however, current ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunting techniques have high failure rates in patients with IIH. To describe our experience treating IIH with a novel stereotactic-guided transcerebellar cisternoperitoneal shunt (SGTC-CPS) technique that places the proximal shunt catheter in the posterior cisterna magnum. Retrospective perioperative and postoperative data from all patients who underwent SGTC-CPS placement for IIH from March 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020, were analyzed. Patients were positioned as for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement but with the head turned farther laterally to adequately expose the retrosigmoid space. Using neuronavigation, an opening was made near the transverse-sigmoid junction, and the proximal catheter was inserted transcerebellarly into the posterior foramen magnum. Thirty-two patients underwent SGTC-CPS placement (29 female; mean body mass index, 36.0 ± 7.5; 14 with prior shunt failures). The mean procedure time for shunt placement was 145 minutes. No intraoperative complications occurred, and all patients were discharged uneventfully. At the 6-month follow-up, 81% of patients (21 of 26) had relief of their presenting symptoms. Shunt survival without revision was 86% (25 of 29) at 1 year and 67% (10 of 15) at 3 years, with no infections. The SGTC-CPS offers an alternative solution for cerebrospinal fluid diversion in patients with IIH and demonstrates a lower failure rate and more durable symptom relief compared with ventriculoperitoneal or lumboperitoneal shunt placement. Using proper techniques and equipment promotes safe and facile placement of the proximal catheter.",,1934

Our objective was to quantify onychomycosis treatment recommendations on YouTube. We searched YouTube for nail fungus, toenail fungus, onychomycosis treatment, onychomycosis, and nail fungus treatment in separate searches. The top 30 videos meeting inclusion criteria in each search were viewed for video demographics and treatment recommendations. Analysis was performed on 102 videos. The majority of videos (81.3%) were intended for patient education. Analyzing videos by speaker, 50.0% featured a podiatrist, 13.7% a nondermatologist physician or other medical professional, 10.8% a patient or blogger, 6.9% a dermatologist, and 2.0% a nail technician. Videos recommended FDA-approved therapies, as well as OTC products. The most recommended medical therapies included oral terbinafine and laser therapy, mentioned in 29 and 28 videos, respectively. Various natural remedies were recommended, with tea tree oil being endorsed in 23 videos. YouTube offers patient education on a range of treatment options for onychomycosis. We caution patients against starting treatments based on social media recommendations and encourage dermatologists to utilize social media to educate the public on common dermatological conditions.",,1935
1697,35968073,Health policy analysis in Eastern Mediterranean region using a health policy triangle framework: Historical and ethical insights from a systematic review.,"Health policy can be defined as an agreement and consensus on a health-related program and set of actions taken to achieve the goals expected by programs in the area of policy. Policy analysis involves a wide range of methods, techniques, and tools in a way to reach awareness of the impacts of the developed and implemented policies. Whereas policy analysis in developed countries has a long history, in developing countries, it is instead in its first developing stages. Our paper aimed to collect systematically the studies using health policy triangle framework in doing analysis in one of the health policy issues in the Eastern Mediterranean region organization. To conduct our literature search, ISI/Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Global Health Database, Scopus, as well as Google Scholar from 2003 up to June 2020 were systematically mined. To evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies, the Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist was used. We selected 30 studies, conducted between 2011 and 2020. According to the findings of these studies, in the Eastern Mediterranean region, organization region, and the role of evidence-based research in policy-making has been repeatedly emphasized, but its use in health program decision-making has been limited, and health research systems in Eastern Mediterranean region organization are still under scrutiny. There is still a gap between evidence-based research in health systems and its use in policy-making. Based on the present systematic review, studies based on policy analysis should focus on all the elements of health policies and provide evidence to inform decisions that can strengthen health systems, improve health and improve existing inequalities.",,1936
1935,35967674,Lifestyle medicine pillars as predictors of psychological flourishing.,"Positive Psychology Interventions (PPI) are widely applied to improving wellbeing and helping individuals flourish. At the same time, Lifestyle Medicine (LM) offers an opportunity to boost PPI and psychological research, by expanding its capacity beyond psychology, to include the body and social environment. However, little is known about the relationship between LM and positive psychology flourishing models. Flourishing is as a stage of optimal human functioning that goes beyond moderate wellbeing. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to, (1) identify which of the six LM pillars (sleep, physical exercise, eating well, alcohol intake, social engagement, stress management) best-predicted flourishing; (2) examine the relationship between the number of LM pillars used by individuals and flourishing; and (3) determine the odds of using LM pillars by flourishers. A total of 1,112 participants, mostly female professionals (73%), aged 40-59 (77%), based in Ireland, completed an online survey. Regression analysis showed that all six LM pillars predicted flourishing as measured by the PERMA Profiler (including the Physical Health component) and the Mental Health Continuum (MHC). Moreover, the chi-square and odds ratio analysis showed that those who flourished were three times more likely to use 3-6 LM pillars than those who were moderately well; and nine times more likely than languishers. The results are discussed in the context of their contribution to enhancing the population's health and wellbeing.",,1937
1874,35967764,The prognostic utility of personality traits versus past psychiatric diagnoses: Predicting future mental health and functioning.,"Past psychiatric diagnoses are central to patient case formulation and prognosis. Recently, alternative classification models such as the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) proposed to assess traits to predict clinically-relevant outcomes. The current study directly compared personality traits and past diagnoses as predictors of future mental health and functioning in three independent, prospective samples. Regression analyses found that personality traits significantly predicted future first onsets of psychiatric disorders (ΔR2=06-.15), symptom chronicity (ΔR2=.03-.06), and functioning (ΔR2=.02-.07), beyond past and current psychiatric diagnoses. Conversely, past psychiatric diagnoses did not provide an incremental prediction of outcomes when personality traits and other concurrent predictors were already included in the model. Overall, personality traits predicted a variety of outcomes in diverse settings, beyond diagnoses. Past diagnoses were generally not informative about future outcomes when personality was considered. Together, these findings support the added value of personality traits assessment in case formulation, consistent with HiTOP model.",,1938
1707,35968063,"Impact of the state of emergency on trends in the care of three major diseases at Showa University Hospital, Japan: a retrospective and descriptive study.","This study aimed to examine the trends in patient consultations for three major diseases (cancer, heart disease, and stroke) at Showa University Hospital, Japan during the state of emergency for the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present study was a retrospective and descriptive study of Showa University Hospital in Tokyo, Japan. Subjects were patients who had received medical treatment at Showa University Hospital and were diagnosed from 2017 to 2020. To examine the impact of the state of emergency, the number visits to hospital by the top three causes of death or other diseases were summarised from 21 weeks of data, from week 8 to week 28, for each year. Compared to the average of the previous 3 years, a comparison of the three periods before and after the state of emergency showed a V-shaped curve in 2020, with a large drop in the number of cancer patients during the state of emergency, both from within Tokyo and from outside the city. This study showed a long-term decrease in cancer patient visits to Showa University Hospital since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the previous 3 years. It is also possible that medical care that would have been available may not have been provided due to the state of emergency, so it is necessary to follow up patients while keeping a close eye on measures other than infectious diseases.",,1939
49,35983539,A practice test and selection of a core set of outcome-based quality indicators in Dutch primary care physical therapy for patients with COPD: a cohort study.,"To estimate the comparability and discriminability of outcome-based quality indicators by performing a practice test in Dutch physical therapy primary care, and to select a core set of outcome-based quality indicators that are well accepted by physical therapists based on their perceived added value as a quality improvement tool. First, a list of potential quality indicators was defined, followed by determination of the comparability (case-mix adjusted multilevel analysis) and discriminability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)). Second, focus group meetings were conducted with stakeholders (physical therapists and senior researchers) to select a core set of quality indicators. Overall, 229 physical therapists from 137 practices provided 2651 treatment episodes. Comparability: in 10 of the 11 case-mix adjusted models, the ICC increased compared with the intercept-only model. Discriminability: the ICC ranged between 0.01 and 0.34, with five of the 11 ICCs being >0.10. The majority of physical therapists in each focus group preferred the inclusion of seven quality indicators in the core set, including three process and four outcome indicators based upon the 6-min walk test (6MWT), the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ), and the determination of quadriceps strength using a hand-held dynamometer. This is the first study to describe the comparability and discriminability of the outcome-based quality indicators selected for patients with COPD treated in primary care physical therapy practices. Future research should focus on increasing data collection in daily practice and on the development of tangible methods to use as the core set of a quality improvement tool.",,1940

1212,35971602,A modified method of augmented distal clavicle fracture osteosynthesis with a Fibertape coracoclavicular cerclage.,"Unstable distal clavicles experience high non-union rates, prompting surgeons to recommend surgery for more predictable outcomes. There is a lack of consensus on the optimal method of surgical fixation, with an array of techniques described in the literature. We describe an alternative method of fixation involving the use of a distal clavicular anatomical locking plate with Fibertape cerclage augmentation in our series of patients. Nine patients (8 males and 1 female), with a mean age of 36 years, who sustained unstable fracture of the distal clavicle in our institution were treated with our described technique. Postoperative range of motion, functional and pain scores, and time to radiographic union were measured over a mean follow-up period of 10 months. Incidences of postoperative complications were also recorded. At the last patient consult, the mean visual analog scale score was 0.88±0.35, with a mean Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score of 1.46±0.87 and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score of 94.1±3.57. The mean range of motion achieved was forward flexion at 173°±10.6°, abduction at 173°±10.6°, and external rotation at 74.4°±10.5°. All patients achieved internal rotation at a vertebral height of at least L2 with radiographical union at a mean of 10 weeks. No removal of implants was required. Our described technique of augmented fixation of the distal clavicle is effective, produces good clinical outcomes, and has minimal complications.",,1942
1503,35968384,Abnormal network homogeneity of default-mode network and its relationships with clinical symptoms in antipsychotic-naïve first-diagnosis schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder affecting around 0.5-1% of the global population. A few studies have shown the functional disconnection in the default-mode network (DMN) of schizophrenia patients. However, the findings remain discrepant. In the current study, we compared the intrinsic network organization of DMN of 57 first-diagnosis drug-naïve schizophrenia patients with 50 healthy controls (HCs) using a homogeneity network (NH) and explored the relationships of DMN with clinical characteristics of schizophrenia patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis and support vector machine (SVM) analysis were applied to calculate the accuracy of distinguishing schizophrenia patients from HCs. Our results showed that the NH values of patients were significantly higher in the left superior medial frontal gyrus (SMFG) and right cerebellum Crus I/Crus II and significantly lower in the right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) compared to those of HCs. Additionally, negative correlations were shown between aberrant NH values in the right cerebellum Crus I/Crus II and general psychopathology scores, between NH values in the left SMFG and negative symptom scores, and between the NH values in the right ITG and speed of processing. Also, patients' age and the NH values in the right cerebellum Crus I/Crus II and the right ITG were the predictors of performance in the social cognition test. ROC curves analysis and SVM analysis showed that a combination of NH values in the left SMFG, right ITG, and right cerebellum Crus I/Crus II could distinguish schizophrenia patients from HCs with high accuracy. The results emphasized the vital role of DMN in the neuropathological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia.",,1943
1080,35974539,Suppression of quasiperiodicity in circle maps with quenched disorder.,"We show that introducing quenched disorder into a circle map leads to the suppression of quasiperiodic behavior in the limit of large system sizes. Specifically, for most parameters the fraction of disorder realizations showing quasiperiodicity decreases with the system size and eventually vanishes in the limit of infinite size, where almost all realizations show mode locking. Consequently, in this limit, and in strong contrast to standard circle maps, almost the whole parameter space corresponding to invertible dynamics consists of Arnold tongues.",,1944
1748,35967994,Prospective evaluation of complications associated with orthosis and prosthesis use in canine patients.,"The use of orthoses and prostheses is expanding in veterinary medicine. However, research evaluating the efficacy and complications of these devices in veterinary patients is limited. The primary objective of this study was to prospectively determine the complications and outcomes associated with custom orthosis and prosthesis use in the canine patient. This was a prospective, clinical trial that followed patients for 12 months following device fitting. Owner-perceived complications, clinical metrology instruments, and objective gait analysis were used as outcome measures at various time points. The patients were grouped into the following four major categories: Patients with a carpal orthosis, patients with a stifle orthosis, patients with a tarsal orthosis, and patients with a prosthetic device. Forty-three patients were included in the study. Thirty-nine out of 43 patients (91%) experienced at least one complication, with 7/7 (100%) prosthesis patients experiencing at least one complication. At least one skin complication was reported for the following patient groups during the first 3 months of use: 8/14 (58%) stifle orthoses, 9/10 (90%) carpal orthoses, 6/10 (60%) tarsal orthoses, and 4/7 (58%) prostheses. Patient non-acceptance of the device was identified in 2/15 (14%) stifle orthoses, 1/10 (10%) tarsal orthoses, and 4/7 (55%) prostheses. One out of 15 (7%) stifle orthoses, 4/10 (40%) carpal orthoses, 4/10 (40%) tarsal orthoses, and 1/7 (15%) prostheses experienced mechanical device problems necessitating repair. The majority of patients with carpal and stifle orthoses showed improvement on objective gait analysis in percent body weight distribution of the affected limb between baseline and the most recent follow-up without the device donned: 83% (n = 6) of patients with carpal orthoses, 100% (n = 11) of patients with stifle orthoses. None of the patients with tarsal orthoses showed a similar improvement (0%; n = 4). Three major complications associated with canine orthosis and prosthesis use were identified in this study as follows: Skin complications (abrasions, loss of hair, and sores), mechanical device problems, and patient non-acceptance of the device. Owners should be notified of these potential complications prior to pursuing orthoses or prostheses as a potential treatment option. Although clinical improvement was noted in the majority of patients with stifle and carpal pathology, given the lack of a control group, it is unknown how much of this improvement can be attributed to the orthoses.",,1945
1302,35967008,Patient and public involvement in stroke research: a scoping review protocol.,"Background: Growing consensus supports public and patient involvement (PPI) in research as the lived experience of patients, family carers and users of health and social care services bring unique insights to healthcare research. The impact and burden of stroke present ongoing challenges for those living with its consequences and could potentially limit PPI activity. This review aims to explore PPI in published stroke research to identify and describe the extent, nature and design of PPI activities, the type/s of studies involved and the profile of PPI participants engaged in stroke research. Methods: This systematic scoping review, guided by the Arksey & O'Malley five step framework, will be reported according to the PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines. PPI is embedded at each stage of this proposed scoping review from conceptualisation, participation, contribution and collaboration. The Population, Concept, Context (PCC) structure defines the research question which asks - How is PPI in stroke research currently being conducted and how do the study authors report their PPI activities and its impact? A comprehensive range of electronic databases including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will generate a broad range of studies. Grey literature (e.g. OpenGrey, Lenus) and internationally recognised stroke organisation websites will be searched for additional research reports. Data extraction will adhere to the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, with results collated and mapped to the research cycle stage/s. Conclusions: The outlined scoping review protocol will comprehensively identify and map the existing scientific literature that reports PPI in stroke research. Findings will be presented in relation to PPI conceptualisation, participant profiles and activities in stroke research, volume, type and range of approaches. Knowledge gaps may be identified thereby offering opportunities and recommendations for future priorities for PPI in stroke research.",,1946
1113,35974506,Anisotropic correlations of plasticity on the yielding of metallic glasses.,"We report computer simulations on the shear deformation of CuZr metallic glasses at zero and room temperatures. Shear bands emerge in athermal alloys at strain γ_{c}, with a finite-size effect found. The correlation of nonaffine displacement exhibits an exponential decay even after yielding in thermal alloys, but transits to a power law at γ>γ_{c} in athermal ones. The algebraic exponent is around -1 for the decay inside shear bands, consistent with the theoretical prediction in random elastic media. We quantify the anisotropic correlation with harmonic projection, finding the spectrum is weak in the exponential-decay regime, while it displays a strong polar and quadrupolar symmetry in the power-law regime. The nonvanishing quadrupolar symmetry at long distance signifies the nonlocality of plastic correlation in the athermal alloys. In contrast, the plastic correlation was found to be isotropic and localized at the yielding in the thermal alloys without shear bands.",,1947
100,35983383,An Assessment of the Profile and Predictors of Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients Hospitalized in a Tertiary Care Institute in Central India.,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the largest pandemic that has affected people around the globe. Various researches have been conducted worldwide, but there is a scarcity of data from Central India on the relationship between several risk factors for infection and mortality. Our study assessed the predictors and patient profiles of those with COVID-19, which will aid in prioritizing patient treatment and preventive measures. Methods A retrospective study was done between March and December 2020. The study included 5,552 COVID-19 patients admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Raipur. A validated questionnaire form provided by the WHO was used. Data for multiple clinical and nonclinical parameters were collected, and analysis was done using SPSS version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and STATA version 12 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). Mortality and risk assessment of patients was done using multivariate logistic regression. Result In our study cohort of 5,552 COVID-19 patients, the median age was found to be 47 years (interquartile range (IQR): 31-60 years; range: 14-100 years), and 3,557 (64%) were male. Predominantly, patients presented with fever (41.30%), cough (40.20%), and dyspnea (29.29%). The major comorbidities were hypertension (29.70%), diabetes (25.40%), and chronic cardiac disease (5.79%). The common complications were liver dysfunction (26.83%), viral pneumonitis (23.66%), acute renal injury (15.25%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (13.41%). In multivariate analysis, age (more than 40 years) (odds ratio (OR): 2.63; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.531-4.512; p<0.001), diabetes (OR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.088-2.399; p=0.017), obesity (OR: 6.88; 95% CI: 2.188-12.153; p=0.004), leukocytosis (OR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.422-2.422; p<0.001), lymphocytopenia (OR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.718-3.826; p<0.001), thrombocytopenia (OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.777-8.700; p=0.001), and ferritin concentration > 1,000 ng/mL (OR: 4.67; 95% CI: 1.991-10.975; p<0.001) were the independent predictors of mortality among COVID-19 patients. Conclusion The leading comorbidities in our study were hypertension, followed by diabetes. Patients who were 40 years or older, obese patients, and diabetic patients have a higher mortality risk. The poor prognostic predictors in COVID-19 patients were high ferritin levels (>1,000 ng/mL), leukocytosis, lymphocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia.",,1948
1764,35967960,Mesenteric Vascular Evaluation with Pre-operative Multidetector Computed Tomographic Angiography and Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Angiography to Reduce Anastomotic Leaks after Minimally Invasive Surgery for Colorectal Cancer.,"The aim of this prospective study was to determine the effect of mesenteric vascular evaluation using pre-operative multidetector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA) and intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) angiography on reducing the anastomotic leak rate of colorectal cancer patients undergoing minimally invasive resection. Twenty-seven consecutive patients with colorectal cancer were studied, 18 males and 9 females, average age 69.1 ± 3.9 years. All patients underwent pre-operative mesenteric vascular evaluation using MDCTA with three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and intraoperative evaluation of perfusion using ICG angiography. Twelve patients underwent laparoscopic resection (Olympus Visera Elite II OTV-S200) and 15 patients underwent robotic resection (DaVinci Si). Colorectal resection lines and anastomoses were guided by intraoperative ICG perfusion. Postoperative anastomotic leaks were assessed. Pre-operative MDCTA 3D reconstructions defined the left colic and sigmoid artery anatomy and guided operative planning. The intraoperative ICG angiography resulted in a change of the planned lines of resection in seven patients (26%). The rate of postoperative anastomotic leaks in this study was 0% (0/27), compared to a leak rate of 6.8% at our institution in the preceding two years. Pre-operative evaluation of mesenteric vascular anatomy using MDCTA with 3D reconstruction and intraoperative evaluation of perfusion using ICG angiography were found to be technically feasible and safe. An appropriately designed study should be undertaken to prove whether it was truly effective at reducing the postoperative anastomotic leak rate in colorectal cancer patients undergoing minimally invasive resection at our institution.",,1949
1712,35968058,Assessment of oral health status and treatment needs of HIV positive transgenders in Odisha - a cross-sectional study.,"Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes the human immunodeficiency infection which is a major global health problem. Oral health status of people infected by HIV is also compromised. There is limited literature on oral health status of HIV/AIDS transgenders in Odisha. This study was conducted to assess the oral health status of HIV-positive transgenders. A cross-sectional study was conducted among the HIV positive transgenders in Odisha. Snowball sampling technique was employed to reach the population. Oral health was recorded using modified WHO 2013 proforma. Clinical examination using disposable mouth mirror and explorer. Chi square statistics was used for finding the association between the socio-demographic variables and DMFT, CPI, and LOA scores. The study included 153 participants out of which seventy participants belonged to the age group 18-30 years. Majority of the participants were unemployed and most of them had spent around 6-10 years in school. Majority of the participants used toothbrush for cleaning their teeth and the average duration of cleaning tooth was less than two minutes. Toothpick was the most common method used for cleaning interdental areas and none of the participants used dental floss or interdental brushes. The mean DMFT score which was recorded to be 1.424. Around 28.10% (43) inmates had pockets of depth 4 mm to 5 mm. Loss of attachment of 6 mm to 8 mm was found in majority (57, 37.25%) of the participants. Most of the participants did not require any prosthesis both in the upper and lower arches. Around 32 participants (20.91%) had very mild fluorosis, 29 participants (18.95%) exhibited signs of moderate fluorosis. Age was found to be significantly associated with loss of attachment score (p = 0.023). Occupation had an association with the DMFT score (p = 0.002) while years in school was found to be significantly associated with CPI score (p = 0.045). The oral health status of transgenders is poor and needs immediate attention.",,1950

704,35975273,The effect of border closure on road potential accessibility in the regions of the EU-27. The case of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The purpose of the paper is to show how the national border closures within the EU-27 have an impact on changes in potential accessibility in individual transport at the NUTS3 level. We are referring to the situation that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Europe in March 2020. The study distinguishes between long and short trips, comparing the situation before the pandemic with that after the complete closure of national borders by all EU countries, thus showing which areas of the EU will suffer from accessibility losses for both long and short trips. We conclude that the spatial pattern of regions at risk of peripheralisation for short trips well defines the zones in which a serious crisis threatens local cross-border commuting. The threat of peripheralisation for long trips mainly concerns those parts of countries which are closer to the demographic and economic core of the European Union. Nevertheless, it is also compounded by other factors: including the national settlement and road networks.",,1952
1887,35967723,Development and initial validation of a clinical measure to assess symptoms of post-stroke depression in stroke patients at the rehabilitation stage.,"The high incidence of post-stroke depression (PSD) during rehabilitation exerts a negative effect on the treatment and functional recovery of patients with stroke and increases the risk of mortality. It is necessary to screen PSD in the rehabilitation stage and thus provide effective intervention strategies. However, existing measurements used to assess PSD in the rehabilitation stage in patients with stroke lack specificity. This study aimed to develop a clinical measure to assess symptoms of PSD in the rehabilitation stage. The research team created the initial items through a literature review and semi-structured interviews of patients with stroke. Then, the symptom-related items were estimated by three panels: healthcare professionals (N = 41), Delphi experts (N = 15), and patients with stroke in the rehabilitation stage (N = 30). The literature review and semi-structured interview produced 51 symptom-related items including six domains, and the items were reduced to 47 by the healthcare professionals. The symptom-related items were further reduced to 33 items by a two-round Delphi consultation. The initiative coefficients of the two Delphi rounds were 71.4 and 100%, the expert authority coefficients were both 0.85, Kendall's W were 0.152 and 0.408 (p < 0.01), and the coefficient of variation (CV) were 0.05-0.32 and 0.00-0.18, respectively. The item-level content validity index (I-CVI) was 0.53-1.00, the scale-level CVI/universal agreement (S-CVI/UA) was 0.26, and the S-CVI/average (S -CVI/Ave) was 0.85 for the first found Delphi consultation; the I-CVI was 0.67-1.00, the S-CVI/UA was 0.61, and the S-CVI/Ave was 0.97 for the second round Delphi consultation. All content validity indicators have been significantly improved compared with the first round. Using mean ≥ 4 and full score ≥ 0.5, combined with CV ≤ 0.16 as the item criteria, a clinical measure of PSD with 33 items and 6 dimensions (cognition, sleep, behavior, emotion, body, and guilt) was finally formed after two rounds. The patients with stroke made no further revisions after evaluation. The research team developed a specific tool with good content validity to assess the symptoms of PSD in the rehabilitation stage.",,1953
284,35981803,"Inferior Vena Cava as a Trigger for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Incidence, Characteristics, and Implications.","Identifying nonpulmonary vein triggers during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is of great importance. Currently, there are limited data on AF triggered by the inferior vena cava (IVC). This study was performed to investigate the incidence, characteristics, and implications of IVC triggers for AF. A total of 661 patients who underwent initial paroxysmal AF ablation were included. After pulmonary vein isolation, ectopic beats that triggered AF were further studied. Activation mapping and angiography were performed to confirm the location of ectopic origin. Electrocardiographic analysis of the ectopic P-wave (P'-wave) was performed. Six patients (0.91%) with AF triggered by the IVC were confirmed. The mean distance from the earliest activation site to the IVC ostium was 6.8 ± 2.5 mm (5.2 to 11.2 mm). Furthermore, the arrhythmogenic foci within the IVC were all located at the apical hemisphere of the IVC (3 at the septal side and 3 at the anterior side). A total of 2.3 ± 0.5 applications of radiofrequency energy were delivered to eliminate IVC triggers. The mean duration of the P' wave was 91.2 ± 11.2 milliseconds (81 to 108 milliseconds), which was narrower than that of the sinus P-wave (115.2 ± 19.3 milliseconds [87 to 139 milliseconds]; P = 0.002). Moreover, the configuration of all P' waves in the inferior leads was negative. During a mean follow-up period of 25.5 ± 7.3 months, all 6 patients remained arrhythmia free without antiarrhythmic drugs. IVC trigger, a rare but latent source of paroxysmal AF, could be identified and safely eliminated by focal radiofrequency ablation. Ectopic beats originating from the IVC presented with narrow P'-wave duration and negative P' waves in all inferior leads.",,1954
492,35978798,Figures of the Psychotherapist in Contemporary Chinese Literature.,"Since the 1980s, psychoanalysis and psychotherapy have attracted great interest in Chinese society, and in parallel, the psychotherapist as a character has emerged in Chinese literature. Through four novels by three Chinese authors, namely, Xu Xiaobin , Ke Yunlu , and Bi Shumin , this article studies the evolution of the image of the psychotherapist in contemporary Chinese literature, which reflects the reception of psychoanalysis as well as the development of psychotherapy in China. In Xu Xiaobin's novel, two psychology students attempt to cure a psychotic patient through transference therapy based on a complete misunderstanding of the notion; Ke Yunlu features a life counselor who, like typical good counselors in Chinese classical novels, simply gives advice without caring about the patients' needs and desires; and the two novels by Bi Shumin show a significant change in the writer's understanding of the profession and therapeutic methods, as well as the current, unregulated situation of psychotherapy in China.",,1955
60,35983469,Bazex Syndrome Associated with Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lip: A Rare Paraneoplastic Acrokeratosis with Nail Dystrophy.,"Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica of Bazex (APB) is a rare paraneoplastic dermatosis having definite association with malignancy, most commonly squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the upper aerodigestive tract. It is characterized by psoriasiform plaques involving the ears, nose, hands, and feet. Nail changes are commonly encountered, including onychauxis, subungual hyperkeratosis, xanthonychia, onycholysis, and onychorrhexis. We report the details of a 40-year-old male who presented with cutaneous changes involving both ears, palms, and soles and multiple nails, suggestive of APB. These typical changes were succeeded by an SCC of the lip. In 70% cases of APB, nail changes precede the diagnosis of the underlying neoplasm by up to 10 months, offering a good lead-time for early suspicion of malignancy. Our case highlights the importance of recognizing these changes early. An atypical location of malignancy (lower lip) and rare presentations, including painful acrokeratosis, melanonychia striata, and chloronychia, as seen in our case, should also be kept in mind.",,1956
276,35981951,American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery consensus statement on laparoscopic adjustable gastric band management.,"Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) management continues to be an important part of many metabolic and bariatric surgery practices. To replace the existing American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) LAGB adjustment credentialing guidelines for physician extenders with consensus statements that reflect the current state of LAGB management. ASMBS Integrated Health Clinical Issues Committee. A modified Delphi process using a 2-stage consensus approach was conducted on LAGB management. Thirty-four consensus statements were developed following a literature search on a wide range of LAGB topics. A 5-point Likert scale was implemented to measure consensus agreement with a Delphi panel of 39 expert participants who were invited and agreed to participate in 2 rounds of Delphi questionnaires. Consensus was set a priori at 75% agreement, defined as the proportion of participants responding with agreement (i.e., 4 or 5) or disagreement (i.e., 1 or 2) on the Likert scale. Consensus was reached on 74% (25 of 34) of the LAGB management statements. In Delphi round 1, 95% (37 of 39) of the participants responded to 34 consensus statements; 21 of the statements (62%) met the 75% criteria for consensus. Thirty-one participants (80%) responded in round 2, shifting the agreement on 4 more statements to the 75% threshold. The ASMBS consensus statement on LAGB management is intended to guide practice with current evidence-based knowledge and professional experience. The ASMBS is not a credentialing body and does not seek to guide credentialing with this document.",,1957
287,35981474,An Italian consensus on the management of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.,"Although international guidelines exist, the clinical heterogeneity of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and the increasing availability of new and repurposed drugs (e.g., fenfluramine and cannabidiol) requires a practical guide to patient management in the clinical context. We report the results of a consensus survey among 42 Italian experts in the diagnosis and treatment of LGS. The consensus procedure followed a modified Delphi approach. Statements were formulated, based on the most recent published evidence and the clinicians' personal experience, then discussed, and agreed upon by the experts through a two-round voting procedure. Approval of a statement was reached with an average score ≥7. Thirteen statements dealing with three main topics (i.e., clinical diagnosis and prognosis, impact on the Quality of Life (QoL), and treatment strategies) were generated. Six statements achieved a level of agreement sufficient for approval on the first voting round. Following the discussion and a few consequent amendments, most of the statements increased their level of agreement and all 13 were approved. Overall, the statements draw a slightly more benign picture of this rare and severe disease, highlighting the possibility of remission - albeit modest -, an apparent trend towards lower mortality, and the availability of several effective drugs, to which greater accessibility would be hoped for. Valproate remains a major therapeutic option in LGS patients although lamotrigine, rufinamide, topiramate, cannabidiol, and clobazam are popular therapeutic options in Italy, allowing for a tailor-made antiseizure therapy.",,1958
2080,35967438,The impact of antibiotic use on clinical features and survival outcomes of cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.,"Nowadays, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become one of the essential immunotherapies for cancer patients. However, the impact of antibiotic (ATB) use on cancer patients treated with ICIs remains controversial. Our research included retrospective studies and a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with cancer patients treated with ICIs and ATB, from the public database of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, clinical trials, and JAMA. The survival outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Meanwhile, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and subgroup analyses were performed to determine the concrete association between ATB use and the prognosis of cancer patients treated in ICIs. Our results revealed that ATB use was associated with poor survival outcomes, including OS (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.68-2.25, p <0.001) and PFS (HR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.53-2.19, p <0.001). The subgroup analysis learned about the association between ATB use and the prognosis of cancer patients with ICI treatment, including 5 cancer types, 3 kinds of ICI, 5 different ATP windows, broad-spectrum ATB class, and ECOG score. ATB treatment was associated with poor OS of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), esophageal cancer (EC), and melanoma (MEL) in patients treated in ICIs, while non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were associated with poor PFS. Meanwhile, it was strongly related to the ICI type and ATB window. Furthermore, it is firstly mentioned that the use of broad-spectrum ATB class was strongly associated with poor PFS. In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicated that ATB use was significantly associated with poor OS and PFS of cancer patients treated with ICI immunotherapy, especially for patients with ATB use in the period of (-60 days; +30 days) near the initiation of ICI treatment. Also, different cancer types and the ICI type can also impact the survival outcome. This first reveals the strong relationship between the broad-spectrum ATB class and poor PFS. Still, more studies are needed for further study.",,1959
696,35975314,"Prevalence, clinical features, and outcomes of COVID-19 in persons with cystic fibrosis: a systematic review protocol.","The objective of this review is to determine the incidence and prevalence, clinical features, and outcomes of COVID-19 in persons with cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis, predominantly a chronic respiratory illness, has long been known to be fatal with concomitant bacterial or viral infections. However, the effects of COVID-19 on this protracted disease need to be understood, especially since the major manifestations affect the respiratory system. Hence, the burden, clinical features, and outcomes of COVID-19 on individuals with cystic fibrosis need to be understood. This review will consider studies on persons in all age groups with preexisting cystic fibrosis who are diagnosed with COVID-19 using either a polymerase chain reaction, serology, or point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2. JBI methodology for systematic reviews of prevalence and incidence will be used for this review. A methodical search for eligible studies in English (as well as available translations) in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL, and unpublished literature in Google Scholar, Dissertation Abstracts International, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and MedNar will be conducted from the year 2020 onwards. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria will be selected for appraisal and their methodological quality will be assessed by two independent reviewers based on study titles and abstracts, followed by full-text review focusing on sampling and statistical analysis. Data extraction will be accomplished using a standardized tool. If adequate synthesized data are obtained, a meta-analysis will be conducted; otherwise, the findings will be presented in a narrative format, including tables and figures to aid in data presentation where appropriate.

1613,35968265,Information interventions can increase technology adoption through information network restructuring.,"The rapid adoption of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) is recasting the role of individual households as a dynamic and potent construct critical for emissions mitigation and resilience of the electricity system. As residential PV enters more risk-averse customer segments, broader deployment of residential PV depends on overcoming both financial and informational barriers to adoption. Fast-changing residential PV technologies and associated policies means there is both lack of information and often misinformation among customers-gaps that are addressed effectively with local, trusted information networks, especially for big-ticket items such as residential PV. Here, we use an extensively validated agent-based model of residential PV adoption to analyze the effectiveness of different information intervention designs in spurring PV diffusion. We show that intervention designs are effective when they balance long-distance connections and local reinforcement, matching the intervention to both the informational needs of potential adopters and the structure of the underlying network.",,1962

2257,35967174,"Monkeypox: A Review of Clinical Features, Diagnosis, and Treatment.","Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that results in a smallpox-like human disease. This causative organism belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus. It is known to affect the neurological, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems. The past few decades have seen endemic outbreaks of this viral infection due to the eradication of smallpox and subsequent laxity in vaccination efforts. Since it was initially diagnosed in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, it has spread to many countries worldwide, including the United States of America, becoming a disease of significant epidemiological importance. The most recent outbreak occurred in 2022. Although this viral disease is considered self-limiting, it poses serious public health concerns due to its complications and pandemic potential. This review will introduce a general overview of MPXV and describe the epidemiology, clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of monkeypox patients. It will also provide a means to raise awareness among primary and secondary healthcare providers. Furthermore, our review focuses on the most up-to-date clinical information for the effective management, prevention, and counselling of monkeypox patients worldwide.",,1964
601,35977876,Germline Testing of Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancers Demonstrating Incidentally Uncovered BRCA2 Apparent Pathogenic Germline Variants.,"Tumor next generation sequencing (NGS) is used to interrogate nearly every non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for the purpose of identifying actionable genetic alterations. Occasionally, tumor NGS also uncovers incidental apparent pathogenic germline variants (PGVs), with BRCA2 being among the most common of those. If germline testing confirms a BRCA2 PGV in a patient with NSCLC, therapies targeting that BRCA2 PGV might be considered, if the patient has exhausted standard NSCLC therapeutic options. Surveillance and preventive therapies for BRCA2-related cancers would be recommended or considered for that patient, as well as for family members found to carry that same BRCA2 PGV. Here, I offer my perspective related to the evidence supporting and against germline testing in patients with NSCLCs that show incidental BRCA2 apparent PGVs. I use an example to underscore how important it is to explain to patients, before tumor NGS, the possibility of uncovering an incidental PGV. I also review the myriad uncertainties related to identifying a BRCA2 PGV, when the sole indication for germline testing was the uncovering of the incidental BRCA2 apparent PGV.",,1965

2022,35967564,Mutational Landscape of CEBPA in Mexican Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients: Prognostic Implications.,"In Mexico, the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has increased in the last few years. Mortality is higher than in developed countries, even though the same chemotherapy protocols are used. CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein Alpha (CEBPA) mutations are recurrent in AML, influence prognosis, and help to define treatment strategies. CEBPA mutational profiles and their clinical implications have not been evaluated in Mexican pediatric AML patients. To identify the mutational landscape of the CEBPA gene in pediatric patients with de novo AML and assess its influence on clinical features and overall survival (OS). DNA was extracted from bone marrow aspirates at diagnosis. Targeted massive parallel sequencing of CEBPA was performed in 80 patients. CEBPA was mutated in 12.5% (10/80) of patients. Frameshifts at the N-terminal region were the most common mutations 57.14% (8/14). CEBPA biallelic (CEBPA BI) mutations were identified in five patients. M2 subtype was the most common in CEBPA positive patients (CEBPA POS) (p = 0.009); 50% of the CEBPA POS patients had a WBC count > 100,000 at diagnosis (p = 0.004). OS > 1 year was significantly better in CEBPA negative (CEBPA NEG) patients (p = 0.0001). CEBPA POS patients (either bi- or monoallelic) had a significantly lower OS (p = 0.002). Concurrent mutations in FLT3, CSF3R, and WT1 genes were found in CEBPA POS individuals. Their contribution to poor OS cannot be ruled out. CEBPA mutational profiles in Mexican pediatric AML patients and their clinical implications were evaluated for the first time. The frequency of CEBPA POS was in the range reported for pediatric AML (4.5-15%). CEBPA mutations showed a negative impact on OS as opposed to the results of other studies.",,1967
1175,35973350,Describing the relationships among meat quality traits in domestic turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations.,"The presence of meat quality defects is increasing in the turkey industry. While the main strategy for mitigating these issues is through improved housing, management, and slaughter conditions, it may be possible to incorporate meat quality into a turkey breeding strategy with the intent to improve meat quality. Before this can occur, it is important to describe the current state of turkey meat quality as well as the correlations among the different meat quality traits and important production traits. The main objective of the present study was to provide a descriptive analysis of 8 different meat quality traits for turkey breast meat from 3 different purebred lines (A, B, and C), and their correlation with a selection of production traits. Using a total of 7,781 images, the breast meat (N = 590-3,892 birds depending on trait) was evaluated at 24 h postmortem for color (L*, a*, b*), pH, and physiochemical characteristics (drip loss, cooking loss, shear force). Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and Pearson correlations were computed to describe the relationships among traits within each genetic line. A one-factor ANOVA and post hoc t-test were conducted for each trait and between each of the genetic lines. We found significant differences between genetic lines for some color traits (L* and a*), pHinitial, drip loss, and cooking loss. The lightest line in weight (line B) had meat that was the lightest (L*) in color. The heaviest line (line C) had meat that was less red (a*) with a higher pHinitial and greater cooking loss. Unfavorable correlations between production traits and meat quality were also found for each of the genetic lines where increases in production (e.g., body weight, growth rate) resulted in meat that was lighter and redder in color and in some cases (line B and C), with an increased moisture loss. The results of this study provide an important benchmark for turkey meat quality in purebred lines and provide an updated account of the relationships between key production traits and meat quality. Although the magnitude of these correlations is low, their cumulative effect on meat quality can be more significant especially with continued selection pressure on growth and yield.",,1968
1641,35968134,High-quality reference genome sequences of two Cannaceae species provide insights into the evolution of Cannaceae.,"Canna edulis Ker-Gawl and Canna indica L. are species belonging to the Cannaceae family and both have a very high economic value. Here, we aimed to assemble genomes of C. edulis and C. indica at the chromosome level to generate a reference genome for the Cannaceae family. We also comparatively analyzed the genomes of C. edulis and C. indica and examined the molecular mechanisms responsible for the remarkable differences in plant characteristics in C. edulis varieties. Our results indicated that genome-wide duplication events had recently occurred in C. edulis and C. indica. The comparative analysis of the genomes of C. edulis and C. indica revealed that C. edulis exhibited a remarkable level of replication of genes in the starch and sucrose metabolic pathways, especially during sucrose hydrolysis. This finding is consistent with the fact that the starch content of the C. edulis tuber is higher than that of C. indica. Simplified genome re-sequencing revealed the population structure of 241 C. edulis genes, and a genome-wide association study of leaf traits revealed the location of key genes related to leaf color and morphology. These findings extend our understanding of Cannaceade at the molecular level, and provide an effective theoretical basis for further study and utilization of Cannaceae plants.",,1969
2264,35967167,"The MedConnect Program: Symptomatology, Return Visits, and Hospitalization of COVID-19 Outpatients Following Discharge From the Emergency Department.","Background and objective Although hospitalization is required for only a minority of those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the high rates of morbidity and mortality among these patients have led researchers to focus on the predictors of admission and adverse outcomes in the inpatient population. However, there is scarce data on the clinical trajectory of individuals symptomatic enough to present for emergency care, but not sick enough to be admitted. In light of this, we aimed to examine the symptomatology, emergency department (ED) revisits, and hospitalization of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outpatients after discharge from the ED. Methods Adult patients with COVID-19 infection were prospectively enrolled after discharge from the ED between May and December 2020. Patients were followed up longitudinally for 14 days via phone interviews designed to provide support and information and to track symptomatology, ED revisits, and hospitalization. Results A volunteer, medical student-run program enrolled 199 COVID-19 patients discharged from the ED during the first nine months of the pandemic. Of the 176 patients (88.4%) who completed the 14-day protocol, 29 (16.5%) had a second ED visit and 17 (9.6%) were admitted, 16 (9%) for worsening COVID-19 symptoms. Age, male sex, comorbid illnesses, and self-reported dyspnea, diarrhea, chills, and fever were associated with hospital admission for patients with a subsequent ED visit. For those who did not require admission, symptoms generally improved following ED discharge. Age >65 years and a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were associated with a longer duration of cough, but generally, patient characteristics and comorbidities did not significantly affect the overall number or duration of symptoms. Conclusions Nearly one in five patients discharged from the ED with COVID-19 infection had a second ED evaluation during a 14-day follow-up period, despite regular phone interactions aimed at providing support and information. More than half of them required admission for worsening COVID-19 symptoms. Established risk factors for severe disease and self-reported persistence of certain symptoms were associated with hospital admission, while those who did not require hospitalization had a steady improvement in symptoms over the 14-day period.",,1970
971,35974648,Migration of active rings in porous media.,"Inspired by how the shape deformations in active organisms help them to migrate through disordered porous environments, we simulate active ring polymers in two-dimensional random porous media. Flexible and inextensible active ring polymers navigate smoothly through the disordered media. In contrast, semiflexible rings undergo transient trapping inside the pore space; the degree of trapping is inversely correlated with the increase in activity. We discover that flexible rings swell while inextensible and semiflexible rings monotonically shrink upon increasing the activity. Together, our findings identify the optimal migration of active ring polymers through porous media.",,1971
64,35983465,Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Onychomycosis: A Systematic Review of the Clinical Evidence.,"Onychomycosis is notoriously difficult to treat. While oral antifungals are the most efficacious treatment for onychomycosis, they are contraindicated in certain patient populations, and patients may desire lower risk and accessible alternatives to systemic agents. In this study, we examine the clinical evidence supporting the use of complementary and alternative therapies in the treatment of onychomycosis. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical trials, observational studies, and case reports/case series, examining the efficacy of a complementary or alternative therapy for the treatment of onychomycosis. We identified 17 articles studying a complementary and alternative therapy for onychomycosis, including tea tree oil (n = 5), Ageratina pichinchensis (n = 3), Arthrospira maxima (n = 2), natural coniferous resin lacquer (n = 2), Vicks VapoRub® (n = 2), propolis extract (n = 2), and ozonized sunflower oil (n = 1). Given the rise of antifungal resistance, complementary and alternative therapies should continue to be studied as adjunctive or alternative therapy for onychomycosis. While preliminary evidence exists for several complementary and alternative therapies in the treatment of onychomycosis, large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed prior to endorsing their use to patients.",,1972
1572,35968314,The Polish Version of the Alberta Infant Motor Scale: Cultural Adaptation and Validation.,"The Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) is a diagnostic tool for the assessment of the motor performance of infants from the time of birth, to the period of independent walking (0-18 months). This study aims to derive a Polish version of the AIMS through its cultural adaptation and validation. The study included 145 infants aged 0-18 months, who were divided into four further age groups: 0-3 months, 4-7 months, 8-11 months, and older than 12 months. The validation was based on an analysis of intrarater and interrater reliability values, as well as concurrent validity, using the gross motor scale of Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 (PDMS-2). The total Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for intrarater reliability was 0.99 (ICC range in positions was 0.87-0.99, in subgroups was 0.91-0.99), while in particular positions, the ICC ranges were as follows: prone 0.97-0.99, supine 0.94-0.99, sitting 0.95-0.99, and standing: 0.63-0.99. The total ICC for interrater reliability was 0.99 (ICC range in positions was 0.98-0.99, in subgroups was 0.91-0.99), while in particular positions, the ICC ranges were as follows: prone 0.95-0.99, supine 0.93-0.96, sitting 0.93-0.98, standing 0.91-0.98. Only the standing position was analyzed for the subgroup of participants over 12 months old. The Spearman correlation between the Polish version of the AIMS and the gross motor scale of PDMS-2 was significant in the total population (r = 0.97, p < 0.0001) and in subgroups (r = 0.79-0.85, p < 0.0001). The results of our study confirm that the Polish version of the AIMS is reliable for infants aged 0-18 months and can be applied to this population for clinical and scientific purposes.

1456,35968442,Predictive value of the systemic immune-inflammation index for cancer-specific survival of osteosarcoma in children.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the primary malignant bone tumor that most commonly affects children and adolescents. Recent years effective chemotherapy have improved the 5-year survival in osteosarcoma patients to up to 60%-70%. Still, there is a lack of novel therapeutic strategies to enhance further survival. Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of pretreatment inflammatory-based parameters, including PLT, NLR, and SII, as prognostic indicators of survival in pediatric osteosarcoma patients. A total of 86 pediatric osteosarcoma patients between 2012 and 2021 in the Department of Orthopedics or tumor Surgery of Children's Hospital affiliated to Chongqing Medical University were retrospectively analyzed. The clinicopathological variables and systematic inflammatory biomarkers, including NLR, PLR and SII, was performed by the A Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Cox proportional risk regression model. According to the results of multivariate analysis, a prognostic nomogram was generated, and the concordance index (C-index) was calculated to predict the performance of the established nomogram. The survival curve was plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis showed that TNM stage, tumor size, NLR value, PLR value, SII value, neutrophil count and platelet count were related to CSS (p < 0.05). According to multivariate analysis, only TNM stage (p = 0.006) and SII values (p = 0.015) were associated with poor prognosis.To further predict survival in pediatric osteosarcoma patients, multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to predict cancer-specific survival at 1, 3 and 5 years. And constructed a nomogram model to predict children's CSS. The C-index of the nomogram is 0.776 (95%CI, 0.776-0.910), indicating that the model has good accuracy. Preoperative SII and TNM staging are independent prognostic markers for pediatric osteosarcoma patients. SII may be used in conjunction with TNM staging for individualized treatment of pediatric osteosarcoma patients in future clinical work.",,1976

The clinical data of 10 patients with PE in our department from June 2018 to December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. All patients underwent thin-layer computed tomography examination before the operation, and then 3D reconstruction was performed with Mimics 20.0 software. The radian and curvature of the pectus bar were designed according to the reconstructed images. Afterward, the images were imported into the light-curing 3D printer in STL format for slice printing. Hence that the personalized operation scheme, including the size of the pectus bar and the surgical approach, can be made according to the 3D printed model. The thoracoscopic-assisted Nuss operation was completed by bilateral incisions. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative hospitalization were counted and analyzed. The satisfaction of the surgery was evaluated according to the Haller index and the most posterior sternal compression sternovertebral distance. The surgeries were successfully completed in 10 patients without a transfer to open procedure. The average operation time was (56 ± 8.76) min, the intraoperative blood loss was (23.5 ± 11.07) mL, and the postoperative hospitalization was (7.2 ± 0.92) d. There were no serious complications or death during the perioperative period. Compared with the data before the operation, the most posterior sternal compression sternovertebral distance was larger, and the Haller index was lower, the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). 3D reconstruction technology combined with 3D printing, which can be used before operation, contributes to the operator performing thoracoscopic-assisted Nuss operation safely and effectively, which has productive clinical application value for the treatment of pectus excavatum.",,1978
2295,35967136,The Efficacy and Success Rate of Methotrexate in the Management of Ectopic Pregnancy.,"Background Ectopic pregnancy is a life-threatening medical condition wherein pregnancy occurs outside the uterus. This study primarily aimed to evaluate the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) in treating patients diagnosed with early ectopic pregnancy between 2016 and 2021. Second, it aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of subsequent pregnancies following ectopic pregnancy treatment. Methods A retrospective cohort study was carried out at a tertiary care centre in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The sample for this study comprised 59 patients who were diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy and treated with MTX at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, between 2016 and 2021. The data were stored in the Microsoft Office Excel format and analyzed using the SPSS software. Results There were 10 reported cases of ruptured ectopic pregnancy; seven of these underwent surgery, while three were successfully treated conservatively using MTX. Success rates of 55.9% and 93.8% were recorded after administering the first and second dose of MTX, respectively, based on beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) drop between day 4 and day 7. Among those treated with MTX, 37.3% of the patients reported a successful subsequent pregnancy, of which 54.5% delivered a live, healthy infant and 13.6% had a second ectopic pregnancy. Conclusion MTX proved effective in treating ectopic pregnancy, with a β-hCG drop of more than 15%. Patients who received a second dose of MTX showed a higher drop in β-hCG level, indicating greater success as a cumulative effect. The clinical outcome after MTX treatment of ectopic pregnancy was shown to be significant with a p-value <0.05.",,1979

However, the genus Hellenia within the Asian clade has been shown to be non-monophyletic and its morphology has not been studied carefully. Therefore, the complete plastid genomes of Hellenia species were obtained and the monophyly of Hellenia was tested through four different datasets in this study. Plastid phylogenomic analyses of Costaceae revealed that Hellenia is strongly supported as paraphyletic. Two major clades are recovered, namely the Hellenia s.s. subclade and the Parahellenia subclade. Phylogenetic analyses based on an enlarged taxon sampling of the Asian clade using a two chloroplast markers dataset (trnK intron and trnL-F spacer) confirmed the paraphyly of Hellenia. Meanwhile, morphological analyses suggested that members of the Parahellenia subclade differ from the remaining Hellenia species in many characters including inflorescences, bracts, stigma, axillary buds, floral tubes and labellum. According to the present molecular and morphological evidence, the latter subclade is recognized as a new genus, Parahellenia.

651,35976002,"Why mothers die: Analysis of verbal autopsy data from Kersa Health and Demographic Surveillance System, Eastern Ethiopia.","Despite registering tremendous improvement as part of the Millennium Development Goals, Ethiopia has still one of the highest numbers of maternal mortality. Although maternal mortality is one of the commonest indicators for comparison or measuring progress, its measurement remained a challenge. In a situation where, vital registration is not in place and only few women gave birth in facilities, alternative data sources from population-based surveys are essential to describe maternal deaths. In this paper, we reported estimates of maternal mortality and causes in a predominantly rural setting in eastern Ethiopia. Data were used from the ongoing prospective open cohort of Kersa Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), located in eastern Ethiopia. At enrolment, detailed sociodemographic and household conditions were recorded for every member, followed by household visit every six months to identify any vital events: births, deaths, and migration. Whenever a death was reported, additional information about the deceased - age, sex, pregnancy status, and perceived cause of deaths - were collected through interview of the closest family member(s). Then, the probable cause of death was assigned using an automated verbal autopsy system (InterVA). In this paper, we included all deaths among women during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy. To describe the trends, we calculated annual maternal mortality ratio (MMR) along with their 95% Confidence Interval (CI). From 2008 to 2019, a total of 32 680 live births and 720 deaths among reproductive age women were registered. Of the 720 deaths, 158 (21.9%) were during pregnancy or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, corresponding with an MMR of 484 per 100 000 live births. The three leading causes of deaths were pregnancy related sepsis, obstetric haemorrhage and anaemia of pregnancy. There was non-significant reduction in the MMR from 744 in 2008 to 665 in 2019, with three lowest ratios recorded in 2013 (172 per 100 000 live births), 2009 (280 per 100 000 live births) and 2016 (285 per 100 000 live births). There was no significant decrement of MMR during the study period. Most deaths occurred at home from pregnancy related sepsis and haemorrhage implicating the unfinished agenda of ensuring skilled delivery and appropriate postnatal management.",,1982
1931,35967678,Psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the preoperative assessment of readiness tool among surgical patients.,"The evaluation of the surgical readiness of patients plays an important role in clinical care. Preoperative readiness assessment is needed to identify the inadequacy among surgical patients, which provides guide for interventions to improve patients' preoperative readiness. However, there is a paucity of high-level, quality tool that evaluate surgical readiness of patients in China. The purpose of this study is to translate the Preoperative Assessment of Readiness Tool (PART) into Chinese and determine the reliability and validity of the Chinese version in the population of surgical patients. Using a standard translation-backward method, the original English version of PART was translated into Chinese. A convenient sampling of 210 surgical patients was recruited from 6 hospitals in Zhejiang Province to test the psychometric properties of this scale including internal consistency, split-half reliability, content validity, structure validity, and floor/ceiling effect. A total of 194 patients (92%) completed questionnaires. The Chinese version of PART achieved Cronbach's alphas 0.948 and McDonald's omega coefficient 0.947, respectively, for the full scale. The estimated odd-even split-half reliability was 0.959. The scale-level content validity index was 0.867, and the items content validity index ranged from 0.83 to 1.0.The output of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed a two-factor model (χ2 = 510.96; df = 86; p < 0.001; root mean square error approximation = 0.08) with no floor/ceiling effect. The Chinese version of PART demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity among surgical patients. It can be used to evaluate patients' preoperative preparation and help health professionals provide proper preoperative support.",,1983

The most characteristic shape is saccular and the most common etiologic agents are Staphylococcus sp. and Salmonella sp. There is scant and imprecise information in the literature about correct nomenclature, diagnosis, and treatment. The authors present three cases in which diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were documented. In addition to reporting this case series, the authors also present a review of the subject, outlining pertinent diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",,1984
204,35982817,Optimum Value of Scale and Threshold for Compression of 99mTc-MDP Bone Scan Images using Haar Wavelet Transform.,"Wavelet transforms of an image result in set of wavelet coefficients. Thresholding eliminates insigniﬁcant coefficients while retaining the significant ones (resulting in matrix having few nonzero elements that need to be stored). The compressed image is reconstructed by applying inverse wavelet transform. The quality of compressed image deteriorates with increase in compression. Hence, finding optimum value of scale and threshold is a challenging task. The objective of the study was to find the optimum value of scale and threshold for compressing 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (99 mTc-MDP) bone scan images using Haar wavelet transform. Haar wavelet transform at scale 1-8 was applied on 106 99 mTc-MDP whole-body bone scan images, and wavelet coefficients were threshold at 90, 95, 97, and 99 percentiles, followed by inverse wavelet transform to get 3392 compressed images. Nuclear medicine physician (NMP) compared compressed image with its corresponding input to label it as acceptable or unacceptable. The values of scale and threshold that resulted in majority of acceptable images were considered to be optimum. The quality of compressed image was also evaluated using perception image quality evaluator (PIQE) image quality metrics. Compression ratio was calculated by dividing the number of nonzero elements after thresholding wavelet coefficients by the number of nonzero elements in Haar decomposed matrix. NMP found quality of compressed images (obtained at scale 2 and 90 percentile threshold) identical to the quality of the corresponding input images. As per PIQE score, quality of compressed images was perceptually better than that of the corresponding input images. The optimum values of scale and threshold were determined to be 2 and 90 percentiles, respectively.",,1985
136,35983266,Tetanus in Uganda: Clinical Outcomes of Adult Patients Hospitalized at a Tertiary Health Facility Between 2011 and 2020.,"Tetanus is a vaccine-preventable infectious disease associated with high mortality rates. Increased vaccination coverage globally and locally has resulted in substantial declines in the number of individuals diagnosed with tetanus. We report annual trends in tetanus admissions and deaths over a decade at a national referral hospital in Uganda. This was a retrospective cohort study, using data from an electronic database of patients admitted to medical wards at a national referral hospital between 2011 and 2020. Data were abstracted on demographic characteristics, that is, length of hospital stay and mortality outcome. Admission and mortality rate trends were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall's trend test, whereas Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to compare gender survival rates. During the study period, 459 individuals were admitted with tetanus. Of these, 85.8% (394 of 459) were males, and 26.1% (120 of 459) were aged 20 years or less. Overall, 48.8% (224 of 459) participants died, 85.3% (191 of 224) of whom were males (85.3%, n = 191), although females had a higher mortality rate (50.8%, 33 of 65 vs 48.5%, 191 of 394). Those aged 31-40 years accounted for 23.7% (53 of 224) of the deaths; and 88.7% (197 of 224) of the deaths occurred within the first 7 days of admission. The total number of tetanus admissions declined (TauA = -.6444, P = .0116). However, mortality rates remained stable (TauA = .0222, P > .999). The average length of hospital stay was 8.1 days (standard deviation, 7.5; range, 1-46). Although tetanus admissions declined, mortality rate remained high. Males were disproportionately affected. We recommend quality-of-care audits for inpatient care improvement and more research on the determinants of infection and mortality to inform vaccination for at-risk men.",,1986
1706,35968064,Factors associated to acceptance and willingness to pay for COVID vaccine in Nepal.,"Corona virus disease (COVID-19) remains pandemic globally. Vaccination is considered one of the best means to control both morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. The study aims to find out the people's acceptance and willingness to pay for it. The study used cross-sectional survey design. Data were collected using a survey questionnaire from 1072 respondents (age 20-60 years) from 14 districts of Nepal. Socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents were independent and acceptance of vaccine was the dependent variable. The study found that 84% of the respondents accepted the COVID vaccine. Only one out of six did not accept the COVID vaccine while 16% of the respondents stated that they would like to pay for the COVID vaccination. The average willingness to pay (WTP) for vaccination was NRs. 1053 (US$ 9) while median and mode remained the same NRs. 500. The middle age groups (30-49 years), respondents belonged to Madhesi, business people in terms of occupation and the respondents who had completed school level education had a higher acceptance rate than other categories. It was observed that place of residence in terms of provinces or districts, age group, caste/ethnicity, and educational level of the respondents were significantly associated with the acceptance of the COVID vaccine. Moreover, respondents residing from Lumbini Province, age group of 30-39 years, and having secondary or higher education were noticed as more likely to accept the COVID vaccine than the respective compared groups. Appropriate information, education and communication needs to disseminate to minimize the misinformation about the COVID and lack of trust in vaccine that may lead to low acceptance and poor WTP for vaccine. These findings could be considered while making COVID and the COVID vaccine-related interventions.",,1987

In each case the triaza ligands, L/LH, direct the formation of {Mn3} triangles with their N atoms preferentially bonding to the Jahn-Teller axes of the MnIII ions. Subsequent self-assembly is dependent on the anion of the Mn salt and the identity of the organic coligand employed-the terminally bonded imidazole and the chelating/bridging amino acid. The {Mn3} triangles fold up on themselves in 1, forming a wheel. However, the syn, syn-bridging carboxylates in 2 prevent this from happening, instead directing the formation of a linear rod. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements reveal competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions in both complexes, the exchange being somewhat weaker in 1 due to the presence of MnII ions.",,1988

In the study we collected data through in-depth interviews with seven preservice teachers in a Master of Education program (Teaching Chinese as a Second Language, TCSL) at a university in Hong Kong SAR, China. The findings indicated that the participants had a relatively positive attitude and inclination toward the development of students' intercultural communicative competence, while their conceptualizations of culture tended to be static and ambiguous. In addition, the participants' objectives in teaching intercultural communicative competence were found to be more attitude-than knowledge- or skill-oriented. The study offers valuable insights that preservice language teachers' cognition plays a crucial role in their future professional development and calls for curricular innovations with intercultural aims in teacher education programs.",,1989

Newspapers are a potential source of useful public health information, but the extent to which concerns around valproate were presented to the public via newspapers has not been evaluated. To explore how sodium valproate has been portrayed by UK newspapers over the last several decades. Thematic analysis of all newspaper articles up to July 2020 with key terms 'Valproate' and 'Epilim'. Articles were retrieved with LexisNexis. Temporal variation in thematic content was analysed. 275 articles were identified for analysis. Teratogenicity was the key theme in 86% of newspaper articles, failure of duty of care of medical professionals to communicate the risks of valproate in 68%, improving its regulation with public health interventions in 51% and litigation against Sanofi who produce valproate in 31%. Reporting was minimal pre-2000 and peaked in the recent 5 years. Issues surrounding valproate have been covered by UK newspapers, with a predominant focus on its teratogenic effects.",,1990
2184,35967334,Effects of tobacco smoking on cardiovascular disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to the general population. However, little is known about the effects of tobacco smoking on CVD in patients with SLE. To systematically review and summarize the available literature regarding the effects of tobacco smoking on developing CVD in patients with SLE. We retrieved relevant studies from the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) database. Two reviewers independently reviewed the eligible studies, assessed their validity, and extracted relevant data. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to distinguish sources of heterogeneity. A total of 10 studies, which comprised 6984 participants, were included in the analysis. The overall quality of evidence was rated as moderate to low. The smoking prevalence among CVD patients was 39.28% (271/690), which was higher than 31.36% (1974/6294) among non-CVD patients. Compared with never-smokers, the risk of developing CVD in current smokers was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.21-1.66). No significant publication bias was found in our meta-analysis. In spite of the several negative results, this study found that current smokers with SLE have an increased risk of developing CVD, although most of the included studies were in low-to-moderate quality. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42022338109.",,1991
1085,35974534,Counterdiabatic driving in the classical β-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain.,"Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs) have been used to make rapid changes to a system while eliminating or minimizing excitations in the system's state. In quantum systems, these shortcuts allow us to minimize inefficiencies and heating in experiments and quantum computing protocols, but the theory of STAs can also be generalized to classical systems. We focus on one such STA, approximate counterdiabatic (ACD) driving, and numerically compare its performance in two classical systems: a quartic anharmonic oscillator and the β Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice. In particular, we modify an existing variational technique to optimize the approximate driving and then develop classical figures of merit to quantify the performance of the driving. We find that relatively simple forms for the ACD driving can dramatically suppress excitations regardless of system size. ACD driving in classical nonlinear oscillators could have many applications, from minimizing heating in bosonic gases to finding optimal local dressing protocols in interacting field theories.",,1992
744,35975101,"Impulsivity, Depressive Mood, and Cannabis Use in a Representative Sample of French-Speaking Swiss Young Men.","Cannabis is the most popular psychoactive substance under international regulations, with more than 192 million users worldwide. It has been associated with an addictive pattern of use and negative social and health-related outcomes in a subgroup of users. Consequently, understanding the individual differences that contribute to cannabis use and problematic use is of much importance. The current study examined the impact of impulsivity traits (negative urgency, positive urgency, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, sensation seeking), delay reward discounting, and depressive mood on cannabis use status during the past 6 months as well as problematic use of cannabis in a representative sample of 635 French-speaking Swiss young men recruited during their conscription in a Swiss national military recruitment center. Binary logistic and multiple linear regressions indicated that cannabis use status was significantly associated with greater depressive mood, elevated sensation seeking, and lack of perseverance, whereas problematic cannabis use was significantly related to higher depressive mood and steeper delay reward discounting. The present study highlights the importance of emotional symptoms in cannabis use and misuse. Our results also shed light on the potential psychological processes related to problematic consumption of cannabis and open avenues for preventive actions and psychological interventions that target problematic use of cannabis.",,1993
1622,35968194,Exploring Molecular Dynamics of Adsorbed CO2 Species in Amine-Modified Porous Silica by Solid-State NMR Relaxation.,"Previous studies on CO2 adsorbents have mainly addressed the identification and quantification of adsorbed CO2 species in amine-modified porous materials. Investigation of molecular motion of CO2 species in confinement has not been explored in depth yet. This work entails a comprehensive study of molecular dynamics of the different CO2 species chemi- and physisorbed at amine-modified silica materials through the determination of the rotating frame spin-lattice relaxation times (T 1ρ) by solid-state NMR. Rotational correlation times (τC) were also estimated using spin relaxation models based on the Bloch, Wangsness, and Redfield and the Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound theories. As expected, the τC values for the two physisorbed CO2 species are considerably shorter (32 and 20 μs) than for the three identified chemisorbed CO2 species (162, 62, and 123 μs). The differences in molecular dynamics between the different chemisorbed species correlate well with the structures previously proposed. In the case of the physisorbed CO2 species, the τC values of the CO2 species displaying faster molecular dynamics falls in the range of viscous liquids, whereas the species presenting slower dynamics exhibit T 1ρ and τC values compatible with a CO2 layer of weakly interacting molecules with the silica surface. The values for chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) and 1H-13C heteronuclear dipolar couplings have also been estimated from T 1ρ measurements, for each adsorbed CO2 species. The CSA tensor parameters obtained from fitting the relaxation data agree with the experimentally measured CSA values, thus showing that the theories are well suited to study CO2 dynamics in silica surfaces.",,1994
737,35975139,Healthcare Utilization and Costs Among US Adolescents With Alopecia Areata.,"Background: Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease of hair loss affecting people of all ages. Alopecia totalis (AT) and universalis (AU) involve scalp and total body hair loss, respectively. AA significantly affects quality of life, but evidence on the economic burden in adolescents is limited. Objectives: To assess healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and all-cause direct healthcare costs, including out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, of US adolescents with AA. Methods: IBM MarketScan® Commercial and Medicare databases were used to identify patients aged 12-17 years with ≥2 claims with AA/AT/AU diagnosis (prevalent cases), from October 1, 2015, to March 31, 2018, enrolled for ≥12 months before and after the first AA diagnosis (index). Patients were matched 1:3 to non-AA controls on index year, demographics, plan type, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Per patient per year HCRU and costs were compared post-index. Results: Patients comprised 130 AT/AU adolescents and 1105 non-AT/AU adolescents (53.8% female; mean age, 14.6 years). Post-index, AT/AU vs controls had more outpatient (14.5 vs 7.1) and dermatologist (3.6 vs 0.3) visits, higher mean plan costs ($9397 vs $2267), including medical ($7480 vs $1780) and pharmacy ($1918 vs $487) costs, and higher OOP costs ($2081 vs $751) (all P<.001). The non-AT/AU cohort vs controls had more outpatient (11.6 vs 8.0) and dermatologist (3.4 vs 0.4) visits, higher mean plan costs ($7587 vs $4496), and higher OOP costs ($1579 vs $805) (all P<.001). Discussion: This large-sample, real-world analysis found that adolescents with prevalent AA had significantly higher HCRU and all-cause costs than matched controls. The greater burden was driven by more frequent outpatient visits, and higher payer medical and pharmacy costs in comparison with controls. Oral corticosteroid use was higher among patients with AT/AU; topical and injectable corticosteroid use was higher for non-AT/AU. Although the data preclude the identification of AA-attributable costs, the matched-control design allows an estimation of incremental all-cause costs associated with AA. Conclusions: Adolescents with AA incurred substantial incremental healthcare costs, with greater costs incurred among those with AT/AU. Study findings suggest that AA incurs costs as a medical condition with a high burden on adolescent patients and health plans.",,1995

Incorporating weather and climate information into public health decisions can promote resilience to climate change's adverse health effects, but regionally it is not common practice. We implemented a project to enhance dialogue between climate and public health specialists in Puerto Rico and Dominica. First, we conducted environmental scans of public health vulnerability in the context of weather and climate for both islands. Then, we convened stakeholders to discuss the scan results and identify priorities for climate and health. A shared priority was increasing climate and health knowledge; thus, we developed several educational initiatives. In this viewpoint, we discuss our process for conducting environmental scans, building capacity and partnerships, and translating knowledge-to-action around climate and health.",,1996
153,35983230,Virus-host interaction analysis in colorectal cancer identifies core virus network signature and small molecules.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant contributor to cancer-related deaths caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. Multiple studies reveal that viruses are involved in colorectal tumorigenesis. The viruses such as Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Human papillomaviruses (HPV16 & HPV18), and John Cunningham virus (JCV) are known to cause colorectal cancer. The molecular mechanisms of cancer genesis and maintenance shared by these viruses remain unclear. We analysed the virus-host networks and connected them with colorectal cancer proteome datasets and extracted the core shared interactions in the virus-host CRC network. Our network topology analysis identified prominent virus proteins RL6 (HCMV), VE6 (HPV16 and HPV18), and Large T antigen (JCV). Sequence analysis uncovered short linear motifs (SLiMs) in each viral target. We used these targets to identify the antiviral drugs through a structure-based virtual screening approach. This analysis highlighted that temsavir, pimodivir, famotine, and bictegravir bind to each virus protein target, respectively. We also assessed the effect of drug binding using molecular dynamic simulations, which shed light on the modulatory effect of drug molecules on SLiM regions in viral targets. Hence, our systematic screening of virus-host networks revealed viral targets, which could be crucial for cancer therapy.",,1997

The study sample comprised 824 third-to-eighth-grade students [255 males (31%) and 569 females (69%)]. Around 10% of the sample (82) had special educational needs (SEN). Students' perceived inclusion levels and academic self-concept were examined with the Arabic version of the Perceptions of Inclusion Questionnaire (PIQ-S-AR). Students' ratings of inclusive practices in their classroom were examined using the Arabic version of the Inclusive Teaching Practices Scale (ITPS). SEN students expressed lower perceived social inclusion, emotional inclusion, and academic self-concept in comparison with non-SEN students. Moreover, high levels of inclusive teaching practices strongly predicted students' perceived emotional inclusion, social inclusion, and academic self-concept. The results of the study supported the importance of school-level inclusive teaching practices and their relation to students' school experiences. It also highlighted the need for schools and teachers to work towards improved school-level inclusion experiences for SEN students.",,1998

M-commerce is a prevalent mode of marketing and is famous among young people of Pakistan. Current research is planned to check the status of consumer purchase intentions (PIs) using perceived influence, virtual interactivity, brand image, and brand expected value among customers who purchase their products with the help of m-commerce. Data was collected from customers who were engaged in buying with the help of m-commerce by using the convenience sampling technique and 227 complete questionnaires were used in final analysis. This research examines the direct impact of perceived influence, virtual interactivity, brand image, and brand expected value on PIs and finds the indirect effect of brand image and brand expected value on the relationships of perceived influence and virtual interactivity with PIs. Results indicate that all the hypotheses of direct relationships are accepted except the hypothesis for the relation of virtual interactivity with consumer PIs. Virtual interactivity has an insignificant positive impact on consumer PIs. Brand expected value has a strong positive effect on consumer PIs among all. The current study proposed four mediational hypotheses. All the proposed mediational hypotheses are accepted.",,1999
1934,35967675,Links between Chinese vocational school students' perception of parents' emotional support and school cooperation climate and their academic performance: The mediating role of school belonging.,"The role of social environmental factors on student academic achievement has been conceptualized from the perspective of the ecological system theory. In the present study, a strengths-based approach derived from the theory of positive youth development was adopted to explore the two favorable aspects of proximal social environments, including parents' emotional support and school cooperation climate, and to examine how these two factors influence the academic performance among Chinese senior-secondary vocational school students. Participants were 1,940 students (55.4% male) who took part in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 test from four regions in China. The students completed the questionnaires to assess parents' emotional support, school cooperation climate, school belonging, and academic performance. By adopting the structural equation model, the results revealed that school belonging fully mediates the association between parents' emotional support and academic scores, and the association between school cooperation climate and academic scores. In addition, multiple group comparison analyses showed there were some gender differences in the relationships between school cooperation climate and academic performance. The practical significance of the influence of parental support and school cooperation climate on student academic achievement was also discussed.",,2000
1998,35967606,The role of legislation in K-12 school discipline: The silence of action.,"Researchers have consistently identified the disparity between teachers' practical and legal knowledge regarding teachers' right to discipline students. However, few studies have investigated teachers' construction processes that form construction outcomes, which would help navigate the role of legislation in school discipline. This study contributes to a holistic picture of the neglected disciplinary rights that teachers construct in teaching practice and their underexplored attitude toward the law, using an interview-based constructionist method on twelve teachers of Lvliang city in a Chinese K-12 context. The findings suggest that the participants prefer to acquire discipline knowledge by interacting with multiple power relations in their local environment and that their knowledge is historically and culturally specific. Although the disciplinary right they construct is never static, balanced, or essentialised, the participants' constructions are commonly not in line with legal provisions or the aims of the law. Furthermore, school discipline legislation plays a silent role in empowering teachers to discipline students, but it is more visible in holding back teachers' use of corporal punishment. These findings illustrate the complexity of implementing school disciplinary law as a universal national policy.",,2001
722,35975162,Applications of metal-organic framework-based bioelectrodes.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of porous nanomaterials that have opened new research possibilities. The inherent characteristics of MOFs such as their large surface area, high porosity, tunable pore size, stability, facile synthetic strategies and catalytic nature have made them promising materials for enormous number of applications, including fuel storage, energy conversion, separation, and gas purification.

Insufficient reports describe tumors of this histological type located in the distal parts of the spinal canal, the conus medullaris and cauda equina. To date, nine cases of GP of the cauda equina and one case of GP of conus medullaris have been described. After analyzing all available treatment reports of GP, a study described it as a tumor with an extremely good prognosis in cases of total tumor removal. Here, we present a case of a female patient with a GP at the level of the L4 vertebra treated at Burdenko Neurosurgical Center using a minimally invasive approach through a tubular retractor.

1986,35967620,Predictive and Contemporaneous Power of the Determinants of Stock Liquidity.,"This study constructs nine (five) idiosyncratic (systematic) variables to test the predictive and contemporaneous power of the determinants of stock liquidity. We select A shares from January 2003 to September 2021 to study stock liquidity in the Chinese market. As a novel discovery, this study finds that stock liquidity abnormally decreases with contemporaneous idiosyncratic return and also with 1-year lagged systematic return. Only the idiosyncratic return variance can decrease future short-term or contemporaneous stock liquidity. Idiosyncratic factors are more important than systematic ones for contemporaneous and future stock liquidity. The predictive power of the determinants decreases with the forecast length. Economic policy uncertainty (EPU) can affect sensitivity of stock liquidity to contemporaneous determinants. The empirical results of this research are robust over subperiods, forecast length and across four liquidity measurements. The abnormalities and linkages between determinants and stock liquidity are correlated with investor psychology and special market mechanism in China.",,2004
270,35982554,The economics of sediment quality on barrier shoreline restoration.,"This paper depicts a simulation-based assessment of sediment quality on the performance of dedicated dredging projects for barrier island restoration in coastal Louisiana, USA. The research involved the development and integration of two sub-models. In the first, geomorphic modeling was used to simulate sediment transport dynamics within a proxy barrier island template over a 50-year trajectory. The template was assumed to be nourished with one of two sources of dredged material: nearshore (NS) sediments of lower quality (smaller grain diameter, higher organic fines); or higher quality sediments from distal sources located on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). In the second model, agency project records and commercial bids were used to estimate project construction costs as a function of dredge material quantity, transport distance, and project target elevation. These sub-models were coupled within a net present value framework from which average annual break-even values for ecosystem services (EBEV) were derived as an efficiency metric for comparing the economic performance of NS- and OCS-sourced projects. Results indicate that in some cases, the physical resiliency afforded by even small increases in sand diameter (+4 μm d50) can translate to greater long-term economic viability (lower EBEV) for OCS-sourced sediment transported over longer distances. Moreover, projects constructed with much higher diameter OCS sediment (+44 μm d50) with low fines and transported over relatively long distances (200 μm, 5% fines, 15-20 miles) were found to be more cost-effective than all comparably-sized projects constructed with lower quality NS sediments obtained from proximal sources (156 μm, 20% fines, 3-5 miles). For some comparisons, this quality advantage yielded a lower EBEV for OCS-sourced projects with transport distances exceeding 30 miles. Under storm-punctuated simulations, these quality advantages were more pronounced, with greater physical and economic implications for earlier (Y5) versus later (Y20) occurring storms. Budgeting for dedicated dredging projects has traditionally centered on the value of sediment as a commodity, with a focus on material placement cost. The findings of this study, however, indicate that a more comprehensive accounting of sediment quality and performance is required to maximize the economic efficiency of coastal restoration spending.",,2005
1701,35968069,Decreased online hepatitis information seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic: an Infodemiology study.,"Viral hepatitis remains a public health concern worldwide, mainly in developing countries. The public's awareness and interest in viral hepatitis information are essential in preventing and controlling this disease. Infodemiology has been used as a surrogate to assess the general understanding of disease and measure public awareness of health topics. However, this analysis has not been applied to viral hepatitis. Thus, this study investigated the online global search interest for viral hepatitis in the last decade, focusing on the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Global online search interest for hepatitis was measured using the Google Trends™ database. Spearman's rank-order correlation correlated country-specific characteristics and prevalence data with search volume index. There was a significant reduction in online search interest for hepatitis during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020). People searching for hepatitis are also interested in hepatitis vaccination. Search volume index is positively correlated with viral hepatitis and HIV prevalence and negatively correlated with GDP. This correlation mirrors the high burden of viral hepatitis in developing countries and their citizens' desire to be informed about this disease. Our study found decreased global online interest in viral hepatitis during the pandemic. Moreover, higher online interest in hepatitis was observed in countries with a lower gross domestic product and high viral hepatitis and HIV prevalence. We demonstrated that global online interest toward viral hepatitis could be assessed through the infodemiologic approach using Google Trends™.",,2006
726,35975155,Solvent dielectric delimited nitro-nitrito photorearrangement in a perylenediimide derivative.,"The discovery of vibrant excited-state dynamics and distinctive photochemistry has established nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as an exhilarating class of organic compounds. Herein, we report the atypical photorearrangement of nitro-perylenediimide (NO2-PDI) to nitrito-perylenediimide (ONO-PDI), triggered by visible-light excitation and giving rise to linkage isomers in the polar aprotic solvent acetonitrile. ONO-PDI has been isolated and unambiguously characterized using standard spectroscopic, spectrometric, and elemental composition techniques. Although nitritoaromatic compounds are conventionally considered to be crucial intermediates in the photodissociation of nitroaromatics, experimental evidence for this has not been observed heretofore. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy combined with computational investigations revealed the prominence of a conformationally relaxed singlet excited-state (SCR 1) of NO2-PDI in the photoisomerization pathway. Theoretical transition state (TS) analysis indicated the presence of a six-membered cyclic TS, which is pivotal in connecting the SCR 1 state to the photoproduct state. This article addresses prevailing knowledge gaps in the field of organic linkage isomers and provides a comprehensive understanding of the unprecedented photoisomerization mechanism operating in the case of NO2-PDI.",,2007
1208,35971606,Short-term comparative outcomes between reverse shoulder arthroplasty for shoulder trauma and shoulder arthritis: a Southeast Asian experience.,"Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA), first introduced as a management option for cuff tear arthropathy, is now an accepted treatment for complex proximal humeral fractures. Few studies have identified whether the outcomes of RSA for shoulder trauma are comparable to those of RSA for shoulder arthritis. This is a retrospective, single-institution cohort study of all patients who underwent RSA at our institution between January 2013 and December 2019. In total, 49 patients met the inclusion criteria. As outcomes, we evaluated the 1-year American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Constant shoulder scores, postoperative shoulder range of motion, intra- and postoperative complications, and cumulative revision rate. The patients were grouped based on preoperative diagnosis to compare postoperative outcomes across two broad groups. The median follow-up period was 32.8 months (interquartile range, 12.6-66.6 months). The 1-year visual analog scale, range of motion, and Constant and ASES functional scores were comparable between RSAs performed to treat shoulder trauma and that performed for arthritis. The overall complication rate was 20.4%, with patients with a preoperative diagnosis of arthritis having significantly more complications than those with a preoperative diagnosis of trauma (34.8% vs. 7.7%). Patients who underwent RSA due to a proximal humeral fracture or dislocation did not fare worse than those who underwent RSA for arthritis at 1 year, in terms of both functional and radiological outcomes.",,2008
248,35982599,Cancer Risk Score Prediction Based on a Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Network.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are performed to study the associations between genetic variants with respect to certain phenotypic traits such as cancer. However, the method that is commonly used in GWAS assumes that certain traits are solely affected by a single mutation. We propose a network analysis method, in which we generate association networks of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can differentiate case and control groups. We hypothesize that certain phenotypic traits are attributable to mutations in groups of associated SNPs. We propose a method based on a network analysis framework to study SNP-SNP interactions related to cancer incidence. We employed logistic regression to measure the significance of all SNP pairs from GWAS for the incidence of colorectal cancer and computed a cancer risk score based on the generated SNP networks. We demonstrated our method in a dataset from a case-control study of colorectal cancer in the South Sulawesi population. From the GWAS results, 20,094 pairs of 200 SNPs were created. We obtained one cluster containing four pairs of five SNPs that passed the filtering threshold based on their p-values. A locus on chromosome 12 (12:54410007) was found to be strongly connected to the four variants on chromosome 1. A polygenic risk score was computed from the five SNPs, and a significant difference in colorectal cancer risk was obtained between the case and control groups. Our results demonstrate the applicability of our method to understand SNP-SNP interactions and compute risk scores for various types of cancer.",,2009
1914,35967695,Enhancing engineering ethics education (EEE) for green intelligent manufacturing: Implementation performance evaluation of core mechanism of green intelligence EEE.,"The characteristics of green intelligent (GI) engineering ethics emphasize the necessity of GI engineering ethics education (EEE). The ethics education of GI engineering is in the development stage, and it is urgent to fully understand the significance of evaluating the development of GI EEE. Only based on the GI manufacturing situation system to understand the implementation status of the core education of EEE can we objectively grasp the improvement space of GI EEE. In this study, the corresponding indicators were selected from three dimensions of cultivation education, collaborative education, and situational education to form the element community of evaluation indicators. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method were used to empirically evaluate the implementation of the key mechanism of GI EEE. The results are as follows. (1) The key education of GI EEE includes cultivation education of micro dimension, collaborative education of medium dimension, and situational education of macro dimension. (2) The most important education is to strengthen the ethics education of GI engineering in the training process of college students. The coordination of GI EEE is becoming more and more important, and the integration and construction are the important pursuit of GI EEE. (3) The cultivation education, collaborative education, and situational education of GI EEE are all at a general level. (4) There is not only a gap between theory and practice in GI EEE but also insufficient attention to localization and coordination issues. The willingness of the government to participate in the ethical education of GI engineering is very insufficient. The optimized space of training education includes teaching cases and full-cycle ethical education.",,2010
113,35983340,Magnetic resonance imaging at 3.0-T in postmenopausal osteoporosis: a prospective study and review of the literature.,"To promote advanced research using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of and screening for osteoporosis by looking for correlations among the T-scores measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and the T1-weighted signal intensity values. This was a prospective study of postmenopausal women with no contraindications to MRI and no history of cancer who underwent DEXA within 30 days before or after the MRI examination. A 3.0-T scanner was used in order to acquire sagittal sequences targeting the lumbar spine. Thirteen women underwent DEXA and MRI. In two cases, the MRI was discontinued early. Therefore, the final sample comprised 11 patients. The ADC values and T1-weighted signal intensity were found to be higher in patients with osteoporosis. However, among the patients > 60 years of age with osteoporosis, ADC values were lower and T1-weighted signal intensity was even higher. It is unlikely that MRI will soon replace DEXA for the diagnostic workup of osteoporosis. Although DWI and ADC mapping are useful for understanding the pathophysiology of osteoporosis, we believe that T1-weighted sequences are more sensitive than is DWI as a means of performing a qualitative analysis of vertebral alterations. Promover pesquisas avançadas usando ressonância magnética (RM) no diagnóstico e rastreamento de osteoporose, procurando correlações entre os escores T medidos por absorciometria de raios-X de dupla energia (DEXA), valores de coeficiente de difusão aparente (ADC) na difusão e valores de intensidade de sinal ponderado em T1. Estudo prospectivo de mulheres na pós-menopausa sem contraindicações para RM e sem histórico de câncer que foram submetidas a DEXA 30 dias antes ou após o exame de RM. Um scanner 3.0-T foi utilizado para adquirir sequências sagitais direcionadas à coluna lombar. Treze mulheres foram submetidas a DEXA e RM. Em dois casos, a RM foi interrompida precocemente. Portanto, a amostra final foi composta por 11 pacientes. Os valores de ADC e intensidade de sinal ponderado em T1 foram mais elevados nas pacientes com osteoporose. No entanto, no subgrupo de pacientes > 60 anos de idade com osteoporose, os valores de ADC foram menores e a intensidade do sinal ponderado em T1 foi ainda maior. É improvável que a RM substitua DEXA para a investigação diagnóstica da osteoporose no futuro próximo. Embora a difusão e o mapeamento ADC sejam úteis para a compreensão da fisiopatologia da osteoporose, acreditamos que as sequências ponderadas em T1 são mais sensíveis do que a difusão como meio de realizar uma análise qualitativa das alterações vertebrais.",,2011
1417,35968484,Disaster health education framework for short and intermediate training in Saudi Arabia: A scoping review.,"Saudi Arabia has made extensive efforts to manage disasters using unique national approaches; however, challenges and obstacles concerning disaster health handling persist. The nation has a reactive strategy to disaster management with a need for increased involvement of health professionals in disaster management and improvement of healthcare facilities emergency preparedness including competency-based education training. A comprehensive and consistent approach of disaster education programs for short and intermediate training of health professionals involved in disaster responses in Saudi Arabia is still not evident. Therefore, it is vital to explore and map the current state of the disaster education framework in Saudi Arabia. The Joanna Briggs Institute approach for scoping reviews was used to assess research articles and preprints between January 2000 and September 2021 from Saudi Digital Library; PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar. Five experts identified key aspects of the disaster education approach and eligibility criteria to facilitate identification of relevant articles. Only five articles met the specified criteria and described two short and three intermediate courses on disaster health management in Saudi Arabia. All courses involved competency-specific training aimed at basic or foundational level and involved a range of activities and learning types. None had refresher courses within 12 months. The review highlights the obvious scarcity of short and intermediate term evidence-based disaster health programs in Saudi Arabia. Adoption of the education framework proposed by the authors based on international frameworks could improve the quality and consistency of the disaster education curriculum in Saudi Arabia.",,2012
249,35982598,Effectiveness of the Use of Standardized Vocabularies on Epilepsy Patient Cohort Generation.,"This study investigated the effectiveness of using standardized vocabularies to generate epilepsy patient cohorts with local medical codes, SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), and International Classification of Diseases tenth revision (ICD-10)/Korean Classification of Diseases-7 (KCD-7). We compared the granularity between SNOMED CT and ICD-10 for epilepsy by counting the number of SNOMED CT concepts mapped to one ICD-10 code. Next, we created epilepsy patient cohorts by selecting all patients who had at least one code included in the concept sets defined using each vocabulary. We set patient cohorts generated by local codes as the reference to evaluate the patient cohorts generated using SNOMED CT and ICD-10/KCD-7. We compared the number of patients, the prevalence of epilepsy, and the age distribution between patient cohorts by year. In terms of the cohort size, the match rate with the reference cohort was approximately 99.2% for SNOMED CT and 94.0% for ICD-10/KDC7. From 2010 to 2019, the mean prevalence of epilepsy defined using the local codes, SNOMED CT, and ICD-10/KCD-7 was 0.889%, 0.891% and 0.923%, respectively. The age distribution of epilepsy patients showed no significant difference between the cohorts defined using local codes or SNOMED CT, but the ICD-9/KCD-7-generated cohort showed a substantial gap in the age distribution of patients with epilepsy compared to the cohort generated using the local codes. The number and age distribution of patients were substantially different from the reference when we used ICD-10/KCD-7 codes, but not when we used SNOMED CT concepts. Therefore, SNOMED CT is more suitable for representing clinical ideas and conducting clinical studies than ICD-10/KCD-7.",,2013
473,35978882,Early gastric cancer presenting as a typical submucosal tumor cured by endoscopic submucosal dissection: A case report.,"Submucosal tumor (SMT)-like gastric cancer is rare, and almost all cases undergo curative surgical treatment because the submucosal layer is usually deeply invaded by tumor cells or because histopathologic types of SMT-like gastric cancer are undifferentiated or poorly differentiated. No report has been issued on an SMT-like gastric cancer cured by endoscopic resection alone or on changes in the endoscopic features of this type of tumor over several years. We describe an exceptional case of a 53-year-old male with a 1.5 cm-sized SMT-like lesion covered by normal-appearing mucosa discovered by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at the gastric antrum. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) visualized a homogeneous, well-circumscribed hypoechogenic lesion arising from the second sonographic layer with associated subtle obliteration of the third sonographic layer. Initial endoscopic biopsy was negative for neoplasm. The patient refused to undergo an invasive procedure and was subsequently lost to follow-up. Three years after initial detection, EGD revealed the lesion had become markedly erythematous, and at 4 years after initial EGD it had increased in size to 1.8 cm and developed a central ulcer and a heterogeneous EUS echo. Finally, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed, and histopathologic examination revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma had minutely invaded the submucosal layer (invasion depth 169 μm) but without lymphovascular invasion and with negative resection margins. Fortunately, no additional surgical treatment was required. He has been followed for 4 years after ESD without any evidence of local or distant recurrence. This report describes an extremely rare case of early gastric cancer presenting as SMT that was cured by ESD after a treatment delay of 4 years and the endoscopic changes that occurred during this period. The report highlights the importance of considering the possibility of gastric cancer when SMT is encountered in clinical practice.",,2014
656,35975831,Analytic description of nanowires II: morphing of regular cross sections for zincblende- and diamond-structures to match arbitrary shapes.,"Setting out from our recent publication [König & Smith (2021). Acta Cryst. B77, 861], we extend our analytic description of the regular cross sections of zincblende- and diamond-structure nanowires (NWires) by introducing cross section morphing to arbitrary convex shapes featuring linear interfaces as encountered in experiment. To this end, we provide add-on terms to the existing number series with their respective running indices for zinc-blende- (zb-) and diamond-structure NWire cross sections. Such add-on terms to all variables yield the required flexibility for cross section morphing, with main variables presented by the number of NWire atoms NWire(dWire[i]), bonds between NWire atoms Nbnd(dWire[i]) and interface bonds NIF(dWire[i]). Other basic geometric variables, such as the specific length of interface facets, as well as widths, heights and total area of the cross section, are given as well. The cross sections refer to the six high-symmetry zb NWires with low-index faceting frequently occurring in the bottom-up and top-down approaches of NWire processing. The fundamental insights into NWire structures revealed here offer a universal gauge and thus enable major advancements in data interpretation and the understanding of all zb- and diamond-structure-based NWires with arbitrary convex cross sections. We corroborate this statement with an exact description of irregular Si NWire cross sections and irregular InGaAs/GaAs core-shell NWire cross sections, where a radially changing unit-cell parameter can be included.",,2015

373,35979301,Family relationship of nurses in COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study.,"This research demonstrates that nurses feel pain because the pandemic process has separated them from their family and children. To examine the family relationship situation of nurses in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The research adopted a descriptive qualitative design. Participants were selected by the snowball method. An individual in-depth interview technique was used while the participants were away. In-depth interviews were made with a total of 27 nurses. Nine of these nurses were excluded from the study due to communication problems and device problems during the interview. This research showed that nurses suffered from family relationship breakdown and insufficiency in intrafamilial coping. The nurses stayed away from their families due to overtime and fear of COVID-19. They cannot meet the needs of their children and spouses for whom they are responsible, and they cannot spare time for them. They were living a tiring life with great responsibility and faced with mental problems such as burnout syndrome and depression. This study was conducted in three cities with a high number of COVID-19 cases in Turkey. We investigated three themes: Breakdown in continuity of intrafamilial relationship, ineffectiveness in role performance, and ineffective individual coping. The nurses suffer from conditions such as change in parent-infant/child relation and insufficiency in intrafamilial process coping.",,2017
246,35982601,Modification of Case-Based Reasoning Similarity Formula to Enhance the Performance of Smart System in Handling the Complaints of in vitro Fertilization Program Patients.,"Eighty percent of in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients have high anxiety levels, which influence the success of IVF and drive IVF patients to quickly report any abnormal symptoms. Rapid responses from fertility subspecialist doctors may reduce patients' anxiety levels, but fertility subspecialist doctors' high workload and their patients' worsening health conditions make them unable to handle IVF patients' complaints quickly. Research suggests that smart systems using case-based reasoning (CBR) can help doctors handle patients quickly. However, a prior study reported enhanced accuracy by modifying the CBR similarity formula based on Lin's similarity theory to generate the Chris case-based reasoning (CCBR) similarity formula. The data were validated through interviews with two fertility subspecialist doctors, interviews with two IVF patients, a questionnaire administered to 17 community members, the relevant literature, and 256 records with data on IVF patients' complaints and how they were handled. An experiment compared the performance of the CBR similarity formula algorithm with the CCBR similarity formula algorithm. A confusion matrix showed that the CCBR similarity formula had an accuracy value of 52.58% and a precision value of 100%. Fertility subspecialist doctors stated that 89.69% of the CCBR similarity formula recommendations were accurate. We recommend applying a combination of the CCBR similarity formula and a minimum reference value of 80% with a CBR smart system for handling IVF patients' complaints. This recommendation for an accurate system produced by the CBR similarity formula may help fertility subspecialist doctors handle IVF patients' complaints.",,2018
1944,35967665,Effect of Physical Exercise on College Students' Life Satisfaction: Mediating Role of Competence and Relatedness Needs.,"This study examined the effect of physical exercise on the life satisfaction among college students. On the basis of the Basic Psychological Need Theory, the mediating roles of competence and relatedness needs satisfaction and their differences among college students in physical education (PE) majors and non-PE majors were explored. The sample included 1,012 college students who were selected to participate in an online survey. Major findings were as follows: (1) The total effect of physical exercise commitment on college students' life satisfaction was marginally significant while that of physical exercise adherence was not significant; (2) The effect of physical exercise commitment was observed exclusively through the mediating role of relatedness need satisfaction, while that of physical exercise adherence was through both competence and relatedness needs satisfaction; (3) In terms of differences caused by major, only one mediation path, that was, physical exercise → competence need satisfaction → college students's life satisfaction was significant among PE majors. This study thus enriched the empirical research on the benefits of physical exercise to individual mental health, highlighted the particularity of college students majoring in PE, and provided targeted and sensible suggestions for the design of physical exercise intervention programs.",,2019
334,35979524,Guidance on COVID-19 Vaccination in Hidradenitis Suppurativa Patients: A Modified Delphi Consensus of Experts.,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients may be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and complications from their medications and comorbidities. There is a lack of expert consensus on recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine for HS patients. Herein, we aim to provide expert-driven consensus recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccinations in HS patients. A modified Delphi consensus survey developed by a core committee of 7 dermatologist HS experts consisting of 4 demographic questions and 12 practice statements was distributed to the US HS Foundation-sponsored provider listserv. Participants were attending physician HS experts. Survey results were to be reviewed by the core group and revised and resubmitted until consensus (≥70% agreement) was achieved. Among the 33 survey participants, there were 30 (87%) dermatologists, 1 general surgeon, 1 plastic surgeon, and 1 rheumatologist. Consensus for all 12 statements on vaccine counseling and HS treatment counseling was achieved after the first round. For now, this consensus can serve as a resource for clinicians discussing COVID-19 vaccination with their HS patients. These recommendations will need to be updated as new evidence on COVID-19 emerges.",,2020
879,35974844,COVID-19 Vaccine-Associated Lymphadenopathy in Breast Imaging Recipients: A Review of Literature.,"The unpredictability of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created an ongoing global healthcare crisis. Implementation of a mass vaccination program to accelerate disease control remains in progress. Although injection site soreness, fatigue, and fever are the most common adverse reactions reported after a COVID-19 vaccination, ipsilateral lymph node enlargement has increasingly been observed. In patients undergoing routine screening and surveillance for breast cancer, interpreting lymphadenopathy (LAP) is challenging in the setting of a recent COVID-19 vaccination. With a growing proportion of the population receiving the vaccine, a multifaceted approach is necessary to avoid unnecessary and costly workup. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the existing literature on COVID-19 vaccine-associated LAP in breast imaging patients.",,2021
1762,35967962,Esophageal Achalasia: From Laparoscopic to Robotic Heller Myotomy and Dor Fundoplication.,"Laparoscopic Heller myotomy and Dor fundoplication has become the gold standard in treating esophageal achalasia and robotic surgical platform represents its natural evolution. The objective of our study was to assess durable long-term clinical outcomes in our cohort. Between June 1, 1999 and June 30, 2019, 111 patients underwent minimally invasive treatment for achalasia (96 laparoscopically and 15 robotically). Fifty-two were males. Mean age was 49 years (20 - 96). Esophageal manometry confirmed the diagnosis. Fifty patients underwent pH monitoring study, with pathologic reflux in 18. Preoperative esophageal dilation was performed in 76 patients and 21 patients received botulin injection. Dysphagia was universally present, and mean duration was 96 months (5 - 480). Median operative time was 144 minutes (90 - 200). One patient required conversion to open approach. Four mucosal perforations occurred in the laparoscopic group and were repaired intraoperatively. Seven patients underwent completion esophageal myotomy and added Dor fundoplication. Upper gastrointestinal series was performed before discharge. Median hospital stay was 39 hours (24 - 312). Median follow up was 157 months (6 - 240), and dysphagia was resolved in 94% of patients. Seven patients required postoperative esophageal dilation. Minimally invasive Heller myotomy and Dor fundoplication are feasible. The operation is challenging, but excellent results hinge on the operative techniques and experience. The high dexterity, three-dimensional view, and the ergonomic movements of robotic surgery allow application of all the technical elements, achieving the best durable outcome for the patient. Robotic surgery is the natural evolution of minimally invasive treatment of esophageal achalasia.",,2022
817,35974981,Connectedness Is Critical: A Social Network Analysis to Support Emerging Women Leaders in Global Health.,"Global health networks serve to bring members together towards a specific objective. However, for myriad reasons, women often lack access to networks that facilitate leadership and career development. In 2020, the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health launched Emerging Women Leaders in Global Health (EDGE) with a virtual seminar series featuring diverse women leaders followed by an online networking space. The purpose of this paper is to use social network analysis (SNA) to describe the network, the connections within it, and the values placed on those connections to inform future programming. We asked EDGE participants to fill out a survey to collect network-specific data. Then, we developed a sociogram and calculated social network metrics based on region, type of organization, and professional career stage. The EDGE network had 103 unique connections, and each node, on average, was connected to two other nodes. Early professionals that work in Global North academic institutions were the most prevalent members and most efficiently connected with other members of the network. However, senior professionals from the Global South are key to bridging gaps between regions and across sectors. Early career professionals from the Global North and senior professionals from the Global South need to work in synergy to improve the connectedness of emerging women leaders around the world.",,2023
577,35978510,Autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases post-COVID-19 vaccination.,"Vaccination against COVID-19 is one of the critical tools to provide herd immunity, reduce mortality, and control the pandemic worldwide. Despite the safety of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in the healthy population, a minority of people may develop rare post-vaccine adverse reactions such as autoimmune syndromes. The current study aimed to identify and present a series of patients with de-novo autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) associated with COVID-19 vaccines. Inclusion criteria were the onset of ARDs symptoms at ∼3-4 weeks post-vaccination, age ≥ 16, no previous history of ARDs, meeting the classification criteria for one of the ARDs, and staying in the follow-up. The most commonly used vaccines in patients were Sinopharm [7 cases (50%)] and AstraZeneca [6 cases (42.9%)]. ARDs were significantly more common in subjects who received the AstraZeneca vaccine than in those who received other vaccines. Based on the results, patients were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis or one of its subtypes (5 cases), vasculitis (4 cases), systemic lupus erythematosus (3 cases), and peripheral seronegative spondyloarthritis (2 cases). Except for one patient with self-limitation of ARD, others were treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and one case developed irreversible neurological complications. Indeed, our data can warn physicians about the possibility of ARDs post-vaccination, lead to faster diagnosis, prevent loss of window of opportunity for treatment, and prevent irreversible organ damage. Based on the published literature, autoimmune phenomena post-COVID-19 vaccination may be related to the overstimulation of mediators and cytokines due to complicated antigen-specific/non-specific immunological responses and mechanisms.",,2024
1403,35968546,Review of investigational medical devices' clinical trials and regulations in Africa as a benchmark for new innovations.,"Medical technologies present a huge potential in improving global health playing a key role toward achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 by 2030. A number of clinicians, innovators, business entities and biomedical engineers among others have developed a number of innovative medical devices and technologies to address the healthcare challenges especially in Africa. Globally, medical devices clinical trials present the most acceptable method for determining the risks and benefits of medical device innovations with the aim of ascertaining their effectiveness and safety as compared with established medical practice. However, there are very few medical device clinical trials reported in Africa compared to other regions like USA, UK and Europe. Most of the medical device clinical trials reported in Africa are addressing challenges around HIV/AIDS, maternal health and NCDs. In this mini review, we report about some of the published medical device clinical trials in Africa PubMed and Google Scholar and their associated challenges.",,2025
414,35979243,Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis in Cirrhotic Patients: A Shift in the Microbial Pattern? A Retrospective Analysis.,"Over the last decade, a shift in the spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) microbial pattern toward an increasing incidence of gram-positive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has been reported. Systematic surveillance of the local microbiological scenario and antibiotic resistance is crucial to SBP treatment success. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the microbiological profile and bacterial resistance of SBP pathogens in a Portuguese cohort to allow selection of the most appropriate empirical antibiotics. This is a single-center retrospective study including 63 adult cirrhotic patients with culture-positive SBP. Patients were identified using a hospital general diagnostic database and searching for all SBP events (neutrophil count in ascitic fluid ≥250/mm3) from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017. Patients were excluded if they had culture-negative SBP, secondary peritonitis, peritoneal dialysis, a liver transplant, or immunodeficiency. The site of SBP acquisition was classified as nosocomial if it was diagnosed 48 h or longer after hospitalization or as nonnosocomial if it was diagnosed within the first 48 h. MDR bacteria were those with an acquired resistance to at least 1 agent in 3 or more antimicrobial categories. All statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics software version 22 (IBM, New York, USA). The study cohort comprised 53 (84.1%) men. The mean age of the patients was 60.6 ± 11.2 years. Alcohol was the most common etiology (88.9%) and most patients had advanced liver cirrhosis (87.1%, Child C). Gram-negative bacteria were slightly more frequent than gram-positive bacteria (56.9 vs. 43.1%). Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (33.8%). Nineteen (31.7%) bacteria were classified as MDR. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, quinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam, and carbapenems was found in 31.7, 35, 26.7, and 18.3% of the cases, respectively. The rates of gram-positive bacteria were similar between nosocomial and nonnosocomial episodes (45 vs. 42.2%; p = 0.835). MDR bacteria were more common in the nosocomial group (50 vs. 23.8%; p = 0.046). Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (50 vs. 23.8%; p = 0.046), piperacillin-tazobactam (44.4 vs. 19.1%; p = 0.041), and carbapenems (33.3 vs. 11.9%; p = 0.049) occurred more frequently in nosocomial episodes. Resistance to first-line antibiotic occurred in 29.3% of the patients, being more common in the nosocomial group (44.4 vs. 22.5%; p = 0.089). Although gram-negative bacteria remain the most common causative microorganisms, our results emphasize the shift in SBP microbiological etiology, as almost half of the isolated microorganisms were gram positive. The emergence of bacteria resistant to traditionally recommended empirical antibiotics underlines the importance of basing this choice on local flora and antibiotic susceptibility data, allowing a more rational and successful use of antibiotics. Na última década assistiu-se a uma mudança no padrão microbiológico da peritonite bacteriana espontânea (PBE), com aumento da incidência de bactérias gram-positivas e multirresistentes. Uma vigilância sistemática do cenário microbiológico e da resistência antibiótica é crucial para o sucesso do tratamento da PBE. O principal objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o perfil microbiológico e os padrões de resistência antibiótica dos agentes bacterianos responsáveis pelos casos de PBE numa coorte portuguesa de doentes cirróticos, de modo a permitir uma seleção mais apropriada da antibioterapia empírica. Estudo retrospetivo unicêntrico, que incluiu 63 doentes adultos cirróticos com PBE culturapositiva. A identificação dos doentes foi efetuada a partir da base de dados eletrónica do centro hospitalar, pesquisando todos os internamentos por PBE (contagem de neutrófilos no líquido ascítico ≥250/mm3) entre 1 janeiro de 2012 e 31 de dezembro de 2017. Foram aplicados como critérios de exclusão: cultura de líquido ascítico negativa, peritonite secundária, diálise peritoneal, transplante hepático ou imunodeficiência. O local de aquisição da PBE foi classificado como nosocomial se diagnóstico após as primeiras 48 horas de hospitalização, e não-nosocomial se diagnóstico nas primeiras 48 horas. Multirresistência foi definida como resistência adquirida a pelo menos um agente em três ou mais categorias antimicrobianas. A análise estatística foi efetuada com recurso ao software IBM SPSS Statistics versão 22 (IBM, New York, USA). A coorte incluiu 53 (84.1%) doentes cirróticos do género masculino. A idade média dos doentes foi de 60.6 ± 11.2 anos. O álcool constituiu a etiologia mais comum (88.9%) e a maioria dos doentes apresentava uma cirrose em estadio avançado (87.1%, Child-C). As bactérias gram-negativas revelaram-se ligeiramente mais frequentes que as gram-positivas (56.9 vs. 43.1%). Escherichia coli foi o microrganismo mais frequente (33.8%). Dezanove (31.7%) das bactérias isoladas foram classificadas como multirresistentes. As resistências às cefalosporinas de terceira-geração, às quinolonas, à piperacilina-tazobactam e aos carbapenemes foram de 31.7, 35, 26.7 e 18.3%, respetivamente. A taxa de bactérias gram-positivas foi similar entre PBE nosocomial e não-nosocomial (45 vs. 42.2%; p = 0.835). As bactérias multirresistentes foram mais frequentes no grupo nosocomial (50 vs. 23.8%; p = 0.046). A resistência às cefalosporinas de terceira-geração (50 vs. 23.8%; p = 0.046), à piperacilina-tazobactam (44.4 vs. 19.1%; p = 0.041) e aos carbapenemes (33.3 vs. 11.9%; p = 0.049) foi significativamente superior nas infeções nosocomiais. A resistência à antibioterapia empírica de primeira linha ocorreu em 29.3% dos doentes, sendo mais frequente no grupo nosocomial (44.4 vs. 22.5%; p = 0.089). Apesar de as bactérias gram-negativas constituírem, nesta coorte, a maioria dos microrganismos responsáveis pela PBE, os nossos resultados enfatizam a mudança na etiologia microbiológica da PBE, na medida em que, quase metade dos microrganismos isolados foram gram-positivos. A emergência de bactérias resistentes aos antibióticos empíricos tradicionalmente recomendados sublinha a importância de basear esta escolha nos dados locais sobre flora bacteriana e susceptibilidade antibiótica, permitindo uma escolha mais racional e um uso bem-sucedido dos antibióticos.",,2026
1225,35971488,Demographic and clinical variations of keratoconus in Saudi population.,"The aim of this prospective study was to identify the demographic and clinical variations of keratoconus (KC) in Saudi Arabia. A self-administered survey was completed by patients in Saudi hospitals. The survey included questions on demographics, educational level, treatment options, dry eye, eye rubbing because of allergy, residence, family history, and consanguineous marriage. Six hundred and forty-eight patients (375 - male, 273 - female; mean age: 26.89 [standard deviation: 7.04] years; range: 11-50 years) were conducted at 13 central hospitals in all 13 administrate areas of Saudi Arabia over a 1-year period. Five hundred and forty-three (83.8%) patients had a secondary school diploma or diploma's degree of education and mostly were from the Aseer and Riyadh regions. The geographical distribution rate of KC was highest in the mountainous areas. For dry eye, 21.9% and 44.8% of the patients, respectively, reported frequent or occasional dryness and 13.4% and 48.9% of the patients, respectively, reported frequent or occasional bouts of eye allergy. Furthermore, 17.9% and 61.9% of the patients, respectively, reported that they constantly or sometimes rubbed their eyes. Marriages were endogamous in 53.5% of the patients and the family history was positive by 56.8%. There was a history of ocular disease in 27% of the patients and the systemic disease was 13%. This study is the first to describe the regional demographic and clinical variations of KC in Saudi Arabia. Its findings suggest that the different distribution of keratoconic patients between provinces is attributable to genetic and/or environmental factors.",,2027
511,35978748,Dysphagia as a Postoperative Complication of Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion.,"Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), despite its possible complications, remains the gold standard for the surgical treatment of patients with radiculopathy and/or myelopathy caused by cervical intervertebral disc herniation or spondylosis. Despite its high rate of incidence, postoperative dysphagia following ACDF is still poorly understood; its pathogenesis remains relatively unknown, and its risk factors are still a subject of debate. The aim of this study is to review the incidence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and methods of prevention of dysphagia in ACDF patients. To this end, a literature review was conducted based on the PubMed internet database. Article titles were searched by using the following keywords: dysphagia and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion or ACDF. The search was limited to prospective clinical studies evaluating dysphagia after ACDF surgery. Studies published in non-English languages, retrospective studies, cadaveric studies, reviews, case reports, study protocols, and commentary studies were excluded. Initially, 335 studies were identified after a primary search. After the application of the exclusion criteria, 73 studies remained for the final analysis. This literature review focused on identifying the rate of dysphagia and the various risk factors leading to this complication by comparing and evaluating the current literature with a wide spectrum of heterogeneity concerning patients, surgeons, and surgical techniques. A mean dysphagia rate of 19.4% (95% CI: 9.6%-29.1%) based on the findings of the included studies correlating dysphagia directly with ACDF procedures was calculated. Various established risk factors leading to dysphagia include the female sex, smoking, the surgical approach, rhBMP-2 use, and multilevel surgery, while zero-profile devices seem to reduce dysphagia risk. The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiological findings, especially prevertebral soft-tissue swelling. However, videofluoroscopic and endoscopic studies have been recently used for the evaluation of dysphagia. The role of local administration of steroids in the prevention of dysphagia has not yet been clarified. This review underscores the prevailing rudimentary understanding of the problem of dysphagia after ACDF procedures and highlights the need for more sensitive, factor-specific studies for understanding the impact of various risk factors on the incidence rate of dysphagia.",,2028
1091,35974528,Diffuse-interface lattice Boltzmann modeling of charged particle transport in Poiseuille flow.,"In this paper, we developed a coupled diffuse-interface lattice Boltzmann method (DI-LBM) to study the transport of a charged particle in the Poiseuille flow, which is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid field and the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electric potential field. We first validated the present DI-LBM through some classical benchmark problems, and then investigated the effect of electric field on the lateral migration of the particle in the Poiseuille flow. The numerical results show that the electric field has a significant influence on the particle migration. When an electric field in the vertical direction is applied to the charged particle initially located above the centerline of the channel, the equilibrium position of the particle would drop suddenly as the electric field is larger than a critical value. This is caused by the wall repulsion due to lubrication, the inertial lift related to shear slip, the lift owing to particle rotation, the lift due to the curvature of the undisturbed velocity profile, and the electric force. On the other hand, when an electric field in the horizontal direction is adopted, the equilibrium position of the particle would move toward the centerline of the channel with the increase of the electric field.",,2029

1304,35970236,Mixed-Methods Study of the Experience of Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"To understand the experiences of women who were pregnant during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, March 2020 to May 2020, and how they coped with stress. A convergent mixed-methods design. Online survey that launched in April 2020. A total of 185 pregnant women. For the quantitative strand, we measured adaptation to coping with stress using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. For the qualitative strand, we asked participants to describe the experience of being pregnant during the pandemic. The mean score on the Brief Resilient Coping Scale was 14.7, which indicated a medium-level resilient coper. Using Krippendorff's content analysis, we identified four themes: Robbed of Enjoying the Expected Pregnancy Experiences, Anxiety and Fear in the Face of a Pandemic Pregnancy, Heightened Source of Worry With Birth on the Horizon, and Choosing Hope. To meet the needs of pregnant women, perinatal nurses and other maternity care providers must understand the experience of pregnancy during times of upheaval, such as the onset of a global pandemic. Health care providers and nurses can help ensure ideal outcomes for pregnant women by recognizing the loss of the expected pregnancy experience, providing support through creative social outlets, and fostering hopeful optimism.",,2031
2261,35967170,Study of Arterial Blood Gas Analysis in Moderate-to-Severe COVID-19 Patients.,"Background The high prevalence of pneumonia and renal involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to frequent acid-base abnormalities in serious patients and affects prognosis. In this study, we aimed to assess the arterial blood gas (ABG) and acid-base patterns in COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital. Methodology A retrospective observational study was conducted in a designated COVID-19 hospital involving 267 reverse transcription-polymerasechain reaction-positive COVID-19 patients. Demographic and laboratory data including ABG data within the ﬁrst day after admission and in patients with multiple ABG analyses, only the first measurement was collected and analyzed statistically, including its association with comorbidities. Results The most common age group of the patients was 51-60 years (30.8%), with a male predominance (male:female = 2.7:1). The most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease found in 147 (55%) COVID-19 patients. Alkalosis and acidosis were observed in 145 (54.3%) and 50 (18.7%) patients, respectively. The most common ABG abnormality observed was primary respiratory alkalosis with secondary metabolic acidosis in 67 (25.1%) patients, followed by primary respiratory alkalosis with secondary metabolic alkalosis in 54 (20.2%) patients. Statistically significant negative correlation was found with PaCO2 and pH (r = -0.530, p < 0.0001), statistically significant positive correlation was found between pH and base (r = 0.533, p < 0.0001), pH and TCO2 (r = 0.260, p < 0.0001), and pH and HCO3 (r = 0.354, p < 0.0001). Conclusions Acid-base abnormalities are commonly encountered in COVID-19 patients. Respiratory alkalosis as a part of a single or mixed pattern on ABG was the most common pattern found in critically ill COVID-19 patients. ABG on admission in moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients can help in the early correction of metabolic abnormalities leading to improved patient outcomes.",,2032
363,35979311,"Current guidelines for Helicobacter pylori treatment in East Asia 2022: Differences among China, Japan, and South Korea.","Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is highly prevalent in East Asia. The overall seroprevalence rate of H. pylori infection is 44.2% in China, 37.6%-43.2% in Japan, and 51.0% in South Korea. H. pylori can cause peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. East Asian countries have high rates of gastric cancer (age-standardized incidence rate: 20-30 per 100000). The Kyoto global consensus report emphasized that H. pylori gastritis should be considered the main cause for the development of gastric cancer. H. pylori treatment guidelines in China, Japan, and South Korea have recently been revised according to data from each of those countries. However, emerging antibiotic resistance is an important barrier to H. pylori eradication. The recommended H. pylori treatment regimens differ among those three East Asian countries. In this review, recent guidelines and up-to-date research on H. pylori treatment regimens from China, Japan, and South Korea are discussed.",,2033

1631,35968147,"Molecular tools, potential frontiers for enhancing salinity tolerance in rice: A critical review and future prospective.","Improvement of salinity tolerance in rice can minimize the stress-induced yield losses. Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of Asia's most widely consumed crops, native to the subtropical regions, and is generally associated with sensitivity to salinity stress episodes. Salt-tolerant rice genotypes have been developed using conventional breeding methods; however, the success ratio is limited because of the complex nature of the trait and the high cost of development. The narrow genetic base of rice limited the success of conventional breeding methods. Hence, it is critical to launch the molecular tools for screening rice novel germplasm for salt-tolerant genes. In this regard, the latest molecular techniques like quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, genetic engineering (GE), transcription factors (TFs) analysis, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are reliable for incorporating the salt tolerance in rice at the molecular level. Large-scale use of these potent genetic approaches leads to identifying and editing several genes/alleles, and QTL/genes are accountable for holding the genetic mechanism of salinity tolerance in rice. Continuous breeding practices resulted in a huge decline in rice genetic diversity, which is a great worry for global food security. However, molecular breeding tools are the only way to conserve genetic diversity by exploring wild germplasm for desired genes in salt tolerance breeding programs. In this review, we have compiled the logical evidences of successful applications of potent molecular tools for boosting salinity tolerance in rice, their limitations, and future prospects. This well-organized information would assist future researchers in understanding the genetic improvement of salinity tolerance in rice.",,2035
1714,35968039,The temporo-mandibular joint: Reconstruction of the condyle post-ablation.,"Ablative surgery of the mandibular condyle poses a unique reconstructive challenge for many reasons. The condyle and it's relationship to the TMJ is a unique, complex, functional and aesthetically relevant piece of human anatomy. Resection may be required for both malignant and benign pathologies; each posing a differing set of surgical variables. Particularly in neoplastic processes, there must remain a certain degree of peri-operative flexibility with regards to the extent of the resection, and forethought to the requirement for post-operative radiotherapy; both of which further complicate choice of reconstructive option and surgical or prosthetic planning. The cases involved can often concern paediatric patients, and an additional aspect to be considered is that of growth potential. In this piece, we will discuss the indications for ablation and the techniques involved. We will elaborate on the reconstructive challenges specific to reconstructing the condyle in post-ablative cases. We will then describe and analyse the established reconstructive techniques; aiming to provide a balanced view on the advantages and disadvantages. Our focus will include autologous options such as vascularised and non-vascularised free tissue transfer, and the non-autologous options of custom and stock implants. We will also touch on distraction osteogenesis and ramus osteotomies. Lastly we will look to the future and consider possible innovative techniques which may become available to the surgeon.",,2036
1451,35968447,COVID-19 Shock and the Time-Varying Volatility Spillovers Among the Energy and Precious Metals Markets: Evidence From A DCC-GARCH-CONNECTEDNESS Approach.,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic intensified the volatility of commodity markets (the energy and precious metals markets), which created a significant negative impact on the volatility spillovers among these markets. It may also have triggered a new volatility risk contagion. In this paper, we introduce the DCC-GARCH-CONNECTEDNESS approach to explore the volatility spillover level and multi-level spillover structure characteristics among the commodity markets before and during the COVID-19 epidemic in order to clarify the new volatility risk contagion patterns across the markets. The results implied several conclusions. (i) The COVID-19 epidemic has significantly improved the total volatility spillover level of the energy and precious metals markets and has enhanced the risk connectivity among the markets. (ii) The COVID-19 epidemic has amplified the volatility of the crude oil market, making it the main volatility spillover market, namely the source of volatility risk contagion. (iii) The COVID-19 epidemic outbreak enhanced the external risk absorption capacity of the natural gas and silver markets, and the absorption level of the external volatility spillover improved significantly. Furthermore, the risk absorption capacity of the gold market weakened, while the gold market has remained the endpoint of external volatility risk during the epidemic and has acted as a risk stabilizer. (iv) The volatility spillover among markets has clear time-varying characteristics and a positive connectedness with the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic. As the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic increases, the volatility risk connectivity among the markets rapidly increases.",,2037
2068,35967450,NOTCH4 mutation as predictive biomarker for immunotherapy benefits in NRAS wildtype melanoma.,"NRAS wildtype melanoma accounts for approximately 80% of melanomas. Previous studies have shown that NRAS wildtype melanoma had higher response rates and better prognoses than NRAS-mutant patients following immunotherapy, while as major actors in tumor cells and tumor microenvironment (TME), the association between NOTCH family genes and response to immunotherapy in NRAS wildtype melanoma remains indistinct. We aim to explore whether NOTCH family gene variation is associated with genomic factors in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response in NRAS wildtype melanoma and with clinical results in these patients. This research used genomic data of 265 NRAS wildtype ICI-pretreatment samples from five ICI-treated melanoma cohorts to analyze the relationship between NOTCH family gene mutation and the efficacy of ICI therapy. NRAS wildtype melanomas with NOTCH4-Mut were identified to be associated with prolonged overall survival (OS) in both the discovery (HR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.11-0.83, P = 0.01) and validation cohorts(HR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.07-0.68, P = 0.003). Moreover, NOTCH4-Mut melanoma had a superior clinical response in the discovery cohort (ORR, 40.0% vs 13.11%, P = 0.057) and validation cohort (ORR, 68.75% vs 30.07%, P = 0.004). Further exploration found that NOTCH4-Mut tumors had higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) and tumor neoantigen burden (TNB) (P <0.05). NOTCH4-Mut tumors had a significantly increased mutation in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed NOTCH4-Mut tumor enhanced anti-tumor immunity. NOTCH4 mutation may promote tumor immunity and serve as a biomarker to predict good immune response in NRAS wildtype melanoma and guide immunotherapeutic responsiveness.",,2038

78,35983405,Changes in the CHA2DS2-VASC score as a predictor of incident atrial fibrillation in older Chinese individuals: the AF-CATCH study.,"Incidence of atrial fibrillation is highly associated with age and cardiovascular co-morbidities. Given this relationship, we hypothesized that the dynamic changes resulting in an increase in the CHA2DS2-VASC score over time would improve the efficiency of predicting incident atrial fibrillation on repeated screening after a negative test. We investigated in an analysis of the AF-CATCH trial [quarterly vs. annual electrocardiogram (ECG) screening for atrial fibrillation in older Chinese individuals] data, the association between the changes in the CHA2DS2-VASC score from baseline to end-of-study visit and the risk of incident atrial fibrillation. Participants without a history of atrial fibrillation and with a sinus rhythm at baseline were randomized to the annual (usual) or quarterly 30 s (intensive) single-lead ECG screening groups. During a median follow-up of 2.1 years in 6806 participants, the incidence rate of atrial fibrillation increased from 4.2 per 1000 person-years in participants with a change in the CHA2DS2-VASC score of 0 to 6.4 and 25.8 per 1000 person-years in participants with a change in the CHA2DS2-VASC score of 1 and ≥2, respectively. A change in the CHA2DS2-VASC score of ≥2 was associated with a significantly elevated risk of incident atrial fibrillation. Patients with substantial changes in the CHA2DS2-VASC score were more likely to develop incident atrial fibrillation, and regular re-assessments of cardiovascular risk factors in the elderly are probably worthwhile to improve the detection of atrial fibrillation.

712,35975217,Rhytidoplasty Through Minimal Incisions (Rhythmic).,"In the present report, an innovative alternative approach for rhytidoplasty is described. Rhytidoplasty Through Minimal Incisions (Rhythmic) is an effective, efficient, safe, and reproducible alternative procedure for facial rejuvenation. It has several advantages over traditional procedures. The main objective of this report is to describe the surgical technique of Rhythmic. The surgical technique for the foreheadplasty requires only a transverse ~7-mm incision ~1 cm behind the hairline at the midline. The upper and lower blepharoplasty are made with incisions of ~3 mm, and no suture is needed. Liposuction of the neck can also be performed, and the face-lift can be achieved through preauricular incisions. Here, we summarize the results obtained in 741 patients subjected to rhytidoplasty through minimal incisions. The follow-up of these patients extended up to 20 years. This technique drastically reduced the length of scars; the eyebrows elevated 8-13 mm, and in some cases, the tip of the nose was also elevated ~7 mm. It minimized or eliminated the vertical frown lines and the horizontal furrows in the forehead. The use of this technique allowed an excellent definition of the cervicofacial angle in the patients. In conclusion, rhytidoplasty through minimal incisions drastically reduced the length of scars, bleeding, surgical time, avoided the use of drains, reduced costs, and shorted the convalescent period. It also offered the patients a natural appearance with minor complications. ",,2041

115,35983319,Predictors of Decision Regret among Caregivers of Older Canadians Receiving Home Care: A Cross-Sectional Online Survey.,"Background. In Canada, caregivers of older adults receiving home care face difficult decisions that may lead to decision regret. We assessed difficult decisions and decision regret among caregivers of older adults receiving home care services and factors associated with decision regret. Methods. From March 13 to 30, 2020, at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted an online survey with caregivers of older adults receiving home care in the 10 Canadian provinces. We distributed a self-administered questionnaire through Canada's largest and most representative private online panel. We identified types of difficult health-related decisions faced in the past year and their frequency and evaluated decision regret using the Decision Regret Scale (DRS), scored from 0 to 100. We performed descriptive statistics as well as bivariable and multivariable linear regression to identify factors predicting decision regret. Results. Among 932 participants, the mean age was 42.2 y (SD = 15.6 y), and 58.4% were male. The most frequently reported difficult decisions were regarding housing and safety (75.1%). The mean DRS score was 28.8/100 (SD = 8.6). Factors associated with less decision regret included higher caregiver age, involvement of other family members in the decision-making process, wanting to receive information about the options, and considering organizations interested in the decision topic and health care professionals as trustworthy sources of information (all P < 0.001). Factors associated with more decision regret included mismatch between the caregiver's preferred option and the decision made, the involvement of spouses in the decision-making process, higher decisional conflict, and higher burden of care (all P < 0.001). Discussion. Decisions about housing and safety were the difficult decisions most frequently encountered by caregivers of older adults in this survey. Our results will inform future decision support interventions. This is one of the first studies to assess decision regret among caregivers of older adults receiving home and community care services and to identify their most frequent difficult decisions.Difficult decisions were most frequently about housing and safety. Most caregivers of older adults in all 10 provinces of Canada experienced decision regret.Factors associated with less decision regret included higher caregiver age, the involvement of other family members in the decision-making process, wanting to receive information about the options, considering organizations interested in the decision topic, and health care professionals as trustworthy sources of information.

257,35982574,Detecting vinyl chloride by phytoscreening in the shallow critical zone at sites with potential human exposure.,"Chlorinated ethene (CE) contaminants are widespread in groundwater, and the occurrence of vinyl chloride (VC), among others, is a well-known issue due to its mobility, persistence, and carcinogenicity. Human exposure to VC may occur through inhalation after soil vapor intrusion into buildings at sites with shallow underground contamination. Soil vapor intrusion risk is traditionally assessed through indoor air and sub-slab sampling (direct evidence) or soil gas and groundwater surveys (indirect evidence). Phytoscreening (sampling and analysis of tree trunk matrices) was proven as a cost-effective alternative technique to indirectly detect shallow underground contamination by higher chlorinated ethenes and subsequent vapor intrusion risk. However, the technique has appeared barely capable to screen for the lower chlorinated VC, likely due to its fugacity and aerobic bio-degradability, with only one literature record to date showing successful detection in trees. We applied phytoscreening at two sites with severe CE contamination nearby residential buildings caused by illegal dumping of chlorinated pitches from petrochemical productions. The two sites show variable amounts of VC in the shallow groundwater (1e2 to 1e4 μg/L), posing potential sanitary risk issues. Former soil gas surveys did not detect VC in the vadose zone. At both sites, we sampled trunk micro-cores and trunk gas from poplar trees close to contaminated piezometers in different seasons. VC was detected in several instances, disproving the shared literature assumption of the inefficacy of phytoscreening towards this compound. Factors influencing the detectability of VC and other CEs in trees were analyzed through linear regressions. Two different conceptual models were proposed to explain the effective uptake of VC by trees at the two sites, i.e., direct uptake of contaminated groundwater at the first site and uptake of VC from an anoxic vadose zone at the second site. In planta reductive dechlorination of CEs is not expected based on current literature knowledge. Thus, the detection of VC in trunks would indicate its occurrence in the shallow underground, suggesting higher screening effectiveness of phytoscreening compared to soil gas; this has implications for indirect vapor intrusion risk assessment.",,2046

This protocol was registered in PROSPERO CRD42020197598. Selection criteria were: years between 2010 and 2020, in English language, and full-term gestation (37-42 weeks). The methodological quality of the eligible articles was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analyses were performed to study each parameter related to neonatal mortality and maternal morbidity. The meta-analysis included 94 285 births with breech presentation. The relative risk of perinatal mortality was 5.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.61-11.51) times higher in the vaginal delivery group, 4.12 (95% CI = 2.46-6.89) for birth trauma and 3.33 (95% CI = 1.95-5.67) for Apgar results. Maternal morbidity showed a relative risk 0.30 (95% CI = 0.13-0.67) times higher in the planned caesarean group. An increment in the risk of perinatal mortality, birth trauma, and Apgar lower than 7 was identified in planned vaginal delivery. However, the risk of severe maternal morbidity because of complications of a planned caesarean was slightly higher.",,2047

309,35980629,"Medical Residency Milestones: Competencies in Informatics, Library, and Evidence-Based Practice.","The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) sets standards known as Milestones and monitors the progress of medical residents as they advance toward medical practice in their specialties. Health sciences librarians need to train medical residents in certain competency areas to help reach the Milestone standards. This project analyzed the Milestones related to informatics, library, and evidence-based practice (EBP) skills to identify core and optional library-related curricular elements that can be integrated into different medical specialty residencies. The authors collected key competency documents from ACGME and from those specialties representing 2% or more of the residencies in the United States. Then, they compared and contrasted those Milestones related to informatics, library, and EBP competency skills. Most relevant Milestones were categorized under the fifth broad ACGME competency area of Practice Based Learning and Improvement. The Milestones followed developmental patterns, reflecting residents' increased sophistication in meeting these competencies as they advanced in their specialties. The curriculum was designed to meet the residents' learning needs at each progressive Milestone.",,2049

655,35975832,Analytical description of nanowires III: regular cross sections for wurtzite structures.,"Setting out from König & Smith [Acta Cryst. (2019), B75, 788-802; Acta Cryst. (2021), B77, 861], we present an analytic description of nominal wurtzite-structure nanowire (NWire) cross sections, focusing on the underlying geometric-crystallographic description and on the associated number theory. For NWires with diameter dWire[i], we predict the number of NWire atoms NWire[i], the bonds between these Nbnd[i] and NWire interface bonds NIF[i] for a slab of unit-cell length, along with basic geometric variables, such as the specific length of interface facets, as well as widths, heights and total area of the cross section. These areas, the ratios of internal bonds per NWire atom, of internal-to-interface bonds and of interface bonds per NWire atom present fundamental tools to interpret any spectroscopic data which depend on the diameter and cross section shape of NWires. Our work paves the way for a fourth publication which - in analogy to König & Smith [Acta Cryst. (2022). B78, 643-664] - will provide adaptive number series to allow for arbitrary morphing of nominal w-structure NWire cross sections treated herein.",,2051
1615,35968256,An investigation on trust in AI-enabled collaboration: Application of AI-Driven chatbot in accommodation-based sharing economy.,"Several measures taken to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic have severely disrupted the accommodation sharing sector. This study attempts to find solutions to aid the recovery of the accommodation sharing sector via team efforts. Accordingly, we focus on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and collaboration. Despite the significant developments in AI technologies, there exists no research considering the application of AI in team collaboration. Utilizing the design science research method and collaboration engineering, we developed an AI-driven prototype system, AI-Driven, for collaboration process recommendation. Qualitative results show that the newly developed tool for collaboration process recommendation has achieved satisfactory performance. Furthermore, we investigated the antecedents and outcomes of trust in the AI-driven collaboration context. From a practical perspective, we propose several solutions to the challenges looming over the accommodation sharing sector according to collaboration deliverables. Furthermore, a system prototype was developed to facilitate collaboration process recommendation and provide procedural guidance.",,2052
513,35978746,Hand-Foot Syndrome Presentation Post-Capecitabine Treatment in a Black Patient.,"Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, commonly known as hand-foot syndrome (HFS), is a side-effect of cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as capecitabine. Patients with HFS oftentimes present with palmoplantar numbness, tingling, burning pain, and/or hyperpigmentation; in advanced grades, blistering and ulceration may occur. In this article, we present the case of a Black patient with grade 1 HFS post-capecitabine treatment for metastasized breast cancer. Prompt recognition for atypical HFS symptom presentation in people of color and discontinuation of capecitabine with supportive treatment can prevent progression to grade 2+ HFS that limits activities of daily living (ADLs).",,2053
698,35975311,Experiences and perceptions of nurses working night shift: a qualitative systematic review.,"The objective of this review was to examine the available evidence on the experiences and perceptions of nurses working the night shift within any specialty in the acute care, subacute, or long-term care setting. Nurses are required for round-the-clock patient care, and night shift nurses can experience detrimental effects because of their work hours, which disrupt their normal circadian rhythm. Understanding nurses' experiences and perceptions when working night shift will facilitate the development of strategies to minimize the potential negative effects of working at night. In examining nurses' experiences and perceptions of working night shift, there is scope to explore how to improve night shift nurses' practice environment and job satisfaction, which will then translate to improved nurse and patient outcomes. This review included qualitative studies focused on registered nurses and licensed practical nurses who work the night shift or rotate between day and night shift. This review followed the JBI methodology for systematic reviews of qualitative evidence. The methodology used was consistent with the a priori protocol. Studies included in this review were those published in full text, English, and between 1983 (when the seminal work on hospitals that attract and retain nurses was published) and February 2021, when the search was completed. The main databases searched for published and unpublished studies included MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science.From the search, two reviewers independently screened the studies against the inclusion criteria, and then papers selected for inclusion were assessed for methodological quality. Qualitative data was then extracted from the included papers independently by the four reviewers. Results from each reviewer were discussed and clarified to reach agreement. The extracted findings were pooled and examined for shared meaning, coded, and grouped into categories. Common categories were grouped into meta-synthesis to produce a comprehensive set of synthesized findings. The final synthesized findings were graded using the ConQual approach, to determine the level of confidence (trust) users may have in the value of the synthesized findings. Thirty-four papers, representing 33 studies, conducted in 11 countries, six continents, and a total of 601 participants met the criteria for inclusion. From these, a total of 220 findings were extracted and combined to form 11 categories based on similarity in meaning, and three syntheses were derived: i) The Other shift: The distinctiveness of night nursing; ii) Juggling sleep and all aspects of life when working nights; and iii) Existing in the Twilight Zone: Battling the negative impact of sleep deprivation consumes nurses who strive to keep patients, self, and others safe. The major conclusions from this review are the uniqueness of working the night shift and the sleep deprivation of night nurses. Organizational strategies and support are needed for those working this shift, which will enhance nurse and patient safety. PROSPERO CRD42019135294.",,2054
942,35974748,Cationic molybdenum oxo alkylidenes stabilized by N-heterocyclic carbenes: from molecular systems to efficient supported metathesis catalysts.,"Cationic d0 group 6 olefin metathesis catalysts have been recently shown to display in most instances superior activity in comparison to their neutral congeners. Furthermore, their catalytic performance is greatly improved upon immobilization on silica. In this context, we have developed the new family of molecular cationic molybdenum oxo alkylidene complexes stabilized by N-heterocyclic carbenes of the general formula [Mo(O)(CHCMe3)(IMes)(OR)[X-]] (IMes = 1,3-dimesitylimidazol-2-ylidene; R = 1,3-dimesityl-C6H3, C6F5; X- = B(3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)4 -, B(ArF)4, tetrakis(perfluoro-t-butoxy)aluminate (PFTA)). Immobilization of [Mo(O)(CHCMe3)(IMes)(O-1,3-dimesityl-C6H3)+B(ArF)4 -] on silica via surface organometallic chemistry yields an active alkene metathesis catalyst that shows the highest productivity towards terminal olefins amongst all existing molybdenum oxo alkylidene catalysts.",,2055
635,35977216,Changes in Insurance Coverage Continuity After Affordable Care Act Expansion of Medicaid Eligibility for Young Adults With Low Income in Massachusetts.,"Young adults historically have had the highest uninsured rates among all age groups. In 2014, in addition to Medicaid expansion for adults with low income (≤133% of the federal poverty level [FPL]) through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Massachusetts also extended eligibility for children (≤150% FPL) to beneficiaries aged 19 to 20 years. To examine changes in insurance coverage continuity for Medicaid enrollees who turned age 19 years before and after eligibility policy changes. This cohort study used data from the Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Database (2012 to 2016) to compare coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries turning age 19 years before and after Medicaid expansion. Monthly coverage was examined for each cohort for 3 years as beneficiaries aged from 18 and 19 years to 19 and 20 years to 20 and 21 years. Analyses were performed between November 1, 2020, and May 12, 2022. In each year, the likelihood of being uninsured or having Medicaid, employer-sponsored insurance, or individual commercial coverage for 3 or more months was examined along with the likelihood of having continuous Medicaid enrollment for 12 or more and 24 or more months. Multivariable linear probability models were used to compare the likelihood of these outcomes for those in the postexpansion vs preexpansion cohorts, adjusting for sex, comorbidity levels, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and neighborhood race and ethnicity. A total of 41 247 young adults turning age 18 to 19 years in the baseline year (20 876 [50.6%] men) were included in the study, with 20 777 in the preexpansion cohort and 20 470 in the postexpansion cohort. Enrollees who turned age 19 years after vs before the Medicaid eligibility expansion were less likely to have 3 or more uninsured months at ages 18 to 19 years (4.4% [n = 891] vs 22.9% [n = 4750]; adjusted difference, -18.4 [95% CI, -19.0 to -17.7] percentage points) and 19 to 20 years (13.2% [n = 2702] vs 35.8% [n = 7447]; adjusted difference, -22.4 [95% CI, -23.2 to -21.6] percentage points) and more likely to have continuous insurance coverage for 12 or more months (94.1% [n = 19 272] vs 63.7% [n = 13 234]; adjusted difference, 30.5 [95% CI, 29.7-31.2] percentage points) or 24 or more months (77.5% [n = 15 868] vs 44.4% [n = 9221]; adjusted difference, 33.0 [95% CI, 32.1-33.9] percentage points). Differences in the likelihood of having 3 or more uninsured months diminished at ages 20 to 21 years, when both groups had access to Medicaid (ie, in calendar years 2014 for the preexpansion cohort and 2016 for the postexpansion cohort). In this cohort study of young adults in Massachusetts, the combination of expanding Medicaid to lower-income adults and increasing the age threshold for child Medicaid eligibility was associated with reduced likelihood of becoming uninsured among Medicaid enrollees entering adulthood.",,2056
1554,35968332,Three-dimensional versus two-dimensional laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer: better promote postoperative sexual and urinary function of a propensity-matched study.,"Laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) with autonomic nerve preservation (ANP) is a common procedure for rectal cancer (RC), associated with a high prevalence of postoperative urogenital and anorectal dysfunctions. Compared to 2D laparoscopy, 3D laparoscopy provides better depth perception of the surgical field and hand-eye coordination to achieve better outcomes. We compared the performance of 2D and 3D laparoscopy on preserving urogenital and anorectal function in TME+ANP surgery for rectal cancer using propensity-score matching. Data were collected from consecutive male patients who underwent 3D or 2D laparoscopic TME+ANP for primary RC at our institution between March 2012 and December 2020. The primary outcome was sexual and urinary function 1 year after surgery. A total of 450 male patients were eligible. After 1:1 matching, 146 cases were included in each group for analysis. One year after surgery, the prevalence of sexual dysfunction (International Index of Erectile Function score <26) was 8.22% in the 3D laparoscopic group and 44.52% in the 2D laparoscopic group, respectively (P=0.000) and a significant difference in the incidence of urinary retention was observed (n=3 and 24, respectively (P=0.000)). Moreover, blood loss, operative time, duration of hospital stay, and the time to first flatus in the 3D laparoscopic group were significantly less than in the 2D laparoscopic group. In conclusion, 3D laparoscopic TME is associated with lower incidences of postoperative sexual and urinary dysfunction than 2D laparoscopic TME for rectal cancer in male patients.",,2057
321,35980411,Predictors of COVID-19 Vaccination Among EMS Personnel.,"Unvaccinated emergency medical services (EMS) personnel are at increased risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and potentially transmitting the virus to their families, coworkers, and patients. Effective vaccines for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus exist; however, vaccination rates among EMS professionals remain largely unknown. Consequently, we sought to document vaccination rates of EMS professionals and identify predictors of vaccination uptake. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of North Carolina EMS professionals after the COVID-19 vaccines were widely available. The survey assessed vaccination status as well as beliefs regarding COVID-19 illness and vaccine effectiveness. Prediction of vaccine uptake was modeled using logistic regression. A total of 860 EMS professionals completed the survey, of whom 74.7% reported receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. Most respondents believed that COVID-19 is a serious threat to the population, that they are personally at higher risk of infection, that vaccine side effects are outweighed by illness prevention, and the vaccine is safe and effective. Despite this, only 18.7% supported mandatory vaccination for EMS professionals. Statistically significant differences were observed between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness, recall of employer vaccine recommendation, perceived risk of infection, degree of threat to the population, and trust in government to take actions to limit the spread of disease. Unvaccinated respondents cited reasons such as belief in personal health and natural immunity as protectors against infection, concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness, inadequate vaccine knowledge, and lack of an employer mandate for declining the vaccine. Predictors of vaccination included belief in vaccine safety (odds ratio [OR] 5.5, P=<0.001) and effectiveness (OR 4.6, P=<0.001); importance of vaccination to protect patients (OR 15.5, P=<0.001); perceived personal risk of infection (OR 1.8, P=0.04); previous receipt of influenza vaccine (OR 2.5, P=0.003); and sufficient knowledge to make an informed decision about vaccination (OR 2.4, P=0.024). In this survey of EMS professionals, over a quarter remained unvaccinated for COVID-19. Given the identified predictors of vaccine acceptance, EMS systems should focus on countering misinformation through employee educational campaigns as well as on developing policies regarding workforce immunization requirements.",,2058
2258,35967173,Far From the Biliary Tree: A Case of Overlapping Autoimmune Liver Disease in a Patient Presenting With Sicca Symptoms.,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune condition with many extrahepatic manifestations that are commonly encountered as a patient's primary presenting complaints. Rarely, PBC co-exists as an overlapping syndrome with other liver-related autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Presented is a rare case of PBC with features of AIH diagnosed in a patient who initially presented with hemoptysis and worsened sicca symptoms due to advanced Sjögren's syndrome. The patient had a three-year evolution of abnormal liver biochemistry and was found to be a heterozygous carrier for hereditary hemochromatosis (H63D mutation). Given that patients with PBC-AIH are at an increased risk of complications compared to isolated disease from either disorder, early diagnosis and prompt management can help spare patients from cirrhosis, liver failure and transplantation, or even death.",,2059

365,35979309,Plastic surgery for giant metastatic endometrioid adenocarcinoma in the abdominal wall: A case report and review of literature.,"Endometrial cancer (EC) is a common gynecological malignancy, but metastasis to the abdominal wall is extremely rare. Therefore, an appropriate treatment approach for large metastatic lesions with infection remains a great challenge. We report the case of a 65-year-old woman who developed abdominal metastasis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma, as defined by International Obstetrics and Gynecology stage II, in which the lesion was complicated by infection. A right hemicolectomy was performed for colon metastasis in relation to her initial gynecological cancer 3 years ago. When admitted to our department, a complete resection of the giant abdominal wall lesion was performed, and a Bard composite mesh was used to reconstruct the abdominal wall. A local flap was used to close the resultant large defect in the external covering of the abdomen. The patient underwent chemotherapy following cytoreductive surgery. Pathology revealed metastasis of EC, and molecular subtyping showed copy number high of TP53 mutation, implying a poor prognosis. When EC patients develop giant abdominal wall metastasis, a plastic surgeon should be included before contemplating resection of tumors.",,2061
59,35983470,Ungual Spitz Nevus: Description of Dermoscopic Data.,"Spitz nevus is an uncommon, benign melanocytic proliferation that primarily appears on face, trunk or lower extremities of children. This lesion may share clinical and microscopical characteristics with melanoma, making it a diagnostic and management challenge. A 13-year old male presented with an asymptomatic chronic dermatosis located on the third left-hand nail. Cutaneous examination revealed a homogeneous dark brown melanonychia which extended up to the cuticle. Upon dermoscopy, longitudinal bands measuring less than 3 mm wide of heterogeneous colors ranging from light to dark brown, and positive Hutchinson's sign were observed. We report the second case of a Spitz nevus ungually localized which strongly resembled an ungual melanoma with a positive Hutchinson's sign upon dermoscopy. Describing the infrequent presentation and location of the Spitz nevus poses an opportunity to establish diagnostic and management criteria in the near future.",,2062
1276,35970760,Natural History of Patients with Prostate MRI Likert 1-3 and Development of RosCaP: a Multivariate Risk Score for Clinically Significant Cancer.,"Clinically significant prostate cancer (csCaP) with Gleason ≥3 + 4 is found in 10% negative prebiopsy multiparametric (mp) MRI cases and varies widely for equivocal mpMRI cases. The objective of this study was to investigate long-term outcomes of patients with negative and equivocal mpMRIs and to develop a predictive score for csCaP risk stratification in this group. Patients who underwent an upfront mpMRI between May 2015 and March 2018 with an MRI score Likert 1 to 3 were included in the study. Patients had either a CaP diagnosis at MRI-targeted biopsy or were not diagnosed and attended follow-up in the community. Outcomes were analysed through the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox Model. Regression coefficients of significant variables were used to develop a Risk of significant Cancer of the Prostate score (RosCaP). At first assessment 281/469 patients had mpMRI only and 188/469 mpMRI and biopsy, 26 csCaP were found at biopsy, including 10/26 in Likert 3 patients. 12/371 patients discharged without CaP after first assessment were diagnosed with csCaP during a median of 34.2 months' follow-up, 11/12 diagnosis occurred in patients omitting initial biopsy. csCaP diagnosis-free survival was 95.7% in the MRI group and 99.1% in the biopsy group. From these outcomes, a continuous RosCaP score was developed: RosCaP = 0.083 x Age - 0.202 x (1/PSA Density) + 0.786 (if Likert 3), and 4 risk classes were proposed. Limitations include retrospective design and absence of external validation. Age, PSA Density and MRI Likert score were significantly associated to the risk of csCaP and utilised to devise the novel RosCap predictive score focused to support risk assessment in patients with negative or equivocal mpMRI results.",,2063
163,35983118,Development and internal validation of preoperative and postoperative nomograms predicting quadrifecta outcomes following robotic radical prostatectomy.,"Literature on the factors predicting functional and oncological outcomes following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is sparse for the Indian population. Hence, the primary objective of this study was to develop preoperative and postoperative nomograms predicting these outcomes in patients with prostate cancer undergoing RARP. This retrospective analysis identified the predictors of quadrifecta outcomes, i.e., the patients who did not have complications, were continent, had negative surgical margins, and were biochemical recurrence free with at least 1 year of follow-up following RARP. We excluded the return of sexual potency as the majority of the patients in our series were sexually inactive preoperatively. We used the backward stepwise logistic regression analysis method to identify the predictors of quadrifecta. Preoperative and postoperative nomograms using these predictors were developed and validated with bootstrapping, goodness of fit, calibration plot, decision curve analysis (DCA), and theits receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Of the 688 patients who underwent RARP, 399 were included in this study, and 123 (30.8%) of these achieved the quadrifecta outcomes. Preoperative nomogram was developed using four variables, i.e., prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), biopsy Gleason score, and clinical stage. Postoperative nomogram included PSA, CCI, pathological tumor stage, tumor grade, and positive lymph node. Both the models were internally valid on bootstrapping, calibration plots, and goodness of fit. On the ROC analysis, preoperative and postoperative nomograms had an area under the curve of 0.71 and 0.79, respectively. On the DCA, at a threshold probability of 5%, both the models showed a net benefit. We developed and validated accurate nomograms for predicting quadrifecta outcomes following RARP for the Indian population.",,2064

1716,35968036,Recommendations for ethical and responsible use of artificial intelligence in digital agriculture.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are an integral and emerging component of digital agriculture. AI can help ensure sustainable production in agriculture by enhancing agricultural operations and decision-making. Recommendations about soil condition and pesticides or automatic devices for milking and apple picking are examples of AI applications in digital agriculture. Although AI offers many benefits in farming, AI systems may raise ethical issues and risks that should be assessed and proactively managed. Poor design and configuration of intelligent systems may impose harm and unintended consequences on digital agriculture. Invasion of farmers' privacy, damaging animal welfare due to robotic technologies, and lack of accountability for issues resulting from the use of AI tools are only some examples of ethical challenges in digital agriculture. This paper examines the ethical challenges of the use of AI in agriculture in six categories including fairness, transparency, accountability, sustainability, privacy, and robustness. This study further provides recommendations for agriculture technology providers (ATPs) and policymakers on how to proactively mitigate ethical issues that may arise from the use of AI in farming. These recommendations cover a wide range of ethical considerations, such as addressing farmers' privacy concerns, ensuring reliable AI performance, enhancing sustainability in AI systems, and reducing AI bias.",,2067
1457,35968441,Vaccination against COVID-19 reduces virus-related fears: Findings from a German longitudinal study.,"During the recent pandemic, fear of COVID-19 has been widespread and is considered to deteriorate mental health. We assessed whether vaccination can effectively reduce the fear of COVID-19 and, thus, contribute to improving people's mental health status. We used two-wave panel data from a German online study collected in April 2021 (t1) and August/September 2021 (t2) and estimated differences-in-differences to determine whether those who were vaccinated against COVID-19 experienced a reduction of fear of COVID-19, and whether the reduction was more evident as compared to people who were not vaccinated for various reasons. Fear of COVID-19 generally decreased between t1 and t2 for all respondents. Moreover, reduction of fear for people who were unvaccinated at t1 but received the vaccine between t1 and t2 was strongest as compared to people who did not get vaccinated during that period, even after we controlled for factors associated with fear (e.g., age, gender). Vaccination reduced fear of COVID-19 beyond some seasonal fluctuation and, therefore, we argue that vaccination partially reduces the psychological distress caused by the pandemic. We recommend that scientists, practitioners, and politicians highlight this additional positive effect of vaccination in health communication.",,2068
357,35979317,Endoscopic ultrasound radiofrequency ablation of pancreatic insulinoma in elderly patients: Three case reports.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has recently been proposed as a local treatment for functional pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms in patients unfit for surgery, in order to obtain clinical syndrome regression. Data on the safety and long-term effectiveness of this approach are scarce, and EUS-RFA procedures are not standardized. The present case series reports 3 elderly patients with a pancreatic insulinoma and comorbidities, locally treated by EUS-guided RFA with clinical success in terms of hypoglycemic symptoms. RFA procedures were performed during deep sedation, under EUS control with a 19 G needle, an electrode 5-mm in size at a power of 30 W and multiple RFA applications during the same session in order to treat the whole area of the lesions. Immediate relief of symptoms was evident in 2 patients after the first EUS-RFA, while in the third patient a second endoscopic treatment was needed. All 3 patients are symptom-free without need of medications after 24 mo of follow-up with imaging follow-up showing no disease recurrence. A single adverse event of intraprocedural bleeding occurred, which was successfully treated endoscopically. EUS-RFA represents an effective and safe alternative to surgery for the treatment of insulinomas in elderly patients at high surgical risk. However, larger multicenter studies with longer follow-up are needed in order to better assess its safety and clinical success.",,2069
1844,35967796,Expert persuasion can decrease willingness to pay for sugar-containing food.,"Recent studies have revealed types of eating nudges that can steer consumers toward choosing healthier options. However, most of the previously studied interventions target individual decisions and are not directed to changing consumers' underlying perception of unhealthy food. Here, we investigate how a healthy eating call-first-person narrative by a health expert-affects individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) for sugar-free and sugar-containing food products. Participants performed two blocks of a bidding task, in which they had to bid on sweets labeled either as sugar- free or as sugar-containing. In-between the two blocks, half of the participants listened to a narrative by a dietary specialist emphasizing the health risks of sugar consumption, whereas the remaining participants listened to a control narrative irrelevant to food choices. We demonstrate that the health expert's narrative decreased individuals' WTP for sugar-containing food, but did not modulate their WTP for sugar- free food. Overall, our findings confirm that consumers may conform to healthy eating calls by rather devaluating unhealthy food products than by increasing the value of healthy ones. This paves the way for an avenue of innovative marketing strategies to support individuals in their food choices.",,2070
1227,35971486,Validation of the Arabic version of the quality of life impact of refractive correction questionnaire.,"To validate the Arabic version of the quality of life impact of refractive correction (QIRC) questionnaire. This was a cross-sectional study included participants with refractive errors (myopia, hypermetropia, or astigmatism) aged between 19 and 40 years who were pre or postrefractive surgeries. Uncorrected distance visual acuity, refraction, and corneal topography were collected. The 20-item QIRC questionnaire was translated to the Arabic language and then back translated to the English language. Participants were asked to answer all items of the Arabic QIRC. The validity and reliability of the translated questionnaire were tested using Rasch analysis. A total of 145 participants with refractive errors participated in this study. The mean age ± standard deviation of participants was 26.29 ± 5.1 years. Person separation (2.01) and reliability (0.80) indicates good precision and stability of the Arabic QIRC questionnaire. Item infit was ranged between 0.82 and 1.23; and item outfit was range between 0.76 and 1.32. The items were well targeted to the persons with a mean difference of 0.30.

1180,35973315,Culture-based determinants and outcome of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections.,"The objective of this study was to examine the occurrence, determinants, and outcome of S. aureus bloodstream infections (BSI) diagnosed based on single versus multiple positive initial cultures. All adults with first episodes of mono-microbial S. aureus BSI in Queensland during 2000-2019 were included. 10,855 (67%) and 5,421 (33%) were diagnosed based on one and multiple positive initial cultures, respectively. Patients with multiple positive initial cultures were significantly younger, more likely to have community-associated disease, have a shorter time to culture positivity, less likely to have methicillin-resistant S. aureus BSI, and have a different distribution of comorbid medical illnesses and clinical foci. The 30-day all-cause case-fatality rate was 18% and single positive initial culture was an independent risk factor for death. Among patients with S. aureus BSI, those diagnosed by single positive initial blood cultures have different clinical features and a higher risk for death.",,2074

1483,35968410,New and emerging forms of data and technologies: literature and bibliometric review.,"With the increased digitalisation of our society, new and emerging forms of data present new values and opportunities for improved data driven multimedia services, or even new solutions for managing future global pandemics (i.e., Disease X). This article conducts a literature review and bibliometric analysis of existing research records on new and emerging forms of multimedia data. The literature review engages with qualitative search of the most prominent journal and conference publications on this topic. The bibliometric analysis engages with statistical software (i.e. R) analysis of Web of Science data records. The results are somewhat unexpected. Despite the special relationship between the US and the UK, there is not much evidence of collaboration in research on this topic. Similarly, despite the negative media publicity on the current relationship between the US and China (and the US sanctions on China), the research on this topic seems to be growing strong. However, it would be interesting to repeat this exercise after a few years and compare the results. It is possible that the effect of the current US sanctions on China has not taken its full effect yet.",,2076
1222,35971491,"Etiology, clinical profile, and treatment outcome of peripheral ulcerative keratitis.","To assess the etiology, clinical features, and treatment outcome in patients with peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK). In this retrospective, observational study, forty-eight eyes of 32 consecutive patients with PUK were included. Demographic profile, etiology, clinical features, treatment history, and outcome were documented. Of the 32 patients, 19 (59%) were male and the mean age at presentation was 54.72 ± 14.92 years. Sixty-eight percent of patients were from rural backgrounds. Half of the patients had bilateral involvement. Fifty percent of patients presented after 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms. Of 48 eyes at presentation, 11 had mild disease, 9 had moderate disease and 28 had severe disease. At presentation, best-corrected visual acuity <3/60 was found in 26 (54%) eyes. Mooren's ulcer (40% eyes) was the most common etiology for PUK. Rheumatoid factor was positive in 8 of 32 patients (25%). Of 32 patients, 19 (59%) required systemic immunosuppression for the control of disease activity. Surgical intervention to maintain anatomical integrity was required in 27 (56%) eyes. No significant change in vision was seen in pretreatment and posttreatment groups. Four eyes failed to heal after 4 weeks of initiation of treatment due to noncompliance of the patient. None of our patients died during follow-up. PUK is an indicator of occult systemic autoimmune disease. Mooren's ulcer is the most common cause of PUK. Prompt and adequate immunosuppression is not only eye saving but also lifesaving for patients with PUK of autoimmune origin.",,2077
166,35983113,The value of webinars during COVID-19 pandemic: A questionnaire-based survey.,"An opportunity for e-learning has been created by the ongoing pandemic and lockdown, along with the availability of efficient technology. Webinars have filled in the lacunae of the learning process. We conducted an online survey to evaluate the interest and opinion regarding webinars, which enables for standardization of future webinars and reap the maximum benefits. An online survey was conducted among practicing urologists and urology residents. The survey was formulated and edited by a group of urologists and uro-oncologists who had experience conducting several regional and international conferences and webinars. The survey comprised 39 questions divided into six parts. A total of 328 urologists throughout the country participated in the survey, and 303 complete responses were obtained for the analysis. 67.3% subjects felt that live webinars are the preferred method of knowledge exchange during the coronavirus disease pandemic, and 58.1% felt that this concept of webinars had to be extended even after the pandemic was over. Few shortcomings in the webinars included lack of networking (41.3%), lack of personal connection (73.3%), and lack of practical skills (35%). About 85.5% felt that the duration should be <90 min, and 83.2% thought that speakers should be restricted to <5. They were comfortable attending the webinars on weekends (48.8%) or weekdays but after hospital hours (43.9%). Most of them felt (92.4%) that webinars should be focused, covering a single theme and including international and national speakers (84.2%). Webinars can be streamlined for the better and continued after the pandemic. A few issues in this novel learning process have to be adequately addressed to strengthen this modality of academic urology.",,2078
1247,35971368,Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic Effects on Admissions and In-Hospital Outcomes in Patients With ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI): An Albanian Observational Study.,"Background Multiple studies conducted worldwide and in Albania documented an important reduction of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) admissions during the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. There are few studies regarding STEMI admissions and outcomes during the ongoing pandemic after the initial lockdown. We aimed to study STEMI admissions and in-hospital outcomes after the COVID-19 lockdown period. Methods A retrospective single-center study was conducted, collecting data for all consecutive STEMI admissions from March 9th, (the first COVID-19 case) until April 30th, the corresponding period of 2020 total lockdown, for years 2019 and 2021. The control period was considered the year 2019 [pre-pandemic (PP)] and the study period was in 2021 [ongoing pandemic (OP)]. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to compare all-STEMI admissions, invasive procedures, and risk ratio (RR) 95% CI to compare the mortality and complications rate between the study and control period. Results The study included 217 STEMI patients admitted in 2019, and 234 patients during the 2021 period. The overall-STEMI admissions IRR is in a similar range during the 2021 OP compared to the 2019 PP period IRR=1.07 (95%CI 0.90-1.28). Similar invasive procedures were observed during OP compared to PP period, respectively for coronary-angiography IRR= 1.07; (0.87-1.31), for all-PCI [1.12 (0.92-1.35)], and primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) [1.09 (0.89-1.34)]. The STEMI death rate during OP compared to PP period was similar (7.3 vs. 7.4%), RR=1.01 (0.53-1.96), and a non-significant lower primary-PCI-death rate (4.0 vs 4.8%), RR= 0.83 (0.30-2.3)]. Conclusions After the initial reduction of admissions and invasive procedures in STEMI patients during the 2020 lockdown period and the increase of all-STEMI mortality, the number of hospitalizations, invasive procedures, and mortality returned to a similar range during OP compared to the PP period despite a highly incident ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",,2079

1612,35968272,EEG biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of infantile spasms.,"Early diagnosis and treatment are critical for young children with infantile spasms (IS), as this maximizes the possibility of the best possible child-specific outcome. However, there are major barriers to achieving this, including high rates of misdiagnosis or failure to recognize the seizures, medication failure, and relapse. There are currently no validated tools to aid clinicians in assessing objective diagnostic criteria, predicting or measuring medication response, or predicting the likelihood of relapse. However, the pivotal role of EEG in the clinical management of IS has prompted many recent studies of potential EEG biomarkers of the disease. These include both visual EEG biomarkers based on human visual interpretation of the EEG and computational EEG biomarkers in which computers calculate quantitative features of the EEG. Here, we review the literature on both types of biomarkers, organized based on the application (diagnosis, treatment response, prediction, etc.). Visual biomarkers include the assessment of hypsarrhythmia, epileptiform discharges, fast oscillations, and the Burden of AmplitudeS and Epileptiform Discharges (BASED) score. Computational markers include EEG amplitude and power spectrum, entropy, functional connectivity, high frequency oscillations (HFOs), long-range temporal correlations, and phase-amplitude coupling. We also introduce each of the computational measures and provide representative examples. Finally, we highlight remaining gaps in the literature, describe practical guidelines for future biomarker discovery and validation studies, and discuss remaining roadblocks to clinical implementation, with the goal of facilitating future work in this critical area.",,2081
366,35979308,Retroperitoneal tumor finally diagnosed as a bronchogenic cyst: A case report and review of literature.,"Retroperitoneal bronchogenic cyst (RBC) is an extremely rare developmental abnormality. Most are benign tumors but malignant transformation is possible. Because of their anatomical position, RBCs are easily misdiagnosed as adrenal or pancreatic solid tumors on radiological evaluation. Here, we report a case of RBC, review the literature, and summarize some important features. A 49-year-old woman was incidentally found to have a retroperitoneal tumor during a physical examination. Enhanced computed tomography and laboratory evaluations, including routine blood examination, blood biochemistry, 24-h urine 17 ketones, 17 hydroxyls, adrenocortical hormone, serum potassium concentration, serum amylase, lipase, and epithelial tumor markers, revealed a moderate density, 54 mm × 40 mm mass with a clear boundary near the left adrenal gland. The were no abnormalities in the blood and urine values. Because the patient had a history of hypertension and the location of the mass was adjacent to the adrenal gland, it was initially diagnosed as a left adrenal tumor and was resected by retroperitoneal laparoscopy. However, the pathological examination after surgery confirmed it to be a bronchogenic cyst. Retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery can be prioritized for symptomatic RBC patients. Conservative treatment is feasible for selected patients.",,2082
108,35983347,"Common and uncommon neuroimaging manifestations of ataxia: an illustrated guide for the trainee radiologist. Part 2 - neoplastic, congenital, degenerative, and hereditary diseases.","Ataxia is defined as a lack of coordination of voluntary movement, caused by a variety of factors. Ataxia can be classified by the age at onset and type (chronic or acute). The causative lesions involve the cerebellum and cerebellar connections. The correct, appropriate use of neuroimaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, can make the diagnosis relatively straightforward and facilitate implementation of the appropriate clinical management. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to describe the imaging findings of ataxia, based on cases obtained from the archives of a tertiary care hospital, with a review of the most important findings. We also discuss and review the imaging aspects of neoplastic diseases, malformations, degenerative diseases, and hereditary diseases related to ataxia. Ataxia é definida como uma síndrome de falta de coordenação dos músculos de movimentação voluntária.

51,35983537,Real-life burden of hospitalisations due to COPD exacerbations in Spain.,"Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often suffer episodes of exacerbation of symptoms (ECOPD) that may eventually require hospitalisation due to several, often overlapping, causes. We aimed to analyse the characteristics of patients hospitalised because of ECOPD in a real-life setting using a big data approach. The study population included all patients over 40 years old with a diagnosis of COPD (n=69 359; prevalence 3.72%) registered from 1 January 2011 to 1 March 2020 in the database of the public healthcare service (SESCAM) of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) (n=1 863 759 subjects). We used natural language processing (Savana Manager version 3.0) to identify those who were hospitalised during this period for any cause, including ECOPD. During the study 26 453 COPD patients (38.1%) were hospitalised (at least once). Main diagnoses at discharge were respiratory infection (51%), heart failure (38%) or pneumonia (19%). ECOPD was the main diagnosis at discharge (or hospital death) in 8331 patients (12.0% of the entire COPD population and 31.5% of those hospitalised). In-hospital ECOPD-related mortality rate was 3.11%. These patients were hospitalised 2.36 times per patient, with a mean hospital stay of 6.1 days. Heart failure was the most frequent comorbidity in patients hospitalised because of ECOPD (52.6%). This analysis shows that, in a real-life setting, ECOPD hospitalisations are prevalent, complex (particularly in relation to heart failure), repetitive and associated with significant in-hospital mortality.",,2084
818,35974980,What Do Global Health Practitioners Think about Decolonizing Global Health?,"The growing awareness of colonialism's role in global health partnerships between HICs and LMICs and the associated calls for decolonization in global health has led to discussion for a paradigm shift that would lead to new ways of engagement and partnerships, as well as an acknowledgement that colonialism, racism, sexism, and capitalism contribute to inequity. While there is general agreement among those involved in global health partnerships that the current system needs to be made more equitable, suggestions for how to address the issue of decolonization vary greatly, and moving from rhetoric to reform is complicated. Based on a comprehensive (but not exhaustive) review of the literature, there are several recurring themes that should be addressed in order for the inequities in the current system to be changed. The degree to which decolonization of global health will be successful depends on how the global health community in both the HICs and LMICs move forward to discuss these issues. Specifically, as part of a paradigm shift, attention needs to be paid to creating a more equal and equitable representation of researchers in LMICs in decision-making, leadership roles, authorship, and funding allocations. There needs to be agreement in defining basic principles of best practices for global partnership, including a universal definition of 'decolonization of global health'; the extent to which current policies allow the perpetuation of power imbalance between HICs and LMICs; a set of principles, best practices, and models for equitable sharing of funds and institutional costs among partners; a mechanism to monitor progress prospectively the equitable sharing of credits (e.g., leadership, authorship), including a set of principles, best practices, and models; and, a mechanism to monitor progress prospectively the extent to which decolonialization will contribute to strengthening institutional capacity in the LMIC institutions.",,2085
2,35985732,Educators Countering the Impact of Structural Racism on Health Equity.,"Health equity endorses that all persons are respected equally, and society must exert intentional efforts to eradicate inequities. Race, frequently taught as an impartial risk factor for disease, is a facilitator of structural inequities stemming from racist policies. Nursing educators must help students understand the impact of structural racism on patient populations, communities, and society at large. This article illustrates the face of structural racism, highlights how structural racism impacts health care outcomes, and provides meaningful ways for educators to unmute racism and facilitate race-related discourse in the classroom to counter the impact of structural racism on health equity.",,2086
1166,35973384,The association between gambling marketing and unplanned gambling spend: Synthesised findings from two online cross-sectional surveys.,"In 2020, the British Government initiated a review about whether to introduce stricter controls on gambling marketing. We examine: (i) what proportion of regular sports bettors and emergent adult gamblers report that marketing has prompted unplanned spend; and (ii) what factors are associated with reporting that marketing had prompted unplanned spend. Data are from two British non-probability online surveys with: (i) emerging adults (16-24 years; n = 3,549; July/August 2019) and (ii) regular sports bettors (18+; n = 3,195; November 2020). Among current gamblers, logistic regressions examined whether reporting that gambling marketing had prompted unplanned spend (vs never) was associated with past-month marketing awareness, past-month receipt of direct marketing (e.g., e-mails), following gambling brands on social media, and problem gambling classification. Almost a third of current gamblers reported that marketing had prompted unplanned gambling spend (sports bettors: 31.2 %; emerging adults: 29.5 %). Escalated severity of problem gambling was associated with reporting that marketing had prompted unplanned spend in both samples, in particular those experiencing gambling problems compared to those experiencing no problems (sports bettors: ORAdj = 17.01, 95 % CI: 10.61-27.27; emerging adults: ORAdj = 11.67, 95 % CI: 6.43-21.12). Receipt of least one form of direct marketing in the past month and following a gambling brand on at least one social media platform was also associated unplanned spend among sports bettors and emerging adults. Among emerging adults and regular sports bettors, increased severity of gambling problems, receiving direct marketing, and following gambling brands on social media are associated with reporting that marketing has prompted unplanned spend.",,2087
83,35983400,Clinical and Epidemiological Profile of Elderly Hodgkin's Lymphoma in India.,"Background Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a curable malignancy that commonly involves the younger population. However, HL can rarely occur in the elderly population (≥60 years) and probably has different biology as compared to the younger counterparts. There was a paucity of data on the clinical and epidemiological profile of the elderly subset with HL in Indian patients who are misdiagnosed and empirically treated as tuberculosis. We have done an analysis of this subset of elderly patients who were registered at our institute. Methods A retrospective chart analysis of HL patients who presented to our center from 2008 to 2016 was conducted. Twenty-eight patients with HL of age ≥60 years were included in this study. Results Elderly HL comprised 18.67% of the total HL patients registered during this period. The majority were male patients, and the mean age of presentation was 65.9±5.6 years. A Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of ≥2 was seen in 30.77% of the patients. Among these, 84.62% of the patients presented with advanced-stage disease, and 57.69% of the patients presented with B symptoms, which was significantly associated with a high-risk international prognostic score (IPS). Histology-wise, mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (MCCHL) and nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (NSCHL) were equally represented (30.76%). Of the patients, 50% had extranodal disease, with the liver being the most frequent site involved. One patient each had bone marrow involvement and bulky disease. CD30, CD15, and CD20 positivity was seen in 84.61%, 50%, and 26.92% of cases, respectively. Conclusion Among elderly HL patients, males were more commonly represented than females, and patients more often presented with advanced disease and B symptoms and less often with bulky disease and mediastinal mass. Mixed cellularity classical HL is more common in the elderly subset, and significant comorbidities are present in a higher number of elderly HL patients.",,2088
1320,35970028,Prognostic significance of germline BRCA mutations in patients with HER2-POSITIVE breast cancer.,"HER2-positive breast cancers are rare amongst BRCA mutation carriers. No data exist regarding clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of this subgroup of patients. Using a retrospective matched cohort design, we collected data from 700 women who were diagnosed with operable invasive breast cancer from January 2006 to December 2016 and were screened for germline BRCA mutations. Clinicopathological features and survival rates were analyzed by BRCA and HER2 status. One hundred and fifteen HER2-positive/BRCA mutated cases were evaluated in comparison to the three control groups: HER2-positive/BRCA wild type (n = 129), HER2-negative/BRCA mutated (n = 222), HER2-negative/BRCA wild type (n = 234). HER2-positive breast cancers were more likely to have high histologic grade and high proliferation rate than HER2-negative neoplasms, regardless of BRCA mutation status. An interaction between BRCA mutations and HER2-positive status was found to correlate with worse survival after adjusting for prognostic variables (HR = 3.4; 95% CI: 1.3-16.7). Co-occurrence of BRCA mutations and HER2-positive status is a poor prognostic factor in patients with early or locally advanced breast cancer. This finding may be a proof of concept that a combined pharmacological intervention directed to these targets could be synergistic.",,2089
631,35977220,Risk of Closure Among Independent and Multihospital-Affiliated Rural Hospitals.,"The increase in rural hospital closures has strained access to inpatient care in rural communities. It is important to understand the association between hospital system affiliation and access to care in these communities to inform policy on this issue. To examine the association between affiliation and rural hospital closure. This cohort study used survival models with a time-dependent variable for affiliation vs independent status to assess risk of closure among a national cohort of US rural hospitals from January 2007 through December 2019. Data analysis was conducted from March to October 2021. Hospital affiliations were identified from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey and Irving Levin Associates and closures from the University of North Carolina Sheps Center (Chapel Hill). Additional covariates came from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases and other national sources. Affiliation with another hospital or multihospital health system. Closure was the main outcome. The models included hospital, market, and utilization characteristics and were stratified by financial distress in 2007. Among 2237 rural hospitals operating in 2007, 140 (6.3%) had closed by 2019. The proportion of rural hospitals that were independent decreased from 68.9% in 2007 to 47.0% in 2019; the proportion that were affiliated increased from 31.1% to 46.7%. Among financially distressed hospitals in 2007, affiliation was associated with lower risk of closure compared with being independent (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26-0.92). Conversely, among hospitals that were financially stable in 2007, affiliation was associated with higher risk of closure compared with being independent (aHR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.20-4.62). For-profit ownership was also strongly associated with closure for hospitals that were financially stable in 2007 (aHR, 4.08; 95% CI, 1.86-8.97). The results of this cohort study suggest that affiliations may be associated with lower risk of closure for some rural hospitals in financial distress. However, among initially financially stable hospitals, an increased risk of closure for hospitals associated with affiliation and proprietary ownership raises concerns about the association of affiliation with closures in some circumstances. Policy interventions to stabilize inpatient care in rural areas should account for these findings.",,2090
2448,35966845,Applications of social theories of learning in health professions education programs: A scoping review.,"In health professions education (HPE), acknowledging and understanding the theories behind the learning process is important in optimizing learning environments, enhancing efficiency, and harmonizing the education system. Hence, it is argued that learning theories should influence educational curricula, interventions planning, implementation, and evaluation in health professions education programs (HPEPs). However, learning theories are not regularly and consistently implemented in educational practices, partly due to a paucity of specific in-context examples to help educators consider the relevance of the theories to their teaching setting. This scoping review attempts to provide an overview of the use of social theories of learning (SToLs) in HPEPs. A scoping search strategy was designed to identify the relevant articles using two key concepts: SToLs, and HPEPs. Four databases (PubMed, ERIC, ProQuest, and Cochrane) were searched for primary research studies published in English from 2011 to 2020. No study design restrictions were applied. Data analysis involved a descriptive qualitative and quantitative summary according to the SToL identified, context of use, and included discipline. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Only two SToLs were identified in this review: Bandura's social learning theory (n = 5) and Lave and Wenger's communities of practice (CoP) theory (n = 4). A total of five studies used SToLs in nursing programs, one in medicine, one in pharmacy, and two used SToLs in multi-disciplinary programs. SToLs were predominantly used in teaching and learning (n = 7), with the remaining focusing on assessment (n = 1) and curriculum design (n = 1). This review illustrated the successful and effective use of SToLs in different HPEPs, which can be used as a guide for educators and researchers on the application of SToLs in other HPEPs. However, the limited number of HPEPs that apply and report the use of SToLs suggests a potential disconnect between SToLs and educational practices. Therefore, this review supports earlier calls for collaborative reform initiatives to enhance the optimal use of SToLs in HPEPs. Future research should focus on the applicability and usefulness of other theories of learning in HPEPs and on measuring implementation outcomes.Systematic Review Registration: https://www.researchregistry.com/browse-the-registry#registryofsystematicreviewsmetaanalyses/registryofsystematicreviewsmeta-analysesdetails/60070249970590001bd06f38/, identifier review registry1069.",,2091
107,35983349,Uterine artery embolization with highly compressible calibrated microspheres for the treatment of uterine fibroids.,"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of using highly compressible calibrated microspheres in uterine artery embolization (UAE) for the treatment of uterine fibroids. This was a prospective multicenter study. Thirty-two women with symptomatic uterine fibroids were selected for UAE between January 2019 and March 2020. The participants completed the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS-QOL) questionnaire, underwent contrast-enhanced pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and were submitted to anti-Müllerian hormone measurement, subsequently undergoing UAE with Embosoft microspheres. After six months, the patients again completed the UFS-QOL questionnaire and underwent pelvic MRI. The most common symptoms were abnormal uterine bleeding (in 81.3% of the cases), pelvic pain (in 81.3%), and compression (in 46.9%). Of the 32 patients evaluated, 12 (37.5%) had anemia due to abnormal uterine bleeding. Thirty patients completed the study. Among those patients, we observed median reductions of 21.4% in uterine volume and 15.9% in dominant fibroid volume. We identified no adverse events that could be attributed to the material itself, although there were events attributed to the UAE procedure in general. For the treatment of uterine fibroids, UAE using Embosoft microspheres shows satisfactory results, providing reductions in uterine and dominant fibroid volumes, with a low rate of adverse events, and improving patient quality of life, as well as demonstrating safety and efficacy.

Este foi um estudo prospectivo e multicêntrico. Foram selecionadas 32 mulheres com miomas uterinos sintomáticos para EAU de janeiro de 2019 a março de 2020. As participantes preencheram o questionário Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS-QOL), realizaram ressonância magnética (RM) pélvica com contraste e teste para medição dos hormônios antimüllerianos, seguido de embolização de miomas com microesferas Embosoft. Após seis meses, as pacientes novamente preencheram o UFS-QOL e realizaram RM pélvica. Os sintomas mais relatados foram sangramento uterino anormal (81,3%), dor pélvica (81,3%) e compressão (46,9%). Doze pacientes (37,5%) apresentaram anemia consequente a sangramento uterino anormal. Nas 30 pacientes que completaram o estudo, observou-se redução mediana de 21,4% no volume uterino e 15,9% no volume do mioma dominante. Não foram identificados eventos adversos possivelmente relacionados ao material utilizado, apenas em relação ao procedimento de EAU. EAU com microesferas Embrosoft mostrou resultados satisfatórios no tratamento de miomas uterinos, com redução dos volumes uterino e do mioma dominante, baixa taxa de eventos adversos e melhora na qualidade de vida, demonstrando segurança e eficácia.",,2092

Findings of a sample of n = 7,633 university students are presented in the first cross-sectional, two-year food and housing security study on campus administered via platform Campus Labs Baseline. The first sample in 2019 consisted of n = 2,615 students representing 10.4% of student enrollment (25,177 total 2019 enrollment), and the second sample in 2020 was n = 5,018 representing 20.2% of student enrollment (24,879 total 2020 enrollment). To measure food security, the six-item short form of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Household Food Security Survey Module was used. To document housing security, we created questions informed by student input. In this study, survey results are reported, and tests are conducted to assess the relationships between various student characteristics and food and housing security. Student characteristics significantly impacting food and housing security are probed further using data visualizations and subpopulation analysis with a focus on analyzing factors impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicate that employment status, consistent employment status, hours per week, academic level, number of dependents, and gender are all factors associated with food security during the pandemic but not prior to the pandemic. Other factors, including, college affiliation, ethnicity/race, having any dependents and being head of household, living alone, mode of campus transportation and mode of the transportation, household income, and age, all were associated with food security in both academic years. Using these results, a critical analysis of past interventions addressing food and housing security is presented with a focus on changes made during the pandemic. Recommendations are made for further data-driven interventions and future steps.",,2093
549,35978600,"Lenvatinib with or without Concurrent Drug-Eluting Beads Transarterial Chemoembolization in Patients with Unresectable, Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Real-World, Multicenter, Retrospective Study.","Lenvatinib is the first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of lenvatinib plus drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) versus lenvatinib alone in real-world practice. This retrospective analysis included 142 consecutive patients who received lenvatinib plus DEB-TACE and 69 patients who received lenvatinib alone as first-line treatment from 15 Chinese academic centers from November 2018 to November 2019. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) were evaluated by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, and safety profiles were compared between the two groups. The median OS and PFS were significantly longer in the combined therapy group than in the monotherapy group in whole cohort (median OS, 15.9 vs. 8.6 months, p = 0.0022; median PFS, 8.6 vs. 4.4 months, p < 0.001) and after propensity score matching analysis (median OS, 13.8 vs. 7.8 months, p = 0.03; median PFS, 7.8 vs. 4.5 months, p = 0.009). Moreover, the treatment option was an independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS with adjustment based upon baseline characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36-0.78, p = 0.001, and adjusted HR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.30-0.60, p < 0.001, respectively) and propensity score (adjusted HR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.36-0.76, p = 0.001, and adjusted HR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.33-0.64, p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, a greater ORR was observed in the combined group (ORR: 46.48% vs. 13.05%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the most common adverse events (AEs) were elevated aspartate aminotransferase (54.9%) and fatigue (46.4%) in the lenvatinib plus DEB-TACE group and lenvatinib group, respectively. Most AEs were mild-to-moderate and manageable. With well-tolerated safety, lenvatinib plus DEB-TACE was more effective than lenvatinib monotherapy in improving OS, PFS, and ORR. Thus, it may be a promising treatment for advanced HCC. Future prospective studies confirming these findings are warranted.",,2094

28,35985077,Listeria monocytogenes post-outbreak management - When could a food production be considered under control again?,"In cases of outbreaks, food business operators face inspections, recall actions and delisting by retailers. This could have happened to an Austrian meat processor whose products have been associated with a cluster of seven cases of listeriosis spread over the years 2015-2017. Sequencing of clinical and foodborne isolates by public health specialists raised the suspect of a single source outbreak since all strains were of MLST 155, cgMLST 1234. Since the family-driven business was highly motivated to save their business, a crisis management scheme was applied that was agreed upon with national authorities. An end-product-based approach testing every single lot for L. monocytogenes was set into power and only negative lots were released for delivery. We combined the active food lot controls of food authorities with a Listeria environmental transmission mapping procedure. The environmental monitoring approach included 19 sampling activities during 3.5 years resulting in 1632 samples. This scheme allowed to trace and mitigate the Listeria contamination but did not jeopardize the processing of meat products. In total, 14 measures were set into power that reduced the overall Listeria occurrence after sanitation of 50-75 % (sampling event I, II) to 0.0-3.8 % (sampling events XIII to XIX). The outbreak-associated ST155/CT1234 clone was not detected in the third sampling event onwards but popped up during the sampling event VIII again. From then on, the outbreak clone ST155/CT1234 was no longer detected in the food business operator (FBO). We conclude that an intense combined investigation of food lots and environmental samples is needed to identify the source and verify that contamination levels are under control. Initially public health authorities suspected contamination of the slicer, but the monitoring approach has localized the source of ST155/CT1234 in a Schnitzel sorting machine. Other factors leading to the contamination scenario were inadequate conveyor belt hygiene. An inadequate crate washing system and an inadequate hygiene lock led to Listeria spreading between compartments. All transmission routes could be effectively interrupted. A root cause analysis and preventive maintenance program implemented in the FPE is mandatory for food processing facilities.",,2096
956,35974723,Neutron interference from a split-crystal interferometer.,"The first successful operation of a neutron interferometer with a separate beam-recombining crystal is reported. This result was achieved at the neutron interferometry setup S18 at the ILL in Grenoble by a collaboration between TU Wien, ILL, Grenoble, and INRIM, Torino. While previous interferometers have been machined out of a single-crystal block, in this work two crystals were successfully aligned on nanoradian and picometre scales, as required to obtain neutron interference. As a decisive proof-of-principle demonstration, this opens the door to a new generation of neutron interferometers and exciting applications.",,2097
325,35980404,Caregiver Perceptions Regarding Alternative Emergency Medical Services Dispositions for Children: A Cross-Sectional Survey Analysis.,"Emergency medical services (EMS) systems have developed alternative disposition processes for patients (including leaving the patient at the scene, using taxis, and transporting to clinics) vs taking patients directly to an emergency department (ED). Studies show that patients favorably support these alternative options but have not included the perspectives of caregivers of children. Our objective was to describe caregivers' views about these alternative disposition processes and analyze whether caregiver support is associated with sociodemographic factors. We surveyed a convenience sample of caregivers in a pediatric ED. We asked caregivers 15 questions based on a previously validated survey. We then conducted logistic regressions to determine whether sociodemographic factors were associated with levels of support. We enrolled 241 caregivers. The median age of their children was five years. The majority of respondents were non-Hispanic Black (57%) and had public insurance (65%). We found that a majority of respondents supported all alternative EMS disposition options. The overall level of agreement for survey questions ranged from 51-93%. We grouped questions by theme: non-transport; alternative destinations; communication with EMS physician; communication with primary care physician and sharing records; restricted EMS role; and shared decision-making. Regression analyses for each theme found that race/ethnicity, public insurance, and patient age were not significantly associated with the level of support. Most caregivers were supportive of alternative EMS disposition options for children with low-acuity complaints. Support did not vary significantly by respondent race/ethnicity, public insurance status, or patient age.",,2098

As effective therapies and prevention strategies are limited, there is an urgent need to elucidate the pathogenesis of SFTS. SFTSV has evolved several mechanisms to escape from host immunity. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms through which SFTSV escapes host immune responses, including the inhibition of innate immunity and evasion of adaptive immunity. Understanding the pathogenesis of SFTS will aid in the development of new strategies for the treatment of this disease.",,2099
2015,35967571,Discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors based on BCR-ABL1 monitoring by digital droplet PCR in pediatric chronic myeloid leukemia.,"Lifelong treatment of pediatric chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can affect their growth and development. For these reasons, clinical trials have explored the feasibility of TKI discontinuation in children with a sufficient TKI response. We evaluated the analytical performance of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to quantify BCR-ABL1 and compared the results with reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We further investigated whether ddPCR could be used to determine TKI discontinuation in a clinical setting. Performance of ddPCR was evaluated using standard materials for BCR-ABL1, and a total of 197 clinical samples from 45 pediatric CML patients was included for comparison with RT-qPCR. ddPCR showed excellent analytical sensitivity with 0.001% international scale (IS) and linearity with R 2 > 0.99 in log scale. BCR-ABL1 % IS results correlated well with those of RT-qPCR (R 2 = 0.9435), however, they showed a moderate strength for agreement with a Cohen's kappa of 0.41 due to higher sensitivity of ddPCR. Among 45 pediatric CML patients, 42 were treated with first-line TKIs including imatinib (n = 27, 64%) and dasatinib (n = 12, 29%), and three patients that were started with imatinib were switched to dasatinib. When we evaluated whether follow-up samples fulfilled ABL1 copies ≥ 10,000 required for deep molecular response (DMR), all samples were acceptable by ddPCR, whereas 18% by RT-qPCR did not reached acceptable ABL1 copies. Moreover, 52 and 13% reached ABL1 copies ≥ 32,000 required for MR4.5 by ddPCR and RT-qPCR, respectively. Seven patients discontinued TKI and the median TKI treatment duration was 73 months prior to discontinuation. Prior to discontinuation, the median duration of sustained undetected BCR-ABL1 was 60 months. Two patients experienced loss of major MR (MMR) during follow-up and restarted dasatinib 5 months after discontinuation. They achieved MMR again and maintained better than DMR afterward. Results from those patients demonstrated that RT-qPCR did not match the need for adequate ABL1 copies for MR4.5 while majority of ddPCR could. Therefore, ddPCR was technically more acceptable to decide and monitor pediatric CML patients before and after TKI discontinuation.",,2100
75,35983412,Incomplete Penetrance and Variable Expressivity: From Clinical Studies to Population Cohorts.,"The same genetic variant found in different individuals can cause a range of diverse phenotypes, from no discernible clinical phenotype to severe disease, even among related individuals. Such variants can be said to display incomplete penetrance, a binary phenomenon where the genotype either causes the expected clinical phenotype or it does not, or they can be said to display variable expressivity, in which the same genotype can cause a wide range of clinical symptoms across a spectrum. Both incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are thought to be caused by a range of factors, including common variants, variants in regulatory regions, epigenetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle. Many thousands of genetic variants have been identified as the cause of monogenic disorders, mostly determined through small clinical studies, and thus, the penetrance and expressivity of these variants may be overestimated when compared to their effect on the general population. With the wealth of population cohort data currently available, the penetrance and expressivity of such genetic variants can be investigated across a much wider contingent, potentially helping to reclassify variants that were previously thought to be completely penetrant. Research into the penetrance and expressivity of such genetic variants is important for clinical classification, both for determining causative mechanisms of disease in the affected population and for providing accurate risk information through genetic counseling. A genotype-based definition of the causes of rare diseases incorporating information from population cohorts and clinical studies is critical for our understanding of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. This review examines our current knowledge of the penetrance and expressivity of genetic variants in rare disease and across populations, as well as looking into the potential causes of the variation seen, including genetic modifiers, mosaicism, and polygenic factors, among others. We also considered the challenges that come with investigating penetrance and expressivity.",,2101
1449,35968449,"Proportion and associated factors of respectful maternity care during childbirth in North Showa zone public health institutions, North Showa, Ethiopia: An institutional-based cross-sectional study.","Respectful maternity care is one of the key strategies to increase access to use skilled maternity care services. However, limited studies are done about the extent of respectful maternity care during labor and delivery in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area. This study aimed to determine the proportion and identify the associated factors of respectful maternity care during childbirth among women who gave birth in North Showa zone public health institutions, North Showa zone, Ethiopia, 2020. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among women who got birth in North Showa public health institution from October 20 to November 20, 2020. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select study participants. Logistic regression with adjusted odds ratio and 95% uncertainty interval was used to declare statistically significant variables based on p < 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression model. The overall proportion of respectful maternity care during childbirth was 48.6 % (95% CI: 44.6-52.3%). Urban residence AOR = 2.6 (95% CI: 1.8, 3.6), being multiparous AOR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1, 2.3), having planned pregnancy AOR = 2.4 (95% CI: 1.3, 4.3) and giving birth in health center AOR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.2, 2.8) were statistically significant factors with respectful maternity care during labor and delivery. The proportion of respectful maternity care during childbirth is low. Being from an urban community, being multiparous, having planned pregnancy, and giving birth in a health center were factors that could increase the likely hood of women getting respectful maternity care during childbirth. Based on the identified factors strategies need to be designed and implemented to enhance the level of respectful maternity care.",,2102
1886,35967724,Chilean University Students' Satisfaction With Online Learning During COVID-19 Pandemic: Demonstrating the Two-Layer Methodology.,"Student satisfaction is a crucial determinant of success in online education, but studies on satisfaction with virtual classes during the COVID-19 outbreak are still scarce. This research contributes empirical evidence regarding the determinants of overall satisfaction with online classes and academic performance through the domain satisfaction approach. Additionally, we introduce to the psychological literature the two-layer model, a well-known econometric methodology, to estimate the effect of domain satisfaction while controlling the impact of unobserved individual differences. Our analyses are based on a cross-sectional sample of n = 648 Chilean university students (53.4% female) surveyed at the end of the first academic semester of 2021, during the lockdown mandated by the Chilean government due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that satisfaction with the support provided by the university, satisfaction with learning, and satisfaction with the perceived quality of the online classes significantly explain the 68% of the variance of satisfaction with the virtual classes experience. Furthermore, satisfaction with academic performance is significantly explained by satisfaction with grades, learning, and the perceived quality of the online classes (R2 = .65). We also explore heterogeneous effects, separating them by gender and geographic area, and find that domains that systematically impact students' satisfaction with online education are satisfaction with grades, learning, and the quality of classes.",,2103

More than 60% of respondents delayed family planning due to work. Pregnancy loss occurred in 36% of respondents, and 50% suffered a pregnancy complication. There were significant differences between specialists, with surgeons working longer hours before and after pregnancy, but having greater access to maternity leave than general practitioners. Female doctors delay starting and completing their family due to work-related demands and structural biases in career progression, which may result in higher infertility and pregnancy complication rates.",,2104
592,35977905,Clinical relevance of postoperative proteinuria for prediction of early renal outcomes after kidney transplantation.,"Proteinuria is associated with poor allograft and patient survival in kidney transplant recipients. However, the clinical relevance of spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) or albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) as predictors of renal outcomes during the early postoperative period following kidney transplantation (KT) has not been determined. This single-center retrospective cohort study included 353 kidney transplant recipients who underwent KT between 2014 and 2017 and were followed up for more than 3 years. Among them, 186 and 167 recipients underwent living donor KT and deceased donor KT, respectively. The PCR and ACR were measured during the immediate postoperative period (within 7 days postoperatively), before discharge (2-3 weeks postoperatively), and 3-6 months postoperatively. The median age of the patients was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-59 years), and 62.9% were male. An immediate postoperative PCR of ≥1 mg/mg was associated with old age, diabetes mellitus, high systolic blood pressure, delayed graft function, and donor factors (deceased donor KT, old age, and high serum creatinine concentrations). The PCR and ACR 3 to 6 months posttransplant were inversely associated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate at 1 year posttransplant. Deceased donor KT recipients with immediate postoperative PCR of ≥3 mg/mg showed a greater incidence of delayed graft function and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate before discharge than those with immediate postoperative PCR of <3 mg/mg. Early postoperative proteinuria is a useful biomarker to predict early renal outcomes after KT.",,2105
1139,35973863,Optimal value of lymph node ratio and metastatic lymph node size to predict risk of recurrence in pediatric thyroid cancer with lateral neck metastasis.,"No specific guideline exists for risk stratification based on lymph node (LN) status in pediatric thyroid cancer. The purpose of our study is to identify optimal values of lymph node ratio (LNR) and largest metastatic LN size for predicting recurrent/persistent disease, especially in children with lateral neck metastasis (N1b). We conducted a retrospective study from January 1997 to June 2018 at Samsung Medical Center. A total of 50 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients who underwent total thyroidectomy + both central neck dissection (CND) + modified radical neck dissection (MRND) (unilateral or bilateral) was enrolled. The median follow-up duration was 60.8 months (range, 6.2-247 months). The mean age was 14.6 years, and the mean tumor size was 2.9 cm. Mean size of the largest metastatic LN was 1.5 cm. Mean value of central LNR was 0.6, and mean value of lateral LNR was 0.3. Largest metastatic LN size [HR = 2.0 (95% CI 1.0-4.0), p = 0.040] and lateral LNR [HR = 43.6 (95% CI 2.2-871.0), p = 0.014] were significant prognostic factors for recurrence. The optimal combination of lateral LNR and largest metastatic LN size to predict recurrence were 0.3 and 2.5 cm, respectively, with the largest AUC (AUC at 60 months = 77.4) and significant p-value (p = 0.009 and p = 0.021) (Table 3). Kaplan-Meier curves showed significant differences in recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates among four groups (Fig. 2A,2B). In pediatric PTC patients with N1b, lateral LNR and largest metastatic LN size are significant predictors for recurrence. Children with lateral LNR > 0.3 or any metastatic lymph node > 2.5 cm in the largest dimension have higher risk for recurrence. Children are classified as extensive N1b if lateral LNR > 0.3 or pathologic N1 with largest LN size > 2.5 cm, and vice versa.",,2106
1847,35967793,Home enteral nutrition for patients with esophageal cancer undergoing esophagectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Home enteral nutrition (HEN) is a relatively new nutritional intervention that provides patients with EN support at home through jejunostomy or nasogastric feeding tubes. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the safety and effect of HEN compared with normal oral diet (NOD) in postoperative patients with esophageal cancer (EC). EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were used to search articles in English-language journals. The intervention effect was expressed using risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcome measures, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The chi-square test and I-square test were used to test heterogeneity among studies. Four studies were eventually included in this meta-analysis. Compared with NOD, HEN has a favorable impact on postoperative body mass index (BMI) (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.09-1.30, P = 0.02), lean body mass (LBM) (WMD = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.04-1.48, P = 0.04), and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) (WMD = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.02-0.58, P = 0.03). Physical function (WMD = 9.26, 95% CI: 8.00-10.53, P < 0.001), role function (WMD = 9.96, 95% CI: 8.11-11.82, P < 0.001), and social function (WMD = 8.51, 95% CI: 3.48-13.54, P = 0.001) of the HEN group were better than those of the NOD group at 3 months, and HEN could reduce the fatigue of patients (WMD = -12.73, 95% CI: -14.8 to -10.66, P < 0.001) and the incidence of postoperative pneumonia (RR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.34-0.81, P = 0.004). There was no significant difference in albumin between HEN and NOD groups (WMD = 0.05, 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.13, P = 0.20). HEN improved nutritional status and quality of life (QOL) in postoperative patients with EC and reduced fatigue and the incidence of postoperative pneumonia. All in all, the results of our meta-analysis support the use of HEN after esophagectomy.",,2107
320,35980413,A Qualitative Study of What Matters to Older Adults in the Emergency Department.,"The 4Ms model - What Matters, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility - is increasingly gaining attention in age-friendly health systems, yet a feasible approach to identifying what matters to older adults in the emergency department (ED) is lacking. Adapting the What Matters questions to the ED setting, we sought to describe the concerns and desired outcomes of both older adult patients seeking ED care and their treating clinicians. We conducted 46 dyadic semi-structured interviews of cognitively intact older adults and their treating clinicians. We used the What Matters conversation guide to explore patients' 1) concerns and 2) desired outcomes. We then asked analogous questions to each patient's treating clinician regarding the patient's priorities. Interviews were professionally transcribed and coded using an inductive approach of thematic analysis to identify emergent themes. Interviews with older adults lasted a mean of three minutes, with a range of 1-8 minutes. Regarding patients' concerns, five themes emerged from older adults: 1) concern through a family member or outpatient clinician recommendation; 2) no concern, with a high degree of trust in the healthcare system; 3) concerns regarding symptom cause identification; 4) concerns regarding symptom resolution; and 5) concerns regarding preservation of their current status. Regarding desired outcomes, five priority themes emerged among older adults: 1) obtaining a diagnosis; 2) returning to their home environment; 3) reducing or resolving symptoms; 4) maintaining self-care and independence; and 5) gaining reassurance. Responding to what they believed mattered most to older adult patients, ED clinicians believed that older adults were concerned primarily about symptom cause identification and resolution and primarily desired a return to the home environment and symptom reduction. This work identifies concerns and desired outcomes of both older adult patients seeking ED care and their treating clinicians as well as the feasibility of incorporating the What Matters questions within ED clinical practice.",,2108

2199,35967319,A novel aGAPSS-based nomogram for the prediction of ischemic stroke in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is the most common and life-threatening arterial manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). It is related to high mortality and severe permanent disability in survivors. Thus, it is essential to identify patients with APS at high risk of IS and adopt individual-level preventive measures. This study was conducted to identify risk factors for IS in patients with APS and to develop a nomogram specifically for IS prediction in these patients by combining the adjusted Global Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome Score (aGAPSS) with additional clinical and laboratory data. A total of 478 consecutive patients with APS were enrolled retrospectively. All patients were randomly assigned to the training and validation cohorts. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic analyses were conducted to identify predictors of IS in the training cohort. Then, a nomogram was developed based on these predictors. The predictive performance of the nomogram for the training and validation cohorts was evaluated by determining areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and creating calibration plots. A decision curve analysis (DCA) was conducted to compare the potential net benefits of the nomogram with those of the aGAPSS. During a mean follow-up period of 2.7 years, 26.9% (129/478) of the patients were diagnosed with IS. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that five risk factors were independent clinical predictors of IS: age (P < 0.001), diabetes (P = 0.030), hyperuricemia (P < 0.001), the platelet count (P = 0.001), and the aGAPSS (P = 0.001). These predictors were incorporated into the nomogram, named the aGAPSS-IS. The nomogram showed satisfactory performance in the training [AUROC = 0.853 (95% CI, 0.802-0.896] and validation [AUROC = 0.793 (95% CI, 0.737-0.843)] cohorts. Calibration curves showed good concordance between observed and nomogram-predicted probability in the training and validation cohorts. The DCA confirmed that the aGAPSS-IS provided more net benefits than the aGAPSS in both cohorts. Age, diabetes, hyperuricemia, the platelet count, and the aGAPSS were risk factors for IS in patients with APS. The aGAPSS-IS may be a good tool for IS risk stratification for patients with APS based on routinely available data.",,2110

However, various defects in graphene produced during synthesis or fabrication hinder its performance for applications such as electronic devices, transparent electrodes, and spintronic devices. Due to its intrinsic bandgap and nonmagnetic nature, it cannot be used in nanoelectronics or spintronics. Intrinsic and extrinsic defects are ultimately introduced to tailor electronic and magnetic properties and take advantage of their hidden potential. This article emphasizes the current advancement of intrinsic and extrinsic defects in graphene for potential applications.

1165,35973386,Adherence and discontinuation rates in patients on Tecfidera™ (dimethyl fumarate): Long-term Canadian experience from the Biogen ONE™ support program.,"Tecfidera™ (dimethyl fumarate [DMF]; Biogen) is an oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) indicated in Canada for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Biogen ONE™, an ongoing Canadian support program, facilitates access to DMF for patients with MS and maintains a database for the purposes of service provision. These data were utilized to assess adherence, persistence, discontinuations, and other outcomes between 2013 and 2021. This non-interventional, retrospective study examined real-world use of DMF prescribed to patients with MS in Canada who were enrolled in the program and received their first dose between April 1, 2013, and June 30, 2021. Follow-up visits and laboratory monitoring occurred based on local standards and per the Canadian product monograph. For adherence and persistence assessments, patients must have had DMF dispensed by specialty pharmacies. Data were collected at patient enrollment, program exit, and throughout the duration of the program. The primary objective was to assess treatment adherence rates to DMF. Secondary objectives included treatment persistence rates, reasons for discontinuation, absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs), and patient characteristics throughout the duration of the program. Overall, 12,608 DMF patients from the program were included between April 1, 2013, and June 30, 2021. At enrollment, mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 40.6 (10.7) years and mean (SD) Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was 2.2 (1.4). DMF was initiated as first-line DMT in 48.8% of patients. Of patients assessed (n = 6,848), 90.4% were adherent to DMF (based on medication possession ratio [MPR] ≥ 80%). Adherence (mean MPR) was marginally greater in DMT-naïve than switch patients, and in younger (< 40 years) than older (≥ 40 years) patients (both p < 0.001). Overall persistence on DMF at 24 months was 57.0%. Greater proportions of DMT-naïve patients persisted on DMF versus switch patients at all time points assessed. Persistence rates were comparable between female and male patients for up to 24 months, and between younger (< 40 years) and older (≥ 40 years) patients for up to 36 months. Older patients were more likely to discontinue for reasons related to lymphocytes (≥ 40 years, 16.1% vs. < 40 years, 6.1%) while efficacy reasons were reported with greater frequency in younger patients (≥ 40 years, 10.5% vs. < 40 years, 16.0%). Discontinuations due to gastrointestinal and flushing events occurred most frequently during the first month of treatment and decreased thereafter. Mean ALC decreased during the first year on treatment and subsequently plateaued. Over successive years, changes were observed in characteristics of patients starting on DMF, including decreases in EDSS score, age, and time since diagnosis. The proportion of DMT-naïve patients increased over the years (2013-2014, 26%-27%; 2018-2021, 62%-67%). High adherence was found in patients on DMF treatment within the Biogen support program with access to specialty pharmacies. The evolution of the patient population throughout the years suggests a shift towards earlier treatment. These real-world data may support the value of a support program in optimizing the management of patients on DMF treatment. Support programs provide personalized treatment monitoring, which can help minimize early discontinuations and improve adherence to treatment.",,2113
2051,35967524,Post Covishield (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) Vaccination: New Onset Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis Resistant to Steroid and Calcineurin Inhibitor.,"With the ongoing mass COVID vaccination program, various case reports link the COVID-19 vaccines with heightened off-target immune responses leading to de novo development or relapse of various glomerular diseases. Very few glomerular diseases (totally nine published cases to date) have been reported post ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccination compared to more potent m RNA vaccine. In this case report, we present a case of de novo focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) post ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination resistant to steroid and calcineurin inhibitor treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first case of FSGS tip variant reported after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination and the second de novo FSGS case post COVID vaccination (any types of COVID vaccines). We may expect more such types of cases resistant to conventional therapy as the global penetration of vaccination programs will improve.",,2114

2394,35966978,Mesentery in Transanal TME.,"Oncological adequacy in rectal cancer surgery mandates not only a clear distal and circumferential resection margin but also resection of the entire ontogenetic mesorectal package. Incomplete removal of the mesentery is one of the commonest causes of local recurrences. The completeness of the resection is not only determined by tumor and patient related factors but also by the patient-tailored treatment selected by the multidisciplinary team. This is performed in the context of the technical ability and experience of the surgeon to ensure an optimal total mesorectal excision (TME). In TME, popularized by Professor Heald in the early 1980s as a sharp dissection through the avascular embryologic plane, the midline pedicle of tumor and mesorectum is separated from the surrounding, mostly paired structures of the retroperitoneum. Although TME significantly improved the oncological and functional results of rectal cancer surgery, the difficulty of the procedure is still mainly dependent on and determined by the dissection of the most distal part of the rectum and mesorectum. To overcome some of the limitations of working in the narrowest part of the pelvis, robotic and transanal surgery have been shown to improve the access and quality of resection in minimally invasive techniques. Whatever technique is chosen to perform a TME, embryologically derived planes and anatomical points of reference should be identified to guide the surgery. Standardization of the chosen technique, widespread education, and training of surgeons, as well as caseloads per surgeon, are important factors to optimize outcomes. In this article, we discuss the introduction of transanal TME, with emphasis on the mesentery, relevant anatomy, standard procedural steps, and importance of a training pathway.",,2116
836,35974935,Post-neurosurgical meningitis; gram negative bacilli vs. gram positive cocci.,"Post-neurosurgical meningitis is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity. In this study we aimed to compare the differences of clinical, laboratory features and outcomes between the post-neurosurgical meningitis caused by gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and gram-positive cocci (GPC). Cases of post-neurosurgical meningitis (with positive CSF culture) were included. After classifying patients as GNB and GPC groups, clinical and paraclinical data were compared. Out of 2667 neurosurgical patients, CSF culture was positive in 45 patients. 25 (54.3%) were GNB, 19 (41.3%) GPC. The most common microorganisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=14, 31.1%), Coagulase negative staphylococcus (n=8, 17.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (n=6, 13.3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=4, 8.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=2, 4.4%), and Escherichia coli (n=2, 4.4%). There were no correlation between CSF Leakage, Surgical site appearance, presence of drain, Age and GCS between two groups (P=0.11, P=0.28, P=0.06, P=0.86, P=0.11 respectively). The only different laboratory indexes were ESR (86.8 mm/h vs. 59.5 mm/h, P=0.01) and PCT (13.1 ng/ml vs. 0.8 ng/ml, P=0.02) which were higher in GNB cases. 20% (n=5) of patients with GNB meningitis received preoperative corticosteroid, while none of GPC cases received (P=0.03). The median length of hospitalization for GNB and GPC cases was 56 and 44.4 days respectively (P=0.3). The GNB antibiotic coverage should be designed more carefully in post-neurosurgical meningitis especially in patients with recent corticosteroid therapy and elevated ESR and procalcitonin.",,2117

NTHL1 tumor syndrome (NTS) is an autosomal recessive genetic condition. Little is known about the cancer risk in patients who have heterozygous NTHL1 mutations. We previously published a case of benign tumors associated with a heterozygous NTHL1 mutation. In this second case, we present a patient with a heterozygous NTHL1 mutation who developed a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, pilocytic astrocytoma, tall cell papillary thyroid cancer, invasive ductal papilloma, spinal nerve sheath tumors, and spinal hemangiomas.

406,35979268,Intraoperative Colonoscopy in Laparoscopic Rectal Cancer Surgery Reduces Anastomotic Leakage.,"Anastomotic leakage (AL) is the most severe complication of colorectal surgery and is a frequent cause of postoperative mortality. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for AL, including the type of air leak test (ALT) performed, in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. This study involved a retrospective review of 201 patients who underwent elective laparoscopic procedures using circular stapled anastomosis for colorectal cancer between January 2015 and December 2020 at Kyorin University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. In all cases, the distance from the anal verge to the anastomotic site was within 15 cm. Overall, AL was observed in 16 patients (8.0%). Univariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for AL included diabetes (P = 0.068), tumor location (P = 0.049), level of anastomosis (P = 0.002), number of linear stapler firings (P = 0.007), and intraoperative colonoscopy (IOCS; P = 0.069). Multivariate analysis revealed that the level of anastomosis (P = 0.029) and IOCS (P = 0.039) were significant and independent risk factors for AL. One of the 107 patients undergoing ALT without IOCS and 3 of the 94 patients undergoing ALT with IOCS were proven to be positive for air leak. However, these four patients underwent additional suturing intraoperatively and developed no AL following surgery. This study identified the level of anastomosis and ALT with IOCS as predictors for AL. The results of our study indicate that ALT with IOCS may be more effective than ALT without IOCS in the diagnosis and prevention of AL.",,2119
1910,35967699,Construction of self-learning classroom history teaching mode based on human-computer interaction emotion recognition.,"Due to the continuous epidemic in recent years, the traditional teaching mode of history classroom has been gradually replaced by the teaching mode of self-learning classroom. The teaching mode of autonomous learning classroom has become a popular teaching mode in recent years. However, in the autonomous learning classroom under the current history teaching mode, the lecturer cannot always pay attention to the various states of the students. It is also difficult to understand and receive the information the teacher wants to convey in real time. For this reason, human-computer interaction emotion recognition technology has been proposed and developed. In order to construct and realize the teaching mode of self-learning classroom history, this paper studies the emotion recognition technology of human-computer interaction. The research results show that the introduction of human-computer interaction emotion recognition technology into the construction of autonomous learning classroom teaching mode can fully understand students' emotional behavior. It improves the accuracy of students' emotion recognition by 2.67%, enables students to maintain a good learning motivation, and make reasonable plans and arrangements for the historical time and progress of learning. At the same time, it enhances the history teaching intensity and autonomous learning ability, and improves the original single learning mode. By establishing a new teaching-teacher-student relationship, it creates a good and active autonomous classroom atmosphere.",,2120
2278,35967153,The Association Between Electronic Cigarette Use During Pregnancy and Unfavorable Birth Outcomes.,"Introduction and objective While the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) continues to gain popularity amongst consumers, literature focusing on the safety and risks of e-cigarette usage remains scarce. Literature focused on the potential effects of e-cigarette use on fetal development is particularly limited. The objective of this study is to investigate the association between the use of e-cigarettes during pregnancy and unfavorable birth outcomes. Methods A retrospective cohort using secondary data analysis was conducted from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) 2016-2017 Phase 8 survey. This database contains both state-specific and population-based information on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. Female participants in the study were initially found through each state's birth certificate file. Eligible women included those who have had a recent live birth. Data collection procedures and instruments were standardized to allow comparisons between states. The independent variable was self-reported use of any e-cigarette products during pregnancy. The dependent variable was dichotomized into the presence of at least one unfavorable birth outcome (preterm birth, low birth weight, or extended postnatal hospital stay for the newborn) or the absence of all. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results A total of 71,940 women were included in our study. After adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, insurance, maternal education, prenatal care, physical abuse during pregnancy, and complications during pregnancy, the odds of unfavorable birth outcomes increase by 62% among women who reported e-cigarette use during pregnancy versus women who did not (aOR 1.62, 95%CI 1.16-2.26, p-value 0.005). Conclusions/implications Moving forward, it is imperative for consumers to understand the implications of using e-cigarettes, such as the increased risk of unfavorable birth outcomes associated with use during pregnancy. Moreover, healthcare providers, particularly obstetricians, should be encouraged to communicate this novel information to at-risk patients. Overall, researchers must continue to study the long-term effects of e-cigarettes, including those on fetal development, as there is still much to be uncovered.",,2121
1270,35971345,Saved by the Scan: A Case of Early Detection of Sarcomatoid Mesothelioma.,"We report a case of localized sarcomesothelioma detected during screening via a low-dose CT (LDCT) scan. The patient is a 71-year-old female, a current 56-pack-year cigarette smoker with a past medical history of myocardial infarction and stroke with a Zubrod score of zero. A screening LDCT revealed a 1.9 cm × 1.8 cm × 1.4 cm right lower lobe lesion with smooth margins and close association with the hemidiaphragm. A wedge resection with biopsy showed high-grade sarcomatoid mesothelioma with extensive desmoplastic morphology and negative margins. The patient opted for imaging surveillance, and at 12 months has shown no evidence of tumor recurrence on positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. The case shows that LDCT screening discovers cancers and saves lives. It also presented a dilemma for the patient and her oncologist because common guidelines do not define a recommended treatment.",,2122

1589,35968295,Combining modified Graeb score and intracerebral hemorrhage score to predict poor outcome in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage undergoing surgical treatment.,"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) is a frequently encountered neurosurgical disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between modified Graeb Score (mGS) at admission and clinical outcomes of sICH and to investigate whether the combination of ICH score could improve the accuracy of outcome prediction. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 511 patients who underwent surgery for sICH between January 2017 and June 2021. Patient outcome was evaluated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at 3 months following sICH, where a GOS score of 1-3 was defined as a poor prognosis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine risk factors for unfavorable clinical outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to detect the optimal cutoff value of mGS for predicting clinical outcomes. An ICH score combining mGS was created, and the performance of the ICH score combining mGS was assessed for discriminative ability. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a higher mGS score was an independent predictor for poor prognosis (odds ratio [OR] 1.207, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.130-1.290, p < 0.001). In ROC analysis, an optimal cutoff value of mGS to predict the clinical outcome at 3 months after sICH was 11 (p < 0.001). An increasing ICH-mGS score was associated with increased poor functional outcome. Combining ICH score with mGS resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.790, p < 0.001. mGS was an independent risk factor for poor outcome and it had an additive predictive value for outcome in patients with sICH. Compared with the ICH score and mGS alone, the ICH score combined with mGS revealed a significantly higher discriminative ability for predicting postoperative outcome.",,2124
1412,35968490,Environmental scan of COVID-19 infection dashboards in the Florida public school system.,"Public dashboards have been one of the most effective tools to provide critical information about COVID-19 cases during the pandemic. However, dashboards for COVID-19 that have not received a lot of scrutiny are those from the public school system. We conducted an environmental scan of published dashboards that report and track new COVID-19 infections in the Florida public school system. We found that thirty-four percent of counties do not provide any public dashboard, and there was significant heterogeneity in the data quality and framework of existing systems. There were poor interfaces without visual tools to trace the trend of COVID-19 cases in public schools and significant limitations for data extraction. Given these observations, it is impossible to conduct meaningful policy evaluations and proper surveillance. Additional work and oversight are needed to improve public data reported.",,2125
407,35979253,Adenoma Recurrence after Endoscopic Piecemeal Mucosal Resection of Colorectal Flat Lesions: Applicability of the Sydney EMR Recurrence Tool in a Non-Tertiary Centre.,"Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is the treatment of choice for non-invasive colorectal flat lesions. When endoscopic piecemeal mucosal resection (EPMR) is performed, endoscopic surveillance is necessary due to the risk of recurrence. The Sydney EMR Recurrence Tool (SERT) is a 0-4 scale that classifies lesions according to size, occurrence of intraprocedural bleeding (IPB) and presence of high-grade dysplasia (HGD). Our goal is to evaluate the applicability of SERT in predicting adenoma recurrence (AR) after EPMR. This is a retrospective single-centre study with inclusion of lateral spreading lesions ≥20 mm, consecutively resected by EPMR from March 2010 to February 2018, with at least 1 endoscopic re-evaluation. A total of 181 lesions were included, corresponding to 174 patients with a mean age of 68 years and male gender predominance (61%; n = 106). The most frequent location was the ascending colon (34%; n = 62). Lesions were assessed according to Paris Classification (PC): 0-IIa: 39% (n = 71); 0-IIb: 24% (n = 43); 0-IIa + Is: 23% (n = 42); 0-IIa + IIb: 6% (n = 11); 0-IIa + IIc: 2% (n = 3). The mean size of the lesions was 33 ± 11 mm, with 25 (14%) being ≥40 mm. IPB occurred in 9 cases (5%), and 44 lesions (24%) displayed HGD. Sixty-six lesions (36.5%) were classified as SMSA (size, morphology, site, and access score) level 4. Adjunctive therapy with argon plasma coagulation (APC) was used in 37% (n = 67) of cases. The 6-month AR rate was 16% (n = 29). According to SERT groups, the AR rate was: SERT 0: 12% (14/120); SERT 1: 17% (6/35); SERT 2: 25% (3/12); SERT 3: 30% (3/10); SERT 4: 75% (3/4). Two of the three SERT variables (size ≥40 mm and IPB) were associated with recurrence at 6 months (p < 0.05). HGD and the remaining tested variables (age, gender, localization, accessibility, PC, use of APC/biopsy forceps and occurrence of delayed bleeding) were not associated with AR. SERT 0 lesions showed an inferior risk of 6-month AR (adjusted OR = 2.62; p = 0.035), with a negative predictive value of 88%. SMSA correlated with SERT (p < 0.001) and SMSA level 4 was associated with 6-month AR (p = 0.007). Lesions classified both as SERT 0 and SMSA level <4 had the lowest 6-month recurrence rate (9.2%). The 24-month recurrence rate was 23% (n = 41). When applying the Kaplan-Meier method, cumulative recurrence was significantly lower in SERT 0 lesions (p = 0.006, log-rank test). Resection of flat colorectal lesions by EPMR has a considerable risk of recurrence, mostly in SERT 1-4 lesions. SERT 0 lesions, especially with SMSA level <4, show a lower risk of recurrent adenoma, which might allow longer intervals to first endoscopic surveillance in the future. A mucosectomia endoscópica é a terapêutica de eleição nas lesões colorretais planas não invasivas e, quando fragmentada, obriga a vigilância endoscópica, dado o risco de recorrência. O Sydney Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Recurrence Tool (SERT) é uma escala de 0 a 4 que classifica as lesões em função da dimensão, ocorrência de hemorragia imediata na sua excisão (HI) e presença de displasia de alto grau (DAG). Pretende-se avaliar a aplicabilidade do SERT na predição de adenoma recorrente (AR) após mucosectomia fragmentada. Estudo retrospetivo unicêntrico com inclusão de todas as lesões planas ≥20 mm excisadas por mucosectomia fragmentada, entre Março/2010 e Fevereiro/2018, com pelo menos uma vigilância endoscópica. Incluídas 181 lesões, correspondentes a 174 doentes com idade média de 68 anos e predomínio do sexo masculino (61%; n = 106). A localização mais frequente foi o cólon ascendente (34%; n = 62). As lesões foram avaliadas segundo a classificação de Paris (CP): 0-IIa: 39% (n = 71); 0-IIb: 24% (n = 43); 0-IIa + Is: 23% (n = 42); 0-IIa + IIb: 6% (n = 11); 0-IIa + IIc: 2% (n = 3). O tamanho médio foi 33 ± 11 mm, tendo 25 (14%) dimensões ≥40 mm. Verificou-se HI em 9 casos (5%) e DAG em 44 (24%). O nível SMSA (size, morphology, site, and access score) foi 4 em 66 lesões (36.5%). Realizou-se terapêutica com árgon plasma (APC) em 37% (n = 67) dos casos.A taxa de AR aos 6 meses foi: SERT 0: 12% (14/120); SERT 1: 17% (6/35); SERT 2: 25% (3/12); SERT 3: 30% (3/10); SERT 4: 75% (3/4); global: 16% (29/181). O AR aos 6 meses associou-se à dimensão ≥40 mm e à HI (p < 0.05). A DAG não mostrou relação com a recorrência, assim como a idade, sexo, localização, acessibilidade, CP, terapêutica adju-adjuvante (APC/pinça de biópsias) e ocorrência de hemorragia tardia. As lesões SERT 0 apresentaram menor risco de AR aos 6 meses (OR ajustado = 2.62; p = 0.035), com um valor preditivo negativo de 88%. O SMSA correlacionou-se com o SERT (p < 0.001), estando o nível SMSA 4 associado à recorrência aos 6 meses (p = 0.007). As lesões classificadas como SERT 0 e nível SMSA <4 apresentaram a menor taxa de AR (9.2%). A taxa de recorrência aos 24 meses foi 23% (n = 41). Aplicando o método de Kaplan Meier, a recorrência cumulativa foi menor nas lesões SERT 0 (p = 0.006, teste log-rank). A excisão de lesões planas por mucosectomia fragmentada apresenta uma taxa de recorrência considerável, sobretudo em lesões SERT 1–4. As lesões SERT 0, particularmente se nível SMSA <4, apresentam menor risco de recidiva, o que poderá possibilitar um prolongamento do intervalo até à primeira vigilância endoscópica.",,2126

Such measurements are made in dense sampling networks to assess regulatory compliance and for source apportionment. Thus, quantifying sampling artefacts is crucial. In this study, 24-h integrated PM2.5 samples collected over Bhopal, India a COALESCE (CarbOnaceous AerosoL Emissions, Source apportionment and ClimatE impacts) site during 2019 and 2020, were used to estimate particulate organic carbon (OC) artefacts. Total OC and its thermal fractions (OC1, OC2, OC3, and OC4) measured on 349 bare quartz (Q) and QbQ filters each, were used to determine OC positive artefacts on quartz filters. 50 QbT (Quartz behind Teflon) filters in conjunction with the simultaneous QbQ samples (a subset of the total QbQ) were used to estimate OC volatilization from Teflon filters. On average, adsorbed gaseous OC contributed 17% and 11% to the measured total OC during 2019 and 2020, respectively. Further, the volatilization loss of organics from Teflon filter (used to quantify PM2.5 mass) ranged between 7% and 9%, and 5% and 6% of the PM2.5 mass during 2019 and 2020, respectively. The results of this study provide the first systematic long-term evaluation of thermal carbon fraction-wise sampling artefacts, estimates of organic volatilization losses from Teflon filters and their implications to PM2.5 mass closure, over a regionally representative location in India.",,2127
1239,35971377,Intergovernmentalism and the crisis of representative democracy: The case for creating a system of horizontally expanded and overlapping national democracies.,"Technocratic intergovernmentalism has undermined the preconditions for its own success as a democratic project of transnational cooperation. It has triggered populist reactions within nation states and helped to discredit the intermediary institutions (parties and parliaments) that connect democratic will-formation and joint decision-making. This rise of populism and its alignment with nationalism, in consequence, hampers joint decision-making in the international realm. We argue that representative democracies can overcome the negative spiral between technocratic intergovernmentalism and nationalist populism by mutually granting their citizens the right to elect representatives not only in their domestic parliament, but also in the parliaments of 'consociated democracies'. Such a system of horizontally expanded and overlapping national democracies can serve three functions: it re-empowers citizens in a world of cross-border flows, it curbs the self-destructive polarization of party systems and it facilitates cooperation among democracies within the European Union (EU) and beyond. Finally, we discuss three competing approaches: Liberal Multilateralism, Deliberative Transnationalism and Republican Intergovernmentalism. We point to common ground, but also show how our approach avoids their main pitfalls.",,2128
1485,35968407,Towards smart surveillance as an aftereffect of COVID-19 outbreak for recognition of face masked individuals using YOLOv3 algorithm.,"The eruption of COVID-19 pandemic has led to the blossoming usage of face masks among individuals in the communal settings. To prevent the transmission of the virus, a mandatory mask-wearing rule in public areas has been enforced. Owing to the use of face masks in communities at different workplaces, an effective surveillance seems essential because several security analyses indicate that face masks may be used as a tool to hide the identity. Therefore, this work proposes a framework for the development of a smart surveillance system as an aftereffect of COVID-19 for recognition of individuals behind the face mask. For this purpose, transfer learning approach has been employed to train the custom dataset by YOLOv3 algorithm in the Darknet neural network framework. Moreover, to demonstrate the competence of YOLOv3 algorithm, a comparative analysis with YOLOv3-tiny has been presented. The simulated results verify the robustness of YOLOv3 algorithm in the recognition of individuals behind the face mask. Also, YOLOv3 algorithm achieves a mAP of 98.73% on custom dataset, outperforming YOLOv3-tiny by approximately 62%. Moreover, YOLOv3 algorithm provides adequate speed and accuracy on small faces.",,2129
306,35980632,Community Conversations About COVID-19.,"Community Conversations About COVID-19 was a multi-group program designed to address the need for culturally sensitive health information about COVID-19 for Latinx and Native American communities. Three medical librarians worked closely with Latinx and/or Spanish-speaking promotores, also known as community health workers (CHWs), and native patient navigators (NPNs) from Native American communities in Tucson, Arizona. In addition, the librarians collaborated with second-year medical students from the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix. The focus was to train the CHWs, NPNs, and students on how to access health information resources from the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other reliable agencies. The second segment of the program provided the opportunity for the groups to learn from each other's experiences working with health information through this pandemic, which is especially important given the fact the CHWs and NPNs live in, care for, and were brought up in these communities.",,2130
739,35975111,The negative impact of the COVID-19 on renewable energy growth in developing countries: Underestimated.,"According to the United Nations Environment Programme, the COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges for the economy and the energy sector, as well as uncertainty for the renewable energy industry. However, the impact on renewable energy during the pandemic has not been consistently determined. Instead of relying on data from year-to-year comparisons, this study redesigned the analytical framework for assessing the impact of a pandemic on renewable energy. First, this research designed an initial prediction-parameter training-error correction-assignment combination forecasting approach to simulate renewable energy consumption in a no pandemic scenario. Second, this study calculates the difference between the pandemic and no pandemic scenarios for renewable energy consumption. This difference represents the change in renewable energy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Various techniques such as nonlinear grey, artificial neural network and IOWGA operator were incorporated. The MAPEs were controlled to within 5% in 80% of the country samples. The conclusions indicated that renewable energy in China and India declined by 8.57 mtoe and 3.19 mtoe during COVID-19 period. In contrast, the rise in renewable energy in the US is overestimated by 8.01 mtoe. Overall, previous statistics based on year-to-year comparisons have led to optimistic estimates of renewable energy development during the pandemic. This study sheds light on the need for proactive policy measures in the future to counter the global low tide of renewable energy amid COVID-19.",,2131

We present and discuss the findings of the most relevant epidemiological studies on keratoconus and describe its characteristics and risk factors, correlating them with its pathogenesis.",,2132
280,35981940,Timely orchiopexy by 18 months of age: Are we meeting the standards defined by the 2014 AUA guidelines?,"Cryptorchidism is one of the most common reasons for pediatric urology referral and one of the few pediatric urologic conditions in which there are established AUA guidelines that recommend orchiopexy be performed before 18 months of age. While access to timely orchiopexy has been studied previously, there is no current study with data from a national clinical database evaluating timely orchiopexy after the AUA guidelines were published. Additionally, prior studies on delayed orchiopexy may have included patients with an ascended testis, which is a distinct population from those with true undescended testicles. To evaluate in a national, clinical database if timely orchiopexy improved after the AUA guidelines were published in 2014. In particular, we aim to evaluate a younger group of patients, 0-5 years of age, in an effort to account for potential ascending testes. Using Cerner Real-World Data™, a national, de-identified database of 153 million individuals, we analyzed pediatric patients undergoing orchiopexy in the United States from 2000 to 2021. We included males 0-18 years old and further focused on the subset 0-5 years. Primary outcome was timely orchiopexy, defined as age at orchiopexy less than 18 months. Predictor variables included race, ethnicity and insurance status. Statistical analyses were performed using logistic regression. Of the total 17,012 individuals identified as undergoing orchiopexy, 9274 were ages 0-5 at the time of surgery. Comparing time periods pre and post AUA guidelines (2000-2014 versus 2015-2021), we found a significant difference in the proportion of timely orchiopexy (51% versus 56%, respectively; p < 0.0001) (Figure). In multivariable analyses, Hispanic (OR = 0.65, p < 0.0001), African American (OR = 0.74, p < 0.0001), and Native American males (OR = 0.66, p = 0.008) were less likely to have timely orchiopexy compared to non-Hispanic White males. Individuals without insurance (OR = 0.81, p = 0.03) or with public insurance (OR = 0.88, p = 0.02) were less likely to have timely orchiopexy as compared to those with private insurance. Nearly a decade after publication of the AUA cryptorchidism guidelines, a large proportion of patients are still not undergoing orchiopexy by 18 months of age. This is the first study to show that timely orchiopexy has improved among patients 0-5 years, but the majority of patients are still not undergoing timely orchiopexy. Health disparities were apparent among Hispanic, African American, Native American, and uninsured males, highlighting the need for further progress in access to pediatric surgical care.",,2133
1765,35967959,Endopelvic Fascia Sparing Robotic Radical Cystectomy with Intracorporeal Studer Pouch with Balbay's Technique.,"Robotic radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal urinary diversion is a technically complicated, time-consuming procedure. The aim of this study was to present the operative, pathological, oncological, and functional outcomes of patients who underwent endopelvic fascia sparing (EPFS) RARC with intracorporeal Studer pouch formation. To the best of our knowledge, this is first series in the literature that includes EPFS RARC. Between October 1, 2019 and April 30, 2022, 10 bladder cancer patients underwent EPFS RARC, bilateral extended pelvic lymph node dissection with intracorporeal Studer pouch reconstruction with Balbay's technique. Patient demographics, operative, and post-operative parameters were recorded. Among 10 patients, 8 were male and 2 were female. Mean operative time, median estimated blood loss, and median duration of hospital stay was 530 minutes, 316 ml, and 8 days, respectively. One month postoperatively, the mean maximum flow, average flow rate, mean voided, and post-voided urine volume were 20.2 ml/sec, 4.4 ml/sec, 273.6 ml, and 3.5 ml, respectively. All of the patients were fully continent during day-time, three had mild night-time incontinence requiring pad use (both patients 1 pad per night). During a mean 11.5 months of follow up, zero patients died. One patient with a pathological, stage 4 tumor, had nodal recurrence at six months postoperatively. No distant metastasis were detected. Endopelvic fascia sparing RARC has very promising early functional results with safe oncological outcomes and low complication rates.",,2134

The dog was subjected to basic clinical examination, hemato-biochemistry test, and radiographic examination before rhinoscopy. Rhinoscopy was performed with Karl Storz's 5-mm video-otoscope under general anesthesia. Leech infestation in the nasal cavity was found to be the cause of the epistaxis under rhinoscopic examination.

1619,35968228,Why are missed opportunities for immunisation and immunisation defaulting among children indistinguishable?,"The two major global immunization agenda framings (Missed Opportunity for Immunisation (MOI) vs. Immunisation Defaulting) are interchangeably and inappropriately used in public health research and practice, with flawed or misleading strategies recommended and adopted in various settings around the world. This is demonstrated by the fact that many opportunities to incorporate findings from immunization coverage research into policy are squandered. The ineffectiveness of inappropriate interventions based on biased evidence can discourage and mislead policymakers to make radical decisions by discretion. This may explain why low- and middle-income countries are unable to vaccinate 80% of their children; it also poses a global health risk to capable countries. The current guidelines and information on MOI and immunization defaulting appear insufficient, and a little clarification would help immunisation forerunners achieve measurable progress in ensuring good coverage, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The purpose of this paper is to provide appropriate recommendations to address this issue in immunization practice. Optimistically, this will stimulate further discussions, streamline differences, and gear global immunization governance on the subject to achieve the target coverage in low- and middle-income countries by 2030.",,2136
1881,35967731,Chinese language teachers' dichotomous identities when teaching ingroup and outgroup students.,"Research into second language teacher identity has experienced a shift in recent years from a cognitive perspective to social constructionist orientation. The existing research in Chinese language literature in relation to Foreign Language (CFL) teachers' identity shift is principally in relation to the change of social, cultural, and institutional contexts. Built on the current literature, this research asks: How might teachers' self-images or self-conceptualizations be renegotiated when they are located within their own mainstream cultural and educational system, yet comprised of students from various cultural backgrounds? The data were collected from a group of CFL teachers in a South China university. The research found that students' backgrounds largely impacted on, and led to, the teachers' dichotomous relational identities, but did not dramatically change the teachers' perception on what or how much subject knowledge to be possessed to make an ideal CFL teacher. This attribute of their identity was sustained even though the teaching content was modified at a practical level in response to groups' differences. Further, the CFL teachers' pedagogical identity remained stable with only minor modifications when teaching ingroups and outgroups of students.",,2137

A 40-year-old woman with untreated metastatic breast cancer presented to an outpatient clinic in significant distress with symptoms of progressive shortness of breath and bilateral leg swelling. An urgent echocardiogram demonstrated a large pericardial effusion with echocardiographic evidence of cardiac tamponade. She underwent emergent pericardiocentesis of the effusion that was deemed to be malignant after cytologic evaluation.

Methodology After obtaining approval from the hospital's ethical committee, the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) proforma was filled on admission (T0) and at week six (T1) postoperatively. All data were collected, and GIQLI scores were calculated for individual patients. Results In our study, among the 70 patients undergoing LC, 20% (n = 14) were aged 18-30 years and 80% (n = 56) were aged 31-60 years, with the mean ± standard deviation calculated as 41.56 ± 10.13 years. Overall, 44.29% (n = 31) of patients were men and 55.71% (n = 39) were women. GIQLI scores were 94.64 ± 2.24 for pre-treatment and 106.09 ± 2.40 for post-treatment, with a mean change of 11.44 ± 3.29, and a p-value of 0.001, showing a significant difference.

1700,35968070,COVID-19 vaccination intention and hesitancy: Mistrust on COVID-19 vaccine benefit a major driver for vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers; a cross-sectional study in North India.,"The advent of an effective novel COVID-19 vaccine could extinguish the current devastating pandemic but the vaccine hesitancy is a hurdle for the public health system, so this study estimated the COVID-19 vaccination intention and hesitancy among the healthcare workers, the priority target group for the COVID-19 vaccination in India. A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among the healthcare workers in Chandigarh, a union territory in North India, using a Snowball sampling technique. A total of 403 healthcare workers participated in the study between 2nd and 25th January 2021. The primary data collected were the intention to get vaccinated against the available COVID-19 vaccine and the concerns regarding the new vaccines. The attitude towards novel COVID-19 vaccine was assessed using developed Vaccine attitude examination scale. These questionnaire, which were delivered via WhatsApp, was filled by the participants over Google forms. Among the 403 respondents surveyed, the majority (54.6%) reported they were definitely intended to get vaccinated against COVID-19, however, 7% expressed a resistance for inoculation with COVID-19 vaccination. The perceived susceptibility (aOR = 0.511, CI 0.265-0.987) and severity of COVID-19 infection (aOR = 0.551 CI 0.196-0.704) and not being concerned about the efficacy of new COVID-19 vaccines (aOR = 0.702 CI 1.109-26.55) were found to have the highest significant odds of intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The majority (62%) were concerned about the safety of the vaccine, in terms of side-effects, quality control, and doubted efficacy of the vaccine. The mistrust of the benefits of the vaccine is a significant predictor for vaccine hesitancy among the healthcare workers (aOR = 5.205 CI 3.106-8.723). Therefore, strategic communication and vaccine-acceptance programs should be formulated in order to combat the prevailing mistrust on the vaccine safety and efficacy and attain effective coverage to gain herd immunity.",,2150
2240,35967191,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hepatitis B and C elimination: An EASL survey.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) HBV and HCV elimination targets, set in 2016 and based on projections to 2030, were unable to consider the impact of intervening factors. To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on viral hepatitis elimination programs, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) conducted a survey in liver centers worldwide in 2021. A web-based questionnaire was distributed (May-July 2021) to all EASL members representing clinical units providing HBV and HCV hepatitis care. Results are expressed as absolute numbers and reduction rates for each care activity. Data were collected from 32 European and 12 non-European clinical centers. Between January 2019 (pre-pandemic) and December 2020 (during the pandemic), chronic HBV consultations decreased by 32% and 26%, new referrals by 38% and 39%, HBV testing rates by 39% and 21% (for HBsAg detection) and 30% and 22% (for HBV DNA detection), and new HBV treatments by 20% and 44% (p = 0.328) in European and non-European centers, respectively. With regard to HCV during the same time frame, the overall reductions were 39% and 50% for consultations, 49% and 49% for new referrals, 11% and 38% for HCV RNA detection, and 51% and 54% for new HCV antiviral treatments for European and non-European Centers, respectively (p = 0.071). All steps in the viral hepatitis care cascade have been hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a comparable impact across different centers. These data reaffirm the pandemic's major effect on global viral hepatitis elimination programs and suggest that actions to achieve the WHO 2030 targets should be reconsidered and revised to account for each country's progress relative to pre-pandemic values. The EASL multinational survey conclusively shows that viral hepatitis elimination programs, expected to provide control of hepatitis B and hepatitis C worldwide by 2030, have been held back by the COVID-19 pandemic in clinical centers from several European and non-European countries, with a comparable impact across centers. Limitations in the cascade of care for both HBV and HCV were linked to limited access to screening, consultations, specific testing, and actual treatment. As restrictions for COVID-19 begin to lift, efforts to diagnose and provide treatment for viral hepatitis should remain high on the list of priorities for public health officials to maintain the WHO elimination efforts. Measures that have been put in place to control the COVID-19 pandemic could be transferred to increasing the diagnosis and linkage to care of people with hepatitis.",,2151
326,35980384,Key signalling pathways underlying the aetiology of polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine condition characterised by a range of reproductive, endocrine, metabolic and psychological abnormalities. Reports estimate that around 10% of women of reproductive age are affected by PCOS, representing a significant prevalence worldwide, which poses a high economic health burden. As the origin of PCOS remains largely unknown, there is neither a cure nor mechanism-based treatments leaving patient management suboptimal and focussed solely on symptomatic treatment. However, if the underlying mechanisms underpinning the development of PCOS were uncovered then this would pave the way for the development of new interventions for PCOS. Recently there have been significant advances in our understanding of the underlying pathways likely involved in PCOS pathogenesis. Key insights include the potential involvement of androgens, insulin, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) in the development of PCOS. This review will summarise the significant scientific discoveries on these factors that have enhanced our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the development of PCOS, and discuss the impact these insights may have in shaping the future development of effective strategies for women with PCOS.",,2152

1194,35972083,Comparison of Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Videoangiography vs Postoperative Catheter Angiography to Confirm Microsurgical Occlusion of Spinal Dorsal Intradural Arteriovenous Fistulas.,"Dorsal intradural arteriovenous fistulas (DI-AVFs) represent 80% of spinal AVFs. Microsurgical clip occlusion is a durable treatment that uses preoperative and postoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as standard practice. Intraoperative indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-VA) is a valuable intraoperative adjunct in these cases. Intraoperative ICG-VA findings have not been compared with postoperative DSA findings. To assess the diagnostic value of intraoperative ICG-VA vs postoperative DSA for spinal DI-AVFs. A multi-institutional database of vascular malformations was queried for all surgically managed cases of DI-AVF. Patients with both intraoperative ICG-VA and postoperative DSA were included. Demographic and radiologic data, intraoperative findings, and surgical outcomes data were retrospectively analyzed. Forty-five patients with DI-AVF were identified (male sex, 32; mean age, 61.9 [range, 26-85] years). All DI-AVFs were treated with interruption of the fistula with clip occlusion of the draining vein. Intraoperative ICG-VA showed complete obliteration in all patients. Postoperative DSA was performed for 40 patients and confirmed complete obliteration in all patients. The negative predictive value of ICG-VA confirming complete occlusion of the DI-AVFs was 100%. Eighteen patients (47%) experienced clinical improvement, and 16 (42%) experienced no change in condition. ICG-VA is useful for intraoperative identification of DI-AVFs and confirmation of complete microsurgical occlusion. Correlation between intraoperative ICG-VA and postoperative DSA findings demonstrates the diagnostic power of ICG-VA. This finding suggests that postoperative DSA is unnecessary when intraoperative ICG-VA confirms complete occlusion of the DI-AVF, which will spare patients the procedural risk and cost of this invasive procedure.",,2155

1275,35971249,Prognostic value of baseline genetic features and newly identified TP53 mutations in advanced breast cancer.,"Approximately 30% of breast cancer (BC) patients suffer from disease relapse after definitive treatment. Monitoring BC at baseline and disease progression using comprehensive genomic profiling would facilitate the prediction of prognosis. We retrospectively studied 101 BC patients ultimately experiencing relapse and/or metastases. The baseline and circulating tumor DNA-monitoring cohorts included patients with baseline tumor tissue and serial plasma samples, respectively. Samples were analyzed with targeted next-generation sequencing of 425 cancer-relevant genes. Of 35 patients in the baseline cohort, patients with TP53 mutations (P < 0.01), or CTCF/GNAS mutations (P < 0.01) displayed inferior disease-free survival, and patients harboring TP53 (P = 0.06) or NOTCH1 (P = 0.06) mutations showed relatively poor overall survival (OS), compared to patients with wild-type counterparts. Of the 59 patients with serial plasma samples, 11 patients who were newly detected with TP53 mutations had worse OS than patients whose TP53 mutational status remained negative (P < 0.01). These results indicate that an inferior prognosis of advanced breast cancer was potentially associated with baseline TP53, CTCF, and NOTCH1 alterations. Newly identified TP53 mutations after relapse and/or metastasis was another potential prognostic biomarker of poor prognosis.",,2157

Data on quality of life and resource use for 613 patients, collected prospectively in the Therapeutic Interventions for Stones of the Ureter (TISU) randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN 92289221), were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of two care pathways, SWL and URS. A health provider (UK National Health Service) perspective was adopted to estimate the costs of the interventions and subsequent resource use. Quality-of-life data were calculated using a generic instrument, the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L. Results are expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The mean QALY difference (SWL vs URS) was -0.021 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.033 to -0.010) and the mean cost difference was -£809 (95% CI -£1061 to -£551). The QALY difference translated into approximately 10 more healthy days over the 6-month period for the patients on the URS care pathway. The probabaility that SWL is cost-effective is 79% at a society's willingness to pay (WTP) threshold for 1 QALY of £30,000 and 98% at a WTP threshold of £20,000. The SWL pathway results in lower QALYs than URS but costs less. The incremental cost per QALY is £39 118 cost saving per QALY lost, with a 79% probability that SWL would be considered cost-effective at a WTP threshold for 1 QALY of £30 000 and 98% at a WTP threshold of £20 000.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey among residents of Greater Chennai Corporation in March 2021. We estimated the sample size to be 203 per strata (slum and non-slum). We used a simple random sampling technique to select 20 locations using a digital map in the slum and non-slum areas. After reaching the location chosen, we selected 10 consecutive households and one adult (≥18 years of age) from each household. We used a validated, semi-structured questionnaire for collecting data regarding knowledge, attitudes, and practices for mask use. We estimated proportions and 95% CI for key variables and compared the variables between slums and non-slums. Of 430 participants included in the study, 51.4% were males. The mean (S.D.) age of the participants is 41.1 (14.6) years. The majority (86.7%) of the participants felt that wearing a mask helped in reducing the spread of coronavirus and the knowledge differed (p-value < 0.05) between the slum (81.4%) and non-slum (92.3%). Nearly half (46.5%) of the participants did not like being forced to wear the mask. About 63.9% of the participants reported the practice of mask use while going out which was similar across slums and non-slums. Although the knowledge regarding mask use was good among the public, the attitude was unfavorable. We suggest continuous reinforcement by spreading awareness and educating the community on the appropriate use of the mask.",,2162
1693,35968077,Analysis of the correlation between mortality in nursing homes and among elderly population in Italy during the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic.,"The objective of the analysis is to investigate whether there is a correlation between deaths occurred within nursing homes in Lombardy Region and those related to the whole elderly population residing in the municipalities of their location at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis considered a sample of 17 nursing homes belonging to the same legal entity (with a total of 2,197 beds). The changes occurred in the trend of deaths in 2020 between January the 1st and February the 20th, and between February the 21st and April the 4th, compared with the average number of deaths occurred in the same time intervals of the previous three-year period (2017-2019) were investigated. To verify the presence of a correlation between deaths occurring within nursing homes and those related to the whole elderly population residing in the municipalities of their respective locations, Pearson correlation index was calculated, distinguishing between elderly over 65 years of age and elderly over 85 years of age. A statistically significant correlation was identified between the number of deaths among the overall population and the number of deaths among nursing homes residents between February the 21st and April the 20th, while no correlations were identified between January the 1st and February the 20th. The number of deaths occurred in the nursing homes of the sample considered shows similar trends to those of the elderly population of the municipalities in which they are located.",,2163
446,35978965,Lifestyle intervention during pregnancy in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus and the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Neonatal hypoglycemia is a severe adverse consequence of infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which can lead to neonatal mortality, permanent neurological consequences, and epilepsy. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to explore the effect of lifestyle intervention during pregnancy in women with GDM on the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched by 1st April 2022. Data were pooled as the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs of neonatal hypoglycemia. Random-effects, subgroup analyses, meta-regression analysis, and leave-one-out analysis were conducted, involving 18 RCTs. Prenatal lifestyle intervention could significantly reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia (RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.98, P = 0.037). Subgroup analysis further demonstrated that the reduced risk of neonatal hypoglycemia was observed only when subjects were younger than 30 years, initiated before the third trimester, and with dietary intervention. Meta-regression analysis revealed that the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia post lifestyle intervention was lower in mothers with lower fasting glucose levels at trial entry. We found that prenatal lifestyle intervention in women with GDM significantly reduced the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Only lifestyle intervention before the third trimester of pregnancy, or dietary intervention only could effectively reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Future studies are required to explore the best pattern of lifestyle intervention and to determine the proper diagnostic criteria of GDM in the first/second trimester of pregnancy. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/#myprospero, PROSPERO, identifier: CRD42021272985.",,2164

Its occurrence in male patients is remarkably rare, with only six cases reported in the English literature. Herein, we discuss the unusual occurrence of this tumor in a 31-years-old male patient as a component of non-seminomatous germ cell tumor. It presented as retroperitoneal metastasis with associated testicular microlithiasis (regressed germ cell tumor).",,2165
664,35975647,Correlation between sensory and instrumental characterization of developed sunscreens containing grape seed extract and a commercial product.,"In the development of cosmetic products, sensory evaluation is an important step in determining consumer acceptance before it is released on a market but is often time-consuming and costly. However, correlating sensory characteristics with instrumental parameters using multivariate techniques is a potential way to facilitate the development of cosmetic products. Sunscreen formulations varied in the content of grape seed extract (GSE) and ultraviolet (UV) filters, and benchmark products were characterized using sensory descriptive analysis and instrumental analysis. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the panel's performance data to study how well the panelists performed compared to each other and to find an association between rheological and textural instrumental parameters of cream samples. Further, applying Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression analysis, the association between sensory attributes and instrumental parameters was analyzed. In addition, a preference for the sensory properties of the studied sunscreen products that are important for consumers living in Southeast Asia was assessed by PLS. In this study, both the sensory and instrumental properties of all tested formulations were described well by PCA. The practicality of PLS was confirmed by an established correlation between sensory attributes from the categories of appearance (glossiness), pick-up (integrity of shape, firmness, glossiness, stringiness), and after-feel (glossiness, spreadability, stickiness) with both rheological and textural parameters. Although the instrumental analysis could not completely replace sensory evaluation, a described method applying PLS can be used as an additional cost-effective and time-saving method during the development of cosmetic products. Moreover, PLS revealed that sunscreens with a light texture and glossy appearance providing smooth skin after-feel are likely to be preferred over the thicker formulations having a residual color appearance in Southeast Asia. Until a universal model is created, the cosmetics developers and companies can apply a described method of determining sensory properties from the instrumental parameters of their own products. Future studies will be worth exploiting the applicability of the PLS regression model on instrumental datasets predicting sensory characteristics of other sunscreen products. Dans le développement de produits cosmétiques, l'évaluation sensorielle est une étape importante pour déterminer l'acceptation par le consommateur avant la mise sur le marché, mais elle est souvent longue et coûteuse. Cependant, la corrélation des caractéristiques sensorielles avec les paramètres instrumentaux à l'aide de techniques multivariées est un moyen potentiel afin de faciliter le développement des produits cosmétiques. MÉTHODES: Les formulations d'écrans solaires variants en termes de teneur en extrait de pépins de raisin (EPR) et en filtres ultraviolets (UV), et les produits de référence ont été caractérisés à l'aide d’une analyse sensorielle descriptive et d’une analyse instrumentale. L'analyse en composantes principales (ACP) a été appliquée aux données de performance du panel pour étudier la performance des panélistes les uns par rapport aux autres et pour trouver une association entre les paramètres instrumentaux rhéologiques et texturaux des échantillons de crème. En outre, l'association entre les attributs sensoriels et les paramètres instrumentaux a été analysée au moyen d'une analyse de régression PLS (Partial Least Squares). De plus, une préférence pour les propriétés sensorielles des produits de protection solaire étudiés importantes pour les consommateurs vivant en Asie du Sud-Est a été évaluée par PLS. RÉSULTATS: Dans cette étude, les propriétés sensorielles et instrumentales de toutes les formulations testées ont été bien décrites par l'ACP. L'aspect pratique de l'analyse PLS a été confirmé par une corrélation établie entre les attributs sensoriels des catégories de l'apparence (brillance), de la prise (intégrité de la forme, fermeté, brillance, filant) et de l'impression résiduelle (brillance, capacité d'étalement, adhésivité) avec les paramètres rhéologiques et texturaux. Bien que l'analyse instrumentale ne puisse pas remplacer complètement l'évaluation sensorielle, la méthode décrite appliquant la PLS peut être utilisée comme une méthode supplémentaire rentable et permettant de gagner du temps lors du développement de produits cosmétiques. En outre, l'analyse PLS a révélé que les écrans solaires à la texture légère et à l'aspect brillant, qui procurent une sensation de douceur sur la peau, sont susceptibles d’être préférés aux formulations plus épaisses ayant une couleur résiduelle en Asie du Sud-Est. En attendant la création d'un modèle universel, les développeurs et les entreprises de cosmétiques peuvent appliquer une méthode décrite pour déterminer les propriétés sensorielles à partir des paramètres instrumentaux de leurs propres produits. Les études futures devront exploiter l'applicabilité du modèle de régression PLS sur des ensembles de données instrumentales prédisant les caractéristiques sensorielles d'autres produits solaires.",,2166
478,35978877,Long noncoding RNAs in hepatitis B virus replication and oncogenesis.,"Several diverse long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified to be involved in hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and oncogenesis, especially those dysregulated in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Most of these dysregulated lncRNAs are modulated by the HBV X protein. The regulatory mechanisms of some lncRNAs in HBV replication and oncogenesis have been characterized. Genetic polymorphisms of several lncRNAs affecting HBV replication or oncogenesis have also been studied. The prognosis of HCC remains poor. It is important to identify novel tumor markers for early diagnosis and find more therapeutic targets for effective treatments of HCC. Some dysregulated lncRNAs in HBV-related HCC may become biomarkers for early diagnosis and/or the therapeutic targets of HCC. This mini-review summarizes these findings briefly, focusing on recent developments.",,2167
1866,35967774,Financial Wellbeing and Quality of Life Among a Sample of the Lebanese Population: The Mediating Effect of Food Insecurity.,"Lebanon is undergoing multiple overlapping crises, affecting the food security, financial well-being, and quality of life (QOL) of its residents. The primary objective was to assess the food insecurity (FI) status of a sample of the Lebanese population. The second objective was to explore factors related to QOL parameters and evaluate the mediating effect of food security between financial well-being and QOL. The study was cross-sectional and enrolled 412 participants recruited online using the snowball sampling technique. The survey included questions related to sociodemographic and economic characteristics of Lebanese households and validated scales to assess FI, QOL measures, financial well-being, and fear of COVID-19. Almost 43% of the study participants reported being food insecure, with 31% experiencing mild FI, 10% moderate FI, and 1.5% severe FI. Compared to food-insecure participants, food secure participants had a significantly higher income (58.5% vs. 39.2%, p < 0.001), a university education level (96.6% vs. 88.1%, p = 0.002), an average perceived financial status (83.9% vs. 65.9%), higher financial well-being scores (5.14 vs. 3.19, p < 0.001), and lower crowding index (0.94 ± 0.4 vs. 1.09, p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that FI was not associated with physical (Beta = -1.48, 95% CI: -3.10; 0.13) and mental (Beta = -1.46, 95% CI -3.68; 0.75) QOL, after adjusting for other demographic and socioeconomic correlates. This association remained non-significant when introducing the financial well-being variable to the model. Mediation analyses showed that the FI variable mediated the association between financial well-being and physical QOL (Beta = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.02; 0.36), but not the mental QOL (Beta = -0.02, 95% CI: -0.20; 0.14). Food insecurity was prevalent in our study sample, and it mediated the association between financial well-being and physical, but not mental, QOL parameters. These findings call for evidence-based policies and programs to help improve the food security and well-being of Lebanese households amidst these unprecedented circumstances.",,2168
1405,35968539,Effect of the Reversed L-Shaped Osteotomy on the Round Sign: Not All Hallux Valgus Deformities May Need Proximal Derotation to Correct the Radiographic Appearance of Metatarsal Pronation.,"Metatarsal pronation has been claimed to be a risk factor for hallux valgus recurrence. A rounded shape of the lateral aspect of the first metatarsal head has been identified as a sign of persistent metatarsal pronation after hallux valgus correction. This study investigated the derotational effect of a reversed L-shaped (ReveL) osteotomy combined with a lateral release to correct metatarsal pronation. The primary hypothesis was that most cases showing a positive round sign are corrected by rebalancing the metatarsal-sesamoid complex. We further assumed that the inability to correct the round sign might be a risk factor for hallux valgus recurrence. We retrospectively evaluated 266 cases treated with a ReveL osteotomy for hallux valgus deformity. The radiologic measurements were performed on weightbearing foot radiographs preoperatively, at an early follow-up (median, 6.2 weeks), and the most recent follow-up (median, 13 months). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified risk factors for hallux valgus recurrence (hallux valgus angle [HVA] ≥ 20 degrees). A preoperative positive radiographic round sign was present in 40.2% of the cases, of which 58.9% turned negative after the ReveL osteotomy (P < .001). Hallux valgus recurred in 8.6%. Risk factors for recurrence were a preoperative HVA >30 degrees (odds ratio [OR] = 5.3, P < .001), metatarsus adductus (OR = 4.0, P = .004), preoperative positive round sign (OR = 3.3, P = .02), postoperative HVA >15 degrees (OR = 74.9; P < .001), and postoperative positive round sign (OR = 5.3, P = .008). Cases with a positive round sign at the most recent follow-up had a significantly higher recurrence rate than those with a negative round sign (22.7% vs 5.9%, P < .001). The ReveL osteotomy corrected a positive round sign in 58.9%, suggesting that not all hallux valgus deformities may need proximal derotation to negate the radiographic appearance of the round sign. A positive round sign was found to be an independent risk factor for hallux valgus recurrence. Further 3-dimensional analyses are necessary to better understand the effects and limitations of distal translational osteotomies to correct metatarsal pronation. Level IV, case series.",,2169
1952,35967655,Beauty is in the eye of the employer: Labor market discrimination of accountants.,"This research investigates labor market discrimination based on physical appearance in Israel's Certified Public Accountant firms. Using a survey questionnaire, we showed that accountants in managerial positions prefer to hire more physically attractive candidates. This beauty premium is larger among the five biggest Certified Public Accountant firms and can be explained by the perception that attractive candidates possess essential traits for becoming successful accountants. An important implication of our results is that even among accounting firms, where professionalism is well defined, discrimination against candidates based on traits such as physical appearance can ineffectively eliminate suitably qualified interns.",,2170

1760,35967964,Protocolized Training of Advanced Practice Providers for Robotic Surgery Improves the Quality of Intraoperative Assistance.,"The expansion of robotic surgery requires identifying factors of competent robotic bedside assisting. Surgical trainees desire more robotic console time, and we hypothesized that protocolized robotic surgery bedside training could equip Advanced Practice Providers (APPs) to meet this growing need. No standardized precedent exists for training APPs. We designed a pilot study consisting of didactic and clinical skills. APPs completed didactic tests followed by proctored clinical skills checklists intraoperatively. Operating surgeons scored trainees with 10-point Likert scale (< 5 not confident, > 5 = confident). APPs scoring > 5 advanced to a solo practicum. Competence was defined as: didactic test score > 75th percentile, completing < 5 checklists, scoring > 5 on the practicum. The probability of passing the practicum was calculated with Bayes theorem. Of 10 APP trainees, 5 passed on initial attempt. After individualized development plans, 4 passed retesting. Differences in trainee factors were not statistically significant, but the probability of passing the practicum was < 50% if more than four checklists were needed. Clinical experience, not didactic knowledge, determines the probability of intraoperative competence. Increasing clinical proctoring did not result in higher probability of competence. Early identification of APPs needing individualized improvement increases the proportion of competent APPs.",,2173
700,35975306,Methods of training lay individuals in the use of evidence-based services for the management of mental and behavioral health disorders: a scoping review protocol.,"The objective of this scoping review is to describe how lay individuals have been trained in evidence-based therapies to manage mental and behavioral health disorders as defined by the International Classification of Diseases, version 11. Health service delivery by lay individuals is common in under-resourced areas. Prior systematic reviews have examined the characteristics of lay workers, the types of services they provide, and the efficacy of their services. Our goal is to focus on the methods of training. Participants will include lay individuals who provide services to community residents; we will exclude individuals with formal training in health service delivery. We will consider for inclusion studies that include training programs for evidence-based therapies delivered to individuals with mental and behavioral health disorders, and will exclude those involving pharmacology or focusing on cognitive defects. We conducted a preliminary search of the literature on PubMed and CINAHL for articles related to the inclusion criteria and published in the past 10 years. Scanning the title, abstract, keywords, and MeSH terms, we generated comprehensive lists of terms and added search terms from six recent systematic reviews. Our search strategy will include MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and gray literature. We will also consult with experts and review the reference lists of articles selected for final inclusion. Articles published in English or Spanish between 1960 and the present will be considered for inclusion. Data analysis will use a mix of descriptive and qualitative approaches, with data presented graphically or in diagrammatic or tabular format.",,2174
1541,35968345,Risk stratification of hepatocellular carcinoma incidence using a fibrosis-4-based prediction model in patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving antiviral therapy: a nationwide real-world Taiwanese cohort study.,"A total of 1,589 patients who had received interferon-based treatment were enrolled and analyzed for the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a real-world nationwide Taiwanese chronic hepatitis C cohort (T-COACH). We aimed to stratify HCC risk by non-invasive fibrosis index-based risk model. Of 1589 patients, 1363 (85.8%) patients achieved sustained virological response (SVR). Patients with SVR had 1, 3, 5 and 10-year cumulative HCC incidence rates of 0.55%, 1.87%, 3.48% and 8.35%, respectively. A Cox proportional hazards model revealed that non-SVR (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-3.12, p = 0.008), diabetes mellitus (aHR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.25-3.55, p = 0.005), and fibrosis (FIB)-4 at the end of follow-up (EOF; aHR: 5.60, 95% CI: 2.97-10.57, p < 0.0001) were independent predictors of HCC. Risk score models based on the three predictors were developed to predict HCC according to aHR. In model 1, the 10-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 43.35% in patients at high risk (score 9-10), 25.48% in those at intermediate risk (score 6-8), and 4.06% in those at low risk (score 3-5) of HCC. In model 2, the 10-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 39.64% in patients at high risk (at least two risk predictors), 19.12% in those at intermediate risk (with one risk predictor), and 2.52% in those at low risk (without any risk predictors) of HCC. The FIB-4-based prediction model at EOF could help stratify the risk of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis C after antiviral treatment.",,2175
1508,35968379,Flavor science in the context of research on electronic cigarettes.,"Thousands start smoking or vaping daily, despite long-standing efforts by public health authorities to curb initiation and use of nicotine containing products. Over the last 15 years, use of electronic nicotine delivery systems has increased dramatically, with a diverse range of products on the market, including pod-based, disposable, and refillable electronic cigarettes (eCigs). Originally intended for harm reduction and smoking cessation, eCigs may encourage nicotine use among never smokers, given the vast range of appealing flavors that are available. To better understand abuse liability and to facilitate appropriate regulations, it is crucial to understand the science of flavor, and flavor perception within the context of eCig use. Here, we (a) provide a brief primer on chemosensory perception and flavor science for addiction and nicotine researchers, and (b) highlight existing some literature regarding flavor and nicotine use, with specific attention given to individual differences in perception, and interaction between different sensory modalities that contribute to flavor. Dramatic increases in use of eCigs highlights the importance of flavor science in contemporary addiction research, both with regards to public health and regulatory efforts. Other recent work summarizes findings on flavored e-liquids and eCig use, but none have focused explicitly on chemosensory processes or flavor perception as they relate to appeal and use of such products. We argue flavor science needs to be considered as perceptual and behavioral phenomena, and not merely from analytical, toxicological and pharmacological perspectives; we help address this gap here.",,2176
2243,35967188,Rectal Foreign Bodies: Surgical Management and the Impact of Psychiatric Illness.,"Background Entrapped rectal foreign bodies can be a challenge to manage and are being encountered by acute surgical teams with increasing frequency. The aims of our study were to (a) ascertain the population demographics of patients presenting with this problem in our local area of East Kent, (b) see if an association could be drawn between this presentation and proposed risk factors such as a psychiatric illness or socioeconomic deprivation, and (c) to review how foreign bodies are being removed in the East Kent Hospital University Foundation NHS Trust, United Kingdom and to highlight best practice with regards to this in line with the latest guidelines. Methodology Between 2017 and 2021, 32 cases of entrapped rectal foreign bodies were diagnosed and managed at our NHS Trust. Retrospective data taken from the theatre directory and electronic patient records were used to audit patient demographics, co-morbidities, the type of foreign body, and the extraction technique. Results The majority of patients (90%) were male (n = 29). The patients' age ranged from 15 to 95 years, with a median age of 48 years. In total, 12 (37.5%) patients had a medical history of a psychiatric illness. The most common foreign bodies removed were sex toys or vibrators (n = 8) and roll-on deodorant bottles (n = 7). Kent Area B (n = 10) and Kent Area A (n = 9) were the areas with the highest number of cases. Twenty-two (68.8%) patients underwent examination under a general anaesthetic for removal, seven (21.8%) patients had the object manually removed without sedation, and three (9.4%) required a laparotomy with or without bowel resection. Conclusions Cases of an entrapped rectal foreign body in this local region typically involved male patients between 40 and 50 years old. A high proportion of this group had a history of a psychiatric illness supporting an association between this presentation and mental health. We have proposed some explanations for this association including the anal canal nervous system interplay with the brain-gut axis. Lower socioeconomic status and unemployment may also be risk factors for this surgical problem. A trans-anal approach for management is successful in the majority of cases; however, almost 10% of patients required emergency surgical management. We have highlighted best practice guidelines for the investigation and management of the entrapped rectal foreign body as part of our discussion.",,2177
626,35977225,Association of the Medicare Value-Based Purchasing Program With Changes in Patient Care Experience at Safety-net vs Non-Safety-net Hospitals.,"Safety-net hospitals, which have limited financial resources and care for disadvantaged populations, have lower performance on measures of patient experience than non-safety-net hospitals. In 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) program began tying hospital payments to patient-reported experience scores, but whether implementation of this program narrowed differences in scores between safety-net and non-safety-net hospitals is unknown. To evaluate whether the VBP program's implementation was associated with changes in measures of patient-reported experience at safety-net hospitals compared with non-safety-net hospitals between 2008 and 2019. This cohort study evaluated 2266 US hospitals that participated in the VBP program between 2008 and 2019. Safety-net hospitals were defined as those in the highest quartile of the disproportionate share hospital index. Data were analyzed from December 2021 to February 2022. The primary outcomes were the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems global measures of patient-reported experience and satisfaction, including a patient's overall rating of a hospital and willingness to recommend a hospital. Secondary outcomes included the 7 other Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems measures encompassing communication ratings, clinical processes ratings, and hospital environment ratings. Piecewise linear mixed regression models were used to assess annual trends in performance on each patient experience measure by hospital safety-net status before (July 1, 2007-June 30, 2011) and after (July 1, 2011-June 30, 2019) implementation of the VBP program. Of 2266 US hospitals, 549 (24.2%) were safety-net hospitals. Safety-net hospitals were more likely than non-safety-net hospitals to be nonteaching (67.6% [371 of 549] vs 53.1% [912 of 1717]; P < .001) and urban (82.5% [453 of 549] vs 77.4% [1329 of 1717]; P = .01). Safety-net hospitals consistently had lower patient experience scores than non-safety-net hospitals across all measures from 2008 to 2019. The percentage of patients rating safety-net hospitals as a 9 or 10 out of 10 increased during the pre-VBP program period (annual percentage change, 1.84%; 95% CI, 1.73%-1.96%) and at a slower rate after VBP program implementation (annual percentage change, 0.49%; 95% CI, 0.45%-0.53%) at safety-net hospitals. Similar patterns were observed at non-safety-net hospitals (pre-VBP program annual percentage change, 1.84% [95% CI, 1.77%-1.90%] and post-VBP program annual percentage change, 0.42% [95% CI, 0.41%-0.45%]). There was no differential change in performance between these sites after the VBP program implementation (adjusted differential change, 0.07% [95% CI, -0.08% to 0.23%]; P = .36). These patterns were similar for the global measure that assessed whether patients would definitely recommend a hospital. There was also no differential change in performance between safety-net and non-safety-net hospitals under the VBP program across measures of communication, including doctor (adjusted differential change, -0.09% [95% CI, -0.19% to 0.01%]; P = .08) and nurse (adjusted differential change, -0.01% [95% CI, -0.12% to 0.10%]; P = .86) communication as well as clinical process measures (staff responsiveness adjusted differential change, 0.13% [95% CI, -0.03% to 0.29%]; P = .11; and discharge instructions adjusted differential change, -0.02% [95% CI, -0.12% to 0.07%]; P = .62). This cohort study of 2266 US hospitals found that the VBP program was not associated with improved patient experience at safety-net hospitals vs non-safety-net hospitals during an 8-year period. Policy makers may need to explore other strategies to address ongoing differences in patient experience and satisfaction, including additional support for safety-net hospitals.",,2178
165,35983114,What should urologists know about Pseudojournals and open access publishing? A narrative review of the literature.,"The majority of the open access publishing allows the researchers to publish their articles for a fee and at the same time enables the readers to access the research without paying the expensive journal subscription charges. Under the garb of open access publishing, predatory journals run a scam to dupe the researchers of money. This study was conducted to highlight the characteristics of pseudojournals and increase the awareness about their modus operandi. The email inboxes of 3 academic urologists (APS, AS, and KP) were searched for emails soliciting articles for open access journals. A list of all such journals was compiled. These journals were checked for metrics from the Journal Citation Reports and the Scimago Journal Rankings. All these journals were then cross-checked with the available whitelists and blacklists. Features pointing toward a pseudo journal were identified as red flag signs for these journals and were noted. A literature search was performed on open access publishing and predatory journals, and the salient points were noted. A checklist of red flag signs was compiled. A total of 71 emails soliciting article submissions from 68 journals were received by the three urologists (APS, AS, KP). Of these, 54 were highly suggestive of being a pseudojournal, 5 journals were operating in the gray zone between genuine open access journals and outright predatory journals, and 9 were genuine open access journals. A total of 33 articles on predatory journals were reviewed after the literature search as per the PRISMA guidelines. The red flag signs identified along with the literature review were used to create the SAFEiMAP checklist, which can be used to identify predatory journals. Predatory journals have infiltrated the whitelists, and the indexing databases like PubMed and no blacklist is all-inclusive. Understanding the concept and the types of open access publishing gives the researchers a better idea on how to differentiate fake journals from the genuine ones.

We highlight opportunities to pioneer the literature by questioning who is meant by immigrant (clearly defining generational status, going beyond covariate and difference-based approaches, focusing on immigrants from understudied ethnic-racial backgrounds), what is meant by identity (ethnic/heritage/native, conjoined with multiple identities such as national, regional, politicized), where experiences are taking place (globalization, differences in how immigrants are defined and viewed across contexts), and the why or importance of continuing this work (identity as resilience against mental health risks). Targeting under-researched intersections among the who-what-where-why can build knowledge and insight for researchers and practitioners who work with immigrant families, and perhaps for immigrants themselves.",,2180
1262,35971353,Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia Secondary to COVID-19: A Case Report.,"Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) is a painful condition characterized by stabbing pain throughout the glossopharyngeal nerve distribution. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we have learned that COVID-19 may induce neurological symptoms and complications. This case report presents a 54-year-old patient diagnosed with GPN, potentially secondary to COVID-19. The pain resolved spontaneously in three months without the need for medication. We discuss our diagnostic approach for this patient and propose a possible theory about the relation between cranial neuralgias and COVID-19.",,2181
819,35974956,Genetic Alteration May Proceed with a Histological Change in Glioblastoma: A Report from Initially Diagnosed as Nontumor Lesion Cases.,"Despite recent signs of progress in diagnostic radiology, it is quite rare that a glioblastoma (GBM) is detected asymptomatically. We describe two patients with asymptomatic nonenhancing GBMs that were not diagnosed with neoplasia at first. The patients had brain scans as medical checkups, and incidentally lesions were detected. In both cases, surgical specimens histopathologically showed no evidence of neoplasia, whereas molecular genetic findings were isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter (pMGMT) unmethylated, and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutated, which matched to GBM. One patient was observed without adjuvant therapy and the tumor recurred 7 months later. Reoperation was performed, and histopathologically GBM was confirmed with the same molecular diagnosis as the first surgical specimen. Another patient was carefully observed, and chemoradiotherapy was begun 6 months after the operation following the extension of the lesion. Eventually, because of disease progression, both patients deceased. We postulate that in each case, the tumor was not lower-grade glioma but corresponded to the early growth phase of GBM cells. Thus far, cases of malignant transformation from lower-grade glioma or asymptomatic GBM with typical histologic features are reported. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no such case of nonenhancing, nonhistologically confirmed GBM was reported. We conjecture these cases shed light on the yet unknown natural history of GBM. GBM can take the form of radiological nonenhancing and histological nonneoplastic fashion before typical morphology. Molecular genetic analysis can diagnose atypical preceding GBM, and we recommend early surgical removal and adjuvant treatment.",,2182
1284,35970738,Factors which delay surgery for undescended testis in Ontario: A retrospective population based cohort study on timing of orchidopexy between 2006 and 2012.,"Delays in performing orchidopexy (OP) for undescended testis (UDT) result in loss of germ cells. Despite practice guidelines recommending OP by 18 months of age, significant delays in OP occur. This delay may impact fertility and increase the risk of testicular malignancy in boys with UDT. The objective of this study is to identify factors associated with delayed OP with the goal of identifying modifiable risk factors. A population-based, retrospective cohort study was conducted using linked databases held at ICES to evaluate factors associated with timing of OP in Ontario for 4339 male newborns undergoing their first OP between 2006 and 2012. Primary outcome was delayed OP (>18 months). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify patient, physician, and hospital risk factors for delayed OP. Median age at OP was 24 months, while median age at first surgical consult was 20 months (IQR 10-60 months). Older age at first surgical consult (>12 months vs. <9 months, OR 17.83) was identified as the primary risk factor for delayed OP, besides ICU hospitalization (OR 3.42), associated hypospadias (OR 2.30), higher hospital OP volume (OR 1.91), more healthcare visits in first year of life (OR 1.05), and older surgeon age (OR 1.02). Our findings support reports that OP is often performed past guideline recommendations. Interventions that result in earlier referral for UDT (<6 months) may result in timely OP. Limitations for this study include potential misclassification or missing data within the utilized databases. The most important barrier to timely OP is delay in first surgical consultation. Aiming for an earlier referral through guideline modifications or education to referring providers may help achieve the goal of timely OP.",,2183
2238,35967253,Recent advances on phylogenomics of gymnosperms and a new classification.,"Living gymnosperms comprise four major groups: cycads, Ginkgo, conifers, and gnetophytes. Relationships among/within these lineages have not been fully resolved. Next generation sequencing has made available a large number of sequences, including both plastomes and single-copy nuclear genes, for reconstruction of solid phylogenetic trees. Recent advances in gymnosperm phylogenomic studies have updated our knowledge of gymnosperm systematics. Here, we review major advances of gymnosperm phylogeny over the past 10 years and propose an updated classification of extant gymnosperms. This new classification includes three classes (Cycadopsida, Ginkgoopsida, and Pinopsida), five subclasses (Cycadidae, Ginkgoidae, Cupressidae, Pinidae, and Gnetidae), eight orders (Cycadales, Ginkgoales, Araucariales, Cupressales, Pinales, Ephedrales, Gnetales, and Welwitschiales), 13 families, and 86 genera. We also described six new tribes including Acmopyleae Y. Yang, Austrocedreae Y. Yang, Chamaecyparideae Y. Yang, Microcachrydeae Y. Yang, Papuacedreae Y. Yang, and Prumnopityeae Y.

1734,35968008,Exploring why animal health practices are (not) adopted among smallholders in low and middle-income countries: a realist framework and scoping review protocol.,"Improving livestock health is considered critical to address poverty, malnutrition and food insecurity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Modifications of livestock management practices is also increasingly recognized as an important strategy to mitigate global threats such as climate change and novel disease emergence. Smallholders are, however, under various constraints which prohibit them from altering health practices for livestock and little is known about how the adoption of these practices may be promoted. The proposed scoping review aims to systematically map evidence around what practices are (not) adopted by smallholders under what circumstances, how and why?. We conducted initial scoping searches to broadly define types of animal health practices relevant for smallholders in LMICs and formulated search terms. A scoping review protocol was designed and registered. A systematic literature search will be conducted using electronic databases including CAB Abstract, Scopus, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science Core Collection. Gray literature will be searched from AGRIS and Standards for Supporting Agricultural Livelihoods in Emergencies. Articles in English, pertaining to the animal health practices considered highly relevant will be considered eligible for inclusion. Articles will be screened at two stages by two independent reviewers; screening of titles, abstracts, and keywords, followed by full-article screening. The first reviewer will review 100% of the articles at both stages. The second reviewer will review a random sample of 20% of the articles at both stages. Any disagreements will be resolved using inputs from the third reviewer. A thematic analysis will be conducted to catalog contexts and mechanisms for adoption and discussed under a realist framework. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying the adoption of animal health practices by livestock smallholders in LMICs is crucial for successful implementation of interventions including those which are based on a One Health approach. This review will identify the extent of this knowledge across disciplines and inform future research priorities for the design of effective and feasible interventions which can contribute toward Sustainable Development Goal 2. This protocol is registered within the Open Science Framework (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FUQAX).",,2186
2016,35967570,"Vaccination timeliness and associated factors among children aged 12-23 months in Debre Libanos district of North Shewa Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia.","Globally, vaccination is one of the most cost-effective interventions in promoting child survival, preventing 2-3 million child deaths annually from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). In Ethiopia, timely vaccination is stated as key to the prevention of unnecessary childhood mortality from measles, pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, and other VPDs. However, Ethiopia ranked fifth among the ten countries with the most unprotected children. Furthermore, previous vaccine timeliness studies produced widely disparate results. As a result, it was suggested that more research be conducted to investigate the potential factors behind the high proportion of untimely vaccination. Therefore, this study was intended to explore the association between different factors and the proportion of vaccination timeliness administered under the Expanded Program on Immunization in Debre Libanos district, Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed from 1 May to 30 May 2021 among children aged 12 to 23 months with their mother/caregiver, who had started vaccination and had vaccination cards in the Debre Libanos. Simple random sampling techniques and pretested semi-structured questionnaires were used for data collection. At last, a multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the vaccination timeliness. In this study, 413 children aged 12 to 23 months were interviewed with their mother/caregiver. Overall, 33.7% [95% CI (29.1-38.3)] of children received their vaccines timely. Having a female child [AOR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.58-5.35], mother/caregiver attending primary [AOR: 6.33, 95% CI: 2.66-15.06] and secondary/above education [AOR: 5.61, 95% CI: 2.41-13.04], sufficient vaccination knowledge [AOR: 3.46, 95% CI: 1.87-6.38], mother/caregiver with least hesitant [AOR: 3.35, 95% CI: 1.51-7.41] and middle hesitant [AOR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.05-3.58], utilization of ANC [AOR: 2.89, 95% CI: 1.32-6.33], and giving birth at health facility [AOR: 4.32, 95% CI: 1.95-9.59] were the factors independently associated with vaccination timeliness. In comparison to Ethiopia's existing vaccination coverage, the proportion of children immunized at the recommended time interval is low in the study district. Policymakers should prioritize vaccine timeliness and integrate it into childhood vaccination strategies.",,2187
114,35983338,Telemedicine can be a feasible means of guiding untrained general practitioners to perform point-of-care ultrasound in life-threatening situations: the case of a field hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"To evaluate the feasibility of telemedicine using a standardized multiorgan ultrasound assessment protocol to guide untrained on-site general practitioners at a field hospital during a life-threatening crisis. We evaluated 11 inpatients with shock, with or without acute dyspnea, for whom general practitioners spontaneously requested remote evaluation by a specialist. All of the general practitioners accepted the protocol and were able to position the transducer correctly, thus obtaining key images of the internal jugular vein, lungs, and inferior vena cava when guided remotely by a telemedicine physician, who interpreted all of the findings. However, only four (36%) of the on-site general practitioners obtained the appropriate key image of the heart in the left parasternal long-axis view, and only three (27%) received an immediate interpretation of an image from the remote physician. The mean evaluation time was 22.7 ± 12 min (range, 7-42 min). Even in life-threatening situations, untrained general practitioners may be correctly guided by telemedicine specialists to perform multiorgan point-of-care ultrasound in order to improve bedside diagnostic evaluation.

350,35979324,Transplanted kidney loss during colorectal cancer chemotherapy: A case report.,"The overall risk of de novo malignancies in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) is higher than that in the general population. It is associated with long-lasting exposure to immunosuppressive agents and impaired oncological vigilance due to chronic kidney disease. Colorectal cancer (CRC), frequently diagnosed in an advanced stage, is one of the most common malignancies in this cohort and is associated with poor prognosis. Still, because of the scarcity of data concerning adjuvant chemotherapy in this group, there are no clear guidelines for the specific management of the CRCs in KTRs. We present a patient who lost her transplanted kidney shortly after initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer. A 36-year-old woman with a medical history of kidney transplantation (2005) because of end-stage kidney disease, secondary to chronic glomerular nephritis, and long-term immunosuppression was diagnosed with locally advanced pT4AN1BM0 (clinical stage III) colon adenocarcinoma G2. After right hemicolectomy, the patient was qualified to receive adjuvant chemotherapy that consisted of oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX-4). The deterioration of kidney graft function after two cycles caused chemotherapy cessation and initiation of hemodialysis therapy after a few months. Shortly after that, the patient started palliative chemotherapy because of cancer recurrence with intraperitoneal spread. Initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer increases the risk of rapid kidney graft loss driven also by under-immunosuppression.",,2191
1468,35968430,Beyond effectiveness evaluation: Contributing to the discussion on complexity of digital health interventions with examples from cancer care.,"Digital health interventions (DHIs) have become essential complementary solutions in health care to enhance support and communication at a distance, with evidence of improving patient outcomes. Improving clinical outcomes is a major determinant of success in any health intervention, influencing its funding, development, adoption and implementation in real-world practice. In this article we explore our experiences of developing and testing DHIs to identify and discuss complexity challenges along their intervention research lifecycle. Informed by the case study research approach, we selected three individual DHIs aimed at satisfying the supportive and educational needs of people living with cancer. The Care Expert, the Digi-Do and the Gatapp were underpinned on different complexity frameworks i.e., the Medical Research Council framework and the Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability framework. This variance on the methodological underpinning was expected to prompt a multifaceted discussion on the complexity dimensions endorsed by each of the frameworks. Our discussion endorses the adoption of mixed-methods research designs, to gather the perspectives of stakeholders and end-users, as well as pragmatic evaluation approaches that value effectiveness outcomes as much as process outcomes. Furthermore, the dissemination and sustainability agenda of DHIs needs to be considered from early-stage development with the inclusion of a business model. This business plan should be worked in partnership with healthcare services, regulatory bodies and industry, aiming to assure the management of the DHI throughout time.",,2192
2011,35967576,Clinical characteristics and mortality predictors of patients with cancer hospitalized by COVID-19 in a pediatric third-level referral center.,"More than 135 million COVID-19 cases (coronavirus disease 2019) have been reported worldwide until today, with over 2.9 million deaths. Several studies have demonstrated that disease severity is lower in the pediatric population than in adults; however, differences are described in patients with chronic diseases, including oncological patients. Current world literature suggests patients with comorbidities, including cancer, have an increased risk of unfortunate outcomes. Therefore, our objective was to describe the clinical characteristics and epidemiological factors associated with mortality in a cohort of pediatric cancer patients hospitalized for COVID-19. This is a retrospective, descriptive study of the cases of patients with cancer hospitalized for COVID-19. A total of 40 pediatrics were included in the analysis. Data from pediatric patients with COVID-19 included clinical and epidemiological records, laboratory, imaging studies, COVID-19 diagnostic methods, and medical treatment. Of the 40 pediatric patients admitted with cancer with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, 42.5% were solid tumors, 40% leukemias, and 17.5% lymphomas. The clinical parameters associated with mortality were stage IV tumor (p = 0.029) and intubation (p < 0.001). The biochemical factors associated with lower survival were thrombocytopenia under 25,000 cells/mm3 (p < 0.001), D-dimer over 1 μg/ml (p = 0.003), clinical malnutrition (p = 0.023), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (p = 0.03). Our findings showed that the fever was the most frequent symptom, and the clinical parameters associated with mortality were stage IV tumor, intubation, saturation percentage, RDW, platelets, creatinine, ALT, D-dimer, ferritin, and FiO2 percentage. The thrombocytopenia, D-dimer, nutritional status, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were significantly associated with lower survival.",,2193

In part 1, a systematic search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus and SPORTDiscus (EBSCOhost) was undertaken from the earliest records to January 2021. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020, the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews, and the PRISMA extension protocols were followed. In part 2, 31 international experts in women's rugby (ie, elite players, sports scientists, medical clinicians, sports administrators) participated in a three-round Delphi consensus method. These experts reviewed the findings from part 1 and subsequently provided a list of priority research topics in women's rugby. Research topics were grouped into expert-based themes and expert-based subthemes via content analysis. Expert-based themes and expert-based subthemes were ranked from very low to very high research priority on a 1-5 Likert scale. Consensus was defined by ≥70% agreement. The median research priority agreement and IQR were calculated for each expert-based theme and subtheme. PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus and SPORTDiscus (EBSCOhost). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated applied sports science or sports medicine in women's rugby. In part 1, the systematic scoping review identified 123 studies, which were categorised into six sports science and sports medicine evidence-based themes: injury (n=48), physical performance (n=32), match characteristics (n=26), fatigue and recovery (n=6), nutrition (n=6), and psychology (n=5). In part 2, the Delphi method resulted in three expert-based themes achieving consensus on future research priority in women's rugby: injury (5.0 (1.0)), female health (4.0 (1.0)) and physical performance (4.0 (1.0)). This two-part systematic scoping review and Delphi consensus is the first study to summarise the applied sports science and sports medicine evidence base in women's rugby and establish future research priorities. The summary tables from part 1 provide valuable reference information for researchers and practitioners. The three expert-based themes that achieved consensus in part 2 (injury, female health and physical performance) provide clear direction and guidance on future research priorities in women's rugby. The findings of this two-part study facilitate efficient and coordinated use of scientific resources towards high-priority research themes relevant to a wide range of stakeholders in women's rugby.",,2194

With the advancement of endoscopic DCR and the silicone stents, an update of the surgical outcomes and preferable approaches is required. This study aims at comparing the surgical outcomes of endoscopic DCR using pushed bicanalicular intubation (BCI) to pulled monocanalicular intubation (MCI) in adults with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO). Forty five eyes of 45 patients were enrolled, including 22 eyes of 22 patients treated with endoscopic DCR with pulled MCI and 23 eyes of 23 patients with pushed BCI from January 2014 to June 2021. The success rates at stent removal, 1 month and 3 months after removal were 95, 91, and 82%, respectively, in the MCI group, and 100, 87, and 87% in the BCI group. The BCI group had better success rates but failed to reach a significant difference (p = 0.49, p = 0.67, p = 0.24, respectively). After analyzing with binary logistic regression, the implant material was demonstrated as the predictive of surgical success (p = 0.045). There was no significant difference in success rates between patients with dacryocystitis and those without dacryocystitis. We conclude that endoscopic DCR with pushed BCI is easily manipulated and has a promising surgical outcome over pulled MCI. Stent indwelling duration as well as history of dacryocystitis have less influence on the success rates.",,2196

However, high HCV reinfection rates have been reported among the high-risk population. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the HCV reinfection rate after successful treatment of HIV-1 coinfected MSM populations. Bibliographic databases were searched and a random-effect model was utilized to calculate the pooled HCV reinfection rate. Sub-group and meta-regression were used to explore heterogeneity among selected studies. A funnel plot and Egger's regression test were performed to estimate the publication bias. Sixteen studies with 9,017.2 person-years (PY) follow-up were included. The overall HCV reinfection rate following successful treatment among HIV-1-infected MSM was 5.27/100 PY (95% CI, 3.98, 6.96). Lower reinfection rates were observed in developed parts of Europe (5.28/100 PY; 95% CI, 3.73, 6.84) and North America (3.92/100 PY; 95% CI, 1.67, 6.17). Reinfection rates among people with HCV test intervals of fewer than 6 months (7.59/100 PY; 95% CI: 5.15, 10.03) were significantly higher than those with more than 6 months test interval (2.88/100 PY; 95% CI: 2.26, 3.50), with an adjusted RR of 1.86 (95% CI, 1.06, 3.13). The adjusted study factors explained 91.03% the of studies' heterogeneity. HCV reinfection rate was high in successfully treated MSM who were coinfected with HIV-1. A shorter HCV test interval may help to explore more HCV reinfections. HCV reinfection rate studies from HIV-1 coinfected MSM in underdeveloped countries are urgently needed.

After 2 months with no new COVID-19 cases in Shenzhen, on August 14, 2020, a supermarket employee living in the Luohu district of Shenzhen was tested positive in a nearby city. She has no any symptoms and signs, with unremarkable laboratory testing and radiological image, so she was soon diagnosed as asymptomatic COVID-19 positive case. Rapid contact tracing revealed that three of her relatives in Shenzhen were infected with COVID-19 and all of them were diagnosed as asymptomatic COVID-19 positive cases. To ensure residents' safety, Luohu hospital group (LHG) mounted a rapid organized response focusing on four measures: local environment management and residents' health monitoring, guidance for resumption of work, education and psychological counseling, and management of patients with fever in outpatient clinics. The LHG being structured as a people-centered, integrated organization responded to residents' medical and psychological needs rapidly, provided 6-hour results for COVID-19 testing, and recleared the city of COVID-19, as evidenced by the processing of 459,381 community samples within 15 days, with universally negative results beyond the originally identified case and her three close relatives.

This cross-sectional study used data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative survey of individuals and families in the US, and included all families with 1 or more members with ASCVD from 2014 to 2018. Analyses were conducted from October 2021 to April 2022. Using accepted definitions, objective financial hardship represented annual out-of-pocket medical expenses exceeding 20% of annual postsubsistence income, and subjective financial hardship represented self-reported problems paying medical bills or paying them over time. Prevalence of financial hardship was identified based on individual definitions and their concordance was assessed. Factors associated with each type of financial hardship were examined using risk-adjusted survey logistic regression. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the odds of subjective financial hardship vs objective financial hardship across subgroups. The association between measures of financial hardship and self-reported deferral of care was also assessed. Among 10 975 families of patients with ASCVD, representing 22.5 million families nationally (mean [SD] age of index individual, 66 [24] years; estimated 54% men]), 37% experienced either objective or subjective financial hardship. This group included 11% (95% CI, 10%-11%) with objective financial hardship, 21% (95% CI, 20%-22%) with subjective financial hardship, and 5% (95% CI, 5%-6%) with both objective and subjective financial hardship. Mean age was 70 (95% CI, 68-71) years vs 61 (95% CI, 60-62) years for index patients in families reporting objective financial hardship only vs subjective financial hardship only, with no difference in sex (50% [95% CI, 46%-54%] of men vs 49% [95% CI, 47%-52%] of women). In risk-adjusted analyses, among families of patients with ASCVD, patient age of 65 years or older was associated with lower odds of subjective financial hardship than objective financial hardship (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20-0.76), whereas higher income (OR, 6.08; 95% CI, 3.93-9.42 for an income of >100%-200% of the federal poverty level [FPL] vs ≤100% of the FPL and OR, 20.46; 95% CI, 11.45-36.56 for >200% of FPL vs ≤100% of FPL), public insurance (OR, 6.60; 95% CI, 4.20-10.37), and being uninsured (OR, 5.36; 95% CI, 2.61-10.98) were associated with higher odds of subjective financial hardship than objective financial hardship. Subjective financial hardship alone was associated with significantly higher adjusted odds of self-reporting deferred or forgone care compared with objective financial hardship alone (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.79-4.06). In this cross-sectional study of US adults, 2 in 5 families of patients with ASCVD experienced health care-related financial hardship, but a focus on objective or subjective measures alone would have captured only half the burden and not identified those deferring health care. The findings suggest that a comprehensive framework that evaluates both objective and subjective measures is essential to monitor financial consequences of health care.",,2203
1659,35968115,Seed Longevity in Legumes: Deeper Insights Into Mechanisms and Molecular Perspectives.,"Sustainable agricultural production largely depends upon the viability and longevity of high-quality seeds during storage. Legumes are considered as rich source of dietary protein that helps to ensure nutritional security, but associated with poor seed longevity that hinders their performance and productivity in farmer's fields. Seed longevity is the key determinant to assure proper seed plant value and crop yield. Thus, maintenance of seed longevity during storage is of prime concern and a pre-requisite for enhancing crop productivity of legumes. Seed longevity is significantly correlated with other seed quality parameters such as germination, vigor, viability and seed coat permeability that affect crop growth and development, consequently distressing crop yield. Therefore, information on genetic basis and regulatory networks associated with seed longevity, as well as molecular dissection of traits linked to longevity could help in developing crop varieties with good storability. Keeping this in view, the present review focuses towards highlighting the molecular basis of seed longevity, with special emphasis on candidate genes and proteins associated with seed longevity and their interplay with other quality parameters. Further, an attempt was made to provide information on 3D structures of various genetic loci (genes/proteins) associated to seed longevity that could facilitate in understanding the interactions taking place within the seed at molecular level. This review compiles and provides information on genetic and genomic approaches for the identification of molecular pathways and key players involved in the maintenance of seed longevity in legumes, in a holistic manner. Finally, a hypothetical fast-forward breeding pipeline has been provided, that could assist the breeders to successfully develop varieties with improved seed longevity in legumes.",,2204
112,35983341,Quantitative assessment of emphysema and bronchial wall thickness in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: comparison between the eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic phenotypes.,"To perform a quantitative assessment of bronchial wall thickening and the emphysema score in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), comparing the eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic COPD phenotypes. This was a retrospective observational study of patients with COPD followed between August 2018 and July 2019. The patients were divided into two groups by the eosinophil count in peripheral blood: eosinophilic (≥ 300 cells/µL); and non-eosinophilic (< 300 cells/µL). Quantitative, automated assessments of emphysema and bronchial wall thickness were performed by evaluating computed tomography scans of the chest. We evaluated the records of 110 patients diagnosed with COPD: 28 (25.5%) in the eosinophilic group; and 82 (74.5%) in the non-eosinophilic group. The demographic, clinical, functional, and therapeutic variables were comparable between the two groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the emphysema score or bronchial wall thickness (p > 0.05 for both). Patients with eosinophilic COPD do not appear to have lower emphysema scores or greater bronchial wall thickening than do those with non-eosinophilic phenotypes of the disease. Avaliar quantitativamente o escore de enfisema e o espessamento da parede brônquica de pacientes com doença pulmonar obstrutiva crônica (DPOC) estável e comparar os fenótipos eosinofílico e não eosinofílico. Estudo observacional, transversal, retrospectivo, que avaliou pacientes com DPOC no período de agosto de 2018 a julho de 2019. Os pacientes foram separados dois grupos, de acordo com o número de eosinófilos periféricos: os eosinofílicos (≥ 300 células/µL) e os não eosinofílicos (< 300 células/µL). Foram realizadas avaliações quantitativas e automatizadas de enfisema e de espessamento brônquico para os dois grupos por meio de tomografia computadorizada de tórax. Foram coletados dados de 110 pacientes com o diagnóstico de DPOC, dos quais 28 (25,5%) apresentaram perfil eosinofílico. As variáveis demográficas, clínicas, funcionais e terapêuticas do grupo dos pacientes com perfil eosinofílico foram semelhantes às do grupo não eosinofílico. Não se observaram diferenças significativas em relação ao escore de enfisema e à medida de espessura de parede brônquica entre os dois grupos (p > 0,05). Neste estudo, os pacientes com fenótipo eosinofílico não apresentaram menor escore de enfisema e nem maior espessamento parietal brônquico.",,2205
190,35982852,Approaches to kidney replacement therapies-opportunities and challenges.,"One out of seven people develop chronic kidney disease (CKD). When kidney function continues to decline, CKD patients may develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD, or kidney failure). More than 2 out of 1,000 adults develop ESRD and these patients must live on dialysis or get a kidney transplant to survive. Each year, more than $51 billion is spent to treat patients with ESRD in the United States. In addition, ESRD greatly reduces longevity and quality of life for patients. Compared to dialysis, kidney transplant offers the best chance of survival, but few donor organs are available. Thus, there is an urgent need for innovative solutions that address the shortage of kidneys available for transplantation. Here we summarize the status of current approaches that are being developed to solve the shortage of donor kidneys. These include the bioartificial kidney approach which aims to make a portable dialysis device, the recellularization approach which utilizes native kidney scaffold to make an engineered kidney, the stem cell-based approach which aims to generate a kidney de novo by recapitulating normal kidney organogenesis, the xenotransplantation approach which has the goal to make immunocompatible pig kidneys for transplantation, and the interspecies chimera approach which has potential to generate a human kidney in a host animal. We also discuss the interconnections among the different approaches, and the remaining challenges of translating these approaches into novel therapies.",,2206
694,35975482,Evaluation of the hemoptysis item in clinical decision rules for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department.,"Hemoptysis is not common in pulmonary embolism (PE) and lacks specificity for its diagnosis. However, this item is present in different validated scores that estimate the clinical probability of PE. The relevance of this item in clinical decision rules (CDRs) is not clearly established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of removing the hemoptysis item from the PERC, YEARS, and PEGeD CDR in patients with low clinical probability of PE. This was a post hoc analysis of two European prospective cohorts, which included 2968 patients presenting to the ED with a low clinical probability of PE (PROPER and PERCEPIC) and a 3-month follow-up. The primary endpoint was the false-negative rate of a CDR score without the hemoptysis item. Secondary endpoints included the potential reduction of chest imaging if the item hemoptysis was to be removed and risk stratification of the Geneva and Wells scores without the hemoptysis item. Of 2968 patients included (mean ± SD age 46 ± 18 years, 53% female), 87 patients (3%) had a PE diagnosed at 3 months. A total of 2908 were followed-up at 3 months and analyzed. Using the PERC rule with and without the hemoptysis item, there were 13 and 14 missed cases of PE, respectively (failure rate 0.45% [95% CI 0.25%-0.78%] and 0.48% [95% CI 0.27%-0.82%]). Using the YEARS strategy, there were 11 missed PE cases with or without the hemoptysis item (false-negative rate 0.57% [95% CI 0.30%-1.05%]). With the PERC and YEARS rule, removing the hemoptysis item would have led to a 1% reduction in chest imaging. The PEGeD strategy was not modified by the removal of the hemoptysis item. The hemoptysis item could be safely removed from the PERC, YEARS, and PEGeD CDRs. However, there was no subsequent clinically relevant reduction of chest imaging.",,2207
525,35978734,Diabetes Mellitus is Associated With Higher COVID-19 Mortality Rates in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The rate of COVID-19-related mortality among patients with diabetes mellitus in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is unknown. The current study aimed to determine the mortality rate of COVID-19 among diabetes patients in SSA. We performed a systematic review of research articles until July 1, 2021. A literature review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines to gather relevant data. A random effects model was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used Egger's tests and Begg's funnel plot to examine publication bias. The mortality rate of 7778 COVID-19 patients was analyzed using data from seven studies. The I2 test was used to determine the heterogeneity between studies. The meta-analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus was linked to a 1.39-fold increase in the risk of death among COVID-19 inpatients (95% CI: 1.02-1.76). According to our findings, there was no significant heterogeneity between studies, and there was no publication bias. The present review describes an association between diabetes mellitus and the risk of COVID-19 mortality in SSA.",,2208
2043,35967536,"Correlation of AKI with Risk Factors, Ventilatory Support, Renal Replacement Therapy in a Cohort of COVID-19 Patients.","There is a scarcity of information on the incidence and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients in India. Therefore, we analyzed the correlation of AKI risk factors, ventilatory support, and renal replacement therapy and compared the outcomes of first and second COVID-19 waves in this tertiary care center. We retrospectively analyzed the patients' medical records with a positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 between July 2020 and May 2021. We looked at the clinical outcomes of the first and second COVID-19 waves and documented the frequency, risk factors for AKI, and the relationship between AKI and in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate binomial logistic regression yielded odds ratios for the risk variables of AKI. Risk differences and age-adjusted odds ratios, as well as 99.5% confidence intervals, were used to compare COVID-19 outcomes between the first and second waves. Of the 1260 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 86 (6.8%) presented with AKI and 8 (0.7%) patients required dialysis. The most common comorbidity was diabetes mellitus (55.2%), hypertension (42.1%), hypothyroidism (11.3%), and coronary artery disease (8.1%). A total of 229 (18.17%) patients were admitted to ICU, 574 (45.5%) received ventilation, and 26 (2.0%) required mechanical ventilation.The incidence of in-hospital death in the patients with AKI as per the stage from 1 to 3 was 9 (15.8%), 7 (35%), and 5 (55.6%), respectively.Compared to the first wave, the second wave cohort had a lower risk of AKI (adj OR: 0.426; CI: 0.232-0.782) and mortality (adj OR: 0.252; CI: 0.090-0.707). In our study, AKI prevalence was 6.8%, the need for ventilation was 45.5%, ECMO 0.2%, and the mortality rate 2.9%. Second wave of COVID-19 exhibits improved clinical outcomes compared to the first wave.",,2209
2442,35966854,Interventions to reduce the incidence of medical error and its financial burden in health care systems: A systematic review of systematic reviews.,"Improving health care quality and ensuring patient safety is impossible without addressing medical errors that adversely affect patient outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to correctly estimate the incidence rates and implement the most appropriate solutions to control and reduce medical errors. We identified such interventions. We conducted a systematic review of systematic reviews by searching four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid Medline, and Embase) until January 2021 to elicit interventions that have the potential to decrease medical errors. Two reviewers independently conducted data extraction and analyses. Seventysix systematic review papers were included in the study. We identified eight types of interventions based on medical error type classification: overall medical error, medication error, diagnostic error, patients fall, healthcare-associated infections, transfusion and testing errors, surgical error, and patient suicide. Most studies focused on medication error (66%) and were conducted in hospital settings (74%). Despite a plethora of suggested interventions, patient safety has not significantly improved. Therefore, policymakers need to focus more on the implementation considerations of selected interventions.",,2210
138,35983262,The Impact of Standardized Infectious Diseases Consultation on Postsplenectomy Care and Outcomes.,"Patients who receive splenectomy are at risk for overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI). Guidelines recommend that adult asplenic patients receive a complement of vaccinations, education on the risks of OPSI, and on-demand antibiotics. However, prior literature suggests that a majority of patients who have had a splenectomy receive incomplete asplenic patient care and thus remain at increased risk. This study assessed the impact of standardized involvement of infectious diseases (ID) providers on asplenic patient care outcomes in patients undergoing splenectomy. A quasi-experimental study design compared a prospective cohort of patients undergoing splenectomy from August 2017 to June 2021 who received standardized ID involvement in care of the asplenic patient with a historic control cohort of patients undergoing splenectomy at the same institution from January 2010 through July 2017 who did not. There were 11 components of asplenic patient care defined as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of OPSI, death, and death from OPSI. Fifty patients were included in the prospective intervention cohort and 128 in the historic control cohort. There were significant improvements in 9 of the 11 primary outcomes in the intervention arm as compared with the historic controls. Survival analysis showed no statistically significant difference in the incidence of OPSI-free survival between the groups (P = .056), though there was a trend toward improvement in the prospective intervention arm. Standardized involvement of an ID provider in the care of patients undergoing splenectomy improves asplenic patient care outcomes. Routine involvement of ID in this setting may be warranted.",,2211
1951,35967656,Risky business: A mixed methods study of decision-making regarding COVID-19 risk at a public university in the United States.,"Until vaccines became available in late 2020, our ability to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within countries depended largely on voluntary adherence to mitigation measures. However, individual decision-making regarding acceptable COVID-19 risk is complex. To better understand decision-making regarding COVID-19 risk, we conducted a qualitative substudy within a larger Berkeley COVID-19 Safe Campus Initiative (BCSCI) during the summer of 2020, and completed a mixed-methods analysis of factors influencing decision-making. We interviewed 20 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 10 who remained negative, and analyzed quantitative survey data from 3,324 BCSCI participants. The BCSCI study enrolled university-affiliated people living in the local area during summer of 2020, collected data on behaviors and attitudes toward COVID-19, and conducted SARS-CoV-2 testing at baseline and endline. At baseline, 1362 students (57.5%) and 285 non-students (35.1%) said it had been somewhat or very difficult to comply with COVID-19-related mandates. Most-cited reasons were the need to go out for food/essentials, difficulty of being away from family/friends, and loneliness. Eight interviewees explicitly noted they made decisions partially because of others who may be at high risk. We did not find significant differences between the behaviors of students and non-students. Despite prevailing attitudes about irresponsibility of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, students in our study demonstrated a commitment to making rational choices about risk behavior, not unlike non-students around them. Decision-making was driven by perceived susceptibility to severe disease, need for social interaction, and concern about risk to others. A harm reduction public health approach may be beneficial.",,2212
702,35975301,Transition to practice programs for newly graduated advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants: a scoping review protocol.,"The objective of this scoping review is to map the evidence on transition to practice programs for newly graduated advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants, and describe how they differ. Additional objectives include summarizing what outcomes are evaluated and what gaps remain within the literature. By consolidating this information, health care administrators may more easily reference transition to practice methods to enhance their own programs for advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants. Transition to practice involves two program types: onboarding and postgraduate training. However, no existing reviews describe the state of the literature regarding these program types, and how they compare with regard to location, setting, and outcomes. Because transition to practice programs may improve workforce outcomes, understanding how these programs differ, and what gaps exist, is needed to help these programs grow. This review will include articles describing transition to practice for advanced practice registered nurses and/or physician assistants, including onboarding and fellowship/residency programs. Articles will be included regardless of geographic location if they take place within a professional, clinical setting. The scoping review will follow the JBI approach. Databases to be searched include MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Scopus, and Web of Science. All included manuscripts will be screened by two reviewers and relevant data will be extracted. These data will summarize what transition to practice programs are used, how they differ, and what gaps exist.",,2213
367,35979307,Diagnostic accuracy of ≥ 16-slice spiral computed tomography for local staging of colon cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide with high mortality and is classified as a single entity, although colon cancer and rectal cancer have largely different diagnoses, treatments, surgical methods, and recurrence rates. ≥ 16-slice spiral computed tomography (SCT) is mostly applied to detect the local stage of colon cancer; however, its diagnostic accuracy and whether it is conducive to distinguishing between high-risk and low-risk colon cancer are unclear. To systematically review the diagnostic accuracy of ≥ 16-slice SCT for local staging of colon cancer. Based on the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases, computers were used to search the literature from the establishment of the database to April 2021, and the results of the diagnostic tests on ≥ 16-slice SCT for local staging of colon cancer were collected according to the inclusion criteria. The data were then extracted and assessed on the basis of the Quality Assessment Checklist of the Institute of Economics of Canada, Reference Citation Analysis (https://www.referencecitationanalysis.com/). Afterward, a meta-analysis was performed using the statistical software Meta-disc 14.0 and Stata 15.0. Eleven studies that provided data on 1613 subjects with computed tomography diagnostic tests were included in this study. Meta-analysis revealed that the pooled sensitivity, pooled specificity, pooled negative likelihood ratio (LR), pooled diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the fitted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of ≥ 16-slice SCT for colon cancer T staging were 0.67 (95%CI: 0.65-0.70), 0.81 (95%CI: 0.80-0.83), 4.13 (95%CI: 2.66-6.41), 0.39 (95%CI: 0.31-0.49), 10.81 (95%CI: 7.33-15.94), and 0.829, respectively, while the specificity, negative LR, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the fitted ROC curve of ≥ 16-slice SCT for N staging of colon cancer were 0.54 (95%CI: 0.49-0.59), 0.74 (95%CI: 0.70-0.77), 1.92 (95%CI: 1.36-2.70), 0.67 (95%CI: 0.51-0.87), 3.74 (95%CI: 1.76-7.94), and 0.829 respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 16-slice SCT for colon cancer T staging were acceptable, while the sensitivity for colon cancer N staging was relatively low, though its specificity was acceptable. ≥ 16-slice SCT for local staging of colon cancer has good diagnostic value; however, the accuracy needs to be confirmed by further clinical practice.",,2214
399,35979275,Risk Factors for Predicting Lymph Node Metastasis in Submucosal Colorectal Cancer.,"The cornerstone of treating colorectal cancer (CRC) is generally a surgical resection with lymph node (LN) dissection. The tools for predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM) in submucosal (SM) CRC are useful to avoid unnecessary surgical resection. Retrospectively, we analyzed 526 consecutive patients with SM CRC who underwent surgical resection at the Osaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka University Hospital, and Minoh City Hospital, Japan, between 1984 and 2012. The Osaka International Cancer Institute group and the Osaka University Hospital group were randomly divided into a training set and a test set of 2:1. The prediction model was validated in Minoh City Hospital. We partitioned patients using three risk factors involved in the presence or absence of LNM in SM CRC: lymphatic invasion (Ly), budding grade (BD) and the depth of submucosal invasion (DSI) (cut-off value 2789 μm) that were significantly different in the multivariate analysis. As a result, a predictive model of LNM <5% when Ly negative and DSI <2789 μm was evaluated. We similarly partitioned by DSI 3000 μm as easy-to-evaluate values in clinical use. We developed the additional model for predicting LNM is 1.05%, that is, LNM <5%, when there are Ly negative and DSI <3000 μm. As a limitation, only patients who underwent surgical resection were included in this study. This predictive model could help clinicians and CRC patients decide on the additional surgery required after endoscopic resection.",,2215

We performed a bibliometric analysis on research documents on perinatal mental health from 1900 to 2020. Web of Science was used to download bibliometric data. Search strategy used generic index terms with specific free text searches using AND as Boolean function. For example, psycho AND perinatal. Microsoft Excel was used to identify research growth, geographical and research institutes contribution to research in the field. Citation analysis was done using VOSviewer. A total of 11,081 articles were extracted. The most cited research was by Cox et al., which introduced Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. There was exponential increase in the research documents from 1990 to 2020. However, most of the research was contributed by the global north. Among emerging countries, India, South Africa, and Brazil did not contribute in the perinatal research. Postnatal depression and its risk factors were most studied themes. Paternal perinatal mental health and impact on mental health of children were understudied themes. Perinatal mental health research outpaced growth in biomedical research in the past 30 years. The work of leading researcher in the field was initially inspired by his experience in Uganda encountering postnatal depression. However, even after half a century, there is still less contribution from developing countries. This analysis highlights research and possibly access to services inequities in developing countries.",,2216

A cross-sectional study was carried out among university students at the Lebanese University between March 30, 2020, and April 4, 2020. Information on socio-demographic data, knowledge, practice, and additional information concerning COVID-19 were collected. Our survey showed that the majority of the students had good knowledge 90.8%, and more than two third of the respondents 78.6% reported good practice regarding COVID-19. Graduate students were more knowledgeable compared to undergraduate students (unstandardized beta 0.349 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.165 to 0.533; p-value < 0.0001). Moreover, male students had a negative impact on good practice compared to females (unstandardized beta -0.280 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -0.402 to -0.159; p-value < 0.0001). Nearly half of the students (55.2%) reported that their food intake has increased, and 82.5% of the students didn't practice sport during the quarantine. The most common information source of the students was the television (63.3%) followed by social media (53.9%). This study offers useful insights into the knowledge and practices of Lebanese university students towards COVID-19. Our findings support the importance to deliver health education campaign by the ministry of public health through television and social media to improve the knowledge on disease transmission and preventive measures.",,2217
1223,35971490,Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty for keratoconus: Elements for success.,"Advanced keratoconus may require keratoplasty when the patient can no longer achieve functional vision with glasses and contact lenses. Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) has become the surgical treatment of choice due to its undisputed advantages over penetrating keratoplasty including the reduced risk of intraoperative complications, the absence of endothelial immune rejection, and the longer graft survival. Albeit big-bubble DALK still represents the most popular surgical method, several modifications have been developed over the years. This allowed standardization of the technique, with improved success rates and clinical outcomes. This review presents an overview on the literature on DALK surgery for keratoconus. We discuss state-of-the art surgical techniques, current evidence on the clinical outcomes and complications as well as possible future directions.",,2218

Among men 50 years of age or older, risk factor and residential history data (1975 to 1994) were collected from 1,420 prostate cancer cases and 1,424 controls. Three methods were used to estimate the residential mean exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 during this period: (1) satellite-derived observations; (2) satellite-derived observations scaled with historical fixed-site measurements; and (3) a national land-use regression (LUR) model. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in relation to interquartile range (IQR) increases in PM2.5 and NO2 were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for personal and contextual factors. We found positive associations between exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 over the previous 20 years and prostate cancer. An IQR increase in PM2.5 (3.56 µg/m3 for satellite and 4.48 µg/m3 for scaled satellite observations) yielded ORs of 1.28 (95% CI = 1.07, 1.52) and 1.20 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.40), respectively. For NO2, IQR increases (1.45 ppb for satellite, 15.18 ppb for scaled satellite-derived information, and 15.39 ppb for the national LUR) were associated with ORs of 1.09 (95% CI = 0.95, 1.24), 1.21 (95% CI = 1.02, 1.43), and 1.19 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.38), respectively. Our findings support the hypothesis that ambient air pollution increases the risk of prostate cancer.",,2221

1837,35967803,Association between dietary acid load and cancer risk and prognosis: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,"Epidemiological studies have suggested that dietary acid load (DAL) might be related to the risk and prognosis of cancer, whereas the evidence is contentious. Several high-quality observational studies have been published following a prior systematic review with only one study included. Consequently, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively investigate the relationship between DAL and cancer risk and prognosis. A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception to 26 October 2021. Summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs were calculated using a random-effects model. Publication bias, subgroup, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Ten observational studies (six cohorts and four case-control studies) with 227,253 participants were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The summary RRs revealed a statistically significant associations between DAL and cancer risk (RR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.23-2.05, I 2 = 71.9%, n = 7) and prognosis (RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.10-2.13, I 2 = 77.1%, n = 3). No evidence of publication bias was observed in the current analysis. Positive associations were observed in most subgroup analyses stratified by predefined factors, including region, study design, study quality, study population, participants' gender, age of participants, cancer type, DAL assessment indicator, and adjustment of potential confounding parameters. No evidence of heterogeneity between subgroups was indicated by meta-regression analyses. The high DAL might be associated with an increased risk of cancer, as well as a poor prognosis of cancer. More high-quality prospective studies are warranted to further determine the associations between DAL and risk and prognosis for specific cancers.",,2223

2434,35966862,Hotspots and future directions in rheumatoid arthritis-related cardiovascular disease: A scientometric and visualization study from 2001 to 2021 based on Web of Science.,"The morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is significantly higher than those in the general population, leading to RA-related CVD has attracted broad attention and numerous articles have been published. However, no study has systematically examined this area from a scientometric perspective. This study aimed to visualize the knowledge structure and identify emerging research trends and potential hotspots in this field. Articles and reviews on RA-CVD published from 2001 to 2021 were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database. CiteSpace and VOSviewer software were used to visualize the knowledge network of countries, institutions, authors, references and keywords in this field. SPSS and Microsoft Excel software were used for curve fitting and correlation analysis. A total of 2,618 articles and reviews were included. The number of publications about RA-related CVD significantly increased yearly. Publications were mainly concentrated in North America, Europe and East Asia. The United States contributed most with 699 publications, followed by the United Kingdom and Italy. Gross Domestic Product was an important factor affecting scientific output. University of Manchester and Professor Kitas George D. were the most prolific institutions and influential authors, respectively. Journal of Rheumatology was the most productive journal for RA-related CVD research. The research hotspots switched in the order of clinical features (cardiovascular events), mechanism exploration, anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, risk factors, and antirheumatic drug safety, which can be observed from the keyword analysis and co-cited reference cluster analysis. This study found that research on RA-related CVD is flourishing. The safety and cardiovascular pharmacological mechanisms of anti-rheumatoid drugs, especially targeted synthetic DMARDs, would be the focus of current research and developmental trends in future research.",,2225
411,35979247,Guidelines in Gastroenterology: Careful Interpretation Is Essential.,"Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) contain recommendations that aim to guide physicians in the diagnosis of and therapeutic approach toward patients affected by gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. These CPG systematically combine scientific evidence and clinical judgment, culminating in recommendations that have been shown to improve patient care. European and North American guidelines published in the area of gastroenterology in 2018 and 2019 were considered for inclusion. To standardize the results, only guidelines that used GRADE as an evidence system were included. Thus, in the end, 1,233 recommendations from 29 guidelines published between 2018 and 2019 were analyzed. Of the 1,233 recommendations collected, 324 (26.3%) had a low level of evidence and 127 (10.3%) had a very low level of evidence, indicating little evidence or expert opinion. Of the 29 publications analyzed, 14 (48.3%) did not present any recommendation with a high level of evidence. Regarding the 1,233 individual recommendations expressed in these 29 publications, only 336 (27.25%) assumed a high level of evidence, with 277 (82.44%) referring to liver pathology. Of the recommendations evaluated, 77 were from North American societies and the remaining 1,156 were European recommendations. In relation to the first group, only 3 (3.9%) had a high level of evidence belonging to the Guidelines for Sedation and Anesthesia in GI Endoscopy. More than 25% of all recommendations currently accepted to guide patients with gastroenterological disorders are based on low-quality evidence or expert opinion. Thus, these documents should guide our performance, but clinical sense and multidisciplinarity must not be overlooked in dubious cases and with weak scientific evidence. Research should focus on the development of randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews to improve the evidence supporting the guidelines that guide clinical practice. As diretrizes que orientam a prática clínica contêm recomendações de forma a que os médicos possam determinar os cuidados mais adequados para cada paciente. Estas diretrizes combinam evidências científicas com o julgamento clínico, culminando em recomendações destinadas a otimizar a prestação de cuidados. Diretrizes publicadas na área de Gastroenterologia entre 2018 e 2019 foram consideradas para inclusão.Para padronizar os resultados, apenas diretrizes usando o GRADE como um sistema de evidência foram incluídas. Assim, foram analisadas 1,233 recomendações de 29 diretrizes publicadas entre 2018–2019. Das 1,233 recomendações incluídas, 334 (26.3%) apresentavam um nível de evidência baixo e 127 (10.3%) um nível de evidência muito baixo, indicando pouca evidência ou mesmo opinião de especialistas. Das 29 publicações analisadas, 14 (48,3%) não apresentavam nenhuma recomendação com alto nível de evidência. Em relação às 1,233 recomendações incluídas nas 29 publicações, apenas 336 (27.25%) assumiam alto nível de evidência, sendo 277 (82.44%) referentes à patologia hepática. Das recomendações avaliadas, 77 eram de sociedades norteamericanas e as restantes 1,156 recomendações europeias.Em relação ao primeiro grupo, apenas 3 (3,9%) possuíam alto nível de evidência e pertenciam às “Diretrizes para sedação e anestesia em endoscopia gastrointestinal.”. Mais de 25% de todas as recomendações atualmente aceites para orientar pacientes com patologias gastrointestinais são baseadas em evidências de baixa qualidade ou opinião de especialistas. Estes documentos devem orientar a nossa forma de atuar, mas o senso clínico e a abordagem multidisciplinar não devem ser esquecidos em casos duvidosos e com evidência científica fraca. A investigação deve concentrar-se no desenvolvimento de ensaios clínicos randomizados e revisões sistemáticas para melhorar as evidências que apoiam as diretrizes que orientam a prática clínica.",,2226

A 26-year-old male was diagnosed with COVID-19 and acute kidney injury. His kidney biopsy was suggestive of thrombotic microangiopathy. Five sessions of plasmapheresis were done but were discontinued in view of nonrecovery of kidney function. He was then referred for a kidney transplant. On genetic analysis, he was found to have mutations in the complement system (CFHR1 and CFHR3), which suggested this was a case of aHUS precipitated by COVID-19. In view of the high risk of recurrence of the primary disease in live-related kidney donor transplantation, he was advised for simultaneous liver and kidney transplants.",,2227
433,35979151,Diagnostic value of 3.0 T versus 1.5 T MRI in staging prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To compare the diagnostic performance of 3.0 T and 1.5 T MRI in the staging of prostate cancer. English-language studies on the diagnostic accuracy of 3.0 T and 1.5 T MRI in prostate cancer staging published through May 2020 were searched for in relevant databases. The focus was on studies in which both 3.0 T and 1.5 T MRI were performed in the study population, to reduce interstudy heterogeneity. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were determined for 3.0 T and for 1.5 T along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Out of 8 studies identified, 4 met the inclusion criteria. 3.0 T (n = 160) had a pooled sensitivity of 69.5% (95% CI: 56.4-80.1%) and a pooled specificity of 48.8% (95% CI: 6.0-93.4%), while 1.5 T (n = 139) had a pooled sensitivity of 70.6% (95% CI: 55.0-82.5%; p = 0.91) and a pooled specificity of 41.7% (95% CI: 6.2-88.6%; p = 0.88). The pooled DOR for 3.0 T was 3 (95% CI: 0-26.0%), while the pooled DOR for 1.5 T was 2 (95% CI: 0-18.0%), which was not a significant difference (p = 0.89). 3.0 T has slightly better diagnostic performance than 1.5 T MRI in prostate cancer staging (3 vs. 2), although without statistical significance. Our findings suggest the need for larger, randomized trials directly comparing 3.0 T and 1.5 T MRI in prostate cancer.",,2228
418,35979196,Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and COVID-19 have increased rates of arterial thrombosis.,"Both coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are associated with systemic inflammation and risk of thrombosis. Risk of thrombosis in patients with COVID with and without MPNs has not been extensively studied. Retrospective cohort study of 44 patients with MPNs and 1114 patients without MPNs positive for SARS-COV-2. Outcomes were arterial thrombosis (AT), venous thromboembolism (VTE), bleeding, and death. Time-to-event analysis was performed using competing risk regression model and Cox proportional hazards. AT occurred more frequently in patients with MPN (7% vs. 1%, p = 0.03). Rates of VTE (7% vs. 5%, p = 0.73), bleeding (7% vs. 2%, p = 0.06), and death (9% vs. 6%, p = 0.32) were similar. MPN patients were older and had more cardiovascular comorbidities. After time-to-event competing-risk regression adjusting for age, MPN patients had higher risk of AT (subdivision hazards ratio 3.95, 95% CI 1.09-14.39) but not VTE, bleeding, or death. Among patients with COVID-19, MPN patients had higher risk of arterial thrombosis but not VTE, bleeding, and death compared with non-MPN patients. Larger studies are needed to confirm our findings given the limited sample size.",,2229
1287,35970727,"COVID-19 perceptions and vaccine hesitancy: Acceptance, attitude, and barriers among Cameroonians.","Information about Cameroonians' views toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and amenability to receiving a vaccine is emerging. Learning more about Cameroonians' vaccine perspectives could guide prevention messaging and facilitate optimal communication modalities. The primary objective of this study was to analyze the willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among Cameroonians, pending availability. The secondary objectives were to assess perceptions of COVID-19's origin and to gauge views toward government-mandated vaccinations. An 11-item questionnaire queried Cameroonians in-person and online, from March through May 2021, about their demographics and whether they believed that COVID-19 was man-made, whether COVID-19 vaccinations should be governmentally mandated, and whether they would receive a COVID-19 vaccine, if available. A free-text option inviting rationales for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was included. In-person participation took place on the grounds of St. Louis University in Douala, Cameroon, and was restricted to participants lacking Internet access or electronic mobile devices. Online participation included use of an electronic link that contained questionnaire content located within Google Forms. A total of 591 respondents participated by replying to at least 8 items on the questionnaire, 386 online and 205 in-person. Over 80% stated that they previously received a seasonal influenza vaccine. Roughly, 87% reported unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, if available. Approximately 95% of respondents disagreed with governmental mandates on COVID-19 vaccinations. About 75% attributed COVID-19 to man-made as opposed to natural beginnings. Seven respondents' free-text comments cited lacking confidence in a COVID-19 vaccine, discriminatory COVID-19 vaccine distribution patterns in other parts of the world relative to Africa, and improper COVID-19 vaccine approval timeline. Raising awareness of COVID-19 misconceptions and barriers to vaccine acceptance is integral to accomplishing immunization goals. Cameroonians' pessimism in this study toward COVID-19 vaccination was multifaceted. Our findings signal a need for additional research that requests more qualitative insights, for example, interviews, focus groups, into vaccine aversion.",,2230
1323,35970018,Being a health care professional in the ICU serving patients with covid-19: A qualitative study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a great deal of strain on healthcare providers across the world. There has been no research into the experiences of health care providers in Turkey caring for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. To explain the experiences of health care providers who provide services to patients with Covid-19 in an intensive care unit. This study used a phenomenological approach to recruit 15 participants (10 nurses and 5 physicians). The data was gathered through semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted face-to-face. The four primary themes that came up in the results were COVID-19: the unidentified enemy, front-line struggle, psychological struggle, and invasion of social life. During the epidemic, health care providers encountered several psychological, physical, social, and professional difficulties. All health care personnel must receive information and skills training on what to do in crisis and risk circumstances such as infectious disease, decision-making, anxiety management, and problem-solving during pandemics.",,2231

430,35979154,Update on the limited sensitivity of computed tomography relative to RT-PCR for COVID-19: a systematic review.,"The global and ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has compelled the need for timely and reliable methods of detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been widely accepted as a reference standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, several early studies have suggested the superior sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a previous systematic review, we stratified studies based on risk for bias to evaluate the true sensitivity of CT for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study revisits our prior analysis, incorporating more current data to assess the sensitivity of CT for COVID-19. The PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for relevant articles published between 1 January 2020, and 25 April 2021. Exclusion criteria included lack of specification regarding whether the study cohort was adult or paediatric, whether patients were symptomatic or asymptomatic, and not identifying the source of RT-PCR specimens. Ultimately, 62 studies were included for systematic review and were subsequently stratified by risk for bias using the QUADAS-2 quality assessment tool. Sensitivity data were extracted for random effects meta-analyses. The average sensitivity for COVID-19 reported by the high-risk-of-bias studies was 68% [CI: 58, 80; range: 38-96%] for RT-PCR and 91% [CI: 87, 96; range: 47-100%] for CT. The average sensitivity reported by the low-risk-of-bias studies was 84% [CI: 0.75, 0.94; range: 70-97%] for RT-PCR and 78% [CI: 71, 0.86; range: 44-92%] for CT. On average, the high-risk-of bias studies underestimated the sensitivity of RT-PCR and overestimated the sensitivity of CT for COVID-19. Given the incorporation of recently published low-risk-of-bias articles, the sensitivities according to low-risk-of-bias studies for both RT-PCR and CT were higher than previously reported.",,2233
1470,35968428,The relationship between polycystic ovary syndrome and insulin resistance from 1983 to 2022: A bibliometric analysis.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common clinical disease often associated with insulin resistance (IR). The interaction between PCOS and IR will promote the progress of PCOS and the risk of related complications, harm women's physical and mental health, and increase the social and economic burden. PCOS IR-related works of literature were retrieved through the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) Database and imported into VOSviewer and CiteSpace, respectively, in plain text format to conduct the literature visualization analysis of authors, countries, institutions, highly cited works of literature, and keywords, aiming to reveal the hot spots and trends of PCOS IR fields. A total of 7,244 articles were retrieved from 1900 to 2022. Among them, the United States has made the largest contribution. Diamanti-Kandarakis E was the author with the most publications, and the University of Athens was the institution with most publications. Keyword analysis showed that PCOS interacts with IR mainly through sex-hormone binding globulin, luteinizing hormone, insulin-like growth factor, oxidative stress, and other mechanisms. In addition, the complications of PCOS complicated with IR are also the focus of researchers' attention. Through bibliometric analysis, this paper obtains the research hotspot and trend of PCOS IR fields, which can provide a reference for subsequent research.",,2234
1796,35967859,Clinical relevance of molecular testing methods in the diagnosis and guidance of therapy in patients with staphylococcal empyema: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Efficient detection tools for determining staphylococcal pleural infection are critical for its eradication. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the diagnostic utility of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in suspected empyema cases to identify staphylococcal strains and avoid unnecessary empiric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) therapy. From inception to July 24, 2021, relevant records were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The quality of studies was determined using the QUADAS-2 tool. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve for NAAT's diagnostic performance were evaluated using an HSROC model. Eight studies comprising 424 samples evaluated NAAT accuracy for Staphylococcus aureus (SA) identification, while four studies comprising 317 samples evaluated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) identification. The pooled NAAT summary estimates for detection of both SA (sensitivity: 0.35 (95% CI 0.19-0.55), specificity: 0.95 (95% CI 0.92-0.97), PLR: 7.92 (95% CI 4.98-12.59), NLR: 0.44 (95% CI 0.14-1.46), and DOR: 24.0 (95% CI 6.59-87.61) ) and MRSA (sensitivity: 0.45 (95% CI 0.15-0.78), specificity: 0.93 (95% CI 0.89-0.95), PLR: 10.06 (95% CI 1.49-67.69), NLR: 0.69 (95% CI 0.41-1.15), and DOR: 27.18 (95% CI 2.97-248.6) ) were comparable. The I 2 statistical scores for MRSA and SA identification sensitivity were 13.7% and 74.9%, respectively, indicating mild to substantial heterogeneity. PCR was frequently used among NAA tests, and its diagnostic accuracy coincided well with the overall summary estimates. A meta-regression and subgroup analysis of country, setting, study design, patient selection, and sample condition could not explain the heterogeneity (meta-regression P = 0.66, P = 0.46, P = 0.98, P = 0.68, and P = 0.79, respectively) in diagnostic effectiveness. Our study suggested that the diagnostic accuracy of NAA tests is currently inadequate to substitute culture as a principal screening test. NAAT could be used in conjunction with microbiological culture due to the advantage of faster results and in situations where culture tests are not doable.",,2235

1448,35968450,Rates and Determinants of Retention on ART Among Orphans and Vulnerable Children Living With HIV in Tanzania.,"Despite the global progress in response to HIV and AIDS, notable challenges remain for children, especially identification, linkage, and retention in HIV care and treatment services. To succeed in pediatric HIV programming requires the linkage and retention of the children in those services over time. This study assessed the level of retention to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and its associated factors among orphans and vulnerable children living with HIV (OVCLHIV) in Tanzania. Data were obtained from the USAID Kizazi Kipya project that collected pediatric ART data from October 2017 to October 2019 in 81 district councils of Tanzania. Community-based volunteers supported the linkage and retention of the OVCLHIV on ART. Analysis of on-ART status was conducted in a cohort of OVCLHIV aged 0-20 years enrolled in the project and monitored for 24 months. OVCLHIV who remained on ART until the end of the follow-up period were referred to as retained, otherwise, not retained. Multivariable analysis was conducted using logistic regression, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Of the 5,304 OVCLHIV analyzed, the mean age was 13.1 years, 51.5% were female, and 72.2% were living with female caregivers. Their overall rate of retention on ART over the 24 months was 86.7%. Multivariable analysis showed that as the higher frequency of home visit by the project staff increased, the likelihood of retention increased by 8% [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.11, p < 0.001]. Membership in people living with HIV (PLHIV) support groups was associated with a higher likelihood of retention compared to nonmembership (aOR = 3.31, 95% CI 2.60-4.21, p < 0.001). Children in larger family size were 22% less likely to sustain ART (aOR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.72-0.84, p < 0.001). Urban OVCLHIV were 18% less likely to remain on ART than their rural counterparts (aOR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.98, p = 0.030). Remaining on ART was 49% more likely for OVC in economically better-off households than those in destitute households (aOR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.22-1.81, p < 0.001). Male OVC were 17% less likely to be retained on ART than their female counterparts (aOR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.99, p = 0.033). Community-based OVC support resulted in a high pediatric retention rate over the 24 months of follow-up. While key enablers of retention were higher frequency of home visits by the project volunteer, participation in PLHIV support groups, and better economic status, large family sizes, urban place of residence, and male gender of the OVC were barriers. This study brings useful evidence to inform strategies for advancing retention of OVCLHIV on ART for their better health outcomes and overall wellbeing.",,2237
672,35975540,A Pooled Analysis of the PCR for the Detection of Candida Auris.,"Candida auris is an opportunistic pathogen with multiple drug resistance. Therefore, researchers conducted a meta-analysis to review PCR's ability to diagnose Candida auris to promote the development of accurate Candida auris diagnosis. Researchers systematically retrieved relevant articles from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science. Then, researchers extracted the key data required for the study from the selected articles. Meta-DiSc 1.4 was used for the statistical analysis. RevMan 5.3 was employed to assess the quality of the included literature. A funnel plot can appraise whether the included articles have publication bias. Five articles were included in the study. The results suggest that the pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92 - 0.95) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99 - 0.99), respectively. The positive and negative likelyhood ratios were 100.94 (95% CI: 47.51 - 214.47) and 0.07 (95% CI: 0.05 - 0.10), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio was 1,814.70 (95% CI: 717.30 - 4,591.04), and the area under the SROC curve was 0.9935. Deek's funnel plot indicated that there was no publication bias. The results of the analysis indicate that PCR can become a valuable technique for the clinical diagnosis of Candida auris due to its excellent performance.",,2238
1476,35968421,Prevalence and Determinants of COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Among Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review.,"COVID-19 is a major public health problem that has been seriously affecting the global community. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of infection due to being directly involved in diagnosing and taking care of patients. Due to this, they were prioritized to receive the initial supply of vaccines. However, vaccine hesitancy has been identified as a major global public health threat. Therefore, this review aimed to synthesize pieces of evidence on the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and determinate factors among HCWs. A systematic search of published articles was identified using PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for relevant studies of vaccine acceptance and determinant factors among HCWs. Published articles were identified using abstracts and titles of the articles, and articles were assessed for eligibility criteria. The review process was conducted according to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). An electronic database search identified 365 articles, from which 33 full-text articles were included in the systematic review. In this review, the highest rate of vaccine acceptance was reported at 95% and the lowest rate of vaccine acceptance was found at 21%. Factors such as sex (male), age, profession (medical doctors), and previous influenza vaccination were the main positive predictors for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among HCWs. Concerns about vaccine safety, efficacy, and effectiveness were the main barriers and drivers for vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, to improve the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among HCWs, governments, public health authorities, and private healthcare systems should work together to provide continuous professional development and training on the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine.",,2239
69,35983424,Association Between Diabetes and the Risk of Kidney Cancer: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Diabetes is a risk factor for several types of cancer, but the specific relationship between diabetes and kidney cancer is not well understood. We conducted a search strategy in scientific databases for case-control and cohort studies on this topic. We analyzed 17 studies and found that diabetes was significantly associated with the risk of developing kidney cancer and that this risk was slightly stronger for women and for people living in Asia. These findings were not influenced by obesity, cigarette smoking, or hypertension. We conclude that diabetes is an independent risk factor for the development of kidney cancer.",,2240

After HIV infects the human body, the latent HIV is unable to be recognized by the body's immune system. Currently, the widely adopted antiretroviral therapy (ART) is also unble to eliminate it, thus hindering the progress of HIV treatment. This review discusses the existence of latent HIV vault for HIV treatment, its formation and factors affecting its formation, cell, and tissue localization, methods for detection and removing latent reservoir, to provide a comprehensive understanding of latent HIV vault, in order to assist in the future research and play a potential role in achieving HIV treatment.",,2241
2229,35967264,Interventions for Integrating Behavioral Health Services Into HIV Clinical Care: A Narrative Review.,"The integration of behavioral health services within human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care settings holds promise for improving substance use, mental health, and HIV-related health outcomes for people with HIV. As part of an initiative funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration's HIV/AIDS Bureau, we conducted a narrative review of interventions focused on behavioral health integration (BHI) in HIV care in the United States (US). Our literature search yielded 19 intervention studies published between 2010 and 2021. We categorized the interventions under 6 approaches: collaborative care; screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT); patient-reported outcomes (PROs); onsite psychological consultation; integration of addiction specialists; and integration of buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) treatment. All intervention approaches appeared feasible to implement in diverse HIV care settings and most showed improvements in behavioral health outcomes; however, measurement of HIV outcomes was limited. Future research studies of BHI interventions should evaluate HIV outcomes and assess facilitators and barriers to intervention uptake.",,2242
2044,35967535,A Preemptive Living Donor Renal Transplant in an HIV Positive Patient from an HIV Positive Donor.,"With recent advances in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), renal transplantation is no longer considered a contraindication in properly selected HIV-positive patients. Several studies have demonstrated comparable patient and graft outcomes between HIV-negative and HIV-positive renal transplant recipients. Most of the information on outcomes of HIV-positive to HIV-positive transplantation is based on data from deceased donors. There are only a handful of case reports about living donor renal transplantation in an HIV-positive patient from an HIV-positive donor. Furthermore, there is no report in the world of preemptive living donor renal transplantation in this setting. Here, we report a case of successful preemptive renal transplantation in an HIV-positive recipient from an HIV-positive living donor performed at our center.",,2243
1252,35971363,The Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Primary Care.,"Approximately 30 million Americans suffer from sleep disorders. The incidence of and mortality rates associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been increasing in recent years in the United States. OSA is associated with various health problems, including depression and hypertension, and it adversely affects occupational and academic performance. Hence, OSA is a major public health concern. Sleep specialists may be consulted for the evaluation and treatment of OSA. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the mainstay of OSA treatment. The role of primary care physicians in such a scenario becomes vital, especially for choosing the most suitable approach for each patient, treating comorbidities and risk factors, and, if needed, referring them to sleep specialists for further management. In addition to medical management, primary care physicians serve as the main patient educator on this particular health condition.",,2244
1236,35971402,Copper-Catalyzed Azide-Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC) by Functionalized NHC-Based Polynuclear Catalysts: Scope and Mechanistic Insights.,"Copper(I) [Cu2(μ-Br)2(tBuImCH2pyCH2L)] n (L = OMe, NEt2, NHtBu) compounds supported by flexible functionalized NHC-based polydentate ligands have been prepared in a one-pot procedure by reacting the corresponding imidazolium salt with an excess of copper powder and Ag2O. An X-ray diffraction analysis has revealed that [Cu2(μ-Br)2(tBuImCH2pyCH2NEt2)] n is a linear coordination polymer formed by bimetallic [Cu(μ-Br)]2 units linked by the lutidine-based NHC-py-NEt2 ligand, which acts as a heteroditopic ligand with a 1κC-2κ2 N,N' coordination mode. We propose that the polymeric compounds break down in the solution into more compact tetranuclear [Cu2(μ-Br)2(tBuImCH2pyCH2L)]2 compounds with a coordination mode identical to the functionalized NHC ligands. These compounds have been found to exhibit high catalytic activity in the Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. In particular, [Cu2(μ-Br)2(tBuImCH2pyCH2NEt2)]2 efficiently catalyzes the click reaction of a range of azides and alkynes, under an inert atmosphere at room temperature in neat conditions at a very low catalyst loading, to quantitatively afford the corresponding 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole derivatives in a few minutes. The cycloaddition reaction of benzyl azide to phenylacetylene can be performed at 25-50 ppm catalyst loading by increasing the reaction time and/or temperature. Reactivity studies have shown that the activation of the polynuclear catalyst precursor involves the alkyne deprotonation by the NHC moiety of the polydentate ligand to afford a copper(I)-alkynyl species bearing a functionalized imidazolium ligand. DFT calculations support the participation of the dinuclear species [(CuBr)2(μ-tBuImCH2pyCH2NEt2)], resulting from the fragmentation of the tetranuclear compound, as the catalytically active species. The proposed reaction pathway proceeds through zwitterionic dinuclear intermediates and entails the active participation of both copper atoms, as well as the NHC moiety as an internal base, which activates the reacting alkyne via deprotonation.",0,2245
374,35979300,Isolated cryptococcal osteomyelitis of the ulna in an immunocompetent patient: A case report.,"Cryptococcal osteomyelitis is a bone infection caused by cryptococcus. As an opportunistic infection, bone cryptococcosis usually occurs in patients with immunodeficiency diseases or in those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy and often displays characteristics of disseminated disease. Isolated cryptococcal osteomyelitis is extremely unusual in immunocompetent person. The pathogenic fungus often invades vertebrae, femur, tibia, rib, clavicle, pelvis, and humerus, but the ulna is a rare target. A 79-year-old woman complaining of chronic pain, skin ulceration and a sinus on her right forearm was admitted, and soon after was diagnosed with cryptococcal osteomyelitis in the right ulna. Unexpectedly, she was also found to have apparently normal immunity. After treatment with antifungal therapy combined with surgery debridement, the patient's osteomyelitis healed with a satisfactory outcome. Although rare, cryptococcal osteomyelitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of osteolytic lesions even in immunocompetent patients, and good outcomes can be expected if early definitive diagnosis and etiological treatment are established.",0,2246
683,35975528,Clinical Evaluation of Serum Levels of SARS-CoV-2 Anti-Spike Protein IgG Antibodies in Infected Patients and Vaccinated Subjects.,"The aim was clinical evaluation of immune response against SARS-CoV-2, analyzing serum levels of IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 protein S in infected and vaccinated patients, as well as in subjects with and without frequent comorbidities (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and chronic respiratory disease). Patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by RT-PCR and subjects vaccinated with vaccines based on the mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 protein S were studied. SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG serum levels were quantified by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. There were 79 infected patients with a median age of 53.0 years; 35 women and 44 men; 42 patients with any comorbidities and 37 without comorbidities. The median of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG serum level was 203.4 BAU/mL (11.6 - 5,620.6). The median antibody level in the infected patients with any comorbidities was higher than those without comorbidities. The group of vaccinated subjects included 96 subjects with a median age of 49.5 years; 77 women and 19 men; 31 subjects with any comorbidities and 65 without comorbidities. The median of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG serum levels was 1,145.6 BAU/mL (138.3 - 4,828.1). No significant differences were found in terms of specific or global comorbidities in the vaccinated subjects. SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG serum levels were 5.6 times higher in vaccinated subjects than infected patients. The vaccination produces higher serum antibody levels than SARS-CoV-2 infection. This reinforces the indication for the vaccine in infected patients. These antibodies did not decrease significantly in patients with frequent comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease or chronic respiratory disease.",0,2247
1891,35967719,The effectiveness of remote delivered intervention for loneliness reduction in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Remotely delivered intervention is widely applied to loneliness treatment in older adults, but the effect is controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of remotely delivered intervention on loneliness using a systematic review and meta-analysis. The PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (EBSCO) databases were searched for studies, the search ended on 7 July 2021. Thirteen randomized controlled trials of remotely delivered intervention compared with usual care, brief contact, or no intervention for loneliness were included. A random-effects model measured estimation of loneliness reduction. Furthermore, standardized mean differences (SMDs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), publication bias, and heterogeneity were calculated. Subgroup analysis was used to explore the factors that might affect the treatment effects. The evidence of remotely delivered intervention on loneliness reduction was certain (SMD = -0.41 [95% CI, -0.70 to -0.13]). Media subgroup analysis supported the effectiveness of intervention delivered by video call (SMD = -0.54 [95% CI, -0.83 to -0.25]); treatment strategy subgroup analysis found evidence to support the effectiveness of increasing social support and maladaptive social cognition treatment strategy (SMD = -0.47 [95% CI, -0.77 to -0.18] and SMD = -1.04 [95% CI, -1.98 to -0.10], respectively); participants subgroup analysis shown the effectiveness of intervention for older adults living in LTC and social isolation (SMD = -1.40 [95% CI, -2.43 to -0.36] and SMD = -0.55 [95% CI, -0.74 to -0.36], respectively); group format subgroup analysis testified the effectiveness of intervention carried out in individual format (SMD = -0.39 [95% CI, -0.71 to -0.07]); measurement time points subgroup analysis found the positive effect of intervention at 3 months and 3 to 6 months stage (SMD = -0.33 [95% CI, -0.52 to -0.14] and SMD = -0.32 [95% CI, -0.57 to -0.07], respectively). Significant publication bias was detected (p < 0.05), and the heterogeneity of the studies was substantial. This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that remotely delivered intervention can reduce loneliness in older adults, and it appears to be affected by media type, treatment strategy, participants characteristics, group format, and measurement time points.",0,2248
86,35983397,Endoscopic Resection of Nasal Mucosal Melanoma Using Temporary Transseptal Access.,"Nasal mucosal melanoma (NMM) is a rare tumor with a poor prognosis. Although an endoscopic resection of malignant nasal tumor now becomes a treatment of choice when the surgical margin can be secured, it is still controversial. We report three cases of NMM that was successfully removed en bloc with clear margins by endoscopic surgery with temporal transseptal access. Cases of a 78-year-old woman, an 83-year-old man, and an 81-year-old man with NMM arising from the inferior turbinate who underwent endoscopic resection of the tumor are discussed in detail. We made temporal transseptal access using septal mucosal flaps. We moved the nasal cavity-occupying tumor to the contralateral side to create a working space to perform endoscopic en bloc resections. This technique is simple yet effective and less invasive than open craniofacial resections for removing malignancies arising from the inferior turbinate.",0,2249
1374,35969083,Viral Transgene Expression in Rodent Hearts and the Assessment of Cardiac Arrhythmia Risk.,"Heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Due to their low cost, ease of handling, and abundance of transgenic strains, rodents have become essential models for cardiovascular research. However, spontaneous lethal cardiac arrhythmias that often cause mortality in heart disease patients are rare in rodent models of heart disease. This is primarily due to the species differences in cardiac electrical properties between human and rodents and poses a challenge to the study of cardiac arrhythmias using rodents. This protocol describes an approach to enable efficient transgene expression in mouse and rat ventricular myocardium using echocardiography-guided intramuscular injections of recombinant virus (adenovirus and adeno-associated virus). This work also outlines a method to enable reliable assessment of cardiac susceptibility to arrhythmias using isolated, Langendorff-perfused mouse and rat hearts with both adrenergic and programmed electrical stimulations. These techniques are critical for studying heart rhythm disorders associated with adverse cardiac remodeling after injuries, such as myocardial infarction.",0,2250
1229,35971482,Changing trends in the corneal transplantation and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on corneal transplant recipient selection.,"The aim of this study was to analyze the trends in the major indications and types of keratoplasty over a 15-year period and to determine the effect of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the selection of corneal transplant recipients at a tertiary referral center in Turkey. We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who underwent keratoplasty at the center from January 2006 to March 2021. The keratoplasty indications and types of surgery were evaluated after classification into three groups (period I - January 2006-December 2012; period II - January 2013-March 2020; COVID-19 period - April 2020-March 2021). A total of 5016 corneal transplants were performed in 3862 patients. Lamellar keratoplasty (LK) techniques were found to demonstrate a statistically significantly increasing trend compared to penetrating keratoplasty in the period between 2006 and 2021 (χ2 = 240.55, P < 0.001). The top 4 indications over the 15-year period were aphakic/pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (BK) (1105, 22%), keratoconus (1085, 21.6%), regraft (1084, 21.6%), and keratitis (645, 12.8%). The most common keratoplasty indication during the COVID-19 period was regraft (27, 54.0%), followed by BK (13, 26.0%) and corneal perforation (5, 10%). BK was the most common keratoplasty indication at our clinic during the 15-year period. LK rates have been found to increase in recent years, although still not reaching the rates of developed countries. There was a marked decrease in the number of keratoplasties during the COVID-19 pandemic and patients requiring urgent keratoplasty or those who suffered from a painful eye were prioritized.",0,2251

Due to the advantages of small genome, well elucidated functional genomics, fast life cycle, and high stability, T7 phage has been widely used in many fields, including biology and medicine. In this review, we focus on the research of T7 phages in biological sciences and medicine, including the application of T7 phages and T7 phage products, T7 phage display systems, and recombinant T7 phages in the treatment and diagnosis of infectious diseases (bacteria, viruses, parasites) and tumor diseases. In addition, we also introduce the therapeutic application of T7 phage in various diseases such as allergic reaction, Alzheimer's disease, inflammatory reaction, and other diseases, and finally discuss the future direction of T7 phage application in the biomedical field.",0,2252
405,35979269,"Trends in Treatment for Hemorrhoids, Fistula, and Anal Fissure: Go Along the Current Trends.","Recent trends in benign anal disease treatment are minimizing surgery to preserve normal anorectal anatomical unit and its functions. However, some surgeons still prefer and are confident with the use of conventional solid surgical methods. In this report, we will investigate the recent trends in the treatment for hemorrhoids, fistula, and anal fissure. The practice guidelines of advanced countries, including UK, Italy, France, USA, Japan, and ESCP, are referred to in this review. Opinions suggested in international meetings were also added. In the management of hemorrhoids, surgical treatments and office procedures were recommended according to a patient's status and preference. For the management of complex anal fistula, novel sphincter-preserving surgical techniques are more widely accepted than a sphincter-dividing procedure of immediate repair following fistulectomy. The treatment of anal fissures is well covered in the guidelines of the ASCRS.",0,2253
313,35980625,Looking at Library Resource Usage Trends in Medical Residents & Fellows: Survey Results from 2006-2021.,"Since 2006, the University of Tennessee's Preston Medical Library has collected survey feedback from exiting residents through targeted emails or at the required exit process in the library. Questions ask residents which types of articles or sources they use to find information and address the resident's use of the library's physical space. Survey results from 2006 to 2021 were examined for trends and changes in resident utilization of resources to better inform future library decisions on instruction and marketing. Resident resource usage varied over time and demonstrated an encouraging increase in attention to evidence-based tools. UpToDate's consistent popularity shows the durability of the product. A reported increase in use of reviews, randomized controlled trials, case reports, and practice guidelines reflects greater employment of more in-depth resources than merely expert opinion. At the same time, residents clearly valued the library's physical space. Survey results will inform future outreach focus.",0,2254
2472,35966786,Association between white matter alterations on diffusion tensor imaging and incidence of frailty in older adults with cardiometabolic diseases.,"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used for the early detection of abnormal changes in the integrity of cerebral white matter tracts, and we have previously reported that these changes are associated with indices of early atherosclerotic lesions. Although these changes have been demonstrated to be associated with the incidence of frailty in older adults, no studies have investigated this relationship in patients at high risk for vascular disease. In this longitudinal study, we followed outpatients with cardiometabolic diseases for a maximum of 6 years (median, 3 years) and evaluated the association of baseline DTI data of seven white matter tracts with the incidence of frailty. The modified version of the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria and the Kihon Checklist were used as indices of frailty; fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were used as indices of white matter changes. Patients who developed frailty based on both indices had low FA and high MD in many of the tracts tested, with the most significant difference found in the MD of the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR). Cox proportional hazard model analysis revealed a significantly high risk of frailty defined by both indices in the groups with high MD values in the left ATR. Similar results were found in patients with diabetes mellitus but not in those without diabetes mellitus. Therefore, abnormalities in the integrity of the left ATR could be associated with the progression of frailty in older adults with cardiometabolic disease, particularly those with diabetes mellitus.",0,2255
584,35978503,Research progress of targeting NLRP3 inflammasome in peripheral nerve injury and pain.,"Nerve injury and nerve pain are common diseases caused by neuroinflammation. Numerous studies have shown that the activation of NLRP3 (nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome is involved in a various inflammatory response, such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, nerve damage and other diseases. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a complex containing NLRP3 protein, ASC (apoptosis-associated speckle-like protein), and pro-caspase-1, which is highly expressed and activated to promote the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in response to the stimulation of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome can cause cell death through caspase-1-mediated cell pyroptosis and plays an important role in the development of nervous system injury and inflammation-related diseases. This discussion aims to summarize the mechanisms of nerve damage and pain caused by excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.",0,2256
487,35978868,Mapping the global research landscape on nutrition and the gut microbiota: Visualization and bibliometric analysis.,"Nutrition is a significant modifiable element that influences the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota, implying the possibility of therapeutic diet methods that manipulate the composition and diversity of the microbial. To overview research papers on nutrition and gut microbiota and determines the hotspots in this field at the global level. Scopus and Reference Citation Analysis were used to construct a bibliometric technique. It was decided to create bibliometric indicators and mapping as in most previous studies. 2012 through 2021 served as the study's timeframe. A total of 5378 documents from the Scopus database were selected for analysis. Of all retrieved studies, 78.52% were research papers (n = 4223), followed by reviews (n = 820; 15.25%). China ranked first with a total number of articles of 1634 (30.38%), followed by the United States in second place with a total number of articles of 1307 (24.3%). In the last decade, emerging hotspots for gut microbiota and nutrition research included gut microbiota metabolism and interaction with dietary components, connection between the gut microbiota and weight gain, and the influence of high-fat diet and gut microbiota on metabolic disorders. This is the first thorough bibliometric analysis of nutrition and gut microbiota publications conducted on a global level. Investigation of the association between nutrition/diet and the gut microbiota is still in its infancy and will be expanded in the future. However, according to recent trends, the effect of gut microbiota and high-fat diet on metabolic disorders will be an increasing concern in the future.",0,2257
474,35978881,Altered gut microbiota patterns in COVID-19: Markers for inflammation and disease severity.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection leads to a severe respiratory illness and alters the gut microbiota, which dynamically interacts with the human immune system. Microbiota alterations include decreased levels of beneficial bacteria and augmentation of opportunistic pathogens. Here, we describe critical factors affecting the microbiota in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. These include, such as gut microbiota imbalance and gastrointestinal symptoms, the pattern of altered gut microbiota composition in COVID-19 patients, and crosstalk between the microbiome and the gut-lung axis/gut-brain-lung axis. Moreover, we have illustrated the hypoxia state in COVID-19 associated gut microbiota alteration. The role of ACE2 in the digestive system, and control of its expression using the gut microbiota is discussed, highlighting the interactions between the lungs, the gut, and the brain during COVID-19 infection. Similarly, we address the gut microbiota in elderly or co-morbid patients as well as gut microbiota dysbiosis of in severe COVID-19. Several clinical trials to understand the role of probiotics in COVID-19 patients are listed in this review. Augmented inflammation is one of the major driving forces for COVID-19 symptoms and gut microbiome disruption and is associated with disease severity. However, understanding the role of the gut microbiota in immune modulation during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help improve therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment.",0,2258
2464,35966794,Identification of diagnostic signatures associated with immune infiltration in Alzheimer's disease by integrating bioinformatic analysis and machine-learning strategies.,"As a chronic neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of progressive dementia. The purpose of this study was to identify diagnostic signatures of AD and the effect of immune cell infiltration in this pathology. The expression profiles of GSE109887, GSE122063, GSE28146, and GSE1297 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AD and control brain samples. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to reveal AD-associated biological functions and key pathways. Besides, we applied the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO) and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) analysis to screen potential diagnostic feature genes in AD, which were further tested in AD brains of the validation cohort (GSE5281). The discriminatory ability was then assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). Finally, the CIBERSORT algorithm and immune cell infiltration analysis were employed to assess the inflammatory state of AD. A total of 49 DEGs were identified. The functional enrichment analysis revealed that leukocyte transendothelial migration, cytokine receptor interaction, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway were enriched in the AD group. MAF basic leucine zipper transcription factor F (MAFF), ADCYAP1, and ZFP36L1 were identified as the diagnostic biomarkers of AD with high discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.850) and validated in AD brains (AUC = 0.935). As indicated from the immune cell infiltration analysis, naive B cells, plasma cells, activated/resting NK cells, M0 macrophages, M1 macrophages, resting CD4+ T memory cells, resting mast cells, memory B cells, and resting/activated dendritic cells may participate in the development of AD. Additionally, all diagnostic signatures presented different degrees of correlation with different infiltrating immune cells. MAFF, ADCYAP1, and ZFP36L1 may become new candidate biomarkers of AD, which were closely related to the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, the immune cells mentioned above may play crucial roles in disease occurrence and progression.",0,2259
1740,35968002,"Effect of Eucommia ulmoides Leaf Extract on Growth Performance, Carcass Traits, Parameters of Oxidative Stress, and Lipid Metabolism in Broiler Chickens.","Eucommia ulmoides bark has been traditionally used as a Chinese medicine to attenuate stress, but the leaf, which is rich in polyphenols and polysaccharides, has been rarely used. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Eucommia ulmoides leaf extracts (EULEs) on oxidative stress and meat quality of broilers. A total of 252 broilers were randomly divided into 3 treatments and fed with a control basal diet (CON), or a diet containing 250 mg/kg or 1,000 mg/kg of EULE for 51 days. Results showed that dietary supplementation of 250 mg/kg EULE increased significantly the average daily gain of broilers in the early stage (1-21 days), while 250 mg/kg or 1,000 mg/kg of EULE decreased the feed conversion ratio in the whole period (P < 0.05). Supplementation of 250 mg/kg EULE reduced the level of MDA in the liver (P < 0.05), while 1,000 mg/kg EULE decreased the serum level of MDA (P < 0.05), and the HDL level in serum was increased by 250 mg/kg or 1,000 mg/kg EULE (P < 0.05). Additionally, 250 mg/kg EULE decreased abdominal fat ratio and serum triglyceride (TC) level in broilers, while 250 or 1,000 mg/kg of EULE reduced drip loss in breast muscle (P < 0.05), and 1,000 mg/kg EULE reduced the cooking loss in thigh muscle (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation of 250 mg/kg of EULE could attenuate oxidative stress and improve the growth performance and meat quality in broilers.",0,2260
1820,35967820,Dietary adaptation for weight loss maintenance at Yale (DAWLY): Protocol and predictions for a randomized controlled trial.,"Current therapies for obesity treatment are effective at producing short-term weight loss, but weight loss maintenance remains a significant challenge. Here we investigate the impact of pre-intervention dietary fat intake on the efficacy of a dietary supplement to support weight loss maintenance. Preclinical work demonstrates that a vagal afferent pathway critical for sensing dietary lipids is blunted by a high-fat diet (HFD), resulting in a reduced preference for a low-fat emulsion and severe blunting of the dopamine (DA) response to the gastric infusion of lipids. Infusion of the gut lipid messenger oleoylethanolamide (OEA), which is also depleted by HFD, immediately reverses this DA blunting and restores preference for the low-fat emulsion. Studies of OEA supplementation for weight loss in humans have had limited success. Given the strong effect of HFD on this pathway, we designed a study to test whether the efficacy of OEA as a weight loss treatment is related to pre-intervention habitual intake of dietary fat. We employed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 100 adults with overweight/obesity (OW/OB) were randomized to receive either OEA or placebo daily for 16 months. Following a baseline evaluation of diet, metabolic health, adiposity, and brain response to a palatable an energy dense food, participants in both groups underwent a 4-month behavioral weight loss intervention (LEARN®) followed by a 1-year maintenance period. The study aims are to (1) determine if pre-intervention dietary fat intake moderates the ability of OEA to improve weight loss and weight loss maintenance after a gold standard behavioral weight loss treatment; (2) identify biomarkers that predict outcome and optimize a stratification strategy; and (3) test a model underlying OEA's effectiveness. Focusing on interventions that target the gut-brain axis is supported by mounting evidence for the role of gut-brain signaling in food choice and the modulation of this circuit by diet. If successful, this work will provide support for targeting the gut-brain pathway for weight loss maintenance using a precision medicine approach that is easy and inexpensive to implement.

457,35978931,Long non-coding RNA PVT1 regulates LPS-induced acute kidney injury in an in vitro model of HK-2 cells by modulating the miR-27a-3p/OXSR1 axis.,"Sepsis is a severe inflammatory disease caused by infection that can lead to multiple organ failure. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is considered to be a major cause of septic mortality in infected organs. Previous studies have revealed that non-coding RNAs are involved in AKI, but the underlying mechanisms are mostly unknown. The present study aimed to explore the role of long non-coding RNA plasmacytoma variant translocation gene 1 (lncRNA PVT1) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute kidney injury and the underlying mechanism. In the present study, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis indicated that, in HK-2 cells treated with LPS, the mRNA expression levels of lncRNA PVT1 and oxidative stress responsive kinase 1 (OXSR1) were upregulated, and the expression of microRNA (miR)-27a-3p was downregulated. Furthermore, LPS treatment could promote the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, which was rescued by PVT1 knockdown. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RIP assay and pull-down assay results demonstrated that miR-27a-3p may be a target miR of PVT1, and that OXSR1 is the target gene of miR-27a-3p. Moreover, it was found that miR-27a-3p overexpression decreased the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6, promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in LPS-treated HK-2 cells, which could be reversed by OXSR1 overexpression. Therefore, the present results indicated that lncRNA PVT1 regulated inflammatory cytokine secretion, cell proliferation and apoptosis by targeting miR-27a-3p, and modulating OXSR1 expression in LPS-induced HK-2 cells.",0,2262
1362,35969101,Intestinal Epithelial Regeneration in Response to Ionizing Irradiation.,"The intestinal epithelium consists of a single layer of cells yet contains multiple types of terminally differentiated cells, which are generated by the active proliferation of intestinal stem cells located at the bottom of intestinal crypts. However, during events of acute intestinal injury, these active intestinal stem cells undergo cell death. Gamma irradiation is a widely used colorectal cancer treatment, which, while therapeutically efficacious, has the side effect of depleting the active stem cell pool. Indeed, patients frequently experience gastrointestinal radiation syndrome while undergoing radiotherapy, in part due to active stem cell depletion. The loss of active intestinal stem cells in intestinal crypts activates a pool of typically quiescent reserve intestinal stem cells and induces dedifferentiation of secretory and enterocyte precursor cells. If not for these cells, the intestinal epithelium would lack the ability to recover from radiotherapy and other such major tissue insults. New advances in lineage-tracing technologies allow tracking of the activation, differentiation, and migration of cells during regeneration and have been successfully employed for studying this in the gut. This study aims to depict a method for the analysis of cells within the mouse intestinal epithelium following radiation injury.",0,2263
2073,35967445,Mast cell tissue heterogeneity and specificity of immune cell recruitment.,"Mast cells occupy a unique niche within tissues as long lived perpetrators of IgE mediated hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, as well as other immune responses. However, mast cells are not identical in different tissues and the impact of this tissue heterogeneity on the interaction with other immune cells and on defined immune responses is still unclear. In this review, we synthesize the characteristics of mast cell heterogeneity in the gut and the skin. Furthermore, we attempt to connect mast cell heterogeneity with functional diversity by exploring differences in mast cell-induced immune cell recruitment in these two model organs. The differential expression of certain receptors on mast cells of different tissues, notably tissue-specific expression patterns of integrins, complement receptors and MRGPRX2, could indicate that tissue environment-dependent factors skew mast cell-immune cell interactions, for example by regulating the expression of these receptors.",0,2264
2198,35967320,The role of neutrophil extracellular traps in acute lung injury.,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a heterogeneous inflammatory condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. Neutrophils play a key role in the development of different forms of ALI, and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is emerging as a common pathogenic mechanism. NETs are essential in controlling pathogens, and their defective release or increased degradation leads to a higher risk of infection. However, NETs also contain several pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic molecules than can exacerbate thromboinflammation and lung tissue injury. To reduce NET-mediated lung damage and inflammation, DNase is frequently used in preclinical models of ALI due to its capability of digesting NET DNA scaffold. Moreover, recent advances in neutrophil biology led to the development of selective NET inhibitors, which also appear to reduce ALI in experimental models. Here we provide an overview of the role of NETs in different forms of ALI discussing existing gaps in our knowledge and novel therapeutic approaches to modulate their impact on lung injury.",0,2265
1742,35968000,Effects of Dietary Macleaya cordata Extract Containing Isoquinoline Alkaloids Supplementation as an Alternative to Antibiotics in the Diets on Growth Performance and Liver Health of Broiler Chickens.,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with Macleaya cordata extract (MCE) containing protopine and allotypotopine on the growth performance and liver health in broiler chickens. A total of 486 1-day-old male AA broiler chickens were randomly assigned to the following three groups: (1) control (CON) group, broiler chickens fed a basal diet; (2) AGP group (positive control), broiler chickens fed a basal diet supplemented with 50 mg/kg aureomycin; (3) MCE group, broiler chickens fed a basal diet supplemented with 0.6 mg/kg MCE including 0.4 mg/kg protopine and 0.2 mg/kg allotypotopine. The results showed that the MCE group had significantly higher final body weight and average daily gain from d 0 to 42 than the other groups (p < 0.05), and groups MCE and AGP both had significantly lower feed-to-gain ratio from d 0 to 42 than the CON group (p < 0.05). Serum total protein, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, glucose, immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin M, and complements (C3, C4) concentrations in the MCE group were significantly higher than in the CON group (p < 0.05). Dietary MCE or aureomycin supplementation significantly reduced the hepatic contents of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, malondialdehyde, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, NLRs family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), and caspase-1 in the liver (p < 0.05). Moreover, MCE or aureomycin supplementation significantly inhibited mRNA expressions of Toll-like receptor 4, myeloid differentiation factor 88, nuclear factor-κB, and NLRP3, as well as the expression ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 mRNA (p < 0.05). Therefore, our study suggested that dietary supplementation with 0.6 mg/kg MCE containing protopine and allocryptopine improved growth performance and benefited liver health in broiler chickens possibly through inhibiting caspase-1-induced pyroptosis by inactivating TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway, and provided support for the application of MCE containing protopine and allocryptopine as an alternative to antibiotics in the feed industry.",0,2266
2471,35966787,Differences in gut microbiota correlate with symptoms and regional brain volumes in patients with late-life depression.,"Depression is associated with gut dysbiosis that disrupts a gut-brain bidirectional axis. Gray matter volume changes in cortical and subcortical structures, including prefrontal regions and the hippocampus, have also been noted in depressive disorders. However, the link between gut microbiota and brain structures in depressed patients remains elusive. Neuropsychiatric measures, stool samples, and structural brain images were collected from 36 patients with late-life depression (LLD) and 17 healthy controls. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was used to profile stool microbial communities for quantitation of microbial composition, abundance, and diversity. T1-weighted brain images were assessed with voxel-based morphometry to detect alterations in gray matter volume between groups. Correlation analysis was performed to identify the possible association between depressive symptoms, brain structures and gut microbiota. We found a significant difference in the gut microbial composition between patients with late-life depression (LLD) and healthy controls. The genera Enterobacter and Burkholderia were positively correlated with depressive symptoms and negatively correlated with brain structural signatures in regions associated with memory, somatosensory integration, and emotional processing/cognition/regulation. Our study purports the microbiota-gut-brain axis as a potential mechanism mediating the symptomatology of LLD patients, which may facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies targeting gut microbes in the treatment of elderly depressed patients.",0,2267
344,35979352,Proinflammatory mucosal-associated invariant CD8+ T cells react to gut flora yeasts and infiltrate multiple sclerosis brain.,"The composition of the intestinal microbiota plays a critical role in shaping the immune system. Modern lifestyle, the inappropriate use of antibiotics, and exposure to pollution have significantly affected the composition of commensal microorganisms. The intestinal microbiota has been shown to sustain inappropriate autoimmune responses at distant sites in animal models of disease, and may also have a role in immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). We studied the composition of the gut mycobiota in fecal samples from 27 persons with MS (pwMS) and in 18 healthy donors (HD), including 5 pairs of homozygous twins discordant for MS. We found a tendency towards higher fungal abundance and richness in the MS group, and we observed that MS twins showed a higher rate of food-associated strains, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then found that in pwMS, a distinct population of cells with antibacterial and antifungal activity is expanded during the remitting phase and markedly decreases during clinically and/or radiologically active disease. These cells, named MAIT (mucosal-associated invariant T cells) lymphocytes, were significantly more activated in pwMS compared to HD in response to S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans strains isolated from fecal samples. This activation was also mediated by fungal-induced IL-23 secretion by innate immune cells. Finally, immunofluorescent stainings of MS post-mortem brain tissues from persons with the secondary progressive form of the disease showed that MAIT cells cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. These results were in agreement with the hypothesis that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota might determine the inappropriate response of a subset of pathogenic mucosal T cells and favor the development of systemic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.",0,2268
458,35978929,miR-374a-5p alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury by targeting ZEB1 via the p38 MAPK pathway.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of microRNA (miR)-374a-5p on sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the associated mechanism. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) were used to construct the cellular model of sepsis. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the association between miR-374a-5p and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were performed to assess the relative expression of miR-374a-5p, ZEB1 and apoptosis-related proteins. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to evaluate inflammatory cytokines. The results revealed that miR-374a-5p was downregulated in sepsis patients and LPS-treated HPMVECs. Upregulation of miR-374a-5p alleviated LPS-triggered cell injury in HPMVECs, as evidenced by restoration of cell viability, and inhibition of apoptosis and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, ZEB1 was revealed to be a downstream target of miR-374a-5p, and overexpression of ZEB1 could reverse the anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of miR-374a-5p on an LPS-induced sepsis cell model. Moreover, miR-374a-5p-induced protective effects involved the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Collectively, miR-374a-5p exerted a protective role in sepsis-induced ALI by regulating the ZEB1-mediated p38 MAPK signaling pathway, providing a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.",0,2269
517,35978742,An Unusual Case of Drug-Induced Liver Injury Secondary to Nitrofurantoin Use.,"Nitrofurantoin is a commonly prescribed antibiotic for uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Despite a number of side effects, it is increasingly prescribed due to its low cost, high efficacy, and minimal antimicrobial resistance. One of the rare, however significant side effects of nitrofurantoin is idiosyncratic drug-induced liver toxicity. It commonly presents with abdominal pain and elevated liver enzymes. Interestingly, it can cause either an acute or a chronic hepatitis-like syndrome that can be severe and lead to liver failure or cirrhosis. We present a case of a healthy 24-year-old female who presented with epigastric abdominal pain, which was found to be drug-induced liver injury (DILI) secondary to her recent nitrofurantoin use.",0,2270
170,35983037,Carbohydrates Metabolic Signatures in Immune Cells: Response to Infection.,"Metabolic reprogramming in immune cells is diverse and distinctive in terms of complexity and flexibility in response to heterogeneous pathogenic stimuli. We studied the carbohydrate metabolic changes in immune cells in different types of infectious diseases. This could help build reasonable strategies when understanding the diagnostics, prognostics, and biological relevance of immune cells under alternative metabolic burdens. Search and analysis were conducted on published peer-reviewed papers on immune cell metabolism of a single pathogen infection from the four known types (bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses). Out of the 131 selected papers based on the PIC algorithm (pathogen type/immune cell/carbohydrate metabolism), 30 explored immune cell metabolic changes in well-studied bacterial infections, 17 were on fungal infections of known medical importance, and 12 and 57 were on parasitic and viral infections, respectively. While carbohydrate metabolism in immune cells is signaled by glycolytic shift during a bacterial or viral infection, it is widely evident that effector surface proteins are expressed on the surface of parasites and fungi to modulate metabolism in these cells. Carbohydrate metabolism in immune cells can be categorized according to the pathogen or the disease type. Accordingly, this classification can be used to adopt new strategies in disease diagnosis and treatment.",0,2271
2185,35967333,Interaction between microbiota and immunity and its implication in colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the world. Besides genetic causes, colonic inflammation is one of the major risk factors for CRC development, which is synergistically regulated by multiple components, including innate and adaptive immune cells, cytokine signaling, and microbiota. The complex interaction between CRC and the gut microbiome has emerged as an important area of current CRC research. Metagenomic profiling has identified a number of prominent CRC-associated bacteria that are enriched in CRC patients, linking the microbiota composition to colitis and cancer development. Some microbiota species have been reported to promote colitis and CRC development in preclinical models, while a few others are identified as immune modulators to induce potent protective immunity against colitis and CRC. Mechanistically, microbiota regulates the activation of different immune cell populations, inflammation, and CRC via crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), type I interferon, and inflammasome. In this review, we provide an overview of the potential interactions between gut microbiota and host immunity and how their crosstalk could synergistically regulate inflammation and CRC, thus highlighting the potential roles and mechanisms of gut microbiota in the development of microbiota-based therapies to prevent or alleviate colitis and CRC.",0,2272
2189,35967329,Atopic dermatitis: Is innate or adaptive immunity in control? A clinical perspective.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with barrier defects and immune dysregulations. The pathogenesis of AD involves the physical barrier as well as epithelial cells, which are considered a vital part of the innate immunity of the skin. The importance of filaggrin mutations in the pathogenesis of AD has also been well-established with reproducible results around the world in multiple studies and ethnic groups. This protein plays an important role in skin barrier functions and further reaffirms barrier defects as one of the primary causes of AD. The main epithelial cells, keratinocytes, function as a major sentinel for the skin in detecting danger signals or microbial pathogens, and trigger downstream immune responses. In AD, these cells express TSLP, IL-33 and IL-25, which lead to downstream systemic production of type 2 cytokines. In spite of major advances in our understanding of the innate immunity of AD, recent success in the systemic therapeutics of AD have focused on targeting the products of the adaptive immunity, particularly cytokines produced by T cells. In addition to type 2 cytokines, type 17 cytokines have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. The current review examines the implications of these cytokines in AD from clinical perspectives.",0,2273
2193,35967325,Extracellular vesicles from A23187-treated neutrophils cause cGAS-STING-dependent IL-6 production by macrophages.,"In response to several types of bacteria, as well as pharmacological agents, neutrophils produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) and release DNA in the form of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). However, it is unknown whether these two neutrophil products cooperate to modulate inflammation. Consistent with vital NETosis, neutrophils challenged with S. aureus, as well as those treated with A23187, released significantly more DNA relative to untreated or fMLF-treated neutrophils, with no lysis occurring for any condition. To test the hypothesis that EVs generated during NETosis caused macrophage inflammation, we isolated and characterized EVs from A23187-treated neutrophils (A23187-EVs). A23187-EVs associated with neutrophil granule proteins, histone H3, transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM), and nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We showed that DNA from A23187-EVs, when transfected into macrophages, led to production of IL-6 and IFN-α2, and this response was blunted by pre-treatment with the STING inhibitor H151. Next, we confirmed that A23187-EVs were engulfed by macrophages, and showed that they induced cGAS-STING-dependent IL-6 production. In contrast, neither EVs from untreated or fMLF-treated cells exhibited pro-inflammatory activity. Although detergent-mediated lysis of A23187-EVs diminished IL-6 production, removal of surface-associated DNA with DNase I treatment had no effect, and A23187-EVs did not induce IFN-α2 production. Given these unexpected results, we investigated whether macrophage mtDNA activated the cGAS-STING signaling axis. Consistent with mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a defined mechanism of mtDNA release, we observed macrophage mitochondrial membrane depolarization, a decrease in cytosolic Bax, and a decrease in mitochondrial cytochrome c, suggesting that macrophage mtDNA may initiate this EV-dependent signaling cascade. All together, these data demonstrate that A23187-EVs behave differently than transfected NET- or EV-DNA, and that neutrophil-derived EVs could be used as a model to study NF-κB-dependent STING activation.",0,2274
2216,35967302,Identification of pyroptosis-related subtypes and establishment of prognostic model and immune characteristics in asthma.,"Although studies have shown that cell pyroptosis is involved in the progression of asthma, a systematic analysis of the clinical significance of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) cooperating with immune cells in asthma patients is still lacking. Transcriptome sequencing datasets from patients with different disease courses were used to screen pyroptosis-related differentially expressed genes and perform biological function analysis. Clustering based on K-means unsupervised clustering method is performed to identify pyroptosis-related subtypes in asthma and explore biological functional characteristics of poorly controlled subtypes. Diagnostic markers between subtypes were screened and validated using an asthma mouse model. The infiltration of immune cells in airway epithelium was evaluated based on CIBERSORT, and the correlation between diagnostic markers and immune cells was analyzed. Finally, a risk prediction model was established and experimentally verified using differentially expressed genes between pyroptosis subtypes in combination with asthma control. The cMAP database and molecular docking were utilized to predict potential therapeutic drugs. Nineteen differentially expressed PRGs and two subtypes were identified between patients with mild-to-moderate and severe asthma conditions. Significant differences were observed in asthma control and FEV1 reversibility between the two subtypes. Poor control subtypes were closely related to glucocorticoid resistance and airway remodeling. BNIP3 was identified as a diagnostic marker and associated with immune cell infiltration such as, M2 macrophages. The risk prediction model containing four genes has accurate classification efficiency and prediction value. Small molecules obtained from the cMAP database that may have therapeutic effects on asthma are mainly DPP4 inhibitors. Pyroptosis and its mediated immune phenotype are crucial in the occurrence, development, and prognosis of asthma. The predictive models and drugs developed on the basis of PRGs may provide new solutions for the management of asthma.",0,2275
455,35978933,"Interleukin 32 participates in cardiomyocyte-induced oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis during hypoxia/reoxygenation via the NOD2/NOX2/MAPK signaling pathway.","Although reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium has been used as a vital treatment of various patients with cardiovascular disease, the accompanying myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) can cause further damage, resulting in a poor prognosis. The present study aimed to explore the roles and regulatory mechanisms of interleukin (IL)-32, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in MIRI. Cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R) to mimic MIRI. The effects of IL-32 on oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis of H/R-treated cells were assessed. Given that the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) play roles in the inflammatory response and myocardial ischemia, the role of this regulatory axis in the function of IL-32 was evaluated. The results indicated that IL-32 levels were elevated following H/R treatment. Downregulation of IL-32 expression attenuated H/R-induced reduction in cell viability, LDH release, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. Moreover, downregulation of IL-32 expression reversed the activation of the NOD2/NOX2/MAPK signaling pathway caused by H/R treatment. NOD2 overexpression altered the effects of the downregulation of IL-32 expression on the cells, indicating that this regulatory axis mediated the function of IL-32. Collectively, the data indicated that IL-32 participated in the induction of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes during H/R treatment via the NOD2/NOX2/MAPK signaling pathway.",0,2276
2194,35967324,Causal analysis between altered levels of interleukins and obstructive sleep apnea.,"Inflammation proteins including interleukins (ILs) have been reported to be related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The aims of this study were to estimate the levels for several key interleukins in OSA and the causal effects between them. Weighted mean difference (WMD) was used to compare the expression differences of interleukins between OSA and control, and the changed levels during OSA treatments in the meta-analysis section. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to estimate the causal directions and effect sizes between OSA risks and interleukins. The inverse-variance weighting (IVW) was used as the primary method followed by several other MR methods including MR Egger, Weighted median, and MR-Robust Adjusted Profile Score as sensitivity analysis. Nine different interleukins-IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, and IL-23-were elevated in OSA compared with control to varying degrees, ranging from 0.82 to 100.14 pg/ml, and one interleukin, IL-10, was decreased by 0.77 pg/ml. Increased IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 rather than IL-10 can be reduced in OSA by effective treatments. Further, the MR analysis of the IVW method showed that there was no significant evidence to support the causal relationships between OSA and the nine interleukins-IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, and IL-18. Among them, the causal effect of OSA on IL-5 was almost significant [estimate: 0.267 (-0.030, 0.564), p = 0.078]. These results were consistent in the sensitivity analysis. Although IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, and IL-23 were increasing and IL-10 was reducing in OSA, no significant causal relationships were observed between them by MR analysis. Further research is needed to test the causality of OSA risk on elevated IL-5 level.",0,2277
459,35978928,PAD4 silencing inhibits inflammation whilst promoting trophoblast cell invasion and migration by inactivating the NEMO/NF-κB pathway.,"Preeclampsia (PE), presenting with onset hypertension and proteinuria, is a pregnancy-specific disorder that can result in maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Insufficient trophoblast invasion and migration has been considered to be an important cause of this disease. The present study aimed to investigate the role of peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), whose knockdown has been previously indicated to reduce inflammation and susceptibility to pregnancy loss in mice, in the development of PE in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to treat a human trophoblast cell line (HTR8/SVneo). After PAD4 silencing via transfection with short hairpin RNA against PAD4, the concentrations of inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-12 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 were measured using ELISA. Cell viability was also measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. HTR8/SVneo cell invasion and migration were detected using Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. Western blotting was used to measure the expression of citrullinated NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) and nuclear NF-κB p65 protein levels. TNF-α was applied for evaluating the potential regulatory effects of PAD4 on NF-κB in LPS-stimulated HTR8/SVneo cells. LPS increased the levels of IL-6, IL-12 and MCP-1 and reduced the migration and invasion of HTR8/SVneo cells. PAD4-knockdown was found to markedly reduce the levels of IL-6, IL-12 and MCP-1 secretion. HTR8/SVneo cell invasion and migration was also significantly elevated after PAD4 silencing following LPS exposure. In addition, LPS stimulation notably upregulated the protein levels of citrullinated NEMO and nuclear NF-κB p65, which was restored by PAD4 knockdown. Furthermore, TNF-α treatment partially counteracted the effects of PAD4 knockdown on the secretion of IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-12, which are markers of inflammation, and invasion and migration in LPS-induced HTR8/SVneo cells. To conclude, these results suggest that PAD4 silencing can suppress inflammation whilst promoting invasion and migration by trophoblast cells through inhibiting the NEMO/NF-κB pathway. These findings furthered the understanding in the complex molecular mechanism that can trigger PE and provide a promising target for the treatment of this disease.",0,2278
572,35978515,Inflammasome Complexes: Crucial mediators in osteoimmunology and bone diseases.,"Inflammasome complexes play a vital role in the inflammatory response by producing interleukin-1β and inducing cell pyroptosis. During the long period of co-evolution of the skeletal and immune systems, inflammasome complexes bridged the bone-immune interaction, which is crucial for osteoimmunology and bone diseases. Additionally, the M1/M2 ratio, the Th17/Treg ratio, and osteoclastogenesis are regulated by inflammasomes in multiple bone diseases. Particularly, based on different disease features and inflammasome functions, osteoclastogenesis can be categorized as site-specific inflammation-related and system inflammation-related and is probably the most well-studied process in osteoimmunology. Research on inflammasomes includes multiple bone diseases and clinical therapies, including bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of jaws, periodontitis, arthritis, metal particle-induced osteolysis, bone fracture, osseointegration, and bone marrow inflammatory diseases. Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease is directly related to NLRP3 mutation. This review consolidates our basic knowledge about inflammasome structure and highlights the main cell subtypes and their functions in the bone-immune interaction. Furthermore, we discuss the inflammasome complexes and relevant bone diseases to provide insights for future studies on inflammasomes, osteoimmunology, and bone diseases.",0,2279
2154,35967364,Role of hepatic stellate cells in liver ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major complication of liver trauma, resection, and transplantation. IRI may lead to liver dysfunction and failure, but effective approach to address it is still lacking. To better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of liver IRI, functional roles of numerous cell types, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, neutrophils, and sinusoidal endothelial cells, have been intensively studied. In contrast, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which are well recognized by their essential functions in facilitating liver protection and repair, have gained less attention in their role in IRI. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the effects of HSCs on the injury stage of liver IRI and their associated molecular mechanisms. In addition, we discuss the regulation of liver repair and regeneration after IRI by HSCs. Finally, we highlight unanswered questions and future avenues of research regarding contributions of HSCs to IRI in the liver.",0,2280
573,35978514,Microglia and microglial-based receptors in the pathogenesis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests as progressive deterioration in multiple cognitive and information processing domains, including memory and executive functions. Although AD's cause and cure remain elusive, increasing evidence supports a key role for microglial cells in AD pathogenesis via diverse mechanisms. β-Amyloid (Aβ) and tau triggered proteopathic and immunopathic processes are key contributors to AD pathology. These proteins aggregate into oligomers and fibrils, which eventually deposit in the central nervous system (CNS) as plaques and tangles. Aβ and tau are directly synaptotoxic and neurotoxic, but also concomitantly induce neuroinflammation. As a central player in CNS immunity, microglia recognize different forms of misfolded proteins and initiate subsequent immune responses, mediating neuroinflammation and neuron-glia crosstalk. Microglia phagocytose debris and release cytokines to maintain brain homeostasis and synaptic integrity. However, microglia also exhibit harmful effects when subject to prolonged activation. This review describes the role of microglia in the proteopathic-immunopathic pathogeneses of AD. We summarize the microglial receptors involved in Aβ recognition, and the role played by this interaction in explaining the interplay between Aβ accumulation and AD progression through microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Based on the dual proteopathic and immunopathic roles of microglia, we also review putative drug candidates targeting microglial receptors.",0,2281
235,35982785,A microengineered Brain-Chip to model neuroinflammation in humans.,"Species differences in brain and blood-brain barrier (BBB) biology hamper the translation of findings from animal models to humans, impeding the development of therapeutics for brain diseases. Here, we present a human organotypic microphysiological system (MPS) that includes endothelial-like cells, pericytes, glia, and cortical neurons and maintains BBB permeability at in vivo relevant levels. This human Brain-Chip engineered to recapitulate critical aspects of the complex interactions that mediate neuroinflammation and demonstrates significant improvements in clinical mimicry compared to previously reported similar MPS. In comparison to Transwell culture, the transcriptomic profiling of the Brain-Chip displayed significantly advanced similarity to the human adult cortex and enrichment in key neurobiological pathways. Exposure to TNF-α recreated the anticipated inflammatory environment shown by glia activation, increased release of proinflammatory cytokines, and compromised barrier permeability. We report the development of a robust brain MPS for mechanistic understanding of cell-cell interactions and BBB function during neuroinflammation.",0,2282
469,35978915,Ropivacaine has the potential to relieve PM2.5-induced acute lung injury.,"Ropivacaine is a commonly used local anesthetic in the clinic due to its low toxicity to the cardiovascular system or central nervous system, good tolerance and high clearance rate. The present study intended to investigate the effect of ropivacaine on PM2.5-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and reveal the underlying mechanism. After ropivacaine exposure, cell viability, oxidative stress and inflammation in PM2.5-induced BEAS-2B cells were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 and DCFH-DA staining, corresponding commercial kits and ELISA, respectively. The effects of ropivacaine on the expression of MMP9 and MMP12 and the proteins related to NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling were then determined by western blot and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analyses. In addition, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) agonist monosodium urate (MSU) was used to treat BEAS-2B cells followed by ropivacaine treatment and the effects on the above-mentioned cellular behaviors were determined again. The results indicated that the viability of BEAS-2B cells was decreased after PM2.5 induction, accompanied by aggravated oxidative stress and inflammation. However, ropivacaine alleviated oxidative stress and inflammation in PM2.5-induced BEAS-2B cells in a dose-dependent manner. Ropivacaine was also indicated to decrease the expression levels of NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling-related proteins in PM2.5-induced BEAS-2B cells. Furthermore, cell viability was decreased, while oxidative stress and inflammatory response were aggravated, in PM2.5-induced BEAS-2B cells treated with MSU. In summary, the present results implied that ropivacaine exerted protective effects on PM2.5-induced ALI, and this effect may be related to NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling.",0,2283
14,35985196,Clinical efficacy of oligonol® supplementation on metabolism and muscle health in middle-aged and older adults: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial.,"Oligonol® is a low-molecular-weight polyphenol that has biological effects on metabolism in animals. However, little is known about its roles in muscle function and muscle quality in middle-aged and older adults. 120 participants were enrolled for study based on 1:1 randomization. Participants in the intervention group were provided 200 mg oligonol® prepared as capsules, and 200 mg placebo (dextrin) was provided in control group. Data from 103 participants (52 in the intervention group and 51 in the control group) were available for analysis. The mean age of all participants was 64.0 ± 8.2 years, and two-thirds of the participants were females. Baseline demographic characteristics, functional assessment, laboratory data and muscle parameters were similar between groups. Hip circumference decreased (p = 0.009) during the study period, and the 6-m walking speed increased (p = 0.001) in women in the intervention group. In contrast, 6-m walking speed, 6-min walking distance and handgrip strength were significantly improved in men in the intervention group, but increased total body fat percentage (p = 0.038) and decreased mid-thigh cross-muscle area (CMA) (p = 0.007) were observed in the control group. Compared to the control group, the 12-week interval change in the percentage of mid-thigh CMA was maintained in men in the intervention group but was significantly decreased in the control group (p = 0.03, 95% CI:0.002-0.05). Oligonol supplementation (200 mg per day) significantly improved physical performance and muscle mass in men. Further studies are needed to confirm the potential favorable effects of oligonol® supplementation.",0,2284
2248,35967183,The Antipyretic Effect of High-Dose Paracetamol Versus Mefenamic Acid in the Treatment of Febrile Children: A Randomized Control Trial.,"Introduction Fever is the most common presenting symptom in children and causes distress in patients and parents. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used as antipyretics, they should be reserved for pain or chronic inflammatory conditions due to safety concerns. If we can safely achieve the same antipyretic effect using a higher dose (20 mg/kg) of paracetamol, NSAIDs may be avoided for treating fever. There is a paucity of literature comparing the antipyretic effect of mefenamic acid and high-dose paracetamol. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in the antipyretic effect of high-dose paracetamol and mefenamic acid. Methods In this randomized control trial, 165 febrile children were randomly allocated to one of the following three groups: standard-dose (15 mg/kg) paracetamol (SDPCM) as the control group and high-dose (20 mg/kg) paracetamol (HDPCM) and mefenamic acid (6 mg/kg) (MFN) as the intervention groups. The temperature was measured using a digital thermometer at the start of drug dosage and every 15 minutes until it reached normal. One-way between-group analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare outcome measures such as time for temperature to reach normal, fall of temperature in 60 minutes, and time for the next fever. Post hoc analysis was performed to compare mean differences. Patients were monitored for adverse effects. Results Out of 165 enrolled patients, 159 were analyzed. The baseline demographic data were comparable among the groups. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean time taken for the temperature to reach normal (F-value (F) (2,156)=3.184, p<0.05) and the mean reduction in temperature at 60 minutes (F (2,156)=23.40, p<0.001) among the groups. The mean time for temperature to reach normal in the SDPCM group (97.50±26.60 minutes) was longer than that in the HDPCM (85.09±31.43 minutes) and MFN (84.90±30.42 minutes) groups. The decrease in temperature over 60 minutes was greater in the HDPCM (0.46°C±0.19°C) and MFN (0.45°C±0.11°C) groups than in the SDPCM (0.33°C±0.10°C) group. The time to the next fever spike was shorter for the SDPCM group (5.07±2.66 hours) than for the HDPCM (7.20±3.08 hours) and MFN (8.82±3.83 hours) groups. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that high-dose paracetamol and mefenamic acid had similar and faster antipyretic effects than standard-dose paracetamol. Although the duration of action was found to be longer in the mefenamic acid group, the difference was not statistically significant. There were negligible adverse effects in the groups. Conclusion  Standard-dose paracetamol (15 mg/kg/dose) had a slower and shorter antipyretic effect than high-dose paracetamol (20 mg/kg/dose) and mefenamic acid (6 mg/kg/dose). A single dose of high-dose paracetamol was safe and had a similar antipyretic effect as mefenamic acid. Mefenamic acid may be avoided as an antipyretic and spared for pain and anti-inflammatory indications. Multicentered double-blind clinical trials with larger sample sizes and comparisons of other NSAIDs will be required to confirm these findings.",0,2285
2175,35967343,Interleukin 6-regulated macrophage polarization controls atherosclerosis-associated vascular intimal hyperplasia.,"Vascular intimal hyperplasia (VIH) is an important stage of atherosclerosis (AS), in which macrophages not only play a critical role in local inflammation, but also transform into foam cells to participate into plaque formation, where they appear to be heterogeneous. Recently, it was shown that CD11c+ macrophages were more associated with active plaque progression. However, the molecular regulation of phenotypic changes of plaque macrophages during VIH has not been clarified and thus addressed in the current study. Since CD11c- cells were M2a-polarized anti-inflammatory macrophages, while CD11c+ cells were M1/M2b-polarized pro-inflammatory macrophages, we used bioinformatics tools to analyze the CD11c+ versus CD11c- plaque macrophages, aiming to detect the differential genes associated with M1/M2 macrophage polarization. We obtained 122 differential genes that were significantly altered in CD11c+ versus CD11c- plaque macrophages, regardless of CD11b expression. Next, hub genes were predicted in these 122 genes, from which we detected 3 candidates, interleukin 6 (Il6), Decorin (Dcn) and Tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Timp1). The effects of these 3 genes on CD11c expression as well as on the macrophage polarization were assessed in vitro, showing that only expression of Il6, but not expression of Dcn or Timp1, induced M1/M2b-like polarization in M2a macrophages. Moreover, only suppression of Il6, but not suppression of either of Dcn or Timp1, induced M2a-like polarization in M1/M2b macrophages. Furthermore, pharmaceutical suppression of Il6 attenuated VIH formation and progression of AS in a mouse model that co-applied apolipoprotein E-knockout and high-fat diet. Together, our data suggest that formation of VIH can be controlled through modulating macrophage polarization, as a promising therapeutic approach for prevent AS.",0,2286
2117,35967401,The role of interleukin-22 in lung health and its therapeutic potential for COVID-19.,"Although numerous clinical trials have been implemented, an absolutely effective treatment against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still elusive. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) has attracted great interest over recent years, making it one of the best-studied cytokines of the interleukin-10 (IL-10) family. Unlike most interleukins, the major impact of IL-22 is exclusively on fibroblasts and epithelial cells due to the restricted expression of receptor. Numerous studies have suggested that IL-22 plays a crucial role in anti-viral infections through significantly ameliorating the immune cell-mediated inflammatory responses, and reducing tissue injury as well as further promoting epithelial repair and regeneration. Herein, we pay special attention to the role of IL-22 in the lungs. We summarize the latest progress in our understanding of IL-22 in lung health and disease and further discuss maneuvering this cytokine as potential immunotherapeutic strategy for the effective manage of COVID-19.",0,2287
2147,35967371,Methotrexate Inhibits T Cell Proliferation but Not Inflammatory Cytokine Expression to Modulate Immunity in People Living With HIV.,"Inflammation associated with increased risk of comorbidities persists in people living with HIV (PWH) on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). A recent placebo-controlled trial of low-dose methotrexate (MTX) in PWH found that numbers of total CD4 and CD8 T cells decreased in the low-dose MTX arm. In this report we analyzed T cell phenotypes and additional plasma inflammatory indices in samples from the trial. We found that cycling (Ki67+) T cells lacking Bcl-2 were reduced by MTX but plasma inflammatory cytokines were largely unaffected. In a series of in vitro experiments to further investigate the mechanisms of MTX activity, we found that MTX did not inhibit effector cytokine production but inhibited T cell proliferation downstream of mTOR activation, mitochondrial function, and cell cycle entry. This inhibitory effect was reversible with folinic acid, suggesting low-dose MTX exerts anti-inflammatory effects in vivo in PWH largely by blocking T cell proliferation via dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, yet daily administration of folic acid did not rescue this effect in trial participants. Our findings identify the main mechanism of action of this widely used anti-inflammatory medicine in PWH and may provide insight into how MTX works in the setting of other inflammatory conditions.",0,2288
1799,35967856,Abnormal bile acid metabolism is an important feature of gut microbiota and fecal metabolites in patients with slow transit constipation.,"Destructions in the intestinal ecosystem are implicated with changes in slow transit constipation (STC), which is a kind of intractable constipation characterized by colonic motility disorder. In order to deepen the understanding of the structure of the STC gut microbiota and the relationship between the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, we first used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to evaluate the gut microbiota in 30 STC patients and 30 healthy subjects. The α-diversity of the STC group was changed to a certain degree, and the β-diversity was significantly different, which indicated that the composition of the gut microbiota of STC patients was inconsistent with healthy subjects. Among them, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Desulfovibrionaceae, and Ruminiclostridium were significantly upregulated, while Subdoligranulum was significantly downregulated. The metabolomics showed that different metabolites between the STC and the control group were involved in the process of bile acids and lipid metabolism, including taurocholate, taurochenodeoxycholate, taurine, deoxycholic acid, cyclohexylsulfamate, cholic acid, chenodeoxycholate, arachidonic acid, and 4-pyridoxic acid. We found that the colon histomorphology of STC patients was significantly disrupted, and TGR5 and FXR were significantly downregulated. The differences in metabolites were related to changes in the abundance of specific bacteria and patients' intestinal dysfunction. Analysis of the fecal genomics and metabolomics enabled separation of the STC from controls based on random forest model prediction [STC vs. control (14 gut microbiota and metabolite biomarkers)-Sensitivity: 1, Specificity: 0.877]. This study provided a perspective for the diagnosis and intervention of STC related with abnormal bile acid metabolism.",0,2289
182,35982901,A Novel ER Stress Mediator TMTC3 Promotes Squamous Cell Carcinoma Progression by Activating GRP78/PERK Signaling Pathway.,"During tumor progression, tumor cells are exposed to various stress conditions, which result in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore ER homeostasis. Accumulating evidence reported the orchestrating role of ER stress in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress, but the detailed mechanism was unclear. Here, we identified ectopic expression of TMTC3 in cells undergoing ER stress and verified the association with EMT markers through the cellular model of ER stress and database analysis. TMTC3 was abnormally highly expressed in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and regulated by TP63, an SCCs-specific transcription factor. Biological function experiments indicated that TMTC3 promoted a malignant phenotype in vitro, and accelerated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. RNA-seq analyses and further experiments revealed that TMTC3 promoted the expression of EMT markers via interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI, FAM3C). Further studies on the mechanism showed that TMTC3 disrupted the interaction between PERK and GRP78 to activate the PERK pathway and promote the nuclear translocation of ATF4, which increased the transcriptional activity of ILEI. These findings indicated that TMTC3 activates GRP78/PERK signaling pathway during ER stress-induced EMT, which might serve as a potential therapeutic target in SCCs.",0,2290
1830,35967810,The Potential of Honey as a Prebiotic Food to Re-engineer the Gut Microbiome Toward a Healthy State.,"Honey has a long history of use for the treatment of digestive ailments. Certain honey types have well-established bioactive properties including antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. In addition, honey contains non-digestible carbohydrates in the form of oligosaccharides, and there is increasing evidence from in vitro, animal, and pilot human studies that some kinds of honey have prebiotic activity. Prebiotics are foods or compounds, such as non-digestible carbohydrates, that are used to promote specific, favorable changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota plays a critical role in human health and well-being, with disturbances to the balance of these organisms linked to gut inflammation and the development and progression of numerous conditions, such as colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and mental health issues. Consequently, there is increasing interest in manipulating the gut microbiota to a more favorable balance as a way of improving health by dietary means. Current research suggests that certain kinds of honey can reduce the presence of infection-causing bacteria in the gut including Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Clostridiodes difficile, while simultaneously stimulating the growth of potentially beneficial species, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. In this paper, we review the current and growing evidence that shows the prebiotic potential of honey to promote healthy gut function, regulate the microbial communities in the gut, and reduce infection and inflammation. We outline gaps in knowledge and explore the potential of honey as a viable option to promote or re-engineer a healthy gut microbiome.",0,2291
585,35978501,Depletion of circ_0128846 ameliorates interleukin-1β-induced human chondrocyte apoptosis and inflammation through the miR-940/PTPN12 pathway.,"Previous evidence has suggested that circular RNA (circRNA) is abnormally expressed in osteoarthritis (OA). However, the underlying mechanism of circRNA in OA progression remains unclear. The study aims to reveal the mechanism of circ_0128846 regulating OA. Human chondrocytes (C28/I2 cells) were treated with interleukin-1β (IL-1β) to mimic an OA cell model. The expression levels of circ_0128846, miR-940 and protein tyrosine phosphatase 12 (PTPN12) were detected by qRT-PCR. Protein expression was checked by Western blotting. Cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis were analyzed by a cell counting kit-8 assay, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-6 was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The binding relationship between miR-940 and circ_0128846 or PTPN12 was identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Circ_0128846 and PTPN12 expression were significantly upregulated, whereas miR-940 was downregulated in the cartilage tissues of OA patients and IL-1β-treated C28/I2 cells compared with controls. IL-1β treatment inhibited C28/I2 cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis and the production of inflammatory factors, TNF-α and IL-6; however, these effects were partly reversed after circ_0128846 depletion. In terms of mechanism, circ_0128846 acted as a miR-940 sponge, and miR-940 combined with PTPN12. Also, circ_0128846 depletion partly ameliorated IL-1β-induced C28/I2 cell disorders through miR-940. PTPN12 overexpression also partly relieved miR-940-mediated effects in IL-1β-treated C28/I2 cells. Further, circ_0128846 induced PTPN12 expression by interacting with miR-940. Circ_0128846 regulated human chondrocyte proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation through the miR-940/PTPN12 pathway in OA.",0,2292
576,35978511,CircSPI1_005 ameliorates osteoarthritis by sponging miR-370-3p to regulate the expression of MAP3K9.,"Osteoarthritis (OA), caused by the destruction of joint cartilage, is the most prevalent form of arthritis, causing pain and stiffness in joints among millions of patients worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs, including circular RNAs, play important roles in the pathogenesis of OA, but the precise signaling pathway is still unclear. To study OA, we established a mouse model by the destabilized medial meniscus (DMM) surgery and used IL-1β stimulated human cell line C28/I2 as an in vitro study. To further study the role of circSPI1_005 in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, EdU staining and FACS-based (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) apoptosis examination were performed after the manipulation of the expression of circSPI1_005. Also, bioinformatics predictions were conducted to analyze the downstream microRNAs of circSPI1_005 and the protein regulated by circSPI1_005. The luciferase assay and the RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were used to confirm the binding between circSPI1_005 and the predicted microRNA. To verify the role of circSPI1_005 in regulating OA in vivo, we also over-expressed circSPI1_005 by injecting AAV into previously injured knees to improve the OA symptoms. In this study, we found that circSPI1_005 was significantly down-regulated in IL-1β treated chondrocyte cell lines and cartilage tissues of the OA mouse model. Overexpression of circSPI1_005 ameliorated OA by increasing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, and knockdown of circSPI1_005 in chondrocytes mimicked OA phenotypes. Bioinformatics study showed circSPI1_005 could sponge to miR-370-3p, and mechanistic studies confirmed the functional binding between circSPI1_005 and miR-370-3p. Furthermore, we conducted a TargetScan analysis and found that MAP3K9 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 9) could be the downstream protein effector. The expression level of MAP3K9 was regulated by miR-370-3p and overexpression of MAP3K9 could efficiently ameliorate OA. Also, we over-expressed circSPI1_005 in vivo and found that the cartilage surface in the OA mouse model was improved with overexpression of circSPI1_005. Collectively, circSPI1_005 could sponge to miR-370-3p to regulate the expression of MAP3K9, ameliorating the progression of osteoarthritis.",0,2293
1335,35969923,On the surface-to-bulk partition of proteins in extracellular vesicles.,"Nanomaterials are characterized by an extremely large surface-to-volume ratio. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) - which have been recently recognized as the universal agent of intercellular communication, being involved in many physiological and pathological processes and interkingdom biochemical communication - are nanoparticles, but this key aspect has never been rationally addressed. Here we report the first attempt to quantify the membrane-to-lumen partition of proteins in EVs. A semi-quantitative model based on available well-established compositional and microstructural data is formulated. The model allows for the estimation of the overall protein content of an EV as well as of the partition between membrane (surface) associated and lumen (bulk) contained proteins as a function of the EV size and shape. It further identifies 180 nm as a switch diameter, below which EVs result composed of more membrane than luminal proteins. At larger diameters the partition is reversed, reaching predominance of luminal proteins (> 80 %) in large EVs (diameter > 800 nm). The model is successfully tested to analyze and describe a real preparation composed of subpopulations of small EVs (diameter < 200 nm), including exosomes and ectosomes, and large EVs including large oncosomes (diameter > 1000 nm) from human prostate cancer cells. These findings provide the basis for a better colloidal description of EV samples, might help to understand the stoichiometry of proteins in distinct EV sub-populations, and will improve the design and interpretation of experiments, including EV engineering and dosing in-vitro and in-vivo.",0,2294
2274,35967157,Heart Rate Variability Can Detect Blunt Traumatic Brain Injury Within the First Hour.,"In patients with multi-organ system trauma, the diagnosis of coinciding traumatic brain injury can be difficult due to injuries from the hemorrhagic shock that confound clinical and radiographic signs of traumatic brain injury. In this study, a novel technique using heart rate variability was developed in a porcine model to detect traumatic brain injury early in the setting of hemorrhagic shock without the need for radiographic imaging or clinical exam. A porcine model of hemorrhagic shock was used with an arm of swine receiving hemorrhagic shock alone and hemorrhagic shock with traumatic brain injury. High-resolution heart rate frequencies were collected at different time intervals using waveforms based on voltage delivered from the heart rate monitor. Waveforms were analyzed to assess statistically significant differences between heart rate variability parameters in those with hemorrhagic shock and traumatic brain injury versus those with only hemorrhagic shock. Stochastic analysis was used to assess the validity of results and create a model by machine learning to better assess the presence of traumatic brain injury. Significant differences were found in several heart rate variability parameters between the two groups. Additionally, significant differences in heart rate variability parameters were found in swine within 1 hour of inducing hemorrhage in those with traumatic brain injury versus those without. These results were confirmed with stochastic analysis and machine learning was used to generate a model which determined the presence of traumatic brain injury in the setting of hemorrhage shock with 91.6% accuracy.  Heart rate variability represents a promising diagnostic tool to aid in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury within 1 hour of injury.",0,2295
456,35978932,Pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction and the role of combined brain/heart magnetic resonance imaging (Review).,"Normal cognitive function depends on a continuous and optimally regulated blood supply, and any pathology that further reduces cerebral blood perfusion in addition to that caused by aging could damage or destroy vulnerable neurons of the brain. Furthermore, glucose serves a crucial role as the primary fuel source for the mammalian brain and any disturbance in its circulating concentrations could directly affect brain function. The term cognitive dysfunction (CD), known also as 'brain fog', refers to deficits in attention, verbal and non-verbal learning, short-term and working memory, visual and auditory processing, mathematic problem solving, processing speed, focusing on a specific topic, and motor functioning. CD is the end-point of various cardiovascular, neural, metabolic and immune function impairments. Although CD has a serious impact on patient survival and quality of life, usually it is clinically underestimated. CD is currently assessed using cognitive tests (questionnaires), which have important limitations in their diagnostic capacity, specifically in the preclinical forms of CD. Cognitive tests may not identify subclinical cases of CD but diagnose CD only when symptoms are clinically overt. Furthermore, these tests do not provide information regarding the underlying pathophysiologic background of CD. The aim of the present review is to summarize the existing literature on CD and emphasize the role of combined brain-heart magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in its early diagnosis, before CD questionnaires are abnormal. Combined brain/heart MRI has the potential to identify patients with CD at an early stage, facilitating risk stratification and early intervention. Furthermore, in parallel with brain assessment, it provides valuable information regarding the effect of the underlying disease on the myocardium. Equipment availability, physician familiarity and cost/effectiveness should be considered before wide clinical application of combined brain/heart MRI is recommended.",0,2296
1785,35967871,Molecular mechanisms and functions of pyroptosis in sepsis and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction.,"Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, is a leading cause of death in intensive care units. The development of sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (SAOD) poses a threat to the survival of patients with sepsis. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of sepsis and SAOD is complicated, multifactorial, and has not been completely clarified. Recently, numerous studies have demonstrated that pyroptosis, which is characterized by inflammasome and caspase activation and cell membrane pore formation, is involved in sepsis. Unlike apoptosis, pyroptosis is a pro-inflammatory form of programmed cell death that participates in the regulation of immunity and inflammation. Related studies have shown that in sepsis, moderate pyroptosis promotes the clearance of pathogens, whereas the excessive activation of pyroptosis leads to host immune response disorders and SAOD. Additionally, transcription factors, non-coding RNAs, epigenetic modifications and post-translational modifications can directly or indirectly regulate pyroptosis-related molecules. Pyroptosis also interacts with autophagy, apoptosis, NETosis, and necroptosis. This review summarizes the roles and regulatory mechanisms of pyroptosis in sepsis and SAOD. As our understanding of the functions of pyroptosis improves, the development of new diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies associated with pyroptosis to improve clinical outcomes appears promising in the future.",0,2297
2171,35967347,Comprehensive analysis of mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses restricted by single HLA class II allotype in an individual.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is generally asymptomatic as latent tuberculosis, but it is still known as the world's leading bacterial cause of death. The diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection relies on the evidence of cellular immunity to mycobacterial antigens. Since the association between HLA class II and tuberculosis infection has been reported in several population groups, a detailed study on the CD4+ T cell response to major tuberculosis antigens is needed. To elucidate which HLA class II allotypes in an individual are preferentially used in tuberculosis, CD4+ T cells specific to TB10.4, Ag85b, ESAT-6, and CFP-10 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens were analyzed comprehensively. A total of 33 healthy donors were analyzed by ex vivo and cultured ELISPOT using panels of artificial antigen-presenting cells expressing a single HLA class II allotype. The CD4+ T cell responses were increased by an average of 39-fold in cultured ELISPOT compared with ex vivo ELISPOT. In ex vivo and cultured ELISPOT, CD4+ T cell responses showed significantly higher by HLA-DR than those of HLA-DQ and HLA-DP locus. In cultured ELISPOT, 9 HLA-DR allotypes, 4 HLA-DQ allotypes, and 3 HLA-DP allotypes showed positive CD4+ T cell responses. Among ten donors with positive CD4+ T cell responses when tested for mixed Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, seven donors were positive for only a single allotype, and three were positive for two allotypes in an individual. However, only one allotype was used for a single antigen-specific response when a single tuberculosis antigen was used individually. These results on the distribution of HLA class II allotypes showing high CD4+ T-cell responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens and the intra-individual allotype dominance will provide valuable information for understanding the immunobiology and immunogenetics of tuberculosis, which can contribute to the development of more effective vaccines.",0,2298
583,35978504,The miR-548d-5p/SP1 signaling axis regulates chondrocyte proliferation and inflammatory responses in osteoarthritis.,"Chondrocyte apoptosis and dysfunction play an important role in osteoarthritis (OA), a chronic progressive arthropathy. Non-coding RNAs have been implicated in OA pathogenesis. In this study, microRNA (miR)-548d-5p was found to be downregulated in OA samples and IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes. miR-548d-5p overexpression partially reversed IL-1β-induced chondrocyte damage in vitro, evidenced by the promotion of cell growth, the inhibition of apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine release, and the improvement in extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Furthermore, miR-548d-5p overexpression partially reversed papain-induced damages on OA rat's knee articular cartilage. Specificity protein 1 (SP1) was inhibited by miR-548d-5p and identified as its direct downstream target. In IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes, SP1 overexpression significantly attenuated the protective effects of miR-548d-5p overexpression against chondrocyte damage. In conclusion, miR-548d-5p was abnormally downregulated in OA samples and IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes. miR-548d-5p protects against IL-1β-induced chondrocyte damage via direct inhibition of SP1.",0,2299
834,35974937,Effect of lifestyle modification for two years on obesity and metabolic syndrome components in elementary students: A community- based trial.,"Lifestyle modifications, especially improving nutritional patterns and increasing physical activity are the most important factors in preventing obesity and metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents. For this purpose, the following interventional study was designed to investigate the effects of educational programs for students, as well as the changes in diet and physical activity on obesity and components of the metabolic syndrome. This study is part of an interventional research project (elementary school) conducted on all students of Sama schools in Zanjan and Abhar in three levels;elementary, middle and high school, including 1000 individuals in Zanjan (intervention group) and 1000 individuals (control group) in Abhar in 2011. Interventions were based on educating students, teachers and parents, changes in food services and physical activity. We primarily measured anthropometric indices, fasting blood sugar, lipid profiles and blood pressure and completed standard nutrition and physical activity questionnaires. Also, blood insulin levels were randomly measured in a number of students. Data analysis was done by SPSS software Version 16.0. Overall, 589 individuals (252 males, 337 females) entered the case group and 803 individuals (344 males, 459 females) entered the control group. After two years of intervention, the mean waist circumference (63.8±10.9) and diastolic BP (63.8±10.4) were significantly lower, however, the mean systolic BP (10.1.0±12.5), food score (25.0±5.0) and drinking score (12.1±2.3) were higher in the intervention group (p<0.001). Comparing the components of metabolic syndrome between the second year and at the time of recruitment within the intervention group, showed that although the number of overweight/obese individuals, individuals with hypertriglyceridemia and high LDL increased, while those with abdominal obesity, high BP, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance decreased (p<0.001). On the other hand, in the control group, the number of individuals with high BP increased significantly. The prevalence of abdominal obesity and hypertension, which are the two major components of metabolic syndrome, are much higher in our study than the other regions of the country. However, interventions for modification of diet and increasing physical activity, are effective in lowering of their prevalence.",0,2300
1341,35969708,Comparative metabolomic analysis in horses and functional analysis of branched chain (alpha) keto acid dehydrogenase complex in equine myoblasts under exercise stress.,"The integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics may elucidate the correlation between the genotypic and phenotypic patterns in organisms. In equine physiology, various metabolite levels vary during exercise, which may be correlated with a modified gene expression pattern of related genes. Integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic studies in horses have not been conducted to date. The objective of this study was to detect the effect of moderate exercise on the metabolomic and transcriptomic levels in horses. In this study, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we analyzed the concentrations of metabolites in muscle and plasma; we also determined the gene expression patterns of branched chain (alpha) keto acid dehydrogenase kinase complex (BCKDK), which encodes the key regulatory enzymes in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism, in two breeds of horses, Thoroughbred and Jeju, at different time intervals. The concentrations of metabolites in muscle and plasma were measured by 1H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy, and the relative metabolite levels before and after exercise in the two samples were compared. Subsequently, multivariate data analysis based on the metabolic profiles was performed using orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), and variable important plots and t-test were used for basic statistical analysis. The stress-induced expression patterns of BCKDK genes in horse muscle-derived cells were examined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to gain insight into the role of transcript in response to exercise stress. In this study, we found higher concentrations of aspartate, leucine, isoleucine, and lysine in the skeletal muscle of Jeju horses than in Thoroughbred horses. In plasma, compared with Jeju horses, Thoroughbred horses had higher levels of alanine and methionine before exercise; whereas post-exercise, lysine levels were increased. Gene expression analysis revealed a decreased expression level of BCKDK in the post-exercise period in Thoroughbred horses.",0,2301
2063,35967455,Pathogenic role of monocytes/macrophages in large vessel vasculitis.,"Vasculitis is an autoimmune vascular inflammation with an unknown etiology and causes vessel wall destruction. Depending on the size of the blood vessels, it is classified as large, medium, and small vessel vasculitis. A wide variety of immune cells are involved in the pathogenesis of vasculitis. Among these immune cells, monocytes and macrophages are functionally characterized by their capacity for phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and cytokine/chemokine production. After a long debate, recent technological advances have revealed the cellular origin of tissue macrophages in the vessel wall. Tissue macrophages are mainly derived from embryonic progenitor cells under homeostatic conditions, whereas bone marrow-derived circulating monocytes are recruited under inflammatory conditions, and then differentiate into macrophages in the arterial wall. Such macrophages infiltrate into an otherwise immunoprotected vascular site, digest tissue matrix with abundant proteolytic enzymes, and further recruit inflammatory cells through cytokine/chemokine production. In this way, macrophages amplify the inflammatory cascade and eventually cause tissue destruction. Recent studies have also demonstrated that monocytes/macrophages can be divided into several subpopulations based on the cell surface markers and gene expression. In this review, the subpopulations of circulating monocytes and the ontogeny of tissue macrophages in the artery are discussed. We also update the immunopathology of large vessel vasculitis, with a special focus on giant cell arteritis, and outline how monocytes/macrophages participate in the disease process of vascular inflammation. Finally, we discuss limitations of the current research and provide future research perspectives, particularly in humans. Through these processes, we explore the possibility of therapeutic strategies targeting monocytes/macrophages in vasculitis.",0,2302
2105,35967413,The DCMU Herbicide Shapes T-cell Functions By Modulating Micro-RNA Expression Profiles.,"DCMU [N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-dimethylurea] or diuron is a widely used herbicide, which can cause adverse effects on human, especially on immune cells, due to their intrinsic properties and wide distribution. These cells are important for fighting not only against virus or bacteria but also against neoplastic cell development. We developed an approach that combines functional studies and miRNA and RNA sequencing data to evaluate the effects of DCMU on the human immune response against cancer, particularly the one carried out by CD8+ T cells. We found that DCMU modulates the expression of miRNA in a dose-dependent manner, leading to a specific pattern of gene expression and consequently to a diminished cytokine and granzyme B secretions. Using mimics or anti-miRs, we identified several miRNA, such as hsa-miR-3135b and hsa-miR-21-5p, that regulate these secretions. All these changes reduce the CD8+ T cells' cytotoxic activity directed against cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo in a zebrafish model. To conclude, our study suggests that DCMU reduces T-cell abilities, participating thus to the establishment of an environment conducive to cancer development.",0,2303
1807,35967848,Potential Implications of the Lung Microbiota in Patients with Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Recently, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been considered as a common risk factor of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, very few studies have been conducted on the effects of COPD on the lung microbiota in patients with NSCLC. To identify the lung microbiota in patients with COPD and NSCLC (CN), the microbiome of the induced sputa of 90 patients was analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing. The results showed no significant differences in the bacterial diversities of induced sputa among patients with COPD, NSCLC, and CN and no intrinsic differences among patients with different pathological types of lung cancer. After surgical operation, the diversities of the induced sputa in patients with CN significantly decreased. More remarkably, both the microbial community phenotypes and the components of the induced sputa in patients with CN obviously differed from those in patients with COPD or NSCLC. The relative abundances of Streptococcus, Veillonella, Moraxella, and Actinomyces significantly decreased, but those of Neisseria and Acinetobacter significantly increased in patients with CN compared with those in patients with COPD or NSCLC alone, resulting in increased Gram-negative microbiota and, therefore, in potential pathogenicity and stress tolerance, as well as in enhancement of microbial glycolipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and oxidative stress. Although COPD did not affect the number of pulmonary flora species in patients with NSCLC, these significant alterations in the microbial populations, phenotypes, and functions of induced sputa due to COPD would contribute to inflammation-derived cancer progression in patients with CN.",0,2304
2153,35967365,Novel approaches for long-term lung transplant survival.,"Allograft failure remains a major barrier in the field of lung transplantation and results primarily from acute and chronic rejection. To date, standard-of-care immunosuppressive regimens have proven unsuccessful in achieving acceptable long-term graft and patient survival. Recent insights into the unique immunologic properties of lung allografts provide an opportunity to develop more effective immunosuppressive strategies. Here we describe advances in our understanding of the mechanisms driving lung allograft rejection and highlight recent progress in the development of novel, lung-specific strategies aimed at promoting long-term allograft survival, including tolerance.",0,2305
1500,35968387,Peripheral nervous system: A promising source of neuronal progenitors for central nervous system repair.,"With a steadily aging population there is an increasing prevalence of neurological disorders. Given the lack of effective treatment strategies and a limited ability for the central nervous system (CNS) to regenerate endogenously, there is a critical need to better understand exogenous strategies for nervous system repair. Stem cell therapy offers a promising approach to promote the repair of neurologic tissue and function, however studies to date have been limited by various factors including challenges in harvesting donor cells from the CNS, ethical concerns regarding use of embryonic or fetal tissue, tumorigenic potential of induced pluripotent stem cells, and immune-mediated rejection of non-autologous cell sources. Here we review and propose two alternative sources of autologous cells derived from the peripheral nervous system (PNS) for CNS repair: enteric neuronal stem cells (ENSCs) and neural crest-derived Schwann cells found in subcutaneous adipose tissue (termed SAT-NSCs). ENSCs can be successfully isolated from the postnatal enteric nervous system, propagated in vitro, and transplanted successfully into models of CNS injury via both direct intracerebral injection and systemic tail vein injection. Similarly, SAT-NSCs can be readily isolated from both human and mouse adipose tissue and, although not yet utilized in models of CNS injury, have successfully been transplanted and restored function in models of colonic aganglionosis and gastroparesis. These unique sources of PNS-derived autologous cells offer an exciting option for stem cell therapies for the CNS as they have proven neurogenic potential and eliminate concerns around tumorigenic risk, ethical considerations, and immune-mediated rejection.",0,2306
490,35978857,Immune-Triggered Forms of Plasticity Across Brain Regions.,"Immune cells play numerous roles in the host defense against the invasion of microorganisms and pathogens, which induces the release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines and chemokines). In the CNS, microglia is the major resident immune cell. Recent efforts have revealed the diversity of the cell types and the heterogeneity of their functions. The refinement of the synapse structure was a hallmark feature of the microglia, while they are also involved in the myelination and capillary dynamics. Another promising feature is the modulation of the synaptic transmission as synaptic plasticity and the intrinsic excitability of neurons as non-synaptic plasticity. Those modulations of physiological properties of neurons are considered induced by both transient and chronic exposures to inflammatory mediators, which cause behavioral disorders seen in mental illness. It is plausible for astrocytes and pericytes other than microglia and macrophage to induce the immune-triggered plasticity of neurons. However, current understanding has yet achieved to unveil what inflammatory mediators from what immune cells or glia induce a form of plasticity modulating pre-, post-synaptic functions and intrinsic excitability of neurons. It is still unclear what ion channels and intracellular signaling of what types of neurons in which brain regions of the CNS are involved. In this review, we introduce the ubiquitous modulation of the synaptic efficacy and the intrinsic excitability across the brain by immune cells and related inflammatory cytokines with the mechanism for induction. Specifically, we compare neuro-modulation mechanisms by microglia of the intrinsic excitability of cerebellar Purkinje neurons with cerebral pyramidal neurons, stressing the inverted directionality of the plasticity. We also discuss the suppression and augmentation of the extent of plasticity by inflammatory mediators, as the meta-plasticity by immunity. Lastly, we sum up forms of immune-triggered plasticity in the different brain regions with disease relevance. Together, brain immunity influences our cognition, sense, memory, and behavior via immune-triggered plasticity.",0,2307
2148,35967370,Intervertebral disc cell chondroptosis elicits neutrophil response in Staphylococcus aureus spondylodiscitis.,"To understand the pathophysiology of spondylodiscitis due to Staphylococcus aureus, an emerging infectious disease of the intervertebral disc (IVD) and vertebral body with a high complication rate, we combined clinical insights and experimental approaches. Clinical data and histological material of nine patients suffering from S. aureus spondylodiscitis were retrospectively collected at a single center. To mirror the clinical findings experimentally, we developed a novel porcine ex vivo model mimicking acute S. aureus spondylodiscitis and assessed the interaction between S. aureus and IVD cells within their native environment. In addition, the inflammatory features underlying this interaction were assessed in primary human IVD cells. Finally, mirroring the clinical findings, we assessed primary human neutrophils for their ability to respond to secreted inflammatory modulators of IVD cells upon the S. aureus challenge. Acute S. aureus spondylodiscitis in patients was characterized by tissue necrosis and neutrophil infiltration. Additionally, the presence of empty IVD cells' lacunae was observed. This was mirrored in the ex vivo porcine model, where S. aureus induced extensive IVD cell death, leading to empty lacunae. Concomitant engagement of the apoptotic and pyroptotic cell death pathways was observed in primary human IVD cells, resulting in cytokine release. Among the released cytokines, functionally intact neutrophil-priming as well as broad pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines which are known for their involvement in IVD degeneration were found. In patients as well as ex vivo in a novel porcine model, S. aureus IVD infection caused IVD cell death, resulting in empty lacunae, which was accompanied by the release of inflammatory markers and recruitment of neutrophils. These findings offer valuable insights into the important role of inflammatory IVD cell death during spondylodiscitis and potential future therapeutic approaches.",0,2308
1802,35967853,Gut microbiome is associated with metabolic syndrome accompanied by elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in men.,"It is predicted that by 2035, metabolic syndrome (MS) will be found in nearly more than half of our adult population, seriously affecting the health of our body. MS is usually accompanied by the occurrence of abnormal liver enzymes, such as elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). More and more studies have shown that the gut microbiota is involved in MS; however, the correlation between gut microbiota and MS with elevated GGT has not been studied comprehensively. Especially, there are few reports about its role in the physical examination of the population of men with MS and elevated GGT. By using the whole-genome shotgun sequencing technology, we conducted a genome-wide association study of the gut microbiome in 66 participants diagnosed as having MS accompanied by high levels of GGT (case group) and 66 participants with only MS and normal GGT level (control group). We found that the number of gut microbial species was reduced in participants in the case group compared to that of the control group. The overall microbial composition between the two groups is of significant difference. The gut microbiota in the case group is characterized by increased levels of harmful bacteria such as Megamonas hypermegale, Megamonas funiformis, Megamonas unclassified, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Fusobacterium mortiferum and decreased levels of beneficial bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium eligens, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Bacteroides dorei, and Alistipes putredinis. Moreover, the pathways of POLYAMSYN-PWY, ARG+POLYAMINE-SYN, PWY-6305, and GOLPDLCAT-PWY were also increased in the case group, which may play a role in the elevation of GGT by producing amine, polyamine, putrescine, and endogenous alcohol. Taken together, there are apparent changes in the composition of the gut microbiome in men with MS and abnormal GGT levels, and it is high time to discover specific gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target in that population. More in-depth studies of relevant mechanism could offer some new methods for the treatment of MS with elevated GGT.",0,2309
2192,35967326,Crohn's disease recurrence updates: first surgery vs. surgical relapse patients display different profiles of ileal microbiota and systemic microbial-associated inflammatory factors.,"Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis is still unclear. Remodeling in mucosal microbiota and systemic immunoregulation may represent an important component in tissue injury. Here, we aim to characterize the ileal microbiota in both pathological and healthy settings and to evaluate the correlated systemic microbial-associated inflammatory markers comparing first-time surgery and relapse clinical conditions. We enrolled 28 CD patients at surgery; we collected inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa tissues and blood samples from each patient. Bacterial wall adherence was observed histologically, while its composition was assessed through amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. In addition, we evaluated the systemic microRNA (miRNA) using quantitative real-time PCR amplification and free fatty acids (FFAs) using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The total number of mucosal adherent microbiota was enriched in healthy compared to inflamed mucosa. In contrast, the phylum Tenericutes, the family Ruminococcaceae, and the genera Mesoplasma and Mycoplasma were significantly enriched in the pathological setting. Significant microbiota differences were observed between the relapse and first surgery patients regarding the families Bacillaceae 2 and Brucellaceae and the genera Escherichia/Shigella, Finegoldia, Antrobacter, Gemmatimonas, Moraxella, Anoxibacillus, and Proteus. At the systemic level, we observed a significant downregulation of circulating miR-155 and miR-223, as well as 2-methyl butyric, isobutyric, and hexanoic (caproic) acids in recurrence compared to the first surgery patients. In addition, the level of hexanoic acid seems to act as a predictor of recurrence risk in CD patients (OR 18; 95% confidence interval 1.24-261.81; p = 0.006). We describe a dissimilarity of ileal microbiota composition comparing CD and healthy settings, as well as systemic microbial-associated inflammatory factors between first surgery and surgical relapse. We suggest that patterns of microbiota, associated with healthy ileal tissue, could be involved in triggering CD recurrence. Our findings may provide insight into the dynamics of the gut microbiota-immunity axis in CD surgical recurrence, paving the way for new diagnostics and therapeutics aimed not only at reducing inflammation but also at maintaining a general state of eubiosis in healthy tissue.",0,2310
2379,35966994,Electrical stimulation mapping in the medial prefrontal cortex induced auditory hallucinations of episodic memory: A case report.,"It has been well documented that the auditory system in the superior temporal cortex is responsible for processing basic auditory sound features, such as sound frequency and intensity, while the prefrontal cortex is involved in higher-order auditory functions, such as language processing and auditory episodic memory. The temporal auditory cortex has vast forward anatomical projections to the prefrontal auditory cortex, connecting with the lateral, medial, and orbital parts of the prefrontal cortex. The connections between the auditory cortex and the prefrontal cortex thus help in localizing, recognizing, and comprehending external auditory inputs. In addition, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is believed to be a core region of episodic memory retrieval and is one of the most important regions in the default mode network (DMN). However, previous neural evidence with regard to the comparison between basic auditory processing and auditory episodic memory retrieval mainly comes from fMRI studies. The specific neural networks and the corresponding critical frequency bands of neuronal oscillations underlying the two auditory functions remain unclear. In the present study, we reported results of direct cortical stimulations during stereo-electro-encephalography (SEEG) recording in a patient with drug-resistant epilepsy. Electrodes covered the superior temporal gyrus, the operculum and the insula cortex of bilateral hemispheres, the prefrontal cortex, the parietal lobe, the anterior and middle cingulate cortex, and the amygdala of the left hemisphere. Two types of auditory hallucinations were evoked with direct cortical stimulations, which were consistent with the habitual seizures. The noise hallucinations, i.e., I could hear buzzing noises in my head, were evoked with the stimulation of the superior temporal gyrus. The episodic memory hallucinations I could hear a young woman who was dressed in a red skirt saying: What is the matter with you?, were evoked with the stimulation of MPFC. The patient described how she had met this young woman when she was young and that the woman said the same sentence to her. Furthermore, by analyzing the high gamma power (HGP) induced by direct electrical stimulation, two dissociable neural networks underlying the two types of auditory hallucinations were localized. Taken together, the present results confirm the hierarchical processing of auditory information by showing the different involvements of the primary auditory cortex vs. the prefrontal cortex in the two types of auditory hallucinations.",0,2311
205,35982816,18F-FDG 18F-FDG Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Cortical Reorganization in Spinal Trauma.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) extensively impacts the sensorimotor reorganization in the brain. The effects can be both anatomical and functional. To date, not many studies using 18F-Fluoro-2-Deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) to evaluate metabolic changes in the brain are done. Understanding such changes is crucial for developing clinical management and evidence-based rehabilitation strategies for these patients. In this study, we compared 18F-FDG PET imaging of 6 SCI patients with complete paraplegia and 19 controls. Statistical parametric mapping software was utilized to compare the images on a voxel to voxel basis (significance level P < 0.05 and clusters having >50 voxels). The study showed raised metabolism in supplementary motor areas, comprehension centers, some areas in the parietal and temporal lobe, putamen and cerebellum while reduced metabolic uptake in areas like anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus and sensory cortical areas when SCI patients were compared against healthy controls. The frontal lobe showed varied results where certain regions showed higher metabolism while the others showed lower in patients compared with controls. Cerebral deafferentation or disuse atrophy can be linked with reduced metabolism while raised uptake can be associated with initiation and planning of movement and cognitive changes in the brain posttrauma.",0,2312
2094,35967424,Immunosuppressive landscape in hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell sequencing.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accounting for 75-85% of primary liver cancer cases, is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The purpose of this research was to examine the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in HCC. We investigated the HCC TIME by integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk-tissue sequencing data to reveal the landscape of major immune cell types. Regulatory T(Treg) cells were found to be specifically distributed in the TIME of HCC. Several immune checkpoints, including TNFRSF4, TIGIT and CTLA4, were found to be uniquely overexpressed in Treg cells, and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway was enriched in Treg cells. We also discovered the presence of two NK-cell subsets with different cytotoxic capacities, one in an activated state with antitumor effects and another with an exhausted status. In addition, memory B cells in HCC were found to exist in a unique state, with high proliferation, low differentiation, and low activity, which was induced by overexpression of PRAP1 and activation of the MIF-CD74 axis. We revealed the TIME landscape in HCC, highlighting the heterogeneity of major immune cell types and their potential mechanisms in the formation of an immunosuppressive environment. Hence, blocking the formation of the TIME could be a useful therapeutic strategy for HCC.",0,2313
2204,35967314,FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells in acute HIV infection and following early antiretroviral therapy initiation.,"Besides CD4 regulatory T-cells (Tregs), immunosuppressor FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells are emerging as an important subset of Tregs, which contribute to immune dysfunction and disease progression in HIV infection. However, FoxP3+ CD8 T-cell dynamics in acute HIV infection and following early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation remain understudied. Subsets of FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells were characterized both prospectively and cross-sectionally in PBMCs from untreated acute (n=26) and chronic (n=10) HIV-infected individuals, early ART-treated in acute infection (n=10, median of ART initiation: 5.5 months post-infection), ART-treated in chronic infection (n=10), elite controllers (n=18), and HIV-uninfected controls (n=21). Acute and chronic infection were associated with increased total, effector memory, and terminally differentiated FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells, while early ART normalized only the frequencies of total FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells. We observed an increase in FoxP3+ CD8 T-cell immune activation (HLADR+/CD38+), senescence (CD57+/CD28-), and PD-1 expression during acute and chronic infection, which were not normalized by early ART. FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells in untreated participants expressed higher levels of immunosuppressive LAP(TGF-β1) and CD39 than uninfected controls, whereas early ART did not affect their expression. The expression of gut-homing markers CCR9 and Integrin-β7 by total FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells and CD39+ and LAP(TGF-β1)+ FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells increased in untreated individuals and remained higher than in uninfected controls despite early ART. Elite controllers share most of the FoxP3+ CD8 T-cell characteristics in uninfected individuals. Although early ART normalized total FoxP3+ CD8 T-cells frequencies, it did not affect the persistent elevation of the gut-homing potential of CD39+ and LAP(TGF-β1)+ FoxP3+ CD8 T-cell, which may contribute to immune dysfunction.",0,2314
1811,35967844,"Lymphostatin, a virulence factor of attaching and effacing Escherichia coli, inhibits proliferation and cytokine responses of human T cells in a manner associated with cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis or necrosis.","Lymphostatin is a virulence factor of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and non-O157 serogroup enterohaemorrhagic E. coli. Previous studies using whole-cell lysates of EPEC showed that lymphostatin inhibits the mitogen-activated proliferation of bulk human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the production of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-γ. Here, we used highly purified lymphostatin and PBMC-derived T cells to show that lymphostatin inhibits anti-CD3/anti-CD28-activated proliferation of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and blocks the synthesis of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ without affecting cell viability and in a manner dependent on an N-terminal DTD glycosyltransferase motif. Such inhibition was not observed with T cells activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, implying that lymphostatin targets T cell receptor signaling. Analysis of the expression of CD69 indicated that lymphostatin suppresses T cell activation at an early stage and no impacts on apoptosis or necrosis were observed. Flow cytometric analysis of the DNA content of lymphostatin-treated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed a concentration- and DTD-dependent accumulation of the cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and corresponding reduction of the percentage of cells in S phase. Consistent with this, we found a marked reduction in the abundance of cyclins D3, E and A and loss of phosphorylated Rb over time in activated T cells from 8 donors treated with lymphostatin. Moreover, the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p27kip1, which inhibits progression of the cell cycle at G1 by acting on cyclin E-cdk2 or cyclin D-cdk4 complexes, was found to be accumulated in lymphostatin-treated T cells. Analysis of the abundance of phosphorylated kinases involved in signal transduction found that 30 of 39 were reduced in abundance following lymphostatin treatment of T cells from 5 donors, albeit not significantly so. Our data provide novel insights into the mode of action of lymphostatin on human T lymphocytes.",0,2315
1537,35968349,An immune-inflamed tumor microenvironment as defined by CD8 score is associated with favorable oncologic outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma independent of measures of tumor mutational burden.,"Despite low mutational burden, immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated promising results in a significant minority of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with advanced disease. We hypothesized that HCC patients with higher levels of CD8+ T cell infiltration reflect an immune-inflamed cohort which has improved oncologic outcomes. 355 HCC patients with clinical and transcriptome data in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 151 HCC patients from cohort GSE7624 were analyzed. xCell computational algorithm was used to analyze immune cell infiltration in these patients. Each cohort was divided into high and low expression by the highest 2 terciles value. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed to identify enriched gene sets. High CD8 score associated with improved overall survival in both cohorts (both P < 0.05). High score correlates with early BCLC stage (P = 0.035) but not AJCC stage. High CD8 also correlated with increased IFN-γ response (p = 0.038), lymphocyte infiltration (P < 0.001), and leukocyte fraction (P < 0.001). It was associated with increased polyclonality of T cell (P < 0.001) and B cell response (P = 0.017). High CD8 score correlated with increased cytolytic activity score (P < 0.001) and expression of multiple immune checkpoints including PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and Lag3 (all P < 0.001). There was no correlation to tumor mutational burden and neoantigens. GSEA demonstrated upregulation of several gene sets involved in inflammatory response and IFN-γ response. In conclusion, HCC patients with high CD8 score demonstrated favorable oncologic outcomes, which may be due to immune-mediated tumor cell attack. Furthermore, CD8 score may be a potentially useful biomarker to select patients for immune checkpoint inhibition.",0,2316
824,35974947,"HOMA-IR index in non-diabetic patient, a reliable method for early diagnosis of liver steatosis.","NAFLD is one of the most common liver diseases in the world. HOMA-IR as an indicator of insulin resistance is commonly used in clinical trials in NAFLD patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of HOMA-IR index in the diagnosis of NAFLD. This study was performed on 54 patients with NAFLD and 54 non-NAFLD patients that referred to Razi Hospital in Rasht during 2019-2020. FibroScan was used to diagnose NAFLD in the patient group and ultrasound was used to rule it out in the control group. Metabolic and hepatic parameters were measured for each patient. Data were entered into SPSS 22 software and the necessary analyses were performed. The mean age of the subjects in the study was 44.01±13.12 years and ranged from 18 to 75 years. 72.2% of people affected by NAFLD were men (p <0.001) .The optimal cut-off point for HOMA-IR in NAFLD was 1.65 with a sensitivity of 89.7% and a specificity of 76.9% in men and 1.90 with a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 82.9% in women. Overall, the optimal cut-off point for HOMA-IR in NAFLD was 1.75 with a sensitivity of 87.0% and a specificity of 81.5%. In addition, the results showed that there was no significant relationship between steatosis and hepatic fibrosis with HOMA-IR index. The results showed that HOMA-IR can be used as a reliable criterion for early detection of NAFLD.",0,2317
1636,35968141,Untargeted LC-MS/MS-Based Metabolomic Profiling for the Edible and Medicinal Plant Salvia miltiorrhiza Under Different Levels of Cadmium Stress.,"Salvia miltiorrhiza, a medicinal and edible plant, has been extensively applied to treat cardiovascular diseases and chronic hepatitis. Cadmium (Cd) affects the quality of S. miltiorrhiza, posing serious threats to human health. To reveal the metabolic mechanisms of S. miltiorrhiza's resistance to Cd stress, metabolite changes in S. miltiorrhiza roots treated with 0 (CK), 25 (T1), 50 (T2) and 100 (T3) mg kg-1 Cd by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were investigated. A total of 305 metabolites were identified, and most of them were amino acids, organic acids and fatty acids, which contributed to the discrimination of CK from the Cd-treated groups. Among them, S. miltiorrhiza mainly upregulated o-tyrosine, chorismate and eudesmic acid in resistance to 25 mg kg-1 Cd; DL-tryptophan, L-aspartic acid, L-proline and chorismite in resistance to 50 mg kg-1 Cd; and L-proline, L-serine, L-histidine, eudesmic acid, and rosmarinic acid in resistance to 100 mg kg-1 Cd. It mainly downregulated unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid, linoleic acid) in resistance to 25, 50, and 100 mg kg-1 Cd and upregulated saturated fatty acids (especially stearic acid) in resistance to 100 mg kg-1 Cd. Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, isoquinoline alkaloid, betalain, aminoacyl-tRNA, and tyrosine metabolism were the significantly enriched metabolic pathways and the most important pathways involved in the Cd resistance of S. miltiorrhiza. These data elucidated the crucial metabolic mechanisms involved in S. miltiorrhiza Cd resistance and the crucial metabolites that could be used to improve resistance to Cd stress in medicinal plant breeding.",0,2318
343,35979364,Alveolar macrophages in early stage COPD show functional deviations with properties of impaired immune activation.,"Despite its high prevalence, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are far from being understood. Here, we determine disease-related changes in cellular and molecular compositions within the alveolar space and peripheral blood of a cohort of COPD patients and controls. Myeloid cells were the largest cellular compartment in the alveolar space with invading monocytes and proliferating macrophages elevated in COPD. Modeling cell-to-cell communication, signaling pathway usage, and transcription factor binding predicts TGF-β1 to be a major upstream regulator of transcriptional changes in alveolar macrophages of COPD patients. Functionally, macrophages in COPD showed reduced antigen presentation capacity, accumulation of cholesteryl ester, reduced cellular chemotaxis, and mitochondrial dysfunction, reminiscent of impaired immune activation.",0,2319
2477,35966781,"The past, present, and future of research on neuroinflammation-induced mild cognitive impairment: A bibliometric analysis.","Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor to dementia, and neuroinflammation in the brain is thought to be one of the main pathogenic mechanisms of MCI. However, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms have not been fully explored. The purpose of this study was to establish a visual model map of the articles in the field of neuroinflammation-induced MCI over the past 11 years to reveal the research hotspots and predict the future development trends in this field, which will help to promote the research and development for MCI. The neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment were used as search terms, and literature about neuroinflammation-induced MCI published between 2011 and 2021 was collected from the Web of Science. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to create visual model maps, and assess collaboration among different authors, countries, and institutions. Finally, the current research hotspots and future research directions were analyzed by using high-frequency keywords analysis and co-cited reference burst analysis. A total of 226 articles were retrieved. The number of publications in neuroinflammation-induced MCI shows an upward trend. Since 2018, the number of papers published in this field has increased significantly, with an average of more than 100 published each year. The United States had the highest literature production and the number of cited journals in this research area, and the National Institute on Aging was the most productive research institution. Brooks D.J. and Heneka M.T. had the highest number of publications and had the highest frequency of co-citations. The co-cited references revealed the evolution of the research themes, and the current studies are mainly focused on the effects of various metabolites on the control of microglial activation. Cerebrospinal fluid, mouse model, tau, microglial activation, astrocytes, and TREM2 were the current high-frequency and emerging keywords. Research on neuroinflammation-induced MCI is burgeoning, and the close collaboration with different nations and institutions need to be further strengthened. Current research hotspots are focused on the effects of various metabolites on microglia activation. Future studies should focus on how to regulate the phenotypes of microglia and astrocyte to reduce neuroinflammation and treat MCI.",0,2320
2319,35967059,Oxidative Stress: Glutathione and Its Potential to Protect Methionine-35 of Aβ Peptide from Oxidation.,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder with heterogeneous etiology. Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles caused by tau (τ) protein phosphorylation and extracellular senile plaques caused by aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide are characteristic histopathological hallmarks of AD. Oxidative stress (OS) is also suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of AD. The antioxidant glutathione (GSH) is able to mitigate OS through the detoxification of free radicals. The clearance of these free radicals is reported to be affected when there is a decline in GSH levels in AD. These radicals further react with the methionine-35 (M-35) residue of Aβ and facilitate its subsequent oligomerization. This review presents a plausible model indicating the role of master antioxidant GSH to protect M35 of Aβ1-40/Aβ1-42 from oxidation in pathological conditions as compared to healthy controls.,0,2321
2181,35967337,Galectin-9 contributes to the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis via T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD), a common type 2 inflammatory disease, is driven by T helper (TH) 2/TH22polarization and cytokines.Galectin-9 (Gal-9), via its receptor T cell immunoglobulin- and mucin-domain-containing molecule-3 (TIM-3), can promote TH2/TH22 immunity. The relevance of this in AD is largely unclear. To characterize the role of TIM-3 and Gal-9 in the pathogenesis of AD and underlying mechanisms. We assessed the expression of Gal-9 and TIM-3 in 30 AD patients, to compare them with those of 30 healthy controls (HC) and to explore possible links with disease features including AD activity (SCORAD), IgE levels, and circulating eosinophils and B cells. We also determined the effects of Gal-9 on T cells from the AD patients. Our AD patients had markedly higher levels of serum Gal-9 and circulating TIM-3-expressing TH1 and TH17 cells than HC. Gal-9 and TIM-3 were linked to high disease activity, IgE levels, and circulating eosinophils and/or B cells. The rates of circulating TIM-3-positive CD4+ cells were positively correlated with rates of TH2/TH22 cells and negatively correlated with rates of TH1/TH17 cells. Gal-9 inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of T cells in patients with AD, especially in those with severe AD. Our findings suggest thatGal-9, via TIM-3, contributes to the pathogenesis of AD by augmenting TH2/TH22 polarization through the downregulation of TH1/TH17immunity. This makes Gal-9 and TIM-3 interesting to explore further, as possible drivers of disease and targets of novel AD treatment.",0,2322
2164,35967354,Genomic analysis quantifies pyroptosis in the immune microenvironment of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Pyroptosis, a way of pro-inflammatory death, plays a significant part in the tumor microenvironment (TME). A recent study has shown that the hepatitis C virus changes the TME by inducing pyroptosis against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, compared to TME in hepatitis C virus-infected HCC, the exploration of immune characteristics and response to immunotherapy associated with the pyroptosis phenotype is still insufficient in hepatitis B virus-related HCC (HBV-HCC). Our study constructed pyroptosis-score (PYS) via principal-component analysis (PCA) to unveil the link between pyroptosis and tumor immunity in 369 HBV-HCC patients. Compared with the low-PYS group, subjects with higher PYS were associated with poor prognosis but were more susceptible to anti-PD-L1 treatment. In addition, we found that PYS can serve independently as a prognostic factor for HBV-HCC, making it possible for us to identify specific small molecule drugs with a potential value in inhibiting tumors via targeting pyroptosis. Also, the target genes predicted by the Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and pharmacophore model were enriched in the HIF-1 signaling pathway and NF-kB transcription factor activity, which were related to the mechanism of inflammation-driven cancer. The PYS is extremely important in predicting prognosis and responses to immunotherapy. New treatment strategies for inflammation-driven cancers may be found by targeting pyroptosis.",0,2323
1482,35968415,"Review of Lung Particle Overload, Rat Lung Cancer, and the Conclusions of the Edinburgh Expert Panel-It's Time to Revisit Cancer Hazard Classifications for Titanium Dioxide and Carbon Black.","Chronic inhalation of titanium dioxide or carbon black by rats at concentrations which overload lung particle clearance can result in lung cancer. Based on this rat lung response, IARC, NIOSH, and ECHA classified titanium dioxide, and IARC classified carbon black, as potential human carcinogens. These classifications have been questioned based on an extensive data base demonstrating: the rat lung cancer occurred only under conditions of extreme lung particle overload; the lung cancer response in rats has not been seen in other animal species; and studies in titanium dioxide and carbon black exposed human populations have not shown an increased incidence of cancer. In 2019 an international panel of science and regulatory experts was convened to document the state of the science on lung particle overload and rat lung cancer after exposure to poorly soluble low toxicity particles. Regarding hazard identification, the expert panel concluded, in the absence of supporting data from other species, lung particle overload-associated rat lung cancer does not imply a cancer hazard for humans. Regarding high to low dose extrapolation, the expert panel concluded rat lung tumors occurring only under conditions of lung particle overload are not relevant to humans exposed under non-overloading conditions. The conclusions of the Edinburgh Expert Panel directly conflict with IARC, ECHA and NIOSH's extrapolation of lung particle overload associated rat lung cancer to hazard for humans. The hazard classifications for titanium dioxide and carbon black inhalation should be assessed considering the state-of-the-science on lung particle overload and rat lung cancer.",0,2324
349,35979325,Field evaluation of COVID-19 rapid antigen test: Are rapid antigen tests less reliable among the elderly?,"The global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to the development of accessible and cost-effective rapid antigen-detection tests (RATs), as quick and accurate diagnosis is crucial to curb the pandemic. To evaluate the Humasis COVID-19 Ag Test (Humasis Co., Ltd., Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea) in the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This retrospective study was carried out at the Croatian Institute of Public Health and included patients with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 lasting no longer than 5 d prior to testing, whose nasopharyngeal swabs were primarily tested with RAT. Negative RAT samples underwent confirmatory real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Diagnostic efficacy was determined compared to RT-PCR. The patients were divided into three age groups (< 18, 19-65, > 65 years). Statistical analysis was performed with the significance level set at P < 0.05. In total, 2490 symptomatic patients were tested; 953 samples were positive on RAT, and 1537 were negative. All negative RAT samples were subjected to RT-PCR; 266 samples were positive and marked as false-negative results on RAT. The calculated negative predictive value as a measure of RAT efficacy was 82.69%. The χ 2 test and Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference in the proportion of false negatives (P < 0.001) and RT-PCR cycle (Ct) values for false-negative RATs (P = 0.012) among the age groups. The young age group was significantly less likely to be false negative, whereas the false negatives from the elderly group experienced significantly lower Ct values than the other two age groups. Evaluated RAT demonstrated satisfactory performance with more reliable results in younger patients. Humasis COVID-19 Ag RAT is potentially a valuable tool in areas where access to molecular methods is limited; however, RT-PCR remains a gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection.",0,2325
2178,35967340,Transcriptional dynamics and epigenetic regulation of E and ID protein encoding genes during human T cell development.,"T cells are generated from hematopoietic stem cells through a highly organized developmental process, in which stage-specific molecular events drive maturation towards αβ and γδ T cells. Although many of the mechanisms that control αβ- and γδ-lineage differentiation are shared between human and mouse, important differences have also been observed. Here, we studied the regulatory dynamics of the E and ID protein encoding genes during pediatric human T cell development by evaluating changes in chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and bulk and single cell gene expression. We profiled patterns of ID/E protein activity and identified up- and downstream regulators and targets, respectively. In addition, we compared transcription of E and ID protein encoding genes in human versus mouse to predict both shared and unique activities in these species, and in prenatal versus pediatric human T cell differentiation to identify regulatory changes during development. This analysis showed a putative involvement of TCF3/E2A in the development of γδ T cells. In contrast, in αβ T cell precursors a pivotal pre-TCR-driven population with high ID gene expression and low predicted E protein activity was identified. Finally, in prenatal but not postnatal thymocytes, high HEB/TCF12 levels were found to counteract high ID levels to sustain thymic development. In summary, we uncovered novel insights in the regulation of E and ID proteins on a cross-species and cross-developmental level.",0,2326
2214,35967304,Coexistence of anti-SOX1 and anti-GABAB receptor antibodies with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis presenting with seizures and memory impairment in small cell lung cancer: A case report.,"Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes associated with autoantibodies are rare diseases that cause abnormal manifestations of the nervous system. Early diagnosis of paraneoplastic neurological syndromes paves the way for prompt and efficient therapy. we reported a 56-year-old man presenting with seizures and rapidly progressive cognitive impairment diagnosed as paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) with anti-SRY-like high-mobility group box-1 (SOX-1) and anti-γ-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptor antibodies and finally confirmed by biopsy as small cell lung cancer (SCLC). At the first admission, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no abnormal signal in bilateral hippocampal regions and no abnormal enhancement of enhanced scan. The serum anti-GABAB receptor antibody was 1:100 and was diagnosed as autoimmune encephalitis (AE). The computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest showed no obvious tumor signs for the first time. Although positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) revealed hypermetabolism in the para mid-esophageal, the patient and his family declined to undertake a biopsy. The patient improved after receiving immunoglobulin, antiepileptic therapy, and intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) pulse treatment. However, after 4 months, the symptoms reappeared. Brain MRI revealed abnormal signals in the hippocampal regions. Reexamination of the cerebral fluid revealed anti-GABAB receptor and anti-SOX-1 antibodies, which contributed to the diagnosis of PLE. SCLC was found in a para mid-esophageal pathological biopsy. Antiepileptic medications and immunoglobulin were used to treat the patient, and the symptoms were under control. Our findings increase the awareness that patients with limbic encephalitis with cognitive dysfunction and epileptic seizures should be enhanced to detect latent malignancy. Our case also highlights the importance of anti-SOX1 antibodies in the detection of underlying neoplasm, particularly SCLC. Our findings raise awareness of the cognitive impairment seen by patients with limbic encephalitis.",0,2327
18,35985180,Care rejection and aggression among veterans with dementia with and without posttraumatic stress disorder: A multi-group analysis.,"In residential long-term care, military service veterans with co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dementia encounter a range of physical and social stimuli that may serve as triggers of trauma-related distress that manifests as care rejection or aggression. Yet, PTSD rarely has been examined in research to understand behaviors of care rejection and aggression in veterans with dementia. Guided by the need-driven dementia-compromised behavior model, we examined the moderation effect of PTSD on pathways from background factors and interpersonal triggers to rejection of care and aggression among veterans with dementia with and without co-occurring PTSD. Secondary data analysis of the Staff Training in Assisted Living Residences-Veterans Health Administration (STAR-VA) intervention evaluation by the U.S. Veterans Health Administration healthcare system. 76 Veterans Health Administration-operated nursing homes. 315 veterans with dementia who participated in STAR-VA. We converted text data on the occurrence of care rejection and aggression to binary variables, combined them with data on sociodemographic and PTSD status obtained using medical chart review, and measured anxiety, cognition, depression, and function using validated instruments. A multi-group structural equation modeling analysis was then conducted to test the moderating effect of PTSD on rejection of care and aggression. Although multi-group structural equation modeling did not support the hypothesis of overall moderation by PTSD, distinct patterns between the two groups were observed with respect to how background factors and interpersonal triggers related to care rejection and aggression. The magnitude of the direct effects of interpersonal triggers on rejection of care was greater in veterans with PTSD (β = 0.42, p = .014 compared to those without β = 0.29, p = .008). Depression had a statistically significant indirect effect on rejection of care via interpersonal triggers only in veterans with PTSD (β = 0.09, p = .009). Functional status had a statistically significant direct effect on aggression only in the PTSD group (β = 0.28, p = .044). Our study identified similar and distinct patterns of relationships among background factors, interpersonal triggers, and rejection of care and aggression between veterans with dementia with and without PTSD. The indirect effect of depression on care rejection via interpersonal triggers has implications for developing targeted interventions that focus on interpersonal triggers for veterans with dementia with PTSD who have greater depressive symptoms. This study underscores the importance of an enhanced focus on trauma-informed care for veterans with dementia and PTSD.",0,2328
1784,35967872,Ferroptosis in COVID-19-related liver injury: A potential mechanism and therapeutic target.,"The outbreak and worldwide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a threat to global public health. SARS-CoV-2 infection not only impacts the respiratory system but also causes hepatic injury. Ferroptosis, a distinct iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death, has been investigated in various pathological conditions, such as cancer, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and liver diseases. However, whether ferroptosis takes part in the pathophysiological process of COVID-19-related liver injury has not been evaluated yet. This review highlights the pathological changes in COVID-19-related liver injury and presents ferroptosis as a potential mechanism in the pathological process. Ferroptosis, as a therapeutic target for COVID-19-related liver injury, is also discussed. Discoveries in these areas will improve our understanding of strategies to prevent and treat hepatic injuries caused by COVID-19.",0,2329
132,35983274,Pharmacokinetic Optimization of Small Molecule Janus Kinase 3 Inhibitors to Target Immune Cells.,"Modulation of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling is a promising method of treating autoimmune diseases, and the profound potency of clinical compounds makes this mode of action particularly attractive. Other questions that remain unanswered also include: What is the ideal selectivity between JAK1 and JAK3? Which cells are most relevant to JAK blockade? And what is the ideal tissue distribution pattern for addressing specific autoimmune conditions? We hypothesized that JAK3 selectivity is most relevant to low-dose clinical effects and interleukin-10 (IL-10) stimulation in particular, that immune cells are the most important compartment, and that distribution to inflamed tissue is the most important pharmacokinetic characteristic for in vivo disease modification. To test these hypotheses, we prepared modified derivatives of JAK3 specific inhibitors that target C909 near the ATP binding site based on FM-381, first reported in 2016; a compound class that was hitherto limited in uptake and exposure in vivo. These limits appear to be due to metabolic instability of side groups binding in the selectivity pocket. We identified derivatives with improved stability and tissue exposure. Conjugation to macrolide scaffolds with medium chain linkers was sufficient to stabilize the compounds and improve transport to organs while maintaining JAK3 affinity. These conjugates are inflammation targeted JAK3 inhibitors with long tissue half-lives and high exposure to activated immune cells.",0,2330
776,35975061,Effect of the array of amines on the transfection efficiency of cationic peptidomimetic lipid molecules into neural cells.,"The amino groups in the head group of a cationic lipid play a determinative role regarding the nucleic acid delivery efficiency of the LNP formulated from lipids. Herein, we designed four types of lipid bearing different amine-containing branched head groups to investigate the influence of type and number of amines on the neural cell targeted nuclei acid delivery. Conjugation of an ethylamino group at selected positions of a lysine-based cationic lipid resulted in 4 distinct lipids with 3 (denoted N3 lipid), 4 (denoted N4 lipid), 5 (denoted N5 lipid) and 6 (denoted N6 lipid) amino groups, respectively. Comparative analysis by flow cytometry revealed that the N3 lipid had the highest nucleic acid (plasmid and siRNA) transfection efficiency to neural cell lines (BV2 cells and N2a cells). Furthermore, the N3 lipid mediated delivery of siRNA against Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) into oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated BV2 cells resulted in remarkable silencing of TLR4, inducing alternative polarization (M2) of the cells. Collectively, our data suggest that the N3 lipid is a promising siRNA delivery agent in neural cells.",0,2331
1817,35967823,Neonatal Diet and Gut Microbiome Development After C-Section During the First Three Months After Birth: A Systematic Review.,"Cesarean section (C-section) delivery imprints fundamentally on the gut microbiota composition with potential health consequences. With the increasing incidence of C-sections worldwide, there is a need for precise characterization of neonatal gut microbiota to understand how to restore microbial imbalance after C-section. After birth, gut microbiota development is shaped by various factors, especially the infant's diet and antibiotic exposure. Concerning diet, current research has proposed that breastfeeding can restore the characteristic gut microbiome after C-section. In this systematic review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the current literature on the effect of breastfeeding on gut microbiota development after C-section delivery in the first 3 months of life. The retrieved data from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were evaluated according to the PICO/PECO strategy. Quality assessment was conducted by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. After critical selection, we identified 14 out of 4,628 studies for the evaluation of the impact of the diet after C-section delivery. The results demonstrate consistent evidence that C-section and affiliated intrapartum antibiotic exposure affect Bacteroidetes abundance and the incapacity of breastfeeding to reverse their reduction. Furthermore, exclusive breastfeeding shows a positive effect on Actinobacteria and Bifidobacteria restoration over the 3 months after birth. None of the included studies detected any significant changes in Lactobacillus abundance in breastfed infants after C-section. C-section and intrapartum antibiotic exposure influence an infant's gut microbiota by depletion of Bacteroides, regardless of the infant's diet in the first 3 months of life. Even though breastfeeding increases the presence of Bifidobacteria, further research with proper feeding classification is needed to prove the restoration effect on some taxa in infants after C-section.

1812,35967843,Antibiotic and antifungal use in pediatric leukemia and lymphoma patients are associated with increasing opportunistic pathogens and decreasing bacteria responsible for activities that enhance colonic defense.,"Due to decreased immunity, both antibiotics and antifungals are regularly used in pediatric hematologic-cancer patients as a means to prevent severe infections and febrile neutropenia. The general effect of antibiotics on the human gut microbiome is profound, yielding decreased diversity and changes in community structure. However, the specific effect on pediatric oncology patients is not well-studied. The effect of antifungal use is even less understood, having been studied only in mouse models. Because the composition of the gut microbiome is associated with regulation of hematopoiesis, immune function and gastrointestinal integrity, changes within the patient gut can have implications for the clinical management of hematologic malignancies. The pediatric population is particularly challenging because the composition of the microbiome is age dependent, with some of the most pronounced changes occurring in the first three years of life. We investigated how antibiotic and antifungal use shapes the taxonomic composition of the stool microbiome in pediatric patients with leukemia and lymphoma, as inferred from both 16S rRNA and metagenome data. Associations with age, antibiotic use and antifungal use were investigated using multiple analysis methods. In addition, multivariable differential abundance was used to identify and assess specific taxa that were associated with multiple variables. Both antibiotics and antifungals were linked to a general decline in diversity in stool samples, which included a decrease in relative abundance in butyrate producers that play a critical role in host gut physiology (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Anaerostipes, Dorea, Blautia),. Furthermore, antifungal use was associated with a significant increase in relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens. Collectively, these findings have important implications for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma patients. Butyrate is important for gastrointestinal integrity; it inhibits inflammation, reinforces colonic defense, mucosal immunity. and decreases oxidative stress. The routine use of broad-spectrum anti-infectives in pediatric oncology patients could simultaneously contribute to a decline in gastrointestinal integrity and colonic defense while promoting increases in opportunistic pathogens within the patient gut. Because the gut microbiome has been linked to both short-term clinical outcomes, and longer-lasting health effects, systematic characterization of the gut microbiome in pediatric patients during, and beyond, treatment is warranted.",0,2333
305,35980774,Association between gut microbiota and depressive symptoms: A cross-sectional population-based study in South Korea.,"To investigate the association between gut microbiota and depressive symptoms in a large population cohort of Korean adults. Overall, 1,238 participants were included in the study. Participants were categorized into depressed or non-depressed groups, based on the depressive symptoms reported on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Rating Scale for Depression, with a cut-off score of 16, and their fecal microbiota was profiled using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Several alpha and beta diversity measures were also estimated. The association between depressive symptoms and gut microbiota was analyzed using generalized linear models. The inferred function of the metagenomes was compared between the two groups. There were no consistent differences in alpha and beta diversity between the depressed and non-depressed groups. However, the continuous measure of depressive symptoms was inversely associated with one of four measures of alpha diversity (Shannon's diversity, p = .021). We also found a substantial difference between the depressed and non-depressed groups in the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity among the four beta diversity indices (p = .004). Participants whose depressive symptoms exceeded a clinical cut-off score had a lower relative abundance of the genus Faecalibacterium when compared with controls (coefficient = -.025, q = .047). However, the depressed group had a significantly higher abundance of the genus Oscillospira than the non-depressed group (coefficient = .002, q = .023). Our findings contribute to the identification of potential relationships between the gut microbiota and depressive symptoms and provide useful insights for developing microbiota-based interventions for patients with depressive symptoms.",0,2334
1350,35969697,Gut microbiome-produced metabolites in pigs: a review on their biological functions and the influence of probiotics.,"The gastrointestinal tract is a complex ecosystem that contains a large number of microorganisms with different metabolic capacities. Modulation of the gut microbiome can improve the growth and promote health in pigs. Crosstalk between the host, diet, and the gut microbiome can influence the health of the host, potentially through the production of several metabolites with various functions. Short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, polyamines, indoles, and phenolic compounds are metabolites produced by the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome can also produce neurotransmitters (such as γ-aminobutyric acid, catecholamines, and serotonin), their precursors, and vitamins. Several studies in pigs have demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiome and its metabolites in improving growth performance and feed efficiency, alleviating stress, and providing protection from pathogens. The use of probiotics is one of the strategies employed to target the gut microbiome of pigs. Promising results have been published on the use of probiotics in optimizing pig production. This review focuses on the role of gut microbiome-derived metabolites in the performance of pigs and the effects of probiotics on altering the levels of these metabolites.",0,2335
2072,35967446,Inhibition of human macrophage activation via pregnane neurosteroid interactions with toll-like receptors: Sex differences and structural requirements.,"We recently discovered that (3α,5α)3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone) inhibits pro-inflammatory toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and cytokine/chemokine production in mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. The present studies evaluate neurosteroid actions upon TLR activation in human macrophages from male and female healthy donors. Buffy coat leukocytes were obtained from donors at the New York Blood Center (http://nybloodcenter.org/), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and cultured to achieve macrophage differentiation. TLR4 and TLR7 were activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or imiquimod in the presence/absence of allopregnanolone or related neurosteroids and pro-inflammatory markers were detected by ELISA or western blotting. Cultured human monocyte-derived-macrophages exhibited typical morphology, a mixed immune profile of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers, with no sex difference at baseline. Allopregnanolone inhibited TLR4 activation in male and female donors, preventing LPS-induced elevations of TNF-α, MCP-1, pCREB and pSTAT1. In contrast, 3α,5α-THDOC and SGE-516 inhibited the TLR4 pathway activation in female, but not male donors. Allopregnanolone completely inhibited TLR7 activation by imiquimod, blocking IL-1-β, IL-6, pSTAT1 and pIRF7 elevations in females only. 3α,5α-THDOC and SGE-516 partially inhibited TLR7 activation, only in female donors. The results indicate that allopregnanolone inhibits TLR4 and TLR7 activation in cultured human macrophages resulting in diminished cytokine/chemokine production. Allopregnanolone inhibition of TLR4 activation was found in males and females, but inhibition of TLR7 signals exhibited specificity for female donors. 3α,5α-THDOC and SGE-516 inhibited TLR4 and TLR7 pathways only in females. These studies demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects of allopregnanolone in human macrophages for the first time and suggest that inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines may contribute to its therapeutic actions.",0,2336
1509,35968378,Review on the roles of specific cell-derived exosomes in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death worldwide and cannot be effectively cured or prevented; thus, early diagnosis, and intervention are important. The importance of exosomes, membrane-bound extracellular vesicles produced in the endosome of eukaryotic cells, in the development, diagnosis, and treatment of AD has been recognized; however, their specific functions remain controversial and even unclear. With the development of exosome extraction, isolation, and characterization, many studies have focused on exosomes derived from different cells and body fluids. In this study, we summarized the roles of exosomes derived from different body fluids and cells, such as neuron, glial, stem, and endothelial cells, in the development, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of AD. We also emphasize the necessity to focus on exosomes from biological fluids and specific cells that are less invasive to target. Moreover, aside from the concentrations of classic and novel biomarkers in exosomes, the size and number of exosomes may also influence early and differential diagnosis of AD.",0,2337
2195,35967323,"Human surfactant protein D facilitates SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype binding and entry in DC-SIGN expressing cells, and downregulates spike protein induced inflammation.","Lung surfactant protein D (SP-D) and Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecules-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) are pathogen recognising C-type lectin receptors. SP-D has a crucial immune function in detecting and clearing pulmonary pathogens; DC-SIGN is involved in facilitating dendritic cell interaction with naïve T cells to mount an anti-viral immune response. SP-D and DC-SIGN have been shown to interact with various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped RNA virus that causes COVID-19. A recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) comprising of α-helical neck region, carbohydrate recognition domain, and eight N-terminal Gly-X-Y repeats has been shown to bind SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by preventing viral entry in Vero cells and HEK293T cells expressing ACE2. DC-SIGN has also been shown to act as a cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 independent of ACE2. Since rfhSP-D is known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and DC-SIGN, this study was aimed at investigating the potential of rfhSP-D in modulating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Coincubation of rfhSP-D with Spike protein improved the Spike Protein: DC-SIGN interaction. Molecular dynamic studies revealed that rfhSP-D stabilised the interaction between DC-SIGN and Spike protein. Cell binding analysis with DC-SIGN expressing HEK 293T and THP- 1 cells and rfhSP-D treated SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotypes confirmed the increased binding. Furthermore, infection assays using the pseudotypes revealed their increased uptake by DC-SIGN expressing cells. The immunomodulatory effect of rfhSP-D on the DC-SIGN: Spike protein interaction on DC-SIGN expressing epithelial and macrophage-like cell lines was also assessed by measuring the mRNA expression of cytokines and chemokines. RT-qPCR analysis showed that rfhSP-D treatment downregulated the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-α, IFN-α, IL-1β, IL- 6, IL-8, and RANTES (as well as NF-κB) in DC-SIGN expressing cells challenged by Spike protein. Furthermore, rfhSP-D treatment was found to downregulate the mRNA levels of MHC class II in DC expressing THP-1 when compared to the untreated controls. We conclude that rfhSP-D helps stabilise the interaction between SARS- CoV-2 Spike protein and DC-SIGN and increases viral uptake by macrophages via DC-SIGN, suggesting an additional role for rfhSP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",0,2338
2087,35967431,Protective role of Cav-1 in pneumolysin-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction.,"Pneumolysin (PLY) is a bacterial pore forming toxin and primary virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumonia, a major cause of pneumonia. PLY binds cholesterol-rich domains of the endothelial cell (EC) plasma membrane resulting in pore assembly and increased intracellular (IC) Ca2+ levels that compromise endothelial barrier integrity. Caveolae are specialized plasmalemma microdomains of ECs enriched in cholesterol. We hypothesized that the abundance of cholesterol-rich domains in EC plasma membranes confers cellular susceptibility to PLY. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found increased PLY-induced IC Ca2+ following membrane cholesterol depletion. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is an essential structural protein of caveolae and its regulation by cholesterol levels suggested a possible role in EC barrier function. Indeed, Cav-1 and its scaffolding domain peptide protected the endothelial barrier from PLY-induced disruption. In loss of function experiments, Cav-1 was knocked-out using CRISPR-Cas9 or silenced in human lung microvascular ECs. Loss of Cav-1 significantly enhanced the ability of PLY to disrupt endothelial barrier integrity. Rescue experiments with re-expression of Cav-1 or its scaffolding domain peptide protected the EC barrier against PLY-induced barrier disruption. Dynamin-2 (DNM2) is known to regulate caveolar membrane endocytosis. Inhibition of endocytosis, with dynamin inhibitors or siDNM2 amplified PLY induced EC barrier dysfunction. These results suggest that Cav-1 protects the endothelial barrier against PLY by promoting endocytosis of damaged membrane, thus reducing calcium entry and PLY-dependent signaling.",0,2339
1783,35967873,Insights into the roles of bacterial infection and antibiotics in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, which is accompanied with the classical motor symptoms and a range of non-motor symptoms. Bacterial infection affects the neuroinflammation associated with the pathology of PD and various antibiotics have also been confirmed to play an important role not only in bacterial infection, but also in the PD progression.

2479,35966779,Impact of aging on animal models of Parkinson's disease.,"Aging is the biggest risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Several animal models have been developed to explore the pathophysiology underlying neurodegeneration and the initiation and spread of alpha-synuclein-related PD pathology, and to investigate biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. However, bench-to-bedside translation of preclinical findings remains suboptimal and successful disease-modifying treatments remain to be discovered. Despite aging being the main risk factor for developing idiopathic PD, most studies employ young animals in their experimental set-up, hereby ignoring age-related cellular and molecular mechanisms at play. Consequently, studies in young animals may not be an accurate reflection of human PD, limiting translational outcomes. Recently, it has been shown that aged animals in PD research demonstrate a higher susceptibility to developing pathology and neurodegeneration, and present with a more disseminated and accelerated disease course, compared to young animals. Here we review recent advances in the investigation of the role of aging in preclinical PD research, including challenges related to aged animal models that are limiting widespread use. Overall, current findings indicate that the use of aged animals may be required to account for age-related interactions in PD pathophysiology. Thus, although the use of older animals has disadvantages, a model that better represents clinical disease within the elderly would be more beneficial in the long run, as it will increase translational value and minimize the risk of therapies failing during clinical studies. Furthermore, we provide recommendations to manage the challenges related to aged animal models.",0,2341
1666,35968108,"Impact of Folic Acid in Modulating Antioxidant Activity, Osmoprotectants, Anatomical Responses, and Photosynthetic Efficiency of Plectranthus amboinicus Under Salinity Conditions.","Salinity is a major threat to the sustainability of agricultural production systems. Salt stress has unfavorable implications on various plant physio-morphological and biochemical reactions, causing osmotic and ionic stress. Exogenously applied folic acid (FA) may at least provide one mechanism to evade the injurious stress effects of saline irrigation water on Plectranthus amboinicus. In this regard, two pot trials were performed during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 seasons in an open greenhouse of an experimental farm (29°17'N; 30°53'E) in Fayoum, Egypt. We tested four levels of saline irrigation water (SW): 34, 68, and 102 mM NaCl, plus tap water as the control = 0), combined with FA at three concentrations (25 and 50 μM, plus spray with distilled water as the control = 0). The growth parameters, biochemistry, physiology, elemental leaf status, essential oil content, and anatomical responses were assessed. Salt markedly reduced photosynthetic productivity [Fv/Fm and performance index (PI)], total chlorophyll [soil plant analysis development (SPAD)], and leaf osmoprotectant compounds, i.e., total soluble sugars (TSS), free amino acids, proline, and total phenolics, thus hampering P. amboinicus growth and essential oil yield. However, the addition of FA as a foliar spray to P. amboinicus irrigated with saline water induced increases in Fv/Fm, SPAD, and PI. These were linked with enriched stem anatomical structures, leaf osmoprotectant compounds, and enhanced leaf enzymatic activity, e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione, ascorbic acid, and antioxidant content. Under salt stress, supplementation of 25 and 50 μM FA increased the growth and production of essential oil by 27.8 and 55.6%, respectively, compared with no applied FA. The highest growth characteristics and elemental leaf contents were obtained when P. amboinicus was irrigated with 0 mM saline water and treated foliarly with 50 μM of FA compared with non-treated plants. Overall, these data showed that foliar spraying with FA reduces the impact of salt stress on P. amboinicus irrigated with saline water.",0,2342

Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, is known to act as a chemosensitizer and relieve pain in some cancers. In addition, palbociclib, a potent cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, has been approved for chemotherapy of advanced breast cancer. However, recent studies have revealed the acquired resistance of breast cancer cells to palbociclib. Therefore, the development of combination therapies that can extend the efficacy of palbociclib or delay resistance is crucial. This study investigated whether lidocaine would enhance the efficacy of palbociclib in breast cancer. Lidocaine synergistically suppressed the growth and proliferation of breast cancer cells by palbociclib. The combination treatment showed an increased cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase by decreasing retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and E2F1 expression. In addition, it increased apoptosis by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as observed by increases in cytochrome c release and inhibition of mitochondria-mediated protein expression. Additionally, it significantly reduced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling. In orthotopic breast cancer models, this combination treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased tumor cell apoptosis compared to those treated with a single drug. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the combination of palbociclib and lidocaine has a synergistic anti-cancer effect on breast cancer cells by the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β pathway, suggesting that this combination could potentially be an effective therapy for breast cancer.",0,2343
570,35978517,A novel shiga based immunotoxin against Fn-14 receptor on colorectal and lung cancer.,"Immunotoxins are regarded as a type of targeted therapy for killing cells by highly potent bacterial, fungal or plant toxins. Shiga like toxins (SLTs) are a group of bacterial AB5 protein toxins that inhibit host cell protein synthesis through the removal of a single adenine residue from the 28S rRNA and lead to apoptosis. Here, we described the design and usage of a Stx-based immunotoxin that can induce the selective cytotoxicity and apoptosis in Fn-14-positive cells related to the colon and lung cancer. In the present study, the Stx2a-PE15-P4A8 fusion protein was expressed efficiently in E. coli (DE3) system when driven from inclusion bodies by 8 M urea. The Stx2a-PE15-P4A8 fusion protein was expressed efficiently in E. coli (DE3) system and then purified. The purified fusion protein could specifically target Fn-14 receptor existed on colon and lung cancer cell lines and suppress these cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the protein was able to nearly 50 % of apoptotic cell death and maintains about 54 % of its stability after 24 h of incubation in mouse serum at 37 °C. Compared to PE38-P4A8 construct in our previous study, these results showed that the Stx2a-PE15-P4A8 construct can be an efficient therapeutic candidate for cancer immunotherapy.",0,2344
1133,35973888,Carnosine as a potential therapeutic for the management of peripheral vascular disease.,"To evaluate the potential role of carnosine in the management of peripheral vascular disease. Peripheral vascular disease is growing in its burden and impact; however it is currently under researched, and there are a lack of strong, non-invasive therapeutic options for the clinicians. Carnosine is a dipeptide stored particularly in muscle and brain tissue, which exhibits a wide range of physiological activities, which may be beneficial as an adjunct treatment for peripheral vascular disease. Carnosine's strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiglycating actions may aid in the prevention of plaque formation, through protective actions on the vascular endothelium, and the inhibition of foam cells. Carnosine may also improve angiogenesis, exercise performance and vasodilatory response, while protecting from ischemic tissue injury. Carnosine may have a role as an adjunct treatment for peripheral vascular disease alongside typical exercise and surgical interventions, and may be used in high risk individuals to aid in the prevention of atherogenesis. This review identifies a beneficial role for carnosine supplementation in the management of patients with peripheral vascular disease, in conjunction with exercise and revascularization. Carnosine as a supplement is safe, and associated with a host of beneficial effects in peripheral vascular disease and its key risk factors.",0,2345
1588,35968296,"The effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on cognition, performance, proteomics, and telomere length-The difference between zero and one: A case report.","Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy has recently been suggested for the treatment of different brain injuries as well as for physical and cognitive enhancement. The author recently carried out a self-experiment to obtain objective information on the effects of HBO2 therapy on neurocognition, cardiopulmonary function, neuroimaging and its effect on novel biomarkers such as telomere length and proteomics. In the following case report, the author will present and discuss the results and the differences between zero and one. This is a personal case report on a single subject, myself, who underwent a protocol of 60 daily HBO2 therapy sessions within 3 months. Pre- and post-therapy objective evaluation measured included computerized cognitive assessment, brain imaging, cardiopulmonary exercise test, physical assessments and blood tests including telomere length and proteomics. Neurocognitive results showed a 3.1-3.8% improvements in global cognitive function as well as all other cognitive function domains. In the perfusion MRI, there was a relative increase ranging from 43.3 to 52.3% in cerebral perfusion in various areas subserving memory, coordination, and visual motor cortex function. Similar improvements in cerebral perfusion were seen in the SPECT scans, which ranged from 8.79 to 16.12% increased perfusion in the temporal pole and entorhinal cortex subserving memory, as well as in the subcallosal area and lingual gyrus. MRI-DTI showed prominent increases in fractional anisotropy in several white matter areas including 9% in the body of the corpus callosum, 16.85% in for the fornix and 22.06% in the tapetum. In the physical domains, there were improvements in both anaerobic threshold, exercise endurance, muscle strength, gait speed and grip strength in the 7-15% range. The telomeres length was doubled and clusters of inflammatory proteins dropped around the 40th session and remained low at the 60th session. The difference between zero and one in this single case study of HBO2 therapy confirmed improvement in objective biomarkers which measured cognition, memory, brain processing speed, athletic performance and neuroimaging modalities measuring cerebral perfusion, blood flow and tractography. Additional studies with larger sample size and randomized clinical trials using similar biomarkers are needed to confirm the results and to delineate the longevity of these improvements.",0,2346
1598,35968286,Efficacy of electroacupuncture with different frequencies in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common complication in patients with cancer during chemotherapy. It mainly leads to severe numbness of the hands and feet and causes great pain in patients. Electroacupuncture (EA) is considered to be beneficial in improving peripheral neuropathy and relieving numbness of the hands and feet. This trial aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of different frequencies of EA on CIPN in patients with cancer. This study is a randomized controlled trial. In total, 160 eligible CIPN patients are randomly assigned to the 2 Hz EA group, 100 Hz EA group, 2/100 Hz EA group, and control group in the ratio of 1:1:1:1. All patients in the EA treatment groups receive treatment with EA three times a week for 4 weeks and following up for 4 weeks. The patients in the control group are given Mecobalamin (MeCbl) tablets orally, one tablet at a time, three times a day, for 4 weeks, and following up for 4 weeks. The primary outcome measures are the participant neurotoxicity questionnaire (PNQ) and the peripheral neurotoxicity assessment rating (NCI CTCAE V5.0). Secondary outcomes are the quality of life scale (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the measurement of peripheral nerve conduction velocity (NCV). The results are evaluated at baseline, post-treatment phase, and following up for 4 weeks. All major analyses are based on the intention to treat principle. This protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital) on 7 December 2021. The license number is IRB-2021-458. This study provides clinical efficacy data of different frequencies of EA in the treatment of CIPN.

1502,35968385,Systematic Fusion of Multi-Source Cognitive Networks With Graph Learning - A Study on Fronto-Parietal Network.,"Cognitive tasks induce fluctuations in the functional connectivity between brain regions which constitute cognitive networks in the human brain. Although several cognitive networks have been identified, consensus still cannot be achieved on the precise borders and distribution of involved brain regions for each network, due to the multifarious use of diverse brain atlases in different studies. To address the problem, the current study proposed a novel approach to generate a fused cognitive network with the optimal performance in discriminating cognitive states by using graph learning, following the synthesization of one cognitive network defined by different brain atlases, and the construction of a hierarchical framework comprised of one main version and other supplementary versions of the specific cognitive network. As a result, the proposed method demonstrated better results compared with other machine learning methods for recognizing cognitive states, which was revealed by analyzing an fMRI dataset related to the mental arithmetic task. Our findings suggest that the fused cognitive network provides the potential to develop new mind decoding approaches.",0,2348
2489,35966769,Impact of a multidomain lifestyle intervention on regional spontaneous brain activity.,"In the SoUth Korean study to PrEvent cognitive impaiRment and protect BRAIN health through lifestyle intervention in at-risk elderly people (SUPERBRAIN), we evaluated the impact of multidomain lifestyle intervention on regional homogeneity (ReHo) in resting-state functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Of 152 participants aged 60-79 years without dementia assigned to either facility-based multidomain intervention (FMI), home-based MI, or controls, we analyzed 56 scanned MRIs at baseline and 24 weeks. ReHo values from regions with significant longitudinal changes were compared between the intervention and control groups and their correlations with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) or serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were evaluated. ReHo values in the left medial orbitofrontal gyrus and right superior parietal lobule were increased [p = 0.021, correlated positively with serum BDNF changes (r = 0.504, p = 0.047)] and decreased [p = 0.021, correlated negatively with changes in the total (r = -0.509, p = 0.044) and attention (r = -0.562, p = 0.023).

1264,35971351,What Role Do Inflammatory Cytokines Play in Cancer Cachexia?,"A tumor extends its effects beyond its local site, and one such effect is cancer cachexia which is caused by a state of systemic inflammation in response to cancer. Though the prominent effect of cancer cachexia is seen on skeletal muscles, it shows deterioration in other organs' smooth muscle, adipose tissue, blood, bone marrow, liver, and immunity. Interleukin (IL)-6 plays an imminent role along with tissue necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 beta, interferon-gamma, myostatin, adiponectin, growth differentiation factor-15, activin A, etc. These cytokines through nuclear factor-kappa beta, mitogen-activated protein kinase, suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegic, and Janus activated kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway activate genes inducing ubiquitin-proteosome system and reactive oxidative species. Apart from these, they participate in causing anemia and immunosuppression. Adipose tissue acts as a source of cytokines and place of action of cytokines leading to lipolysis. Moreover, these cytokines act at the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis change metabolism and add to anorexia which already exists in cancer patients. The involvement of multiple cytokines necessitates the development and testing of anti-cytokines in combinations.",0,2350
1546,35968340,Disulfiram blocked cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 via inhibiting the interaction of spike protein and ACE2.,"Disulfiram is an FDA-approved drug that has been used to treat alcoholism and has demonstrated a wide range of anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, and anti-viral effects. In the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for effective therapeutics and vaccine development. According to recent studies, disulfiram can act as a potent SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibitor by targeting multiple SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins to inhibit viral polyprotein cleavage and RNA replication. Currently, disulfiram is under evaluation in phase II clinical trials to treat COVID-19. With more and more variants of the SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, it becomes critical to know whether disulfiram can also inhibit viral entry into host cells for various variants and replication inhibition. Here, molecular and cellular biology assays demonstrated that disulfiram could interrupt viral spike protein binding with its receptor ACE2. By using the viral pseudo-particles (Vpps) of SARS-CoV-2, disulfiram also showed the potent activity to block viral entry in a cell-based assay against Vpps of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. We further established a live virus model system to support the anti-viral entry activity of disulfiram with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Molecular docking revealed how disulfiram hindered the binding between the ACE2 and wild-type or mutated spike proteins. Thus, our results indicate that disulfiram has the capability to block viral entry activity of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Together with its known anti-replication of SARS-CoV-2, disulfiram may serve as an effective therapy against different SARS-CoV-2 variants.",0,2351
452,35978938,"A-kinase interacting protein 1 regulates the cell proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells and affects the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway by binding to Rac1.","A-kinase interacting protein 1 (AKIP1) has previously been demonstrated to be overexpressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tissues and is associated with patient prognosis. The aim of the present study was to explore whether AKIP1 can affect the proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis of ccRCC cells via its interaction with Rac1. Furthermore, the influence of AKIP1 and therefore Rac1 on the expression of the downstream ERK/cellular (c)-Myc signaling pathway was explored. The interaction between AKIP1 and Rac1 was determined using co-immunoprecipitation. The mRNA and protein expression levels of AKIP1 and Rac1 in normal renal epithelial cell lines and ccRCC cell lines were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. The transfection efficiency of small interfering RNA-AKIP1 and the Rac1 overexpression vector were also confirmed using RT-qPCR and western blotting. The viability, proliferation, invasion and migration of ccRCC cells following transfection were analyzed using the Cell Counting Kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine staining, Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. The tube formation ability of HUVECs was assessed using the tube formation assay. The protein expression levels of proliferation, invasion, migration and tube-formation-associated proteins as well as proteins associated with the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway, were detected via western blotting. The results demonstrated that AKIP1 expression levels were increased in ccRCC cell lines. AKIP1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of ccRCC cells and HUVEC tube-formation. In addition, AKIP1 was demonstrated to bind to Rac1 in ccRCC cells and AKIP1 downregulation inhibited Rac1 expression. Furthermore, Rac1 overexpression reversed the effects of AKIP1 knockdown on ccRCC cells. AKIP1 knockdown also suppressed the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway, which was reversed by Rac1 overexpression. In conclusion, AKIP1 knockdown potentially suppressed the proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis of ccRCC cells and inhibited the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway by binding to Rac1.",0,2352
541,35978682,Discovery of MK-1462: GLP-1 and Glucagon Receptor Dual Agonist for the Treatment of Obesity and Diabetes.,"Peptide-based analogues of the gut-derived incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Currently marketed GLP1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists are safe and effective in the management of Type 2 diabetes but often offer only modest weight loss. This has prompted the search for safe and effective alternatives to enhance the weight loss component of these treatments. We have demonstrated that concomitant activation GLP1R and the glucagon receptor (GCGR) can improve glucose metabolism and provide superior weight loss when compared to selective GLP1R agonism in preclinical species. This paper will highlight chemistry structure-activity relationship optimization and summarize in vivo efficacy studies toward the discovery of a once daily balanced dual agonist 12 (MK-1462), which was advanced into clinical trials.",0,2353
1347,35969701,Transcriptome-wide analysis reveals gluten-induced suppression of small intestine development in young chickens.,"Wheat gluten is an increasingly common ingredient in poultry diets but its impact on the small intestine in chicken is not fully understood. This study aimed to identify effects of high-gluten diets on chicken small intestines and the variation of their associated transcriptional responses by age. A total of 120 broilers (Ross Strain) were used to perform two animal experiments consisting of two gluten inclusion levels (0% or 25%) by bird's age (1 week or 4 weeks). Transcriptomics and histochemical techniques were employed to study the effect of gluten on their duodenal mucosa using randomly selected 12 broilers (3 chicks per group). A reduction in feed intake and body weight gain was found in the broilers fed a high-gluten containing diet at both ages. Histochemical photomicrographs showed a reduced villus height to crypt depth ratio in the duodenum of gluten-fed broilers at 1 week. We found mainly a significant effect on the gene expression of duodenal mucosa in gluten-fed broilers at 1 week (289 differentially expressed genes [DEGs]). Pathway analyses revealed that the significant DEGs were mainly involved in ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathways. These pathways are involved in ribosome protein biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism, respectively. Our results suggest a pattern of differential gene expression in these pathways that can be linked to chronic inflammation, suppression of cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. And via such a mode of action, high-gluten inclusion levels in poultry diets could lead to the observed retardation of villi development in the duodenal mucosa of young broiler chicken.",0,2354
460,35978926,An in vitro study on the effect of bevacizumab on endothelial cell proliferation and VEGF concentration level in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.,"Previous studies have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is upregulated in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The use of Bevacizumab as an anti-angiogenic treatment agent seems promising. The purpose of the present in vitro study was to determine the efficacy and potential toxicity levels of bevacizumab on cell proliferation and VEGF concentrations in endothelial cells of HHT patients. In this in vitro study, endothelial cells from patients with HHT and HUVECs (control) were incubated with different concentration levels of bevacizumab (2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 mg/ml). After 24, 48 or 72 h, the cell proliferation was assessed by Alamar Blue® Assay and the VEGF levels in the cell culture supernatants were measured by VEGF-ELISA. All endothelial cells incubated with bevacizumab showed an initial decrease in cell proliferation. Cell proliferation recovered within 72 h in cell cultures incubated with concentration levels of up to 4 mg/ml bevacizumab, whereas those incubated with higher concentration levels showed a continuous decline in cell proliferation. VEGF expression decreased after 24 h in cell cultures incubated with bevacizumab concentration levels of 2 and 4 mg/ml but increased again after 48 h. Cell cultures incubated with bevacizumab concentration levels of 10 mg/ml showed a constant decline in VEGF expression without any tendency for recovery. Translating these results into daily clinical practice, the present study suggests that the intranasal submucosal injection of bevacizumab in HHT patients should not exceed a concentration level of 4 mg/ml. Overall, higher bevacizumab concentration levels not only reduce VEGF expression but pose a higher risk of toxic effects on endothelial cells as they jeopardize cell proliferation.",0,2355
681,35975530,PTPRC Overexpression Predicts Poor Prognosis and Correlates with Immune Cell Infiltration in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a molecularly heterogeneous disease that accounts for approximately 25% of childhood leukemia cases. In this study, we aimed to identify survival-associated genes in pediatric AML patients and investigate potential immunotherapy targets. After retrieving and processing the data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) web resource, we determined hub genes in AML. Bioinformatics technology was applied to identify key genes and perform functional analysis. Finally, we investigated the correlation between the key gene and the infiltration levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. High protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type C (PTPRC) expression was associated with worse overall survival rate (p < 0.001) in 287 pediatric AML patients. The results of risk subgroup analyses were similar in the high-risk and low-risk groups (p = 0.007; p = 0.013). Meanwhile, high expression of PTPRC was an independent adverse prognostic factor for overall survival (p = 0.04). Moreover, the results of immune infiltration assessment demonstrated that the expression level of PTPRC was significantly correlated with the infiltration level of activated dendritic cells (p < 0.001). Overexpression of PTPRC indicates poor prognosis, and its expression level is correlated with the infiltration level of activated dendritic cells. PTPRC could be a promising immunotherapy target for pediatric AML.",0,2356
1792,35967863,Role of microbial secreted proteins in gut microbiota-host interactions.,"The mammalian gut microbiota comprises a variety of commensals including potential probiotics and pathobionts, influencing the host itself. Members of the microbiota can intervene with host physiology by several mechanisms, including the secretion of a relatively well-reported set of metabolic products. Another microbiota influence mechanism is the use of secreted proteins (i.e., the secretome), impacting both the host and other community members. While widely reported and studied in pathogens, this mechanism remains understood to a lesser extent in commensals, and this knowledge is increasing in recent years. In the following minireview, we assess the current literature covering different studies, concerning the functions of secretable proteins from members of the gut microbiota (including commensals, pathobionts, and probiotics). Their effect on host physiology and health, and how these effects can be harnessed by postbiotic products, are also discussed.",0,2357
1127,35974421,Programming by maternal obesity: a pathway to poor cardiometabolic health in the offspring.,"There is an ever increasing prevalence of maternal obesity worldwide such that in many populations over half of women enter pregnancy either overweight or obese. This review aims to summarise the impact of maternal obesity on offspring cardiometabolic outcomes. Maternal obesity is associated with increased risk of adverse maternal and pregnancy outcomes. However, beyond this exposure to maternal obesity during development also increases the risk of her offspring developing long-term adverse cardiometabolic outcomes throughout their adult life. Both human studies and those in experimental animal models have shown that maternal obesity can programme increased risk of offspring developing obesity and adipose tissue dysfunction; type 2 diabetes with peripheral insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction; CVD with impaired cardiac structure and function and hypertension via impaired vascular and kidney function. As female offspring themselves are therefore likely to enter pregnancy with poor cardiometabolic health this can lead to an inter-generational cycle perpetuating the transmission of poor cardiometabolic health across generations. Maternal exercise interventions have the potential to mitigate some of the adverse effects of maternal obesity on offspring health, although further studies into long-term outcomes and how these translate to a clinical context are still required.",0,2358

2247,35967184,Vaping-Induced Lung Injury With Superimposed Mycoplasma Pneumonia Leading to Acute Respiratory Failure.,"Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) contain solvents, nicotine, and other chemicals which are vaporized with heat and inhaled into the lungs during a process known as vaping. Vaping has significantly increased in popularity in the US, especially among youth and young adults. E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) is a syndrome of lung disease associated with vaping or e-cigarette products--which is well discussed in the current medical literature. However, the mechanisms by which lung injury occurs remain to be fully understood. We hypothesize that vaping damages lung defenses, allowing bacterial or viral organisms to infect the lungs and further exacerbate lung function. Furthermore, chemicals found in e-cigarettes alter lung structures, leading to an exaggerated response to an infectious insult. A combination of these two mechanisms may lead to acute respiratory failure. Here we discuss a case report about a 27-year-old patient who presented with acute respiratory failure due to vaping-induced lung injury with superimposed mycoplasma pneumonia.",0,2360
1346,35969702,Protective effects of biological feed additives on gut microbiota and the health of pigs exposed to deoxynivalenol: a review.,"Deoxynivalenol (DON) is the most common mycotoxin contaminant of cereal-based food and animal feed. The toxicity of DON is very low compared to that of other toxins; however, the most prominent signs of DON exposure include inappetence and body weight loss, which causes considerable economic losses in the livestock industry. This review summarizes critical studies on biological DON mycotoxin mitigation strategies and the respective in vitro and in vivo intestinal effects. Focus areas include growth performance, gut health in terms of intestinal histomorphology, epithelial barrier functions, the intestinal immune system and microflora, and short-chain fatty acid production in the intestines. In addition, DON detoxification and modulation of these parameters, through biological supplements, are discussed. Biological detoxification of DON using microorganisms can attenuate DON toxicity by modulating gut microbiota and improving gut health with or without influencing the growth performance of pigs. However, the use of microorganisms as feed additives to livestock for mycotoxins detoxification needs more research before commercial use.",0,2361
2492,35966759,Programming of Regulatory T Cells In Situ for Nerve Regeneration and Long-Term Patency of Vascular Grafts.,"Rapid integration into the host tissue is critical for long-term patency after small diameter tissue engineering vascular grafts (sdTEVGs) transplantation. Neural recognition may be required for host integration and functionalization of the graft. However, immune rejection and inflammation hinder nerve regeneration of sdTEVGs. Here, a CRISPR/dCas9-nanocarrier was used for targeted programming of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in situ to promote nerve regeneration of sdTEVGs by preventing excessive inflammation. Treg cells and (C-C chemokine receptor) CCR2+ macrophage recruitment occurred after transplantation. The nanodelivery system upregulated ten eleven translocation (TET2) in Treg cells in vitro. Reprogrammed Treg cells upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines and decreased the proportion of CCR2+ macrophages. IL-6 concentrations decreased to the levels required for nerve regeneration. Implantation of CRISPR/dCas9 nanodelivery system-modified sdTEVGs in rats resulted in Treg cell editing, control of excessive inflammation, and promoted nerve regeneration. After 3 months, nerve regeneration was similar to that observed in normal blood vessels; good immune homeostasis, consistency of hemodynamics, and matrix regeneration were observed. Neural recognition promotes further integration of the graft into the host, with unobstructed blood vessels without intimal hyperplasia. Our findings provide new insights into vascular implant functionalization by the host.",0,2362
2166,35967352,Six macrophage-associated genes in synovium constitute a novel diagnostic signature for osteoarthritis.,"Synovial macrophages play important roles in the formation and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). This study aimed to explore the biological and clinical significance of macrophage-associated genes (MAGs) in OA. The OA synovial gene expression profiles GSE89408 and GSE82107 were obtained from the GEO database. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and GSEA were employed to decipher differences in immune infiltration and macrophage-associated biological pathways, respectively. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and machine learning were utilized to establish a macrophage-associated gene diagnostic signature (MAGDS). RT-qPCR was performed to test the expression of key MAGs in murine models. OA synovium presented high levels of immune infiltration and activation of macrophage-associated biological pathways. A total of 55 differentially expressed MAGs were identified. Using PPI analysis and machine learning, a MAGDS consisting of IL1B, C5AR1, FCGR2B, IL10, IL6, and TYROBP was established for OA diagnosis (AUC = 0.910) and molecular pathological evaluation. Patients with high MAGDS scores may possess higher levels of immune infiltration and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), implying poor biological alterations. The diagnostic value of MAGDS was also validated in an external cohort (AUC = 0.886). The expression of key MAGs was validated in a murine model using RT-qPCR. Additionally, a competitive endogenous RNA network was constructed to reveal the potential posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. We developed and validated a MAGDS model with the ability to accurately diagnose and characterize biological alterations in OA. The six key MAGs may also be latent targets for immunoregulatory therapy.",0,2363
1786,35967869,Pathological and protective roles of dendritic cells in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: Interaction between host immune responses and pathogen evasion.,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are principal defense components that play multifactorial roles in translating innate immune responses to adaptive immunity in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections. The heterogeneous nature of DC subsets follows their altered functions by interacting with other immune cells, Mtb, and its products, enhancing host defense mechanisms or facilitating pathogen evasion. Thus, a better understanding of the immune responses initiated, promoted, and amplified or inhibited by DCs in Mtb infection is an essential step in developing anti-tuberculosis (TB) control measures, such as host-directed adjunctive therapy and anti-TB vaccines. This review summarizes the recent advances in salient DC subsets, including their phenotypic classification, cytokine profiles, functional alterations according to disease stages and environments, and consequent TB outcomes. A comprehensive overview of the role of DCs from various perspectives enables a deeper understanding of TB pathogenesis and could be useful in developing DC-based vaccines and immunotherapies.",0,2364
1360,35969105,"Standardized Processing for Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Cell Pellet Immunohistochemistry Controls.","Positive and negative controls with known expression of target proteins are essential for the development of immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. While tissue controls are beneficial for well-characterized proteins with defined tissue and cellular expression patterns, they are less suitable for the initial development of IHC assays for novel, poorly characterized, or ubiquitously expressed proteins. Alternatively, due to their standardized nature, cell pellets, including cancer cell lines with defined protein or transcript expression levels (e.g., high, medium, and low expression), transfected over-expressing cell lines, or cell lines with genes deleted through cell engineering technologies like CRISPR, can serve as valuable controls, especially for the initial antibody characterization and selection. In order for these cell pellets to be used in the development of IHC assays for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, they need to be processed and embedded in a manner that recapitulates the procedures used for tissue processing. This protocol describes a process for creating and processing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell pellet controls that can be used for IHC method developments.",0,2365
2160,35967358,From IL-17 to IFN-γ in inflammatory skin disorders: Is transdifferentiation a potential treatment target?,"The targeted inhibition of effector cytokines such as interleukin 17 (IL-17) in psoriasis and IL-13 in atopic dermatitis offers impressive efficacy with a favorable side effect profile. In contrast, the downregulation of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in T helper (Th) 1-dominant skin disorders may lead to more adverse events, given the crucial role of IFN-γ in antiviral and antitumoral immunity. Modulating Th17 and Th2 cell differentiation is performed by blocking IL-23 and IL-4, respectively, whereas anti-IL-12 antibodies are only moderately effective in downregulating Th1 lymphocyte differentiation. Therefore, a targeted approach of IFN-γ-driven disorders remains challenging. Recent literature suggests that certain pathogenic Th17 cell subsets with Th1 characteristics, such as CD4+CD161+CCR6+CXCR3+IL-17+IFN-y+ (Th17.1) and CD4+CD161+CCR6+CXCR3+IL-17-IFN-y+ (exTh17), are important contributors in Th1-mediated autoimmunity. Differentiation to a Th17.1 or exTh17 profile results in the upregulation of IFN-y. Remarkably, these pathogenic Th17 cell subsets are resistant to glucocorticoid therapy and the dampening effect of regulatory T cells (Treg). The identification of Th17.1/exTh17 cells in auto-immune disorders may explain the frequent treatment failure of conventional immunosuppressants. In this review, we summarize the current evidence regarding the cellular plasticity of Th17 cells in inflammatory skin disorders. A deeper understanding of this phenomenon may lead to better insights into the pathogenesis of various skin diseases and the discovery of a potential new treatment target.",0,2366
2138,35967380,Left ventricle- and skeletal muscle-derived fibroblasts exhibit a differential inflammatory and metabolic responsiveness to interleukin-6.,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important player in chronic inflammation associated with heart failure and tumor-induced cachexia. Fibroblasts are salient mediators of both inflammation and fibrosis. Whereas the general outcome of IL-6 on the heart's function and muscle wasting has been intensively studied, the influence of IL-6 on fibroblasts of the heart and skeletal muscle (SM) has not been analyzed so far. We illustrate that SM-derived fibroblasts exhibit higher basal mRNA expression of α-SMA, extracellular matrix molecules (collagen1a1/3a1/5a1), and chemokines (CCL2, CCL7, and CX3CL1) as compared to the left ventricle (LV)-derived fibroblasts. IL-6 drives the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts as indicated by an increase in α-SMA expression and upregulates NLRP3 inflammasome activity in both LV- and SM-derived fibroblasts. IL-6 increases the release of CCL7 to CX3CL1 in the supernatant of SM-derived fibroblasts associated with the attraction of more pro(Ly6Chi) versus anti(Ly6Clo) inflammatory monocytes as compared to unstimulated fibroblasts. IL-6-stimulated LV-derived fibroblasts attract less Ly6Chi to Ly6Clo monocytes compared to IL-6-stimulated SM-derived fibroblasts. In addition, SM-derived fibroblasts have a higher mitochondrial energy turnover and lower glycolytic activity versus LV-derived fibroblasts under basal and IL-6 conditions. In conclusion, IL-6 modulates the inflammatory and metabolic phenotype of LV- and SM-originated fibroblasts.",0,2367
327,35979925,"CAPRIN1 haploinsufficiency causes a neurodevelopmental disorder with language impairment, ADHD and ASD.","We describe an autosomal dominant disorder associated with loss-of-function variants in the Cell cycle Associated PRoteIN 1 (CAPRIN1; MIM*601178). CAPRIN1 encodes a ubiquitous protein that regulates the transport and translation of neuronal mRNAs critical for synaptic plasticity, as well as mRNAs encoding proteins important for cell proliferation and migration in multiple cell types. We identified twelve cases with loss-of-function CAPRIN1 variants, and a neurodevelopmental phenotype characterized by language impairment/speech delay (100%), Intellectual Disability (ID; 83%), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; 82%), and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; 67%). Affected individuals also had respiratory problems (50%), limb/skeletal anomalies (50%), developmental delay (42%) feeding difficulties (33%), seizures (33%) and ophthalmologic problems (33%). In patient-derived lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, we showed a monoallelic expression of the wild-type allele, and a reduction of the transcript and protein compatible with a half dose. To further study pathogenic mechanisms, we generated CAPRIN1+/- human iPSCs (hiPSCs) via CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis and differentiated them into neuronal progenitor cells and cortical neurons. CAPRIN1 loss caused reduced neuronal processes, overall disruption of the neuronal organization, and an increased neuronal degeneration. We also observed an alteration of mRNA translation in CAPRIN1+/- neurons, compatible with its suggested function as translational inhibitor. CAPRIN1+/- neurons also showed an impaired calcium signalling and increased oxidative stress, two mechanisms that may directly affect neuronal networks development, maintenance, and function. According to what was previously observed in the mouse model, measurements of activity in CAPRIN1+/- neurons via micro-electrode arrays (MEA) indicated lower spike rates and bursts, with an overall reduced activity. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CAPRIN1 haploinsufficiency causes a novel autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder and identify morphological and functional alterations associated with this disorder in human neuronal models.",0,2368
2089,35967429,Investigation of the causal etiology in a patient with T-B+NK+ immunodeficiency.,"Newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) has not only accelerated diagnosis and improved treatment for affected infants, but also led to identification of novel genes required for human T cell development. A male proband had SCID newborn screening showing very low T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), a biomarker for thymic output of nascent T cells. He had persistent profound T lymphopenia, but normal numbers of B and natural killer (NK) cells. Despite an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant from his brother, he failed to develop normal T cells. Targeted resequencing excluded known SCID genes; however, whole exome sequencing (WES) of the proband and parents revealed a maternally inherited X-linked missense mutation in MED14 (MED14V763A), a component of the mediator complex. Morpholino (MO)-mediated loss of MED14 function attenuated T cell development in zebrafish. Moreover, this arrest was rescued by ectopic expression of cDNA encoding the wild type human MED14 ortholog, but not by MED14V763A , suggesting that the variant impaired MED14 function. Modeling of the equivalent mutation in mouse (Med14V769A) did not disrupt T cell development at baseline. However, repopulation of peripheral T cells upon competitive bone marrow transplantation was compromised, consistent with the incomplete T cell reconstitution experienced by the proband upon transplantation with bone marrow from his healthy male sibling, who was found to have the same MED14V763A variant. Suspecting that the variable phenotypic expression between the siblings was influenced by further mutation(s), we sought to identify genetic variants present only in the affected proband. Indeed, WES revealed a mutation in the L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAMQ498H); however, introducing that mutation in vivo in mice did not disrupt T cell development. Consequently, immunodeficiency in the proband may depend upon additional, unidentified gene variants.",0,2369
1395,35968622,Acute kidney injury after major orthopedic surgery: A retrospective study of frequency and related risk factors.,"This study aimed to analyze the frequency of postoperative kidney injury, the related factors, and its effect on outcomes in major orthopedic surgery cases treated in the postanesthesia intensive care unit (PACU). Major orthopedic surgery cases treated in the PACU were included in this study retrospectively. Demographic, operation, and anesthesia characteristics, CCI, ASA risk classes, preoperative biochemistry, and hemogram results of the patients were recorded. Postoperative serum creatinine level, urine output, renal replacement therapy requirement, and hemoglobin levels were recorded. The kidney damage of the patients was evaluated with RIFLE and AKIN criteria. Postoperative complications were recorded. The frequency of kidney injury in the early postoperative period was 7.1%. When only arthroplasty cases were taken, the frequency was 11%. It was determined that there was a correlation between preoperative ASA, CCI, BMI, K levels, lactate levels, and postoperative kidney damage (P <0.05). It was determined that the frequency and duration of inotropic use, the frequency and duration of noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and the duration of hospitalization increased in patients with postoperative kidney damage, and the frequency of pneumonia, wound infection, atelectasis, sepsis, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation and mortality increased in the postoperative period (P <0.05). There is a need for further studies on the relationship between ASA, CCI, BMI, K, and lactate values and postoperative kidney damage. Postoperative kidney injury is associated with prolonged hospitalization and increased morbidity and mortality. Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",0,2370
415,35979232,Worenine Prevents Solar Ultraviolet-Induced Sunburn by Inhibiting JNK2.,"Excessive solar ultraviolet (SUV) radiation often causes dermatitis, photoaging, and even skin cancer. In the pathological processes of SUV-induced sunburn, JNK is activated by phosphorylation, and it in turn phosphorylates its downstream transcription factors, such as ATF2 and c-jun. The transcription factors further regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, which ultimately leads to dermatitis. Therefore, inhibiting JNK may be a strategy to prevent dermatitis. In this study, we screened for worenine as a potential drug candidate for inhibiting sunburn. We determined that worenine inhibited the JNK-ATF2/c-jun signaling pathway and the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α in cell culture and in vivo, confirming the role of worenine in inhibiting sunburn. Furthermore, we determined that worenine bound and inhibited JNK2 activity in vitro through the MST, kinase, and in vitro kinase assays. Therefore, worenine might be a promising drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of SUV-induced sunburn.",0,2371
1176,35973349,Research Note: Development and characterization of monoclonal antibodies specific for chicken interleukin-7 receptor α (CD127).,"CD127, also named interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R), is expressed on various cell types including naive and memory T cells, and plays a critical role in the differentiation and activation of T lymphocytes. The availability of poultry-specific immune reagents to identify and measure chicken CD127 response will enhance fundamental and applied research in poultry immunology. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against chicken CD127 (chCD127) were developed and characterized. More specifically, a 678 bp ectodomain of chCD127 gene was cloned in the pET28a (+) vector and expressed in BL21-AI E. coli competent cells. The recombinant chCD127 protein with a size of 30 KDa which was also recognized by a mouse anti-human CD127 MAb (Clone G-11) was used to immunize mice, and 6 new mouse MAbs which specifically detected chicken CD127 were developed and characterized. Availability of these new sets of chCD127-specific MAbs will facilitate the immunological studies on CD127 in poultry, especially in understanding effector and memory T immune cell responses in normal and diseased states.",0,2372
1373,35969084,Determining Intestinal Permeability using Lucifer Yellow in an Apical-Out Enteroid Model.,"Enteroids are an emerging research tool in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). They are traditionally grown in the basolateral-out (BO) conformation, where the apical surface of the epithelial cell faces the inner lumen. In this model, access to the luminal surface of enteroids for treatment and experimentation is challenging, which limits the ability to study host-pathogen interactions. To circumvent this, a neonatal apical-out (AO) model for necrotizing enterocolitis was created. Since intestinal epithelial cell permeability changes are pathognomonic for NEC, this protocol outlines using lucifer yellow (LY) as a marker of paracellular permeability. LY traverses the intestinal epithelial barrier via all three major paracellular pathways: pore, leak, and unrestricted. Using LY in an AO model allows for a broader study of permeability in NEC. Following IRB approval and parental consent, surgical samples of intestinal tissue were collected from human preterm neonates. Intestinal stem cells were harvested via crypt isolation and used to grow enteroids. Enteroids were grown to maturity and then transformed AO or left in BO conformation. These were either not treated (control) or were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subjected to hypoxic conditions for the induction of in vitro NEC. LY was used to assess for permeability. Immunofluorescent staining of the apical protein zonula occludens-1 and basolateral protein β-catenin confirmed AO conformation. Both AO and BO enteroids treated with LPS and hypoxia demonstrated significantly increased paracellular permeability compared to controls. Both AO and BO enteroids showed increased uptake of LY into the lumen of the treated enteroids compared to controls. The utilization of LY in an AO enteroid model allows for the investigation of all three major pathways of paracellular permeability. It additionally allows for the investigation of host-pathogen interactions and how this may affect permeability compared to the BO enteroid model.",0,2373
574,35978513,The potential value of low-level serum interleukin-38 for the clinical diagnosis and risk prediction of hyperuricemia.,"Interleukin (IL)-38, a novel anti-inflammatory cytokine in the IL-1 family, has an important role in various autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. However, the level of serum IL-38 in hyperuricemia (HUA) and its clinical applications are still unknown. Forty-four HUA patients and 43 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The levels of serum IL-38 in the participants were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors associated with HUA. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator combined with 10-fold cross-validation was used to screen the characteristic variables for modeling and the logistic regression model was visualized by nomogram. The discrimination, degree of concordance, and clinical applicability of the models were evaluated by receiver operator characteristic curve, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis, respectively. Compared with that in healthy controls, the level of serum IL-38 was reduced in HUA patients (275.09 ± 294.89 vs 505.99 ± 312.94, P < 0.01). The area under the curve of serum IL-38 was 0.768 (cutoff value: 246.91 pg/ml). IL-38, platelet count, mean platelet volume, and total protein were identified as independent risk factors for HUA. The risk model showed an excellent clinical differentiation value (area under the curve: 0.961) and degree of fit. Decision curve analysis indicated that the prediction model could be beneficial for patients when the threshold probability was 1%-95%. Low level of serum IL-38 shows some potential in the clinical diagnosis and risk prediction of HUA. In addition, as a novel biomarker of HUA, serum IL-38 would contribute to the in-depth study of its pathogenesis in the future.",0,2374
1609,35968275,Construction and validation of a glioblastoma prognostic model based on immune-related genes.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a common malignant brain tumor with high mortality. It is urgently necessary to develop a new treatment because traditional approaches have plateaued. Here, we identified an immune-related gene (IRG)-based prognostic signature to comprehensively define the prognosis of GBM. Glioblastoma samples were selected from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). We retrieved IRGs from the ImmPort data resource. Univariate Cox regression and LASSO Cox regression analyses were used to develop our predictive model. In addition, we constructed a predictive nomogram integrating the independent predictive factors to determine the one-, two-, and 3-year overall survival (OS) probabilities of individuals with GBM. Additionally, the molecular and immune characteristics and benefits of ICI therapy were analyzed in subgroups defined based on our prognostic model. Finally, the proteins encoded by the selected genes were identified with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and western blotting (WB). Six IRGs were used to construct the predictive model. The GBM patients were categorized into a high-risk group and a low-risk group. High-risk group patients had worse survival than low-risk group patients, and stronger positive associations with multiple tumor-related pathways, such as angiogenesis and hypoxia pathways, were found in the high-risk group. The high-risk group also had a low IDH1 mutation rate, high PTEN mutation rate, low 1p19q co-deletion rate and low MGMT promoter methylation rate. In addition, patients in the high-risk group showed increased immune cell infiltration, more aggressive immune activity, higher expression of immune checkpoint genes, and less benefit from immunotherapy than those in the low-risk group. Finally, the expression levels of TNC and SSTR2 were confirmed to be significantly associated with patient prognosis by protein mass spectrometry and WB. Herein, a robust predictive model based on IRGs was developed to predict the OS of GBM patients and to aid future clinical research.",0,2375
1170,35973367,Restriction of SARS-CoV-2 replication in the human placenta.,"Although SARS-CoV-2 can infect human placental tissue, vertical transmission is rare. Therefore, the placenta may function as a barrier to inhibit viral transmission to the foetus, though the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in human placental tissue by in situ hybridization with antisense probes targeting the spike protein; tissue staining was much lower when using sense probes for the spike protein. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence directly indicating inefficient viral replication in the SARS-CoV-2-infected placenta. Additional studies are required to reveal the detailed mechanisms.",0,2376
2168,35967350,Reduced binding activity of vaccine serum to omicron receptor-binding domain.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination regimens contribute to limiting the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the emergence and rapid transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron raise a concern about the efficacy of the current vaccination strategy. Here, we expressed monomeric and dimeric receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the spike protein of prototype SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron variant in E. coli and investigated the reactivity of anti-sera from Chinese subjects immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to these recombinant RBDs. In 106 human blood samples collected from 91 participants from Jiangxi, China, 26 sera were identified to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies by lateral flow dipstick (LFD) assays, which were enriched in the ones collected from day 7 to 1 month post-boost (87.0%) compared to those harvested within 1 week post-boost (23.8%) (P < 0.0001). A higher positive ratio was observed in the child group (40.8%) than adults (13.6%) (P = 0.0073). ELISA results showed that the binding activity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive sera to Omicron RBDs dropped by 1.48- to 2.07-fold compared to its homogeneous recombinant RBDs. Thus, our data indicate that current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines provide restricted humoral protection against the Omicron variant.",0,2377
2096,35967422,Elevated Foxp3+ double-negative T cells are associated with disease progression during HIV infection.,"Persistent immune activation, which occurs during the whole course of HIV infection, plays a pivotal role in CD4+ T cells depletion and AIDS progression. Furthermore, immune activation is a key factor that leads to impaired immune reconstitution after long-term effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), and is even responsible for the increased risk of developing non-AIDS co-morbidities. Therefore, it's imperative to identify an effective intervention targeting HIV-associated immune activation to improve disease management. Double negative T cells (DNT) were reported to provide immunosuppression during HIV infection, but the related mechanisms remained puzzled. Foxp3 endows Tregs with potent suppressive function to maintain immune homeostasis. However, whether DNT cells expressed Foxp3 and the accurate function of these cells urgently needed to be investigated. Here, we found that Foxp3+ DNT cells accumulated in untreated people living with HIV (PLWH) with CD4+ T cell count less than 200 cells/µl. Moreover, the frequency of Foxp3+ DNT cells was negatively correlated with CD4+ T cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio, and positively correlated with immune activation and systemic inflammation in PLWH. Of note, Foxp3+ DNT cells might exert suppressive regulation by increased expression of CD39, CD25, or vigorous proliferation (high levels of GITR and ki67) in ART-naive PLWH. Our study underlined the importance of Foxp3+ DNT cells in the HIV disease progression, and suggest that Foxp3+ DNT may be a potential target for clinical intervention for the control of immune activation during HIV infection.",0,2378
2222,35967296,The EGFR/ErbB inhibitor neratinib modifies the neutrophil phosphoproteome and promotes apoptosis and clearance by airway macrophages.,"Dysregulated neutrophilic inflammation can be highly destructive in chronic inflammatory diseases due to prolonged neutrophil lifespan and continual release of histotoxic mediators in inflamed tissues. Therapeutic induction of neutrophil apoptosis, an immunologically silent form of cell death, may be beneficial in these diseases, provided that the apoptotic neutrophils are efficiently cleared from the tissue. Previous research in our group identified ErbB inhibitors as able to induce neutrophil apoptosis and reduce neutrophilic inflammation both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we extend that work using a clinical ErbB inhibitor, neratinib, which has the potential to be repurposed in inflammatory diseases. We show that neratinib reduces neutrophilic migration o an inflammatory site in zebrafish larvae. Neratinib upregulates efferocytosis and reduces the number of persisting neutrophil corpses in mouse models of acute, but not chronic, lung injury, suggesting that the drug may have therapeutic benefits in acute inflammatory settings. Phosphoproteomic analysis of human neutrophils shows that neratinib modifies the phosphorylation of proteins regulating apoptosis, migration, and efferocytosis. This work identifies a potential mechanism for neratinib in treating acute lung inflammation by upregulating the clearance of dead neutrophils and, through examination of the neutrophil phosphoproteome, provides important insights into the mechanisms by which this may be occurring.",0,2379
1849,35967791,"Onion anthocyanins: Extraction, stability, bioavailability, dietary effect, and health implications.","Anthocyanins are high-value compounds, and their use as functional foods and their natural colorant have potential health benefits. Anthocyanins seem to possess antioxidant properties, which help prevent neuronal diseases and thereby exhibit anti-inflammatory, chemotherapeutic, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, and neuroprotective activities. They also show different therapeutic effects against various chronic diseases. Anthocyanins are present in high concentrations in onion. In recent years, although both conventional and improved methods have been used for extraction of anthocyanins, nowadays, improved methods are of great importance because of their higher yield and stability of anthocyanins. In this review, we compile anthocyanins and their derivatives found in onion and the factors affecting their stability. We also analyze different extraction techniques of anthocyanins. From this point of view, it is very important to be precisely aware of the impact that each parameter has on the stability and subsequently potentiate its bioavailability or beneficial health effects. We present up-to-date information on bioavailability, dietary effects, and health implications of anthocyanins such as antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticancerous, antiobesity, cardioprotective, and hepatoprotective activities.",0,2380
1664,35968110,"Purple stem Brassica napus exhibits higher photosynthetic efficiency, antioxidant potential and anthocyanin biosynthesis related genes expression against drought stress.","Purple-stem Brassica napus (B. napus) is a phenotype with unique color because of its high anthocyanins content. Anthocyanins are naturally occurring plant pigments that have antioxidants activity and play important role in plant defense against abiotic and biotic stresses. In the present study, drought induced effects on plants were investigated in hydroponically grown seedlings of green stem (GS) and purple stem (PS) genotypes of B. napus. The results of this study showed that the major function of anthocyanins accumulation during drought was to enhance the antioxidant capability and stress tolerance in B. napus plants. Our results showed that drought significantly inhibited the plant growth in terms of decreased biomass accumulation in both genotypes, although marked decline was observed in GS genotype. The reduction in photosynthetic attributes was more noticeable in the GS genotype, whereas the PS genotype showed better performance under drought stress. Under stressful conditions, both the genotype showed excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as higher levels of antioxidant enzymes activities. Under drought conditions, the GS genotype showed apparent damages on chloroplast deformation like in thylakoid membrane and grana structural distortion and fewer starch grains and bigger plastoglobuli. Moreover, during drought stress, the PS genotype exhibited maximum expression levels of anthocyanins biosynthesis genes and antioxidant enzymes accompanied by higher stress tolerance relative to GS genotype. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that GS genotype found more sensitive to drought stress than the PS genotype. Furthermore this research paper also provides practical guidance for plant biologists who are developing stress-tolerant crops by using anthocyanin biosynthesis or regulatory genes.",0,2381
567,35978520,The origins of resident macrophages in mammary gland influence the tumorigenesis of breast cancer.,"Macrophage is the important sentinel cell type of innate immune system, and bridge with the adaptive immune response via antigen presentation. Tissue-resident macrophages are universal in almost all organs and play essential roles in maintaining specific organ homeostasis, inflammation responses, and disease genesis, including tumorigenesis. Macrophage is generally divided into two extreme statuses, M1 and M2, with sophisticated continuous subtypes due to different stimuli and microenvironments. Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) is regarded as the key factor related to the prognosis, staging, classification, and treatment strategy of various cancers. However, emerging evidence indicated potential opposite functions of TAM in different tumor models. Recent studies found that different originated resident macrophages show notably different profiles in the same tissue niche. More evidence pointed out that the strategies to repolarize the subtypes of TAM or resident macrophages are valuable in carcinoma treatments. In the breast cancer model, studies pointed that macrophages located differently in histology show obvious different cell markers and functions. In this review, we will illustrate the profiles of resident macrophages in breast cancer with various aspects, including origination, polarization, tumoricidal activity, tumorigenesis, and the factors that could regulate the functions of macrophages.",0,2382
590,35977907,NADPH oxidase inhibitor development for diabetic nephropathy through water tank model.,"Oxidative stress can cause generation of uncontrolled reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lead to cytotoxic damage to cells and tissues. Recently, it has been shown that transient ROS generation can serve as a secondary messenger in receptor-mediated cell signaling. Although excessive levels of ROS are harmful, moderated levels of ROS are essential for normal physiological function. Therefore, regulating cellular ROS levels should be an important concept for development of novel therapeutics for treating diseases. The overexpression and hyperactivation of NADPH oxidase (Nox) can induce high levels of ROS, which are strongly associated with diabetic nephropathy. This review discusses the theoretical basis for development of the Nox inhibitor as a regulator of ROS homeostasis to provide emerging therapeutic opportunities for diabetic nephropathy.",0,2383
1860,35967780,Stepwise establishment of functional microbial groups in the infant gut between 6 months and 2 years: A prospective cohort study.,"The early intestinal colonization of functional microbial groups plays an essential role in infant gut health, with most studies targeting the initial colonization period from birth to 6 months of age. In a previous report, we demonstrated the metabolic cross-feeding of lactate and identified keystone species specified for lactate utilization in fecal samples of 40 healthy infants. We present here the extension of our longitudinal study for the period from 6 months to 2 years, with a focus on the colonization of functional groups involved in lactate metabolism and butyrate production. We captured the dynamic changes of the gut microbiota and reported a switch in the predominant lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, from Veillonella producing propionate in the first year to Anaerobutyrycum hallii producing butyrate in the second year of life. The significant increase in butyrate producers and fecal butyrate concentration was also pinpointed to the weaning period between 6 and 10 months. Correlation analyses further suggested, for the first time, the metabolic cross-feeding of hydrogen in infants. In conclusion, our longitudinal study of 40 Swiss infants provides important insights into the colonization of functional groups involved in lactate metabolism and butyrate production in the first 2 years of life.",0,2384
1543,35968343,Gentian violet induces apoptosis and ferroptosis via modulating p53 and MDM2 in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancies with limited curative options and poor prognosis. Gentian violet (GV) has recently been found to have anti-tumor properties with promising clinical applications. However, its anti-tumor effect and the underlying functional mechanisms in HCC have not been investigated. In this study, we found that GV induced ferroptosis and apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner in vitro, and significantly attenuated the growth of HCC in vivo. Both ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostain-1 (Fer-1) and apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-KFM (Z-VAD) partially attenuated GV-induced growth-inhibitory effects, while combined treatment of Fer-1 and Z-VAD completely abolished GV's activities. Increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected after GV treatment. Interestingly, GV elevated the expression levels of both p53 and its negative regulator MDM2, which was dependent on the expression of the dehydrogenase/reductase protein Hep27. Simultaneously silencing both the MDM2 and p53 genes by siRNAs abolished ROS production and partially rescued the cell death induced by GV treatment. Our data demonstrate a GV-Hep27-MDM2-p53 signaling cascade that regulates ferroptosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, our findings provide insights into understanding the anti-tumor function of GV and present the basis of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HCC.",0,2385
181,35982903,Regulation of Adipose Thermogenesis and its Critical Role in Glucose and Lipid Metabolism.,"The function of the adipose tissue is influenced by complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, and the environment, and its dysfunction can cause a variety of metabolic diseases, such as obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2D). The beige/brown adipose tissue plays a crucial role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism by increasing energy metabolism to generate heat. The adipose tissue thermogenic program is a complex network that involves many signaling pathways regulated by coding RNAs (cRNAs) that encode transcription factor, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). This article discusses factors that regulate adipose tissue thermogenesis, including cRNAs and ncRNAs, and the important role of thermogenic adipose tissue in obesity-related metabolic syndrome. Several studies have shown that some cRNAs and ncRNAs can modulate the thermogenic function of adipose tissue in different ways. This article reviews the roles of cRNAs and ncRNAs in regulating thermogenesis in the beige/brown adipose tissue and the important role of the beige/brown adipose tissue in maintaining the balance of glucose and lipid metabolism in the body.",0,2386
2212,35967306,Volatile organic compounds: A proinflammatory activator in autoimmune diseases.,"The etiopathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including pulmonary disease, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, has been linked to human exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOC) present in the environment. Chronic inflammation due to immune breakdown and malfunctioning of the immune system has been projected to play a major role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune disorders. Macrophages, major phagocytes involved in the regulation of chronic inflammation, are a major target of VOC. Excessive and prolonged activation of immune cells (T and B lymphocytes) and overexpression of the master pro-inflammatory constituents [cytokine and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, together with other mediators (interleukin-6, interleukin-1, and interferon-gamma)] have been shown to play a central role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory responses. The function and efficiency of the immune system resulting in immunostimulation and immunosuppression are a result of exogenous and endogenous factors. An autoimmune disorder is a by-product of the overproduction of these inflammatory mediators. Additionally, an excess of these toxicants helps in promoting autoimmunity through alterations in DNA methylation in CD4 T cells. The purpose of this review is to shed light on the possible role of VOC exposure in the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases.",0,2387
565,35978522,The emerging role of 27-hydroxycholesterol in cancer development and progression: An update.,"Oxysterols are cholesterol metabolites generated in the liver and other peripheral tissues as a mechanism of removing excess cholesterol. Oxysterols have a wide range of biological functions, including the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism, platelet aggregation, and apoptosis. However, it has been found that metabolites derived from cholesterol play essential functions in cancer development and immunological suppression. In this regard, research indicates that 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC) might act as an estrogen, promoting the growth of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer cells. The capacity of cholesterol to dynamically modulate signaling molecules inside the membrane and particular metabolites serving as signaling molecules are two possible contributory processes. 27-HC is a significant metabolite produced mainly through the CYP27A1 (Cytochrome P450 27A1) enzyme. 27-HC maintains cholesterol balance biologically by promoting cholesterol efflux via the liver X receptor (LXR) and suppressing de novo cholesterol production through the Insulin-induced Genes (INSIGs). It has been demonstrated that 27-HC is able to function as a selective ER regulator. Moreover, enhanced 27-HC production is in favor of the growth of end-stage malignancies in the brain, thyroid organs, and colon, as shown in breast cancer, probably due to pro-survival and pro-inflammatory signaling induced by unbalanced levels of oxysterols. However, the actual role of 27-HC in cancer promotion and progression remains debatable, and many studies are warranted to be performed to unravel the precise function of these molecules. This review article will summarize the latest evidence on the deleterious or beneficial functions of 27-HC in various types of cancer, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, glioblastoma, thyroid cancer, adrenocortical cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.",0,2388
2180,35967338,Plasma protein profiling reveals dynamic immunomodulatory changes in multiple sclerosis patients during pregnancy.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Pregnancy represents a natural modulation of the disease course, where the relapse rate decreases, especially in the 3rd trimester, followed by a transient exacerbation after delivery. Although the exact mechanisms behind the pregnancy-induced modulation are yet to be deciphered, it is likely that the immune tolerance established during pregnancy is involved. In this study, we used the highly sensitive and specific proximity extension assay technology to perform protein profiling analysis of 92 inflammation-related proteins in MS patients (n=15) and healthy controls (n=10), longitudinally sampled before, during, and after pregnancy. Differential expression analysis was performed using linear models and p-values were adjusted for false discovery rate due to multiple comparisons. Our findings reveal gradual dynamic changes in plasma proteins that are most prominent during the 3rd trimester while reverting post-partum. Thus, this pattern reflects the disease activity of MS during pregnancy. Among the differentially expressed proteins in pregnancy, several proteins with known immunoregulatory properties were upregulated, such as PD-L1, LIF-R, TGF-β1, and CCL28. On the other hand, inflammatory chemokines such as CCL8, CCL13, and CXCL5, as well as members of the tumor necrosis factor family, TRANCE and TWEAK, were downregulated. Further in-depth studies will reveal if these proteins can serve as biomarkers in MS and whether they are mechanistically involved in the disease amelioration and worsening. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved may identify new treatment strategies mimicking the pregnancy milieu.",0,2389
2088,35967430,Efficient derivation of chimeric-antigen receptor-modified TSCM cells.,"Chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy employs autologous-T cells modified with an antigen-specific CAR. Current CAR-T manufacturing processes tend to yield products dominated by effector T cells and relatively small proportions of long-lived memory T cells. Those few cells are a so-called stem cell memory T (TSCM) subset, which express naïve T-cell markers and are capable of self-renewal and oligopotent differentiation into effector phenotypes. Increasing the proportion of this subset may lead to more effective therapies by improving CAR-T persistence; however, there is currently no standardized protocol for the effective generation of CAR-TSCM cells. Here we present a simplified protocol enabling efficient derivation of gene-modified TSCM cells: Stimulation of naïve CD8+ T cells with only soluble anti-CD3 antibody and culture with IL-7 and IL-15 was sufficient for derivation of CD8+ T cells harboring TSCM phenotypes and oligopotent capabilities. These in-vitro expanded TSCM cells were engineered with CARs targeting the HIV-1 envelope protein as well as the CD19 molecule and demonstrated effector activity both in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. This simple protocol for the derivation of CAR-TSCM cells may facilitate improved adoptive immunotherapy.",0,2390
2420,35966876,The pathological and therapeutic roles of mesenchymal stem cells in preeclampsia.,Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have made progress in the treatment of ischemic and inflammatory diseases. Preeclampsia (PE) is characterized by placenta ischemic and inflammatory injury. Our paper summarized the new role of MSCs in PE pathology and its potency in PE therapy and analyzed its current limitations. Intravenously administered MSCs dominantly distributed in perinatal tissues. There may be additional advantages to using MSCs-based therapies for reproductive disorders. It will provide new ideas for future research in this field.,0,2391
2451,35966841,A multicenter prospective cohort study of cardiac ultrasound phenotypes in patients with sepsis: Study protocol for a multicenter prospective cohort trial.,"Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy significantly increased the mortality of patients with sepsis. The diagnostic criteria for septic cardiomyopathy has not been unified, which brings serious difficulties to clinical treatment. This study aimed to provide evidence for the early identification and intervention in patients with sepsis by clarifying the relationship between the ultrasound phenotype of septic cardiomyopathy and the prognosis of patients with sepsis. This was a multicenter, prospective cohort study. The study population will consist of all eligible consecutive patients with sepsis or septic shock who meet the Sepsis 3.0 diagnostic criteria and were aged ≥18 years. Clinical data and echocardiographic measurements will be recorded within 2 h, at the 24th hour, at the 72nd hour, and on the 7th day after admission. The prevalence of each phenotype will be described as well, and their association with prognosis will be analyzed statistically. To achieve early recognition, prevent reinjury, achieve precise treatment, and reduce mortality in patients with sepsis, it is important to identify septic cardiac alterations and classify the phenotypes at all stages of sepsis. First, there is a lack of studies on the prevalence of each phenotype in Chinese populations. Second, each phenotype and its corresponding prognosis are not clear. In addition, the prognosis of patients with normal cardiac ultrasound phenotypes vs. those with suppressed or hyperdynamic cardiac phenotypes is unclear. Finally, this study was designed to collect data at four specific timing, then the timing of occurrence, duration, changes over time, impact to outcomes of each phenotype will probably be found. This study is expected to establish a standard and objective method to assess the ultrasound phenotype of septic cardiomyopathy due to its advantages of visualization, non-invasiveness and reproducibility, and to provide more precise information for the hemodynamic management of septic patients. In addition, this research will promote the clinical application of critical care ultrasound, which will play an important role in medical education and make ultrasound the best method to assess cardiac changes in sepsis. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05161104, identifier NCT05161104.",0,2392
2221,35967297,A single-cell map of vascular and tissue lymphocytes identifies proliferative TCF-1+ human innate lymphoid cells.,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play important roles in tissue homeostasis and host defense, but the proliferative properties and migratory behavior of especially human ILCs remain poorly understood. Here we mapped at single-cell resolution the spatial distribution of quiescent and proliferative human ILCs within the vascular versus tissue compartment. For this purpose, we employed MISTRG humanized mice as an in-vivo model to study human ILCs. We uncovered subset-specific differences in the proliferative status between vascular and tissue ILCs within lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. We also identified CD117-CRTH2-CD45RA+ ILCs in the spleen that were highly proliferative and expressed the transcription factor TCF-1. These proliferative ILCs were present during the neonatal period in human blood and emerged early during population of the human ILC compartment in MISTRG mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Single-cell RNA-sequencing combined with intravascular cell labeling suggested that proliferative ILCs actively migrated from the local vasculature into the spleen tissue. Collectively, our comprehensive map reveals the proliferative topography of human ILCs, linking cell migration and spatial compartmentalization with cell division.",0,2393
832,35974939,Effect of Rituximab on the cognitive impairment in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.,"The present study aimed to address the effect of Rituximab on the cognitive impairment in patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS). The present interventional study used a convenience sampling method to select the study participants from SPMS patients. All these patients had progressive disability over the last two years before being admitted in the study. Prior to the administration of Rituximab, the minimal assessment of cognitive function in the multiple sclerosis (MACFIMS) test was performed for each patient who was a candidate to be included in this study. This test was repeated by passing 6 and 12 months from the initial treatment with Rituximab. Since the data needed for this study were obtained at different time intervals, so a linear mixed model was used for their analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also used to investigate whether time and sex generally affect the cognitive impairments in SPMS patients. A p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant in this study. Of the total 35 patients, 34% and 66% were men and women with a mean age of 41.33 and 41.39 years old, respectively. Rituximab showed a significant positive effect on a number of subgroups of MACFIMS test, including Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) (P-value: 0.038) and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT-total) (P: 0.019). The present study revealed that Rituximab has a positive effect on the cognitive impairment resulted from MS in secondary progressive patients.",0,2394
1870,35967769,Plant-based diets and body composition in Chinese omnivorous children aged 6-9 years old: A cross-sectional study.,"Evidence suggests that plant-based diets are beneficial for alleviating metabolic diseases. Childhood is a crucial period for body growth and development. However, it is unknown whether adherence to a plant-based diet is related to a healthy body composition in children. We aimed to assess the relationship between a plant-based diet and body composition in children. A total of 452 Chinese children aged 6-9 years old participated in this cross-sectional study. Lean mass (LM), fat mass, and fat mass percentage (FMP) were assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. An age- and sex-specific abdominal FMP ≥85th percentile was defined as abdominal obesity. Handgrip strength was measured using a hydraulic hand dynamometer. A validated 79-item food frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary information. Overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI) scores were calculated. After adjusting for potential covariates, a higher hPDI score (per 10-score increment) was associated with a higher LM in the android area (0.038 kg, 3.2%), gynoid area (0.048 kg, 1.9%), and trunk (0.102 kg, 1.2%) and with a lower FMP (1.18%) in the android area. In contrast, a higher uPDI score (per 10-score increment) was associated with a lower LM in the trunk (0.091 kg, 1.1%) and android area (0.023 kg, 1.9%) and with a higher FMP (0.74%) in the android area. No significant associations were observed between the overall PDI and body composition or abdominal obesity. After stratifying by sex, higher (vs. lower) hPDI scores was associated with lower abdominal obesity risk in girls and higher handgrip strength in boys. In conclusion, in this cross-sectional study, we found that stronger adherence to a healthful plant-based diet, and less adherence to an unhealthful plant-based diet was associated with better body composition in Chinese omnivorous children aged 6-9 years old. Our results highlight the need to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy plant foods within investigating how to obtain a healthy body composition in children.",0,2395
2224,35967294,Distinct immune stimulatory effects of anti-human VISTA antibodies are determined by Fc-receptor interaction.,"VISTA (PD-1H) is an immune regulatory molecule considered part of the next wave of immuno-oncology targets. VISTA is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily cell surface molecule mainly expressed on myeloid cells, and to some extent on NK cells and T cells. In previous preclinical studies, some VISTA-targeting antibodies provided immune inhibitory signals, while other antibodies triggered immune stimulatory signals. Importantly, for therapeutic antibodies, the isotype backbone can have a strong impact on antibody function. To elucidate the mode of action of immune stimulatory anti-VISTA antibodies, we studied three different anti-human VISTA antibody clones, each on three different IgG isotypes currently used for therapeutic antibodies: unaltered IgG1 (IgG1-WT), IgG1-KO (IgG1-LL234,235AA-variant with reduced Fc-effector function), and IgG4-Pro (IgG4- S228P-variant with stabilized hinge region). Antibody functionality was analysed in mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), as a model system for ongoing immune reactions, on unstimulated human PBMCs, as a model system for a resting immune system, and also on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples to evaluate anti-VISTA antibody effects on primary tumor material. The functions of three anti-human VISTA antibodies were determined by their IgG isotype backbones. An MLR of healthy donor PBMCs was effectively augmented by anti-VISTA-IgG4-Pro and anti-VISTA-IgG1-WT antibodies, as indicated by increased levels of cytokines, T cell activation markers and T cell proliferation. However, in a culture of unstimulated PBMCs of single healthy donors, only anti-VISTA-IgG1-WT antibodies increased the activation marker HLA-DR on resting myeloid cells, and chemokine levels. Interestingly, interactions with different Fc-receptors were required for these effects, namely CD64 for augmentation of MLR, and CD16 for activation of resting myeloid cells. Furthermore, anti-VISTA-IgG1-KO antibodies had nearly no impact in any model system. Similarly, in AML patient samples, anti-VISTA-antibody on IgG4-Pro backbone, but not on IgG1-KO backbone, increased interactions, as a novel readout of activity, between immune cells and CD34+ AML cancer cells. In conclusion, the immune stimulatory effects of antagonistic anti-VISTA antibodies are defined by the antibody isotype and interaction with different Fc-gamma-receptors, highlighting the importance of understanding these interactions when designing immune stimulatory antibody therapeutics for immuno-oncology applications.",0,2396
2085,35967433,Antibody response following the third and fourth SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose in individuals with common variable immunodeficiency.,"The antibody response after vaccination is impaired in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). We aimed to study the spike receptor-binding domain IgG antibody (anti-S-RBD) levels during a four-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategy and after monoclonal antibody (mAB) treatment in CVID. Moreover, we assessed the anti-S-RBD levels in immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) products. In an observational study, we examined anti-S-RBD levels after the second, third, and fourth dose of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Moreover, we measured anti-S-RBD after treatment with mAB. Finally, anti-S-RBD was assessed in common IgRT products. Antibody non-responders (anti-S-RBD < 7.1) were compared by McNemar's test and anti-S-RBD levels were compared with paired and non-paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests as well as Kruskal-Wallis tests. Among 33 individuals with CVID, anti-S-RBD levels increased after the third vaccine dose (165 BAU/ml [95% confidence interval: 85; 2280 BAU/ml], p = 0.006) and tended to increase after the fourth dose (193 BAU/ml, [-22; 569 BAU/ml], p = 0.080) compared to the previous dose. With increasing number of vaccinations, the proportion of patients who seroconverted (anti-S-RBD ≥ 7.1) increased non-significantly. mAB treatment resulted in a large increase in anti-S-RBD and a higher median level than gained after the fourth dose of vaccine (p = 0.009). IgRT products had varying concentrations of anti-S-RBD (p < 0.001), but none of the products seemed to affect the overall antibody levels (p = 0.460). Multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses in CVID seem to provide additional protection, as antibody levels increased after the third and fourth vaccine dose. However, anti-S-RBD levels from mAB outperform the levels mounted after vaccination. Boosting with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines seems to improve the antibody response in CVID patients. The third and possibly also the fourth dose of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in CVID improve the antibody response as well as stimulate seroconversion in most non-responders.",0,2397
2069,35967449,"A robust experimental and computational analysis framework at multiple resolutions, modalities and coverages.","The ability to study cancer-immune cell communication across the whole tumor section without tissue dissociation is needed, especially for cancer immunotherapy development, which requires understanding of molecular mechanisms and discovery of more druggable targets. In this work, we assembled and evaluated an integrated experimental framework and analytical process to enable genome-wide scale discovery of ligand-receptors potentially used for cellular crosstalks, followed by targeted validation. We assessed the complementarity of four different technologies: single-cell RNA sequencing and Spatial transcriptomic (measuring over >20,000 genes), RNA In Situ Hybridization (RNAscope, measuring 4-12 genes) and Opal Polaris multiplex protein staining (4-9 proteins). To utilize the multimodal data, we implemented existing methods and also developed STRISH (Spatial TRanscriptomic In Situ Hybridization), a computational method that can automatically scan across the whole tissue section for local expression of gene (e.g. RNAscope data) and/or protein markers (e.g. Polaris data) to recapitulate an interaction landscape across the whole tissue. We evaluated the approach to discover and validate cell-cell interaction in situ through in-depth analysis of two types of cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which account for over 70% of cancer cases. We showed that inference of cell-cell interactions using scRNA-seq data can misdetect or detect false positive interactions. Spatial transcriptomics still suffers from misdetecting lowly expressed ligand-receptor interactions, but reduces false discovery. RNAscope and Polaris are sensitive methods for defining the location of potential ligand receptor interactions, and the STRISH program can determine the probability that local gene co-expression reflects true cell-cell interaction. We expect that the approach described here will be widely applied to discover and validate ligand receptor interaction in different types of solid cancer tumors.",0,2398
1558,35968328,MUC1 is responsible for the pro-metastatic potential of calycosin in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a prominent type of pancreatic cancer. We have recently unveiled that the anti-tumor adjuvant calycosin concurrently possesses growth-inhibitory and pro-metastatic potential in PDAC development by regulating transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), which plays dual roles as both tumor suppressor and tumor promoter. Hence, we are interested to explore if the pro-metastatic property of the drug could be attenuated for effective treatment of PDAC. Through network pharmacology, MUC1 had been identified as the most common drug target of herbal Astragalus constituents (including calycosin) in treating PDAC. Following MUC1 gene silencing, the drug effects of calycosin on migratory activity, growth and metabolic regulation of PDAC cells were assessed by using immunofluorescence microscopy, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), wound healing assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Through in vivo experiments, we further validated the working relationship between MUC1 and TGF-β. Results have elucidated that MUC1 gene suppression could switch off the migratory and pro-metastatic drive of calycosin while retaining its growth-inhibitory power by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, as well as facilitating autophagy and metabolic regulation. The underlying mechanism involves downregulation of TGF-β that acts via modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) signaling. These findings have provided new insights in the safe and target-specific treatment of PDAC.",0,2399
1552,35968334,miR-1297 inhibits osteosarcoma cell proliferation and growth by targeting CCND2.,"Cyclin D2 (CCND2) is abnormally overexpressed in many tumor types and has been associated with tumor cell proliferation. Although the important role of miR-1297 is well established, the molecular mechanism between CCND2 and miR-1297 in osteosarcoma (OS) has not been determined. In the present study, we found CCND2 was highly expressed in OS cells, and its downregulation suppressed cell proliferation, resulting in G1 phase cell cycle arrest. In contrast, miR-1297 was lowly expressed in OS compared to normal tissue. Several data platforms predicted that CCND2 was a target of miR-1297, which was validated by a dual-luciferase reporter assay that revealed miR-1297 could bind with CCND2-3'UTR. miR-1297 overexpression greatly inhibited CCND2 protein expression and exerted the same phenotypic effect as CCND2 downregulation in OS cells. Furthermore, miR-1297 inhibition could also be rescued by CCND2. Nude mice injected cells stable overexpressing miR-1297 OS cells showed lower size and tumor weight. Moreover, lower fluorescence activity recorded by in vivo imaging system and bone erosion revealed by microCT in the miR-1297 group demonstrated miR-1297 inhibited OS tumor growth via CCND2. Our findings demonstrated that miR-1297 can inhibit proliferation and tumor growth in OS by directly targeting CCND2, which indicates that miR-1297 may represent a novel therapeutic target for OS.",0,2400
2018,35967568,The role of necroptosis in common respiratory diseases in children.,"Studies have shown that necroptosis (NEC) relies on a unique gene-regulated molecular pathway to cause cell death. With the development of knockout mouse models and specific molecular inhibitors of necrotic proteins, this cell death pathway has been considered one of the important causes of the pathogenesis of human diseases. In this review, we explored the possible roles and mechanisms of NEC in common respiratory diseases in children, such as acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary infection, childhood asthma, pulmonary hypertension, etc., in order to provide new ideas for the prevention and treatment of such diseases.",0,2401

673,35975539,Evaluation of Serum MiR-184 and MiR-326 Expression in PCOS Subjects: Correlation with PCOS Related Parameters.,"MicroRNA (miRNA) is an endogenous non-coding single-stranded RNA with highly conserved characteristics, which has been proven to regulate gene expression and biological functions of organisms after transcription. Therefore, exploring the differentially expressed miRNAs during the disease process is of great significance for the diagnosis of the disease. The focus of this study is to explore the differences in serum expression of miR-184 and miR-326 in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) subjects, and analyze the Pearson's correlation with PCOS disease characterization parameters. The basic physical characteristics and related biochemical indicators and hormone levels of 60 PCOS subjects and 60 healthy subjects of the same period were tested. MiR-184 and miR-326 in serum were detected, and it was found that miR-184 and miR-326 in PCOS subjects were significantly increased. Correlation analysis found that miR-184 and miR-326 are positively correlated with body mass index, follicle number, ovarian volume, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, homeostasis of insulin resistance model evaluation, and triglycerides and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein. The study showed that serum miR-184 and miR-326 are highly expressed in PCOS patients and can be used as molecular biomarkers for PCOS diagnosis. They may be involved in the metabolism and reproductive function of PCOS patients.",0,2403
2122,35967396,GAS6/TAM signaling pathway controls MICA expression in multiple myeloma cells.,"NKG2D ligands play a relevant role in Natural Killer (NK) cell -mediated immune surveillance of multiple myeloma (MM). Different levels of regulation control the expression of these molecules at cell surface. A number of oncogenic proteins and miRNAs act as negative regulators of NKG2D ligand transcription and translation, but the molecular mechanisms sustaining their basal expression in MM cells remain poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the role of the growth arrest specific 6 (GAS6)/TAM signaling pathway in the regulation of NKG2D ligand expression and MM recognition by NK cells. Our data showed that GAS6 as well as MERTK and AXL depletion in MM cells results in MICA downregulation and inhibition of NKG2D-mediated NK cell degranulation. Noteworthy, GAS6 derived from bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) also increases MICA expression at both protein and mRNA level in human MM cell lines and in primary malignant plasma cells. NF-kB activation is required for these regulatory mechanisms since deletion of a site responsive for this transcription factor compromises the induction of mica promoter by BMSCs. Accordingly, knockdown of GAS6 reduces the capability of BMSCs to activate NF-kB pathway as well as to enhance MICA expression in MM cells. Taken together, these results shed light on molecular mechanism underlying NKG2D ligand regulation and identify GAS6 protein as a novel autocrine and paracrine regulator of basal expression of MICA in human MM cells.",0,2404
2076,35967442,Evidence for histamine release in chronic inducible urticaria - A systematic review.,"Chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) constitutes a group of nine different CIndUs in which pruritic wheals and/or angioedema occur after exposure to specific and definite triggers. Histamine released from activated and degranulating skin mast cells is held to play a key role in the pathogenesis of CIndU, but evidence to support this has, as of yet, not been reviewed systematically or in detail. We aim to characterize the role and relevance of histamine in CIndU. We systematically searched 3 electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Embase) for studies that reported increased serum or skin histamine concentration (direct evidence) or in vitro or ex vivo histamine release (indirect evidence) following trigger exposure. An initial total of 3,882 articles was narrowed down to 107 relevant studies of which 52 were in cold urticaria, 19 in cholinergic urticaria, 14 in heat urticaria, 10 in contact urticaria, 7 each in solar urticaria and vibratory angioedema, 4 each in symptomatic dermographism and aquagenic urticaria, and 3 in delayed pressure urticaria. The results of our review support that histamine has a key pathogenic role in the pathogenesis of all CIndUs, but it is not the sole mediator as evidenced by the often poor relationship between the level of histamine and severity of symptoms and the variable clinical efficacy of H1-antihistamines. Histamine released from skin mast cells is a key driver of the development of signs and symptoms and a promising therapeutic target in CIndU.",0,2405
675,35975537,The Expression and Clinical Value of miR-221 and miR-320 in the Plasma of Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,"The goal was to investigate the expression of plasma miR-221 and miR-320 in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to further explore the relationship between miRNA and risk factors for GDM. This study included 85 GDM and 85 age-matched normal pregnant women who visited our hospital from January 2019 to January 2020. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the expression of miR-221 and miR-320 in the plasma of pregnant women. The correlation analysis was used to detect the relationship between miR-221, miR-320, and risk factors of GDM, including homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the prepregnancy BMI. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to determine the diagnostic value of miR-320 and miR-221 in GDM. Compared with normal pregnant women, the expression of miR-221 and miR-320 in GDM was significantly higher (p < 0.05). The results also demonstrate that the expression of miR-221 and miR-320 increases grad-ually with the development of pregnancy in GDM at 24 weeks, 28 weeks, and 32 weeks (p < 0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis confirmed that the expression level of miR-221 and miR-320 in the plasma of GDM is positively correlated with the HOMA-IR and HbA1c, but has no significant correlation with pre-pregnancy BMI. The area under the curve (AUC) values of miR-221 and miR-320 were 0.862 and 0.853, respectively. Meanwhile, the area under the combined detection curve is 0.904. Plasma miR-221 and miR-320 are significantly elevated in GDM, and are positively correlated with HbA1c and HOMA-IR. The high expression of miR-221 and miR-320 in the peripheral plasma of pregnant women may directly or indirectly participate in the occurrence and development of GDM or may become a new target for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of GDM.",0,2406
1741,35968001,A polymorphism in porcine miR-22 is associated with pork color.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional regulators that play key roles in meat color regulation. Changes in miRNA expression affect their target mRNAs, leading to multifunctional effects on biological processes and phenotypes. In this study, a G > A mutation site located upstream of the precursor miR-22 sequence in Suhuai pigs was significantly correlated with the meat color parameter a*(redness) of the porcine longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. AA genotype individuals had the highest average meat color a* value and the lowest miR-22 level. When G > A mutation was performed in the miR-22 overexpression vector, miR-22 expression significantly decreased. Considering that Ca2+ homeostasis is closely related to pig meat color, our results further demonstrated that ELOVL6 is a direct target of miR-22 in pigs. The effects of miR-22 on skeletal muscle intracellular Ca2+ were partially caused by the suppression of ELOVL6 expression.",0,2407
2197,35967321,Coordinated innate and T-cell immune responses in mild COVID-19 patients from household contacts of COVID-19 cases during the first pandemic wave.,"To better define the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19, the present study aims to characterize the early immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in household contacts of COVID-19 cases. In particular, innate, T- and B-cell specific responses were evaluated over time. Household contacts of COVID-19 cases screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal swab for surveillance purposes were enrolled (T0, n=42). Of these, 28 subjects returned for a follow-up test (T1). The innate response was assessed by detecting a panel of soluble factors by multiplex-technology in plasma samples. Cell-mediated response was evaluated by measuring interferon (IFN)-γ levels by ELISA in plasma harvested from whole-blood stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools, including spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins. The serological response was assessed by quantifying anti-Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD), anti-Nucleocapsid (N), whole virus indirect immunofluorescence, and neutralizing antibodies. At T0, higher levels of plasmatic IFN-α, IL-1ra, MCP-1 and IP-10, and lower levels of IL-1β, IL-9, MIP-1β and RANTES were observed in subjects with positive swab compared to individuals with a negative one (p<0.05). Plasmatic IFN-α was the only cytokine detectable in subjects with positive SARS-CoV-2 swabs with high accuracy for swab score positivity (0.93, p<0.0001). Among subjects with positive swabs, significant negative correlations were found among the RT-PCR cycle threshold values reported for genes S and N and IFN-α or IP-10 levels. At T0, the IFN-γ T-cell specific response was detected in 50% (5/10) of subjects with positive swab, while anti-RBD/anti-N antibodies showed a positivity rate of 10% (1/10). At T1, the IFN-γ T-cell specific response was detected in most of the confirmed-infection subjects (77.8%, 7/9), whereas the serological response was still observed in a minority of them (44.4%, 4/9). Overall, the swab test showed a moderate concordance with the T-cell response (78.6%, k=0.467), and a scarce concordance with the serological one (72.9%, k=0.194). Plasmatic IFN-α and the IFN-γ T-cell specific response appear early even in the absence of seroconversion, and show a greater positivity rate than the serological response in household contacts with positive swab.",0,2408
2112,35967406,"Combined Toxicity Evaluation of Ochratoxin A and Aflatoxin B1 on Kidney and Liver Injury, Immune Inflammation, and Gut Microbiota Alteration Through Pair-Feeding Pullet Model.","Ochratoxin A (OTA) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) are often co-contaminated, but their synergistic toxicity in poultry is limitedly described. Furthermore, the traditional ad libitum feeding model may fail to distinguish the specific impact of mycotoxins on the biomarkers and the indirect effect of mildew on the palatability of feed. A pair-feeding model was introduced to investigate the specific effect and the indirect effect of the combined toxicity of OTA and AFB1, which were independent and dependent on feed intake, respectively. A total of 180 one-day-old pullets were randomly divided into 3 groups with 6 replicates, and each replicate contained 10 chicks. The control group (Group A) and the pair-feeding group (Group B) received the basal diet without mycotoxin contamination. Group C was administrated with OTA- and AFB1-contaminated feed (101.41 μg/kg of OTA + 20.10 μg/kg of AFB1). The scale of feeding in Group B matched with the feed intake of Group C. The trial lasted 42 days. Compared with the control group, co-contamination of OTA and AFB1 in feed could adversely affect the growth performance (average daily feed intake (ADFI), body weight (BW), average daily weight gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and shank length (SL)), decrease the relative weight of the spleen (p < 0.01), and increase the relative weight of the kidney (p < 0.01). Moreover, the reduction of feed intake could also adversely affect the growth performance (BW, ADG, and SL), but not as severely as mycotoxins do. Apart from that, OTA and AFB1 also activated the antioxidative and inflammation reactions of chicks, increasing the level of catalase (CAT), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) while decreasing the level of IL-10 (p < 0.01), which was weakly influenced by the feed intake reduction. In addition, OTA and AFB1 induced histopathological changes and apoptosis in the kidney and liver as well as stimulated the growth of pernicious bacteria to cause toxic effects. There were no histopathological changes and apoptosis in the kidney and liver of the pair-feeding group. The combined toxicity of OTA and AFB1 had more severe effects on pullets than merely reducing feed supply. However, the proper reduction of the feed intake could improve pullets' physical health by enriching the bacteria Lactobacillus, Phascolarctobacterium, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Barnesiella.",0,2409
1859,35967781,Association between vitamins and risk of brain tumors: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies.,"Brain tumor is one of the important causes of cancer mortality, and the prognosis is poor. Therefore, early prevention of brain tumors is the key to reducing mortality due to brain tumors. This review aims to quantitatively evaluate the association between vitamins and brain tumors by meta-analysis. We searched articles on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases from inception to 19 December 2021. According to heterogeneity, the fixed-effects model or random-effects model was selected to obtain the relative risk of the merger. Based on the methods described by Greenland and Longnecker, we explored the dose-response relationship between vitamins and the risk of brain tumors. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were also used for the analysis. The study reviewed 23 articles, including 1,347,426 controls and 6,449 brain tumor patients. This study included vitamin intake and circulating concentration. For intake, it mainly included vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin E, β-carotene, and folate. For circulating concentrations, it mainly included vitamin E and vitamin D in the serum (25-hydroxyvitamin D and α-tocopherol). For vitamin intake, compared with the lowest intakes, the highest intakes of vitamin C (RR = 0.81, 95%CI:0.66-0.99, I 2 = 54.7%, P for heterogeneity = 0.007), β-carotene (RR = 0.78, 95%CI:0.66-0.93, I 2 = 0, P for heterogeneity = 0.460), and folate (RR = 0.66, 95%CI:0.55-0.80, I 2 = 0, P for heterogeneity = 0.661) significantly reduced the risk of brain tumors. For serum vitamins, compared with the lowest concentrations, the highest concentrations of serum α-tocopherol (RR = 0.61, 95%CI:0.44-0.86, I 2 = 0, P for heterogeneity = 0.656) significantly reduced the risk of brain tumors. The results of the dose-response relationship showed that increasing the intake of 100 μg folate per day reduced the risk of brain tumors by 7% (P -nonlinearity = 0.534, RR = 0.93, 95%CI:0.90-0.96). Our analysis suggests that the intake of vitamin C, β-carotene, and folate can reduce the risk of brain tumors, while high serum α-tocopherol concentration also has a protective effect on brain tumors. Therefore, vitamins may provide new ideas for the prevention of brain tumors. PROSPERO, identifier CRD42022300683.",0,2410
1551,35968335,Short chain fatty acids exhibit selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD) activity in breast cancer.,"Early stage estrogen receptor α (ERα, ESR1)-positive breast cancer patients can develop more aggressive endocrine-resistant tumors that express constitutively active mutant forms of ERα including ERα-Y537S and ERα-D538G. These patients are treated with selective ER down regulators (SERDs) such as the ERα antagonist fulvestrant. Previous studies show that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors downregulate ERα and since some dietary derived short chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate and acetate) exhibit HDAC inhibitory activity we investigated their effects as SERDs in MCF-7 and T47D cells expressing wild-type and mutant ERα-D538G and ERα-Y537S. The SCFAs exhibited SERD-like activity in both cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant ERα. The results for propionate and butyrate correlated with parallel induction of histone acetylation and this was also observed for the HDAC inhibitors Panobinostat, Vorinostat and Entinostat which also downregulated wild-type and mutant ERα and induced histone acetylation. Although acetate induced ERα degradation the mechanisms may be independent of the HDAC inhibitory activity of this compound. These results suggest that high fibre diets that induce formation of SCFAs may have some clinical efficacy for treating ER-positive endocrine resistant breast cancer patients and this is currently being investigated.",0,2411
1245,35971370,Alterations of Regional Homogeneity in Parkinson's Disease: A Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Study.,"Objective The objective of this study is to investigate the regional homogeneity (ReHo) of spontaneous brain activities in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Methods In total, 20 PD patients and 20 matched normal controls (NCs) participants were recruited for this study. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging on a 3T MRI system was used to investigate local brain activity. We examined activity in two frequency bands, slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (0.010-0.027 Hz). Two-sample t-tests were used to determine the between-group differences in the ReHo data. Pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the relationships between the ReHo values and clinical indices in PD patients. Results Compared with NCs, PD patients showed decreased ReHo values in the right middle occipital gyrus, right cuneus, and left superior occipital gyrus, and increased ReHo values in the right middle frontal gyrus in slow-4. PD patients showed decreased ReHo values in the right calcarine, left calcarine, and right precentral gyrus compared with NCs in slow-5. Correlation analysis showed that disease duration was negatively correlated with ReHo values in the right precentral gyrus in PD patients. Conclusions These results indicate that several brain regions were altered in PD patients. The regions are associated with the visual network-related cortex, motor cortex, and default mode network. The findings provide new insights into the neuropathophysiology of PD.",0,2412
1834,35967806,Betulinic acid increases lifespan and stress resistance via insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"Numerous studies reported that betulinic acid (BA), a natural product extracted from birch bark, exhibited various beneficial effects in vitro. However, its pharmacological activities in aging are rarely understood. In this study, Caenorhabditis elegans was deployed as a whole animal model to investigate the impacts of BA on lifespan and stress resistance. Wild-type C. elegans were fed in the presence or absence of BA and tested for a series of phenotypes, including longevity, mobility, reproductive capacity, pharyngeal pumping, heat stress, and oxidative stress. BA at the optimal dose (50 μg/mL) extended the lifespan, improved the healthspan, and significantly evoked the increased oxidative stress resistance in C. elegans. Incorporating the genetic analysis with different types of longevity mutants, DAF-16, the downstream effector of the Insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling, was revealed to mediate the protective effects of BA on lifespan and antioxidant activity. Together, these data showcased the potential of BA in promoting healthy aging, which shall facilitate its further development in the food and pharmaceutical industries.",0,2413

129,35983278,Recent Advances in Molecular Diagnosis of Pulmonary Fibrosis for Precision Medicine.,"Pulmonary fibrosis is a serious, progressive lung disease characterized by scarring and stiffening lung tissues, affecting the respiratory system and leading to organ failure. It is a complex disease consisting of alveolar damage, chronic inflammation, and a varying degree of lung fibrosis. Significant challenges with pulmonary fibrosis include the lack of effective means to diagnose the disease at early stages, identify patients at higher risks of progress, and assess disease progression and treatment response. Precision medicine powered by accurate molecular profiling and phenotyping could significantly improve our understanding of the disease's heterogeneity, potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, and molecular targets for treatment development. This Review discusses various translational model systems, including organoids and lung-on-a-chip systems, biomarkers in single cells and extracellular vesicles, and functional pharmacodynamic markers. We also highlight emerging sensing technologies for molecular characterization of pulmonary fibrosis and biomarker detection.",0,2415
716,35975176,Comprehensive Analysis of Genomic and Expression Data Identified Potential Markers for Predicting Prognosis and Immune Response in CRC.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most prevalent type of malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. In the current study, we characterized the landscape of genomic alterations in CRC patients. Based on the results of whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified 31 significantly mutated genes. Among them, several genes including TP53, KRAS, APC, PI3KCA, and BRAF were reported as significantly mutated genes in previous studies. In the current study, the most frequently mutated gene was TP53, which encodes tumor suppressor p53, affecting approximately 60% of CRC patients. In addition, we performed the expression profiles of significantly mutated genes between the normal group and tumor groups and identified 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs); among them, CSMD3, DCHS2, LRP2, RYR2, and ZFHX4 were significantly negatively correlated with PFS. Moreover, consensus clustering analysis for CRC based on the expression of significantly somatic mutated genes was performed. In total, three subtypes of CRC were identified in CRC, including cluster1 (n = 453), cluster2 (n = 158), and cluster 3 (n = 9), based on expression level of significantly somatic mutated genes. Clinicopathological features analysis showed subtype C1 had the longest progression-free survival (PFS) with median time of 8.2 years, while subtypes C2 and C3 had 4.1 and 2.7 years of PFS, respectively. Moreover, we found three subtypes related to tumor infiltration depth, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. Immune infiltration analysis showed the tumor infiltration levels of B cell native, T cell CD8+, T cell CD4+ memory activated, T cell gamma delta, NK cell resting, macrophage M0, macrophage M2, myeloid dendritic cell activated, mast cell activated, and mast cell resting significantly changed among the three groups, demonstrating the three subgroups classified by 22 somatically significantly mutated genes had a high capacity to differentiate patients with different immune statuses, which is helpful for the prediction of immunotherapy response of CRC patients. Our findings could provide novel potential predictive indicators for CRC prognosis and therapy targets for CRC immunotherapy.",0,2416
442,35979060,Arterial Spin Labeling Imaging Characteristics of Anti-leucine-rich Glioma-Inactivated 1 Encephalitis: A Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis.,"Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a rare group of diseases that can present with stroke-like symptoms. Anti-leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis is an AE subtype that is infrequently associated with neoplasms and highly responsive to prompt immunotherapy treatment. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of LGI1 AE is essential in timely patient management. Neuroimaging plays a critical role in evaluating stroke and stroke mimics such as AE. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) is an MRI perfusion modality that measures cerebral blood flow (CBF) and is increasingly used in everyday clinical practice for stroke and stroke mimic assessment as a non-contrast sequence. Our goal in this preliminary study is to demonstrate the added value of ASL in detecting LGI1 AE for prompt diagnosis and treatment. In this retrospective single center study, we identified six patients with seropositive LGI1 AE who underwent baseline MRI with single delay 3D pseudocontinuous ASL (pCASL), including five males and one female between ages 28 and 76 years, with mean age of 55 years. Two neuroradiologists qualitatively interpreted the ASL images by visual inspection of CBF using a two-point scale (increased, decreased) when compared to both the ipsilateral and contralateral unaffected temporal and non-temporal cortex. The primary measures on baseline ASL evaluation were a) presence of ASL signal abnormality, b) if present, signal characterization based on the two-point scale, c) territorial vascular distribution, d) localization, and e) laterality. Quantitative assessment was also performed on postprocessed pCASL cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps. The obtained CBF values were then compared between the affected temporal cortex and each of the unaffected ipsilateral parietal, contralateral temporal, and contralateral parietal cortices. On consensus qualitative assessment, all six patients demonstrated ASL hyperperfusion and corresponding FLAIR hyperintensity in the hippocampus and/or amygdala in a non-territorial distribution (6/6, 100%). The ASL hyperperfusion was found in the right hippocampus or amygdala in 5/6 (83%) of cases. Four of the six patients underwent initial follow-up imaging where all four showed resolution of the initial ASL hyperperfusion. In the same study on structural imaging, all four patients were also diagnosed with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Quantitative assessment was separately performed and demonstrated markedly increased CBF values in the affected temporal cortex (mean, 111.2 ml/min/100 g) compared to the unaffected ipsilateral parietal cortex (mean, 49 ml/min/100 g), contralateral temporal cortex (mean, 58.2 ml/min/100 g), and contralateral parietal cortex (mean, 52.2 ml/min/100 g). In this preliminary study of six patients, we demonstrate an ASL hyperperfusion pattern, with a possible predilection for the right mesial temporal lobe on both qualitative and quantitative assessments in patients with seropositive LGI1. Larger scale studies are necessary to further characterize the strength of these associations.",0,2417
1512,35968374,Cerebellum regulating cerebral functional cortex through multiple pathways in complete thoracolumbar spinal cord injury.,"The previous studies have found significant brain structural and functional changes in cerebral regions after spinal cord injury (SCI), but few studies have explored the cerebellar-cerebral circuit changes in SCI. This study aims to study the brain structural changes of cerebellar subregions and its functional connectivity (FC) changes with cerebrum in complete thoracolumbar SCI (CTSCI), and screen out the regions that play relatively important roles in affecting sensorimotor function. Eighteen CTSCI patients and 18 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to characterize the brain structural changes of cerebellar subregions [from the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL116)], seed-based FC was used to evaluate the cerebellar-cerebral FC changes and support vector machine (SVM) analysis was used to search for sensitive imaging indicators. CTSCI patients showed slightly structural atrophy in vermis_3 (p = 0.046) and significantly decreased FC between cerebellum and cerebral sensorimotor-, visual-, cognitive-, and auditory-related regions (cluster-level FWE correction with p < 0.05). Additionally, SVM weight analysis showed that FC values between vermis_10 and right fusiform gyrus had the greatest weight in functional changes of CTSCI. In conclusion, different degrees of structural and functional changes occurred in each subregion of cerebellum following CTSCI, and FC change between vermis_10 and right fusiform gyrus plays the most important role in dysfunction and may become an important neural network index of rehabilitation therapy.",0,2418
1719,35968025,"Variations in the fecal microbiota and their functions of Thoroughbred, Mongolian, and Hybrid horses.","The horse gut is colonized by a rich and complex microbial community that has important roles in horse physiology, metabolism, nutrition, and immune functions. Fewer across-breed variations in horse gut microbial diversity have been illustrated. In this article, the gut microbiota of Thoroughbred, Mongolian, and Hybrid horses [first filial generation (F1) of Mongolian (maternal) and Thoroughbred (paternal)] were studied by second-generation high-throughput sequencing technology. Differences in gut microbiota composition and function between breeds were determined using diversity and functional prediction analysis. The alpha diversity analysis showed that Thoroughbred horses had a more abundant and diverse gut microbiota, while the diversity of gut microbiota in Hybrid horses was intermediate between Thoroughbred and Mongolian horses. Subsequent cluster analysis showed that Hybrid horses have a microbiota composition more similar to Mongolian horses. LEfSe analysis revealed that the bacterial biomarkers for Thoroughbred horses at the family level were Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, Fibrobacteraceae, p_251_o5, Lactobacillaceae, and uncultured_bacterium_o_WCHB1_41; the bacterial biomarker for Mongolian horses was Planococcaceae; and the bacterial biomarkers for Hybrid horses were Moraxellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Ruminococcaceae. The functional prediction results indicated that the metabolic pathways differ significantly between the breeds. Regarding metabolism, the Hybrid horses had the lowest proportion of the carbohydrate metabolic pathways, while the energy metabolic pathway had the highest proportion. The abundance ratios of the remaining eight metabolic pathways in Hybrid horses were between Thoroughbred and Mongolian horses. In conclusion, the results of this study showed an association between horse breeds and gut microbiota.",0,2419
1721,35968023,Case Report: Congenital tuberculosis in an aborted dromedary camel fetus.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious public health problem worldwide, especially in tropical developing countries. Nevertheless, reports on congenital TB in humans and animals are extremely rare. In this study, abortion was reported in an 8-year-old she-camel at the 9th month of gestation. The she-camel appeared healthy in clinical examination, had a good body condition score, normal appetite, and had no signs of respiratory disease and fever. The expelled placenta was dark red-colored, thickened, and edematous with multifocal to coalescing ecchymotic hemorrhages on the allantoic surface. The striking finding was multiple, white-yellow, solid nodular lesions in the fetal lung, the pleura, and the liver. On histopathology, typical granulomatous lesions were detected in the lung and the liver characterized by caseous necrosis surrounded by lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration and concentric layers of fibrosis. The Ziehl-Neelsen staining detected scarce acid-fast bacilli in lung and liver tissues. The DNA extracted from tubercular lesions from the lung and liver showed amplification of the IS6110 region of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex by PCR. The sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed a close association of these sequences with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The she-camel was detected positive for a single intradermal tuberculin test performed 24 h after abortion. This is the first report on congenital TB caused by M. tuberculosis in a dromedary camel fetus with a possible vertical transmission.",0,2420
678,35975534,MicroRNA-21-5p Regulates CD3+T Lymphocytes Through VCL and LTF in Patients with Immune Thrombocytopenia.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune hemorrhagic disease with distinct clinical manifestations such as extensive skin petechiae, mucosal bleeding, and even visceral hemorrhage. In this study, CD3+T lymphocytes from ITP patients were screened for differentially expressed genes. The expression of miR-21 and miR-155 in T lymphocytes of ITP patients were investigated. The downstream target genes of miR-21 and miR-155 were also searched for the correlation between differentially expressed genes of ITP. Differential gene screening was performed using the GSE43177 data set in the GEO database, and the expression of miR-21 and miR-155 in T lymphocytes of ITP patients was verified by qPCR. The interaction network of core downstream target genes and ITP differentially expressed genes of miR-21 and miR-155 were constructed with the STRING database, and the associated factors were verified by qPCR. In ITP patients, the expression of CD8+T lymphocytes increased, the expression of CD4+T lymphocytes decreased, and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+T cells decreased. Fourteen genes were differentially expressed in CD3+T lymphocytes, all of which were upregulated, and the expression of S100A8 was increased in ITP patients. The expression of miR-21-5p and miR-155-5p increased in CD3+T lymphocytes of initial ITP patients. The core down-stream target gene VCL of miR-21 was associated with the differentially expressed genes such as LTF, LCN2, and DEFA4 in the interaction network. VCL expression was decreased and LTF expression was increased in ITP patients. S100A8 plays an important role in the regulation of CD3+T lymphocytes in ITP patients. MiR-21-5p regulates the differentially expressed gene LTF by inhibiting the core downstream target gene VCL and participates in the immune mechanism of T lymphocytes in ITP patients. MiR-155-5p is also involved in the immunoregulatory mechanism of T lymphocytes in ITP patients.",0,2421
1599,35968285,Serum microRNA-4297 is a sex-specific predictive biomarker of glioma grade and prognosis.,"Gliomas account for nearly 80% of brain cancers, tending to occur more frequently in men with adverse outcomes. Emerging microRNAs have been positioned as promising predictors for glioma's histological grade and prognosis. However, there have been few studies concerning the sex-biased impacts on the clinical approach for the potential microRNA-4297 (miR-4297). We utilized GSE139031micro-RNAs profiling to analyze serum miR-4297 expression in glioma. A total of 114 newly diagnosed glioma patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University from January 2017 to February 2021 were recruited and prospectively followed up. The association of miR-4297 levels with glioma grade and prognosis was investigated. Luciferase reporter gene assays and genotype analyses were carried out to explore the potential mechanism of sexually dimorphic miR-4297 in glioma. Serum miR-4297 levels were notably down-regulated in glioma. Besides, serum miR-4297 levels were positively associated with the high grades, which were exclusively present for females. The positive correlations of miR-4297 with O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) protein and mean platelet volume were also observed in females. IDH-mutant females had decreased miR-4297. Median PFS time for females with miR-4297 ≥ 1.392 was distinctly shorter than those with miR-4297 <1.392 (12.3 months vs. 42.89 months, p = 0.0289). Based on multivariate logistic regression, miR-4297-based equation model was established as FHGRS. AU-ROC analysis revealed FHGRS exhibited a robust performance in predicting high-grade glioma in females (p < 0.001), whereas there was no such relationship in males. Furthermore, the MGMT-3'UTR variant rs7896488 in the specific binding region of miR-4297 was correlated with prognosis. Our study uncovers sex-dependent characterization of serum miR-4297 in predicting glioma grade and the relapse risk for female patients, which underscores the clinical benefits of sex-specific analysis in non-coding RNA research.",0,2422
1491,35968397,Continuous positive airway pressure therapy suppresses inflammatory cytokines and improves glucocorticoid responsiveness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and asthma: A case-control study.,"Asthma and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are prevalent respiratory disorders that frequently coexist. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the standard treatment for OSA. However, its effects on systemic inflammation and glucocorticoid responsiveness in OSA patients with asthma are largely unknown. To examine the potential role of CPAP therapy in reducing systemic inflammation and improving glucocorticoid responsiveness in asthmatic patients with OSA. A case-control study was conducted at the respiratory and sleep clinics involving patients with OSA and patients with asthma and OSA. The levels of inflammatory asthma biomarkers (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-17A, IL-8, IL-2, and interferon-γ [IFN-γ]), and glucocorticoid receptors (GR)-α and GR-β, were determined to compare systemic inflammation and glucocorticoid responsiveness between pre- and post-1-month CPAP treatment in both groups. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare inflammatory biomarkers before and after CPAP therapy. P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The analysis was performed using SPSS. Recruited patients (n = 47), 51% (n = 24) had OSA and 49% (n = 23), had OSA with asthma. Interestingly, the blood levels of IL-17 and IL-8 were significantly decreased post-CPAP therapy in OSA patients, whereas IL-4, IL-17, and IFN-γ were significantly reduced post-CPAP treatment in OSA patients with asthma. Remarkably, CPAP therapy improved glucocorticoid responsiveness in asthmatic patients with OSA, but not in the OSA group and an increase in the GR-α/GR-β ratio was noted post-CPAP therapy. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy improved responsiveness to glucocorticoid treatment and demonstrated a suppressive effect on proinflammatory cytokines in asthmatics with OSA.",0,2423
2491,35966762,Breaking the aging epigenetic barrier.,"Aging is an inexorable event occurring universally for all organisms characterized by the progressive loss of cell function. However, less is known about the key events occurring inside the nucleus in the process of aging. The advent of chromosome capture techniques and extensive modern sequencing technologies have illuminated a rather dynamic structure of chromatin inside the nucleus. As cells advance along their life cycle, chromatin condensation states alter which leads to a different epigenetic landscape, correlated with modified gene expression. The exact factors mediating these changes in the chromatin structure and function remain elusive in the context of aging cells. The accumulation of DNA damage, reactive oxygen species and loss of genomic integrity as cells cease to divide can contribute to a tumor stimulating environment. In this review, we focus on genomic and epigenomic changes occurring in an aged cell which can contribute to age-related tumor formation.",0,2424
17,35985181,Hypericin and its anticancer effects: From mechanism of action to potential therapeutic application.,"Emerging studies indicate that hypericin has diverse pharmacological actions and exhibits potential for treatment of various types of cancer. The current review evaluates the pharmacological activity, associated molecular mechanism, and therapeutic application of hypericin as an anticancer agent according to the most recent state of knowledge with special emphasis on clinical trials and safety profile. This review follows The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews criteria. Various databases, including PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct, were used to search and collect relevant literature. The major keywords used included the following: cancer, distribution, property, signaling pathway, pharmacological effect, treatment, prevention, in vitro and in vivo studies, toxicity, bioavailability, and clinical trials. One hundred three articles met the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Hypericin has shown anticancer activity against the expansion of several cell types including breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, stomach carcinoma, leukemia, lung cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma cancer. Hypericin exerts its anticancer activity by inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediators, endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and mitochondrial thioredoxin. It has also been shown to cause an increase in the levels of caspase-3 and caspase-4, arrest the cell cycle at metaphase leading to cancer cell apoptosis, and affect various protein and gene expression patterns. Hypericin exhibits significant inhibitory activity against various types of in vitro and in vivo cancer models. However, well-designed, high quality, large-scale and multi-center randomized clinical studies are required to establish the safety and clinical utility of hypericin in cancer patients.",0,2425
1564,35968322,Dual role of ERK2/NF-κB signaling in TRAIL sensitivity.,"Targeting tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) signaling is a promising approach in cancer treatment. Although ERK and/or NF-κB signaling is involved in the expression of TRAIL receptors (TRAIL-R), the exact underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we evaluated the role of ERK2 and NF-κB in the cytotoxicity of TRAIL during cisplatin treatment. Cisplatin treatment of neuroepithelioma cells (SK-N-MC) significantly induced ERK2 activation and increased TRAIL cytotoxicity via the upregulation of death receptor 5 (DR5) expression. In partial ERK2 knockdown cell lines that maintained only basal levels of ERK2 activity, cisplatin treatment did not increase ERK2 activity or DR5 expression. These findings indicate that induced (rather than basal) ERK2 activity enhances TRAIL susceptibility via DR5 expression. In complete ERK2 knockdown cell lines with no basal ERK2 activity, DR4, DR5, and DcRs expression levels were increased, and additional treatment with cisplatin did not further increase TRAIL-R expression. Chemical inhibition of ERK2 also enhanced TRAIL cytotoxicity by upregulating DR4 and DR5 expression. These findings indicate that basal ERK2 activity suppresses TRAIL-R expression. Both basal and inducible ERK2 activities regulate TRAIL-R expression via the NF-κB signaling pathway. Overall, our findings suggest that the ERK2/NF-κB signaling pathway has a dual role in TRAIL susceptibility by differentially regulating TRAIL-R expression in the same cellular system.",0,2426
679,35975533,Double Filtration Plasmapheresis (DFPP) in Severe Hypertriglyceridemia Patients - a Pilot Study.,"Severe hypertriglyceridemia (sHTG) is an independent risk factor of atherosclerotic heart disease (ASHD) and acute pancreatitis (AP). The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DFPP in sHTG patients (TG > 1,000 mg/dL). This was a prospective single-center study in which patients with severe symptomatic drug and diet refractory HTG were recruited. Peripheral venous access of upper extremities was used for DFPP. Blood flow rate was 100 - 120 mL/min and plasma separation rate was 800 - 1,000 mL/h. Plasma volume to treat in each case was calculated with the Kaplan formula. Anticoagulation was achieved by low molecular weight heparin. Treatment goal was triglyceride level decreased to normal (< 1.7 mmol/L). Epidemiological data, lipid, hematological parameters as well as side effects were evaluated before and after DFPP. Seven patients (6 males and 1 female) were consecutively enrolled to this trial. There was diabetes mellitus type 2 in four patients and obesity-associated nephropathy in one patient. The mean age was 42.5 years. The average TG level before plasmapheresis was 17.41 mmol/L (range 10.93 - 26.33 mmol/L). After one session, the levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL-c, HDL-c decreased significantly by 58.3%, 43.2%, 41.9%, 20.7%, respectively. The mean number of treatment sessions was 1.5 (range 1 - 3). DFPP was well-tolerated. Except for transient decrease of albumin, globulin and fibrinogen, liver and renal functions, hematological parameters did not change significantly. According to our own experience, DFPP may be used safely and effectively in sHTG patients at risk of acute coronary events and AP. However, further randomized controlled trials are necessary to explore the long-term effect.",0,2427
1351,35969696,Silybum marianum seed extract supplementation positively affects the body weight of weaned piglets by improving voluntary feed intake.,"This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation of Silybum marianum seed (SMS) extract on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal noxious gas emission, and hematology parameters in weaned piglets. A total of 120, 21-day-old weaned piglets ([Yorkshire × Landrace] × Duroc) were randomly assigned to 3 groups based on the average initial body weight (6.46 ± 0.45 kg). There were 8 replicate pens per treatment and 5 pigs (mixed sex) per pen. The experimental period was 42 days. Dietary groups included a basal diet, and a basal diet supplemented with 0.05% or 0.10% SMS extract. Feeding weaned piglets with SMS extract containing diet significantly increased average daily gain and average daily feed intake. Additionally, the supplementation of SMS extract had no significant effects on nutrient digestibility, serum hematology, and fecal noxious gas emission parameters. We considered that the supplementation of SMS extract had positive effects on the voluntary feed intake in weaned piglets, thus improving growth performance.",0,2428
1571,35968315,Insulin resistance is associated with an unfavorable outcome among non-diabetic patients with isolated moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury - A propensity score-matched study.,"Hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor for the poor prognosis in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), and stress-induced impaired insulin function is the major factor of hyperglycemia in non-diabetic patients with TBI. Several types of research suggested that insulin resistance (IR) is related to the poor prognosis of neurocritical ill patients; here we focused on the role of IR in non-diabetic patients after TBI. We performed a prospective observational study with the approval of the Ethics Committee of our institute. IR was accessed via the update Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA2) of IR, a computer-calculated index by glucose and insulin level. HOMA2 ≥ 1.4 was considered as the threshold of IR according to the previous studies. The glycemic variability (GV) indices were calculated by fingertip blood glucose concentration at an interval of 2 h within 24 h to explore the relationship between IR and GV. The outcome was the 6-month neurological outcome evaluated with the Glasgow outcome scale. A total of 85 patients with isolated moderate-to-severe TBI (admission GCS ≤ 12) were finally included in our study, 34 (40%) were diagnosed with IR with HOMA2 ≥ 1.4. After propensity score matching (PSM), 22 patients in IR group were matched to 34 patients in non-IR group. Patients with IR suffered increased systemic glycemic variation after isolated moderate-to-severe TBI. IR was a significant factor for the poor prognosis after TBI (OR = 3.25, 95% CI 1.03-10.31, p = 0.041). The IR estimated by HOMA2 was associated with greater GV and an unfavorable outcome after isolated moderate-to-severe TBI. Ameliorating impaired insulin sensitivity may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the management of TBI patients.",0,2429
2190,35967328,"Multiplex protein profiling of bronchial aspirates reveals disease-, mortality- and respiratory sequelae-associated signatures in critically ill patients with ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bronchial aspirates (BAS) obtained during invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) constitutes a useful tool for molecular phenotyping and decision making. To identify the proteomic determinants associated with disease pathogenesis, all-cause mortality and respiratory sequelae in BAS samples from critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS. Multicenter study including 74 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS. BAS were obtained by bronchoaspiration after IMV initiation. Three hundred sixty-four proteins were quantified using proximity extension assay (PEA) technology. Random forest models were used to assess predictor importance. After adjusting for confounding factors, CST5, NADK, SRPK2 and TGF-α were differentially detected in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. In random forest models for COVID-19, CST5, DPP7, NADK, KYAT1 and TYMP showed the highest variable importance. In COVID-19 patients, reduced levels of ENTPD2 and PTN were observed in nonsurvivors of ICU stay, even after adjustment. AGR2, NQO2, IL-1α, OSM and TRAIL showed the strongest associations with in-ICU mortality and were used to construct a protein-based prediction model. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a clear separation in mortality risk between subgroups of PTN, ENTPD2 and the prediction model. Cox regression models supported these findings. In survivors, the levels of FCRL1, NTF4 and THOP1 in BAS samples obtained during the ICU stay correlated with lung function (i.e., DLCO levels) 3 months after hospital discharge. Similarly, Flt3L and THOP1 levels were correlated with radiological features (i.e., TSS). These proteins are expressed in immune and nonimmune lung cells. Poor host response to viral infectivity and an inappropriate reparative mechanism seem to be linked with the pathogenesis of the disease and fatal outcomes, respectively. BAS proteomics identified novel factors associated with the pathology of SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS and its adverse outcomes. BAS-based protein testing emerges as a novel tool for risk assessment in the ICU.",0,2430
559,35978575,Gene Expression Analysis in Stem Cell-derived Cortical Neuronal Cultures Using Multi-well SYBR Green Quantitative PCR Arrays.,"To optimize differentiation protocols for stem cell-based in vitro modeling applications, it is essential to assess the change in gene expression during the differentiation process. This allows controlling its differentiation efficiency into the target cell types. While RNA transcriptomics provides detail at a larger scale, timing and cost are prohibitive to include such analyses in the optimization process. In contrast, expression analysis of individual genes is cumbersome and lengthy. Here, we developed a versatile and cost-efficient SYBR Green array of 27 markers along with two housekeeping genes to quickly screen for differentiation efficiency of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into excitatory cortical neurons. We first identified relevant pluripotency, neuroprogenitor, and neuronal markers for the array by literature search, and designed primers with a product size of 80-120 bp length, an annealing temperature of 60°C, and minimal predicted secondary structures. We spotted combined forward and reverse primers on 96-well plates and dried them out overnight. These plates can be prepared in advance in batches and stored at room temperature until use. Next, we added the SYBR Green master mix and complementary DNA (cDNA) to the plate in triplicates, ran quantitative PCR (qPCR) on a Quantstudio 6 Flex, and analyzed results with QuantStudio software. We compared the expression of genes for pluripotency, neuroprogenitor cells, cortical neurons, and synaptic markers in a 96-well format at four different time points during the cortical differentiation. We found a sharp reduction of pluripotency genes within the first three days of pre-differentiation and a steady increase of neuronal markers and synaptic markers over time. In summary, we built a gene expression array that is customizable, fast, medium-throughput, and cost-efficient, ideally suited for optimization of differentiation protocols for stem cell-based in vitro modeling.",0,2431
1793,35967862,Lenalidomide potentially reduced the level of cell- associated HIV RNA and improved persistent inflammation in patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis a pilot study.,"The HIV-1 reservoir is a major barrier to curative strategies. Inflammation is an important factor for HIV-1 reservoir persistence. Lenalidomide regulates inflammatory cytokines efficiently. We examined whether lenalidomide could inhibit HIV-1 transcription and reduce systemic inflammation in people living with HIV. Lenalidomide was administered orally for 48 weeks to patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis (HIV-CM). A HIV-1 latency model was treated with or without lenalidomide ex vivo for 5 days. The primary endpoints were change in HIV reservoir markers and inflammatory cytokines in both the cohort and cell model. Thirteen participants were enrolled from May 2019 to September 2020. The median change in cell-associated (CA) HIV RNA between baseline and 48 weeks was 0.81 log10 copies/million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The CA HIV RNA decreased significantly in the cohort (P = 0.021). Serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) gradually diminished with lenalidomide treatment until 48 weeks (P = 0.007, P = 0.014, respectively). C-reactive protein/IL-6/TNF-α and CA HIV RNA were significantly correlated (P = 0.0027, 0.0496, and 0.0346, respectively). Lenalidomide also significantly decreased HIV core P24 (P = 0.0038) and CA HIV RNA in CD8-depleted PBMCs (P = 0.0178) ex vivo. TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly reduced in the CD8-depleted PBMC supernatant (P = 0.004, P < 0.0001, respectively) while IL-10 levels increased significantly on lenalidomide compared to no-lenalidomide treatment (P < 0.0001). Lenalidomide was preliminarily confirmed to reduce the level of cell- associated HIV RNA and improve persistent inflammation in patients with HIV-Associated cryptococcal meningitis, which was a potential intervention for clinical use to inhibit viral transcription of the HIV-1 reservoir and reduced HIV-related inflammation in HIV-1 patients during ART.",0,2432
2115,35967403,Bacterial subversion of NLR-mediated immune responses.,"Members of the mammalian Nod-like receptor (NLR) protein family are important intracellular sensors for bacteria. Bacteria have evolved under the pressure of detection by host immune sensing systems, leading to adaptive subversion strategies to dampen immune responses for their benefits. These include modification of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), interception of innate immune pathways by secreted effector proteins and sophisticated instruction of anti-inflammatory adaptive immune responses. Here, we summarise our current understanding of subversion strategies used by bacterial pathogens to manipulate NLR-mediated responses, focusing on the well-studied members NOD1/2, and the inflammasome forming NLRs NLRC4, and NLRP3. We discuss how bacterial pathogens and their products activate these NLRs to promote inflammation and disease and the range of mechanisms used by bacterial pathogens to evade detection by NLRs and to block or dampen NLR activation to ultimately interfere with the generation of host immunity. Moreover, we discuss how bacteria utilise NLRs to facilitate immunotolerance and persistence in the host and outline how various mechanisms used to attenuate innate immune responses towards bacterial pathogens can also aid the host by reducing immunopathologies. Finally, we describe the therapeutic potential of harnessing immune subversion strategies used by bacteria to treat chronic inflammatory conditions.",0,2433
927,35974763,Mesoporous sodium four-coordinate aluminosilicate nanoparticles modulate dendritic cell pyroptosis and activate innate and adaptive immunity.,"Pyroptosis is a programmed cell death widely studied in cancer cells for tumour inhibition, but rarely in dendritic cell (DC) activation for vaccine development. Here, we report the synthesis of sodium stabilized mesoporous aluminosilicate nanoparticles as DC pyroptosis modulators and antigen carriers. By surface modification of sodium-stabilized four-coordinate aluminium species on dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles, the resultant Na-IVAl-DMSN significantly activated DC through caspase-1 dependent pyroptosis via pH responsive intracellular ion exchange. The released proinflammatory cellular contents further mediated DC hyperactivation with prolonged cytokine release. In vivo studies showed that Na-IVAl-DMSN induced enhanced cellular immunity mediated by natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T cells, and memory T cells as well as humoral immune response. Our results provide a new principle for the design of next-generation nanoadjuvants for vaccine applications.",0,2434
2427,35966869,Protease-activated receptor-2: Role in asthma pathogenesis and utility as a biomarker of disease severity.,"PAR2, a receptor activated by serine proteases, has primarily pro-inflammatory roles in the airways and may play a role in asthma pathogenesis. PAR2 exerts its effects in the lungs through activation of a variety of airway cells, but also activation of circulating immune cells. There is evidence that PAR2 expression increases in asthma and other inflammatory diseases, although the regulation of PAR2 expression is not fully understood. Here we review the available literature on the potential role of PAR2 in asthma pathogenesis and propose a model of PAR2-mediated development of allergic sensitization. We also propose, based on our previous work, that PAR2 expression on peripheral blood monocyte subsets has the potential to serve as a biomarker of asthma severity and/or control.",0,2435
450,35978940,Inflammatory and autoimmune predictive markers of response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in NSCLC and melanoma.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are a standard in cancer therapy, but few patients respond to the treatment. The aim of the present study was the determination of immunological markers for monitoring response to ICI. The present study included 74 patients receiving ICI in subsequent [group 1; non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)] and first-line setting (group 2; melanoma) and 30 patients with NSCLC receiving first-line chemotherapy. In groups 1 and 2 β-2 microglobulin (B2-MG), neopterin (NPT), IL-6, IL-18, HLA-DRB1 and autoantibodies were assessed after two months of ICI, and before the start of next administration in group 3. In group 1 low level of B2-MG (P<0.0001), NPT (P<0.0001), IL-6 (P<0.0001), IL-18 (P=0.0003), HLA-DRB1*03 (P=0.016) and anti-TPO antibodies (P=0.016) were associated with response >six months. In group 2 high level of B2-MG (P=0.0001), NPT (P=0.0016), IL-6 (P=0.013) and IL-18 (P=0.032) were associated with early disease progression (<six months). Univariate analysis demonstrated that immune-related adverse events were predictive marker of prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in group 1 (P=0.038) and 2 (P=0.020). Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ≥5 before immunotherapy was correlated with shorter PFS in melanoma in multivariate analysis (P=0.007). B2-MG ≥2.5 mg/ml (P=0.006) and NPT ≥12 nmol/l (P=0.027) were predictors of shorter PFS in group 1. B2-MG ≥2.5 mg/ml was predictor of shorter PFS (P=0.008) in group 2. In group 1 levels of B2-MG, NPT, IL-6 and IL-18 were higher than in group 3. In summary, immunological markers are promising predictive markers for immunotherapy; however, it requires further prospective studies.",0,2436
157,35983169,Using human iPSC-derived kidney organoids to decipher SARS-CoV-2 pathology on single cell level.,"We describe a protocol for single-cell RNA sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-infected human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived kidney organoids. After inoculation of kidney organoids with virus, we use mechanical and enzymatic disruption to obtain single cell suspensions. Next, we process the organoid-derived cells into sequencing-ready SARS-CoV-2-targeted libraries. Subsequent sequencing analysis reveals changes in kidney cells after virus infection. The protocol was designed for kidney organoids cultured in a 6-well transwell format but can be adapted to organoids with different organ backgrounds.

526,35978733,Long-Term Effects of Radiation on Lymphocytes and Risk of Opportunistic Infections.,"Objectives Lymphocytes are very sensitive to ionizing radiation. The long-term effects and the risk of permanent immune compromise are not well defined in spite of more than a century of therapeutic radiation. The contemporary analysis is made more difficult in that most patients also receive immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Methods Cohort-all patients that underwent a prostate biopsy from 2002 to 2007. Those (n=1118) with at least two blood counts, with one at a minimum of 10 years after biopsy, were included. We identified three groups: those that received no treatment (due to benign biopsy findings or active surveillance), those undergoing prostate cancer surgery, and those undergoing radiation therapy. Blood counts were collected and analyzed for differences with a median follow-up of 178 months. Also evaluated was the risk of opportunistic infections. Results The median granulocyte count gradually increased with time, with no difference between the groups. Overall, the median lymphocyte count decreased from baseline over time (with a slight rise at 20 years). For the no treatment and surgery groups, the lymphocyte counts declined, but due to the initial decline after radiation therapy, that group saw a slow improvement. By 20 years, there was no difference between the groups. Most patients' counts remained in the normal range throughout. The risk of defined opportunistic infections was low (12%) with no difference between the groups. Conclusion Pelvic radiation has minimal lasting effects on lymphocyte and granulocyte counts. In addition, patients receiving radiation do not appear to be significantly immunocompromised.",0,2438
1610,35968274,Tension-type headache and low back pain reconsidered.,"The natural history and clinical course of tension-type headache and non-specific low back pain are reconsidered. By closer examination, these two conditions appear to share several specific clinical features. Both are muscular pain conditions along the spine, they have a preponderance in women, they may occur spontaneously or follow a trivial traumatic incident, and they both have a high risk of chronicity. The affected muscles are tender with tender points. EMG indicates diffuse hyperactivity and abnormal activation pattern, and motor control of the affected muscles and adjacent muscle groups is discoordinated. These shared features suggest analogous pathophysiology involving the neuromotor control of affected and adjacent muscle groups in the cervical and lumbar regions, respectively. As recently suggested for the whiplash disease, we suggest the term spinal dyssynergia for this specific pattern of pathology. This suggestion provides a new perspective for the understanding of these diseases by placing their cause within the central nervous system and not in the spine or spinal musculature. This perspective warrants further clinical, neurophysiological, and neuropharmacological studies of this 'family' of common yet poorly understood clinical muscular pain conditions along the spine.",0,2439
45,35983568,Successful simultaneous targeting of IgE and IL-5 in a severe asthmatic patient selected for lung transplantation.,"We report a case of severe uncontrolled allergic and eosinophilic asthma in which omalizumab had led to a fast remission. After 18 months, mepolizumab was added to omalizumab because of increased blood eosinophils and a deterioration of asthma control. Asthma was then under control for the next 18 months. Discontinuation of mepolizumab in the ensuing 6 months led to a decrease in asthma control and an increased eosinophilia. The introduction of benralizumab resulted in an immediate increase of lung function, asthma control test (ACT), and symptom relief. Before the introduction of biologics, the patient was on the list for transplantation due to respiratory insufficiency. High-resolution CT scans before and after biologic therapy demonstrated a reduction of bronchial wall thickening and mucous plugging as well as an increase in bronchial caliber. The patient did therefore not need a transplant. We conclude that the dual use of biologics may be efficient in some cases of severe asthma.",0,2440
2090,35967428,Impaired antigen-specific B-cell responses after Influenza vaccination in kidney transplant recipients receiving co-stimulation blockade with Belatacept.,"Emerging data suggest that costimulation blockade with belatacept effectively controls humoral alloimmune responses. However, whether this effect may be deleterious for protective anti-infectious immunity remains poorly understood. We performed a mechanistic exploratory study in 23 kidney transplant recipients receiving either the calcineurin-inhibitor tacrolimus (Tac, n=14) or belatacept (n=9) evaluating different cellular immune responses after influenza vaccination such as activated T follicular Helper (Tfh), plasmablasts and H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA)-specific memory B cells (HA+mBC) by flow-cytometry, and anti-influenza antibodies by hemagglutination inhibition test (HI), at baseline and days 10, 30 and 90 post-vaccination. The proportion of CD4+CD54RA-CXCR5+ Tfh was lower in belatacept than Tac patients at baseline (1.86%[1.25-3.03] vs 4.88%[2.40-8.27], p=0.01) and remained stable post-vaccination. At M3, HA+mBc were significantly higher in Tac-treated patients (0.56%[0.32-1.49] vs 0.27%[0.13-0.44], p=0.04) and correlated with activated Tfh numbers. When stratifying patients according to baseline HA+mBc frequencies, belatacept patients with low HA+mBC displayed significantly lower HA+mBc increases after vaccination than Tac patients (1.28[0.94-2.4] vs 2.54[1.73-5.70], p=0.04). Also, belatacept patients displayed significantly lower seroprotection rates against H1N1 at baseline than Tac-treated patients (44.4% vs 84.6%) as well as lower seroconversion rates at days 10, 30 and 90 after vaccination (50% vs 0%, 63.6% vs 0%, and 63.6% vs 0%, respectively). We show the efficacy of belatacept inhibiting T-dependent antigen-specific humoral immune responses, active immunization should be highly encouraged before starting belatacept therapy.",0,2441
425,35979173,Two-Photon Polymerization of 2.5D and 3D Microstructures Fostering a Ramified Resting Phenotype in Primary Microglia.,"Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system and contribute to maintaining brain's homeostasis. Current 2D petri-dish in vitro cell culturing platforms employed for microglia, are unrepresentative of the softness or topography of native brain tissue. This often contributes to changes in microglial morphology, exhibiting an amoeboid phenotype that considerably differs from the homeostatic ramified phenotype in healthy brain tissue. To overcome this problem, multi-scale engineered polymeric microenvironments are developed and tested for the first time with primary microglia derived from adult rhesus macaques. In particular, biomimetic 2.5D micro- and nano-pillar arrays (diameters = 0.29-1.06 µm), featuring low effective shear moduli (0.25-14.63 MPa), and 3D micro-cages (volume = 24 × 24 × 24 to 49 × 49 × 49 μm3) with and without micro- and nano-pillar decorations (pillar diameters = 0.24-1 µm) were fabricated using two-photon polymerization (2PP). Compared to microglia cultured on flat substrates, cells growing on the pillar arrays exhibit an increased expression of the ramified phenotype and a higher number of primary branches per ramified cell. The interaction between the cells and the micro-pillar-decorated cages enables a more homogenous 3D cell colonization compared to the undecorated ones. The results pave the way for the development of improved primary microglia in vitro models to study these cells in both healthy and diseased conditions.",0,2442
1372,35969085,Phospholipid Mediator Induced Transformation in Three-Dimensional Cultures.,"Several models have been developed to study cancer, such as rodent models and established cell lines. Valuable insights into carcinogenesis have been provided by studies using these models. Cell lines have provided an understanding of the deregulation of molecular signaling associated with breast tumorigenesis, while rodent models are widely used to study cellular and molecular characteristics of breast cancer in vivo. The establishment of 3D cultures of breast epithelial and cancerous cells aids in bridging the gap between in vivo and in vitro models by mimicking the in vivo conditions in vitro. This model can be used to understand the deregulation of complex molecular signaling events and the cellular characteristics during breast carcinogenesis. Here, a 3D culture system is modified to study a phospholipid mediator-induced (Platelet Activating Factor, PAF) transformation. Immunomodulators and other secreted molecules play a major role in tumor initiation and progression in the breast. In the present study, 3D acinar cultures of breast epithelial cells are exposed to PAF exhibited transformation characteristics such as loss of polarity and altered cellular characteristics. This 3D culture system will assist in shedding light on genetic and/or epigenetic perturbations induced by various small molecule entities in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, this system will also provide a platform for the identification of novel as well as known genes that may be involved in the process of transformation.",0,2443
236,35982778,Distinct Cohorts of Aspergillus fumigatus Transcription Factors Are Required for Epithelial Damage Occurring via Contact- or Soluble Effector-Mediated Mechanisms.,"Damage to the lung epithelium is a unifying feature of disease caused by the saprophytic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. However, the mechanistic basis and the regulatory control of such damage is poorly characterized. Previous studies have identified A. fumigatus mediated pathogenesis as occurring at early (≤ 16 hours) or late (>16 hours) phases of the fungal interaction with epithelial cells, and respectively involve direct contact with the host cell or the action of soluble factors produced by mature fungal hyphae. Both early and late phases of epithelial damage have been shown to be subject to genetic regulation by the pH-responsive transcription factor PacC. This study sought to determine whether other transcriptional regulators play a role in modulating epithelial damage. In particular, whether the early and late phases of epithelial damage are governed by same or distinct regulators. Furthermore, whether processes such as spore uptake and hyphal adhesion, that have previously been documented to promote epithelial damage, are governed by the same cohorts of epithelial regulators. Using 479 strains from the recently constructed library of A. fumigatus transcription factor null mutants, two high-throughput screens assessing epithelial cell detachment and epithelial cell lysis were conducted. A total of 17 transcription factor mutants were found to exhibit reproducible deficits in epithelial damage causation. Of these, 10 mutants were defective in causing early phase damage via epithelial detachment and 8 mutants were defective in causing late phase damage via epithelial lysis. Remarkably only one transcription factor, PacC, was required for causation of both phases of epithelial damage. The 17 mutants exhibited varied and often unique phenotypic profiles with respect to fitness, epithelial adhesion, cell wall defects, and rates of spore uptake by epithelial cells. Strikingly, 9 out of 10 mutants deficient in causing early phase damage also exhibited reduced rates of hyphal extension, and culture supernatants of 7 out of 8 mutants deficient in late phase damage were significantly less cytotoxic. Our study delivers the first high-level overview of A. fumigatus regulatory genes governing lung epithelial damage, suggesting highly coordinated genetic orchestration of host-damaging activities that govern epithelial damage in both space and time.",0,2444
2446,35966849,Case report: Clinical and histopathological characteristics of psoriasiform erythema and de novo IL-17A cytokines expression on lesioned skin in atopic dermatitis children treated with dupilumab.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic recurrent inflammatory disease, and dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody, is the firstly approved biological drug for AD. Psoriasiform erythema (PE) during dupilumab treatment in adults has been reported. This study describes the risk of PE in children after initiation of dupilumab treatment. To evaluate the de novo cytokines gene expression in the transition of atopic dermatitis symptoms to psoriasiform erythema during dupilumab treatment in children. Two 17-year-old teenage twin patients with AD were included in this study who developed psoriasiform erythema after initiation of dupilumab. The lesional skin biopsy specimens were obtained for the histopathological investigation and RNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (RNA-FISH). Dermoscopy, cytometry (cytokine detection in the blood), and blood investigations were completed for the pedigree and the lesioned descriptions. Two twin patients with AD presented with erythematic scaly plaques on the back, scalp, abdomen, and extensor extremities after 20 weeks of dupilumab treatment. The transitional change of AD to psoriasiform erythema treated with dupilumab was observed. Our subjects' dermoscopy showed pinpoint bleeding and white scales on pink background. Histopathology features showed psoriasiform hyperplasia, epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis), ectatic capillaries, perivascular lymphocytes infiltration, and parakeratosis, with the absence of the granular cell layer. mRNA (RNA-FISH) cytokines gene expression showed a significantly high concentration of IL-17A. Blood investigation results showed a high concentration of (Immunoglobulin E) IgE and Eosinophils, and cytokines detection in blood showed IL-5,6 and IL-17 in one patient; however, only IL-5 in another patient. The dupilumab was discontinued and initiated with Baricitinib. Baricitinib showed a significant reduction in skin lesions. Psoriasiform erythema can appear during dupilumab treatment in atopic dermatitis children. Potently, by suppressing skewed Th2 activation in patients with AD, the balance might shift toward Th1/Th17 predominance, and psoriasis develops. Baricitinib is a potential drug for psoriasiform erythema with significant therapeutic effects.",0,2445
408,35979252,Intestinal Ultrasound in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Valuable and Increasingly Important Tool.,"Intestinal ultrasound is emerging as a non-invasive tool for monitoring disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease patients due to its low cost, excellent safety profile, and availability. Herein, we comprehensively review the role of intestinal ultrasound in the management of these patients. Intestinal ultrasound has a good accuracy in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, as well as in the assessment of disease activity, extent, and evaluating disease-related complications, namely strictures, fistulae, and abscesses. Even though not fully validated, several scores have been developed to assess disease activity using ultrasound. Importantly, intestinal ultrasound can also be used to assess response to treatment. Changes in ultrasonographic parameters are observed as early as 4 weeks after treatment initiation and persist during short- and long-term follow-up. Additionally, Crohn's disease patients with no ultrasound improvement seem to be at a higher risk of therapy intensification, need for steroids, hospitalisation, or even surgery. Similarly to Crohn's disease, intestinal ultrasound has a good performance in the diagnosis, activity, and disease extent assessment in ulcerative colitis patients. In fact, in patients with severe acute colitis, higher bowel wall thickness at admission is associated with the need for salvage therapy and the absence of a significant decrease in this parameter may predict the need for colectomy. Short-term data also evidence the role of intestinal ultrasound in evaluating therapy response, with ultrasound changes observed after 2 weeks of treatment and significant improvement after 12 weeks of follow-up in ulcerative colitis. Intestinal ultrasound is a valuable tool to assess disease activity and complications, and to monitor response to therapy. Even though longer prospective data are warranted, intestinal ultrasound may lead to a change in the paradigm of inflammatory bowel disease management as it can be used in a point-of-care setting, enabling earlier intervention if needed. A ecografia intestinal na doença inflamatória intestinal tem ganho importância crescente como exame não invasivo para monitorizar a atividade de doença, pelos seus custos reduzidos, excelente perfil de segurança e disponibilidade. Neste artigo realizamos uma revisão sobre o papel da ecografia intestinal no manejo destes doentes. Na doença de Crohn, a ecografia intestinal tem uma boa acuidade no diagnóstico, avaliação da atividade e extensão da doença, assim como na avaliação de complicações, como estenoses, fístulas e abcessos. Apesar de não estarem validados, vários scores têm sido desenvolvidos para avaliar a atividade de doença. É de realçar a importância da ecografia intestinal na avaliação da resposta à terapêutica.A melhoria dos parâmetros ecográficos é observada tão precocemente como quatro semanas e persiste durante o seguimento a curto e longo prazo. Os doentes sem melhoria ecográfica parecem ter uma maior necessidade de intensificação terapêutica, corticóides, internamento ou cirurgia. À semelhança da doença de Crohn, a ecografia intestinal tem uma boa acuidade na avaliação ao diagnóstico, atividade e extensão da doença na colite ulcerosa. Na colite ulcerosa grave, um maior espessamento da parede intestinal à admissão está associado a maior necessidade de terapêutica de resgate e a ausência de melhoria deste parâmetro pode predizer a necessidade de colectomia. A ecografia também permite a avaliação da resposta à terapêutica na colite ulcerosa, com alterações observadas após duas semanas de tratamento e mantendo melhoria significativa após 12 semanas. A ecografia intestinal é um método importante para avaliar a atividade de doença, complicações e monitorizar a resposta à terapêutica na doença inflamatória intestinal.

Many studies have used quantitative proteomic analysis to identify proteins associated with meat quality traits in livestock, however, the potential candidate proteins that influence IMF in donkey muscle are not fully understood. In this study, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis, with tandem-mass-tagged (TMT) labeling, with samples from the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of the donkey. A total of 585,555 spectra were identified from the six muscle samples used in this study. In total, 20,583 peptides were detected, including 15,279 unique peptides, and 2,540 proteins were identified. We analyzed differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) between LD muscles of donkeys with high (H) and low (L) IMF content. We identified 30 DAPs between the H and L IMF content groups, of which 17 were upregulated and 13 downregulated in the H IMF group. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis of these DAPs revealed many GO terms (e.g., bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor binding) and pathways (e.g., Wnt signaling pathway and Hippo signaling pathway) involved in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. The construction of protein-protein interaction networks identified 16 DAPs involved in these networks. Our data provide a basis for future investigations into candidate proteins involved in IMF deposition and potential new approaches to improve meat quality in the donkey.",0,2447
1838,35967802,Dynamics and determinants of human plasma bile acid profiles during dietary challenges.,"In recent years, bile acids (BA) have received great interest due to their pleiotropic biological activity and the presence of plasma membrane-bound and nuclear receptors. Moreover, BA in blood have been identified by metabolite screening approaches as biomarkers that are associated with various diseases and even with a human longevity phenotype. With the growing interest in the microbiota contribution to the health-disease trajectory, BA that undergo deconjugation and other modifications by bacteria in the large intestine have become a prime target as a microbiome diversity modifier. We here profiled BA by a quantitative and a semiquantitative approach in 15 healthy and phenotypically very similar young individuals for over a 36-h fasting period, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and an oral lipid tolerance test (OLTT). We demonstrate a remarkable heterogeneity of the responses and describe the different dynamics of the plasma changes that likely originate from different routes by which BA enters the peripheral blood, and that may represent a direct secretion from the liver into the blood and a route that reaches the blood as a spill-over after passing from the gallbladder through the intestine and the portal system. We discuss the finding that an individual transport process involved in the passage of BA could be a critical determinant in the kinetics of plasma appearance and the overall phenotypic variability found.",0,2448
2364,35967012,New Triterpenoids from the Fruiting Bodies of Laetiporus sulphureus and Their Anti-Inflammatory Activity.,"Laetiporus sulphureus is a popular medicinal mushroom with diverse pharmacological activities in many Asian countries. Four new triterpenoids, named sulphurenoids A-D (1-4), along with 12 known analogues, were isolated from the fruits of L. sulphureus. Nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) techniques were used for the investigation of the chemical structure of isolated compounds. In addition, the anti-inflammatory activity of three new compounds (2-4) was tested for NO production in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 cells. The IC50 values of isolated triterpenoids ranged from 14.3 to 42.3 μM, which were more effective than the positive control (IC50 for minocycline was 73.0 μM). The experimentally obtained anti-inflammatory activity data of L. sulphureus are in agreement with its traditional use.",0,2449
763,35975074,Molecular docking and dynamics based approach for the identification of kinase inhibitors targeting PI3Kα against non-small cell lung cancer: a computational study.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an obscure disease whose incidence is increasing worldwide day by day, and PI3Kα is one of the major targets for cell proliferation due to the mutation. Since PI3K is a class of kinase enzyme, and no in silico research has been performed on the inhibition of PI3Kα mutation by small molecules, we have selected the protein kinase inhibitor database and performed the energy minimization process by ligand preparation. The key objective of this research is to identify the potential hits from the protein kinase inhibitor library and further to perform lead optimization by a molecular docking and dynamics approach. And so, the protein was selected (PDB ID: 4JPS), having a unique inhibitor and a specific binding pocket with amino acid residue for the inhibition of kinase activity. After the docking protocol validation, structure-based virtual screening by molecular docking and MMGBSA binding affinity calculations were performed and a total of ten hits were reported. Detailed analysis of the best scoring molecules was performed with ADMET analysis, induced fit docking (IFD) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Two molecules - 6943 and 34100 - were considered lead molecules and showed better results than the PI3K inhibitor Copanlisib in the docking assessment, ADMET analysis, and molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, the synthetic accessibility of the two compounds - 6943 and 34100 - was investigated using SwissADME, and the two lead molecules are easier to synthesize than the PI3K inhibitor Copanlisib. Computational drug discovery tools were used for identification of kinase inhibitors as anti-cancer agents for NSCLC in the present research.",0,2450
2191,35967327,Pericyte derived chemokines amplify neutrophil recruitment across the cerebrovascular endothelial barrier.,"Excessive neutrophil extravasation can drive immunopathology, exemplified in pyogenic meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms that amplify neutrophil extravasation has limited innovation in therapeutic targeting of neutrophil mediated pathology. Attention has focussed on neutrophil interactions with endothelia, but data from mouse models also point to a role for the underlying pericyte layer, as well as perivascular macrophages, the only other cell type found within the perivascular space in the cerebral microvasculature. We tested the hypothesis that human brain vascular pericytes (HBVP) contribute to neutrophil extravasation in a transwell model of the cerebral post-capillary venule. We show that pericytes augment endothelial barrier formation. In response to inflammatory cues, they significantly enhance neutrophil transmigration across the endothelial barrier, without increasing the permeability to small molecules. In our model, neither pericytes nor endothelia responded directly to bacterial stimulation. Instead, we show that paracrine signalling by multiple cytokines from monocyte derived macrophages drives transcriptional upregulation of multiple neutrophil chemokines by pericytes. Pericyte mediated amplification of neutrophil transmigration was independent of transcriptional responses by endothelia, but could be mediated by direct chemokine translocation across the endothelial barrier. Our data support a model in which microbial sensing by perivascular macrophages generates an inflammatory cascade where pericytes serve to amplify production of neutrophil chemokines that are translocated across the endothelial barrier to act directly on circulating neutrophils. In view of the striking redundancy in inflammatory cytokines that stimulate pericytes and in the neutrophil chemokines they produce, we propose that the mechanism of chemokine translocation may offer the most effective therapeutic target to reduce neutrophil mediated pathology in pyogenic meningitis.",0,2451
1602,35968282,The endogenous neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide after spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage-A potential psychoactive prognostic serum biomarker of pain-associated neuropsychological symptoms.,"The pronociceptive neuromediator calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is associated with pain transmission and modulation. After spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (sSAH), the vasodilatory CGRP is excessively released into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum and modulates psycho-behavioral function. In CSF, the hypersecretion of CGRP subacutely after good-grade sSAH was significantly correlated with an impaired health-related quality of life (hrQoL). Now, we prospectively analyzed the treatment-specific differences in the secretion of endogenous CGRP into serum after good-grade sSAH and its impact on hrQoL. Twenty-six consecutive patients (f:m = 13:8; mean age 50.6 years) with good-grade sSAH were enrolled (drop out n = 5): n = 9 underwent endovascular aneurysm occlusion, n = 6 microsurgery, and n = 6 patients with perimesencephalic SAH received standardized intensive medical care. Plasma was drawn daily from day 1 to 10, at 3 weeks, and at the 6-month follow-up (FU). CGRP levels were determined with competitive enzyme immunoassay in duplicate serum samples. All patients underwent neuropsychological self-report assessment after the onset of sSAH (t1: day 11-35) and at the FU (t2). During the first 10 days, the mean CGRP levels in serum (0.470 ± 0.10 ng/ml) were significantly lower than the previously analyzed mean CGRP values in CSF (0.662 ± 0.173; p = 0.0001). The mean serum CGRP levels within the first 10 days did not differ significantly from the values at 3 weeks (p = 0.304). At 6 months, the mean serum CGRP value (0.429 ± 0.121 ng/ml) was significantly lower compared to 3 weeks (p = 0.010) and compared to the first 10 days (p = 0.026). Higher mean serum CGRP levels at 3 weeks (p = 0.001) and at 6 months (p = 0.005) correlated with a significantly poorer performance in the item pain, and, at 3 weeks, with a higher symptom burden regarding somatoform syndrome (p = 0.001) at t2. Our study reveals the first insight into the serum levels of endogenous CGRP in good-grade sSAH patients with regard to hrQoL. In serum, upregulated CGRP levels at 3 weeks and 6 months seem to be associated with a poorer mid-term hrQoL in terms of pain. In migraineurs, CGRP receptor antagonists have proven clinical efficacy. Our findings corroborate the potential capacity of CGRP in pain processing.",0,2452
390,35979284,"Review of clinical characteristics, immune responses and regulatory mechanisms of hepatitis E-associated liver failure.","Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the most common cause of acute liver failure (LF) and one of the most common factors causing acute injury in acute-on-chronic LF (ACLF). When HEV-related LF occurs, a series of changes take place in both the intrahepatic environment and extrahepatic microenvironment. The changed types and distribution of immune cells (infiltrating macrophages and increased lymphocytes) in liver tissue, as well the increased proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the blood, indicate that the occurrence and progression of HEV-related LF are closely related to immune imbalance. The clinical features and immune reaction in the body during HEV-related acute LF (ALF) and ACLF are complicated. This review highlights recent progress in elucidating the clinical manifestations of HEV-associated ALF and ACLF and discusses the corresponding systemic immune changes and possible regulatory mechanisms.",0,2453
2381,35966992,Examining the Effect of Transcranial Electrical Stimulation and Cognitive Training on Processing Speed in Pediatric Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Pilot Study.,"Processing Speed (PS), the ability to perceive and react fast to stimuli in the environment, has been shown to be impaired in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, it is unclear whether PS can be improved following targeted treatments for ADHD. Here we examined potential changes in PS following application of transcranial electric stimulation (tES) combined with cognitive training (CT) in children with ADHD. Specifically, we examined changes in PS in the presence of different conditions of mental fatigue. We used a randomized double-blind active-controlled crossover study of 19 unmedicated children with ADHD. Participants received either anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) or transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), while completing CT, and the administration order was counterbalanced. PS was assessed before and after treatment using the MOXO-CPT, which measures PS in the presence of various conditions of mental fatigue and cognitive load. tRNS combined with CT yielded larger improvements in PS compared to tDCS combined with CT, mainly under condition of increased mental fatigue. Further improvements in PS were also seen in a 1-week follow up testing. This study provides initial support for the efficacy of tRNS combined with CT in improving PS in the presence of mental fatigue in pediatric ADHD.",0,2454
2155,35967363,Balancing B cell responses to the allograft: implications for vaccination.,"Balancing enough immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection and yet maintaining an intact immune system to respond to vaccinations, eliminate invading pathogens or cancer cells is an ongoing challenge to transplant physicians. Antibody mediated allograft rejection remains problematic in kidney transplantation and is the most common cause of graft loss despite current immunosuppressive therapies. The goal of immunosuppressive therapies is to prevent graft rejection; however, they prevent optimal vaccine responses as well. At the center of acute and chronic antibody mediated rejection and vaccine responses is the B lymphocyte. This review will highlight the role of B cells in alloimmune responses including the dependency on T cells for antibody production. We will discuss the need to improve vaccination rates in transplant recipients and present data on B cell populations and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response rates in pediatric kidney transplant recipients.",0,2455
179,35982909,Human CPTP promotes growth and metastasis via sphingolipid metabolite ceramide and PI4KA/AKT signaling in pancreatic cancer cells.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a devastating solid malignancy with a dismal prognosis. The treatment of metastatic PC is a current challenge for medical oncologists due to a lack of early detection, drug resistance, and relapse. Therefore, potential biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets for PC are urgently required. Ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein (CPTP) is a member of the glycolipid transfer protein family, which is associated with autophagy and inflammation regulation. The roles and mechanisms of CPTP in PC have not been clarified. In this study, by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry analysis, we found that CPTP is highly expressed in PC and is associated with a poor prognosis in PC patients. By using cell counting kit-8, colony formation, transwell and matrigel assays in vitro, as well as xenograft model assays in vivo, we further proved that CPTP enhanced PC cells growth and metastasis. In PC cells, human CPTP promotes growth and metastasis via sphingolipid metabolite ceramide and PI4KA/AKT signaling. Sp (specific protein)-1 and Sp3 transcription factors also act as upstream positive regulators of CPTP expression in PC cells. Collectively, these findings suggested that CPTP may function as a pro-tumorigenic gene in PC cells and could be a promising therapeutic target in PC.",0,2456
1365,35969098,Single Extracellular Vesicle Transmembrane Protein Characterization by Nano-Flow Cytometry.,"Single particle characterization has become increasingly relevant for research into extracellular vesicles, progressing from bulk analysis techniques and first-generation particle analysis to comprehensive multi-parameter measurements such as nano-flow cytometry (nFCM). nFCM is a form of flow cytometry that utilizes instrumentation specifically designed for nano-particle analysis, allowing for thousands of EVs to be characterized per minute both with and without the use of staining techniques. High resolution side scatter (SS) detection allows for size and concentration to be determined for all biological particles larger than 45 nm, while simultaneous fluorescence (FL) detection identifies the presence of labeled markers and targets of interest. Labeled subpopulations can then be described in quantitative units of particles/mL or as a percentage of the total particles identified by side scatter. Here, EVs derived from conditioned cell culture media (CCM) are labeled with both a lipid dye, to identify particles with a membrane, and antibodies specific for CD9, CD63, and CD81 as common EV markers. Measurements of comparison material, a concentration standard and a size standard of silica nanospheres, as well as labeled sample material are analyzed in a 1-minute analysis. The software is then used to measure the concentration and size distribution profile of all particles, independent of labeling, before determining the particles that are positive for each of the labels. Simultaneous SS and FL detection can be utilized flexibly with many different EV sources and labeling targets, both external and internal, describing EV samples in a comprehensive and quantitative manner.",0,2457
2384,35966989,Identifying and validating subtypes of Parkinson's disease based on multimodal MRI data via hierarchical clustering analysis.,"We wished to explore Parkinson's disease (PD) subtypes by clustering analysis based on the multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indices amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and gray matter volume (GMV). Then, we analyzed the differences between PD subtypes. Eighty-six PD patients and 44 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. We extracted ALFF and GMV according to the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) partition using Data Processing and Analysis for Brain Imaging (DPABI) software. The Ward linkage method was used for hierarchical clustering analysis. DPABI was employed to compare differences in ALFF and GMV between groups. Two subtypes of PD were identified. The diffuse malignant subtype was characterized by reduced ALFF in the visual-related cortex and extensive reduction of GMV with severe impairment in motor function and cognitive function. The mild subtype was characterized by increased ALFF in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and sensorimotor cortex, and a slight decrease in GMV with mild impairment of motor function and cognitive function. Hierarchical clustering analysis based on multimodal MRI indices could be employed to identify two PD subtypes. These two PD subtypes showed different neurodegenerative patterns upon imaging.",0,2458
36,35984758,PLATELET FUNCTION IN TRAUMA: IS CURRENT TECHNOLOGY IN FUNCTION TESTING MISSING THE MARK IN INJURED PATIENTS?,"Platelets are subcellular anucleate components of blood primarily responsible for initiating and maintaining hemostasis. After injury to a blood vessel, platelets can be activated via several pathways, resulting in changed shape, adherence to the injury site, aggregation to form a plug, degranulation to initiate activation in other nearby platelets, and acceleration of thrombin formation to convert fibrinogen to fibrin before contracting to strengthen the clot. Platelet function assays use agonists to induce and measure one or more of these processes to identify alterations in platelet function that increase the likelihood of bleeding or thrombotic events. In severe trauma, these assays have revealed that platelet dysfunction is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, to date, the mechanism(s) causing clinically significant platelet dysfunction remain poorly understood. We review the pros, cons, and evidence for use of many of the popular assays in trauma, discuss limitations of their use in this patient population, and present approaches that can be taken to develop improved functional assays capable of elucidating mechanisms of trauma-induced platelet dysfunction. Platelet dysfunction in trauma has been associated with need for transfusions and mortality; however, most of the current platelet function assays were not designed for evaluating trauma patients, and there are limited data regarding their use in this population. New or improved functional assays will help define the mechanisms by which platelet dysfunction occurs, as well as help optimize future treatment.",0,2459
882,35974841,Correlation Between Pretreatment Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Expression as Prognostic Markers in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Background The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at baseline treatment is an important marker of systemic inflammation, which is correlated with survival benefits in lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, and colorectal cancer. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is a biomarker with discording results regarding survival benefits in lung cancer. In our research, we studied the relationship between these two markers in patients with lung cancer. Methods Patients with stage I, II, III, and IV lung cancer (n = 80) were included in this retrospective study. The NLR baseline was recorded before the initiation of treatment. The NLR cut-off value was 4. PD-L1 expression was determined by immunohistochemical staining. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted to test their prognostic value. Results NLR proved to be a significant prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.002, Log Rank) with a mean PFS of 27.7 months for low NLR patients and 12.8 months for high NLR patients. It was also significant for overall survival (OS) (p=0.007, Log Rank) with a mean OS of 52 months for low NLR patients and 41.6 months for high NLR patients. The prognostic impact of PD-L1 expression on PFS and OS was not statistically significant with a mean PFS of 23.1 months for PD-L1-negative patients and 15.8 months for PD-L1-positive patients (p=0.422, Log Rank). Mean OS was 49 months for PD-L1-negative patients while for PD-L1-positive patients, it was 43.3 months (p=0.550 Log Rank). Regarding the correlation between PD-L1 expression and NLR value, PFS mean survival times were 13.1 months for PD-L1(+)/NLR>4, 15.1 months for PD-L1(-)/NLR>4, 16.4 months for PD-L1(+)/NLR<4 and 27.8 months for PD-L1(-)/NLR<4. This correlation between PFS and the combined PD-L1 and NLR prognostic factor was statistically relevant (p=0.04). For OS, the PD-L1/NLR combined prognostic factor was not statistically relevant (p=0.055). A mean PFS time of 27.8 months was reported for PD-L1(-)/NLR<4 group patients while for the other groups, the mean PFS was 14.9 months (p=0.045). In univariate analysis, the elevated NLR was significantly associated with a decreased PFS time (HR=2.31, 95% CI =1.323- 4.051, p=0.03) as well as OS (HR=3.555, 95% CI=1.310- 9.652, p=0.013). In multivariate analysis, NLR remained statistically significant for PFS (HR=2.160, 95% CI=1.148- 4.062, p=0.013) and OS (HR=4.364, 95% CI=1.474- 12.921, p=0.008) after adjusting for the factors of age, gender, tumor stage, lymph node stage, clinical stage, histology, and PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression was not a valid prognostic factor for progression or death in either univariate or multivariate analysis. We also stratified the disease control rate (DCR) depending on PD-L1/NLR combined factor expression. In the PD-L1(-)/NLR<4 group, we had the highest number of partial responses (PRs) and only one complete response (CR) compared to the other groups (p=0.006). Conclusions As the number of patients is limited in the present analysis, it is hypothesized that these two markers can be useful in dividing patients into two prognostic groups: the good prognostic group reunites PD-L1(+)/NLR<4 and PD-L1(-)/NLR<4 and the poor prognostic group reunites PD-L1(+)/NLR>4 and PD-L1(-)/NLR>4.",0,2460
22,35985127,Two- and three-dimensional piezoelectric scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.,"The incidence of bone disorders worldwide is increasing. For this reason, new and more effective strategies for bone repair are needed. The most common strategy used for cell regeneration relies in biochemical stimulation while biophysical stimulation using mechanical, and electrical cues is a promising, however, still under-investigated field. This work reports on the development of piezoelectric 2D and 3D porous scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration strategies. While the porous scaffolds mimic the bone's structure, the piezoelectric activity of the scaffolds mimics the bone mechano-electric microenvironment. The piezoelectric activity is related to the electroactive β-phase of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in the scaffolds and was dynamically stimulated by cell culture in a custom-made mechanical bioreactor. These two factors combined provide an effective biomimetic environment for the proliferation of preosteoblasts. The electromechanically-responsive scaffolds are found to promote the enhancement of proliferation rate of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells in about 20 % as well as an improved adhesion and proliferation over the materials, mainly when dynamically stimulated. These results prove that local piezoelectric effect, as the one existing in bone tissue, allows effective cell proliferation, which could be further translated in more efficient strategies for bone tissue regeneration.",0,2461
378,35979296,Identification of risk factors for surgical site infection after type II and type III tibial pilon fracture surgery.,"High-energy tibial pilon fractures are complex and severe fractures that are associated with a high risk of infection following open reduction and internal fixation. Infection can negatively impact patient outcomes. To compare risk factors for postoperative infection after open reduction and internal fixation for a pilon fracture. Among the 137 patients included, 67 developed a surgical site infection. Demographic, clinical, and surgical factors were compared between the two groups. A binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95%CI for significant risk factors for postoperative infection. The distribution of pathogenic bacteria among the 67 patients who developed a surgical site infection was as follows: Gram-positive, 58.2% (n = 39); Gram-negative, 38.8% (n = 26); and fungal, 2.9% (n = 2). The following factors were associated with postoperative infection (P < 0.05): a Ruedi-Allgower pilon fracture type III (OR = 2.034; 95%CI: 1.109-3.738); a type III surgical incision (OR = 1.840; 95%CI: 1.177-2.877); wound contamination (OR = 2.280; 95%CI: 1.378-3.772); and diabetes as a comorbidity (OR = 3.196; 95%CI: 1.209-8.450). Infection prevention for patients with a Ruedi-Allgower fracture type III, surgical incision type III, wound contamination, and diabetes lowers the postoperative infection risk after surgical management of tibial pilon fractures.",0,2462
1505,35968382,Parkinson's disease detection based on multi-pattern analysis and multi-scale convolutional neural networks.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease. At present, the early diagnosis of PD is still extremely challenging, and there is still a lack of consensus on the brain characterization of PD, and a more efficient and robust PD detection method is urgently needed. In order to further explore the features of PD based on brain activity and achieve effective detection of PD patients (including OFF and ON medications), in this study, a multi-pattern analysis based on brain activation and brain functional connectivity was performed on the brain functional activity of PD patients, and a novel PD detection model based on multi-scale convolutional neural network (MCNN) was proposed. Based on the analysis of power spectral density (PSD) and phase-locked value (PLV) features of multiple frequency bands of two independent resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) datasets, we found that there were significant differences in PSD and PLV between HCs and PD patients (including OFF and ON medications), especially in the β and γ bands, which were very effective for PD detection. Moreover, the combined use of brain activation represented by PSD and functional connectivity patterns represented by PLV can effectively improve the performance of PD detection. Furthermore, our proposed MCNN model shows great potential for automatic PD detection, with cross-validation accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve all above 99%. Our study may help to further understand the characteristics of PD and provide new ideas for future PD diagnosis based on spontaneous EEG activity.",0,2463
977,35974642,Contact map dependence of a T-cell receptor binding repertoire.,"The T-cell arm of the adaptive immune system provides the host protection against unknown pathogens by discriminating between host and foreign material. This discriminatory capability is achieved by the creation of a repertoire of cells each carrying a T-cell receptor (TCR) specific to non-self-antigens displayed as peptides bound to the major histocompatibility complex (pMHC). The understanding of the dynamics of the adaptive immune system at a repertoire level is complex, due to both the nuanced interaction of a TCR-pMHC pair and to the number of different possible TCR-pMHC pairings, making computationally exact solutions currently unfeasible. To gain some insight into this problem, we study an affinity-based model for TCR-pMHC binding in which a crystal structure is used to generate a distance-based contact map that weights the pairwise amino acid interactions. We find that the TCR-pMHC binding energy distribution strongly depends both on the number of contacts and the repeat structure allowed by the topology of the contact map of choice; this in turn influences T-cell recognition probability during negative selection, with higher variances leading to higher survival probabilities. In addition, we quantify the degree to which neoantigens with mutations in sites with higher contacts are recognized at a higher rate.",0,2464

Subsequently, these breaks are corrected by a complex system led by the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Pathogenic variants in genes involved in this process, such as the NHEJ1 gene, cause severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID) along with neurodevelopmental disease and sensitivity to ionizing radiation. To provide new clinical and immunological insights on NHEJ1 deficiency arising from a newly diagnosed patient with severe immunodeficiency. A male infant, born to consanguineous parents, suspected of having primary immunodeficiency underwent immunological and genetic workup. This included a thorough assessment of T cell phenotyping and lymphocyte activation by mitogen stimulation tests, whole-exome sequencing (WES), TCR repertoire Vβ repertoire via flow cytometry analysis, and TCR and BCR repertoire analysis via next-generation sequencing (NGS). Clinical findings included microcephaly, recurrent pneumonia, and failure to thrive. An immune workup revealed lymphopenia, reduced T cell function, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Skewed TCR Vβ repertoire, TCR gamma (TRG) repertoire, and BCR repertoire were determined in the patient. Genetic analysis identified a novel homozygous missense pathogenic variant in XLF/Cernunnos: c.A580Ins.T; p.M194fs. The patient underwent a successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A novel NHEJ1 pathogenic variant is reported in a patient who presented with SCID phenotype that displayed clonally expanded T and B cells. An adjusted HSCT was safe to ensure full T cell immune reconstitution.",0,2465
1654,35968120,"Combined analysis of transcriptome and metabolome reveals that sugar, lipid, and phenylpropane metabolism are essential for male fertility in temperature-induced male sterile rice.","Photoperiod- and thermosensitive genic male sterility (PTGMS) rice is a vital germplasm resource consisting of two-line hybrid rice in which light and temperature strictly control their fertility changes. Variable environmental conditions present huge risks to the two-lines hybrid seed production. Explaining the regulatory mechanism of male fertility in rice PTGMS lines is an essential prerequisite to ensuring food security production. A group of near-isogenic lines (NILs) of a rice PTGMS line unique to this research group was used for this study. These lines have the same genetic background and regulate male fertility by responding to different temperature changes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 315 upregulated genes and 391 regulated genes regulated male fertility in response to temperature changes, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly characterized in enrichment analysis as having roles in the metabolic pathways of sugar, lipid and phenylpropanoid. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that a lack of starch accumulation in sterile pollen grains induced by high temperature, with an abnormal exine development and a lack of inner pollen grains. Defective processes for sporopollenin synthesis, sporopollenin transport and pollen wall formation in sterile anthers were verified using qPCR. Targeted metabolomics analysis revealed that most lipids (phospholipids, sphingolipids and fatty acids) and flavonoids (flavones and flavanones) were upregulated in fertile anthers and involved in pollen wall development and male fertility formation, while lignin G units and C-type lignin were the major contributors to pollen wall development. The coding genes for trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase, beta-1,3-glucanase, phospholipase D and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase are considered essential regulators in the process of male fertility formation. In conclusion, our results indicated that the expression of critical genes and accumulation of metabolites in the metabolism of sugar, lipid, and phenylpropanoid are essential for male fertility formation.

Here we report an in-depth comparison of the pharmacological properties and structure-activity relationships of existing and expanded compound libraries of 2-substituted 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine and 4-amino-substituted quinoline derivatives that function as A3AR positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). We also show that our lead compound from each series enhances adenosine-induced A3AR signaling preferentially toward activation of Gαi3 and GαoA isoproteins, which are coexpressed with the A3AR in immune cells and spinal cord neurons. Finally, utilizing an extracellular/intracellular chimeric A3AR approach composed of sequences from a responding (human) and a nonresponding (mouse) species, we provide evidence in support of the idea that the imidazoquinolin-4-amine class of PAMs variably interacts dually with the orthosteric ligand binding site as well as with a separate allosteric site located within the inner/intracellular regions of the receptor. This study has advanced both structural and pharmacological understanding of these two classes of A3AR PAMs, which includes leads for future pharmaceutical development.",0,2467
2127,35967391,"MALT1 regulates Th2 and Th17 differentiation via NF-κB and JNK pathways, as well as correlates with disease activity and treatment outcome in rheumatoid arthritis.","MALT1 regulates immunity and inflammation in multiple ways, while its role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is obscure. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of MALT1 with disease features, treatment outcome, as well as its effect on Th1/2/17 cell differentiation and underlying molecule mechanism in RA. Totally 147 RA patients were enrolled. Then their blood Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells were detected by flow cytometry. Besides, PBMC MALT1 expression was detected before treatment (baseline), at week (W) 6, W12, and W24. PBMC MALT1 in 30 osteoarthritis patients and 30 health controls were also detected. Then, blood CD4+ T cells were isolated from RA patients, followed by MALT1 overexpression or knockdown lentivirus transfection and Th1/2/17 polarization assay. In addition, IMD 0354 (NF-κB antagonist) and SP600125 (JNK antagonist) were also added to treat CD4+ T cells. MALT1 was increased in RA patients compared to osteoarthritis patients and healthy controls. Meanwhile, MALT1 positively related to CRP, ESR, DAS28 score, Th17 cells, negatively linked with Th2 cells, but did not link with other features or Th1 cells in RA patients. Notably, MALT1 decreased longitudinally during treatment, whose decrement correlated with RA treatment outcome (treatment response, low disease activity, or disease remission). In addition, MALT1 overexpression promoted Th17 differentiation, inhibited Th2 differentiation, less affected Th1 differentiation, activated NF-κB and JNK pathways in RA CD4+ T cells; while MALT1 knockdown exhibited the opposite effect. Besides, IMD 0354 and SP600125 addition attenuated MALT1's effect on Th2 and Th17 differentiation. MALT1 regulates Th2 and Th17 differentiation via NF-κB and JNK pathways, as well as correlates with disease activity and treatment outcome in RA.",0,2468
1349,35969699,"Effects of dietary arginine in ameliorating the deleterious effects induced by mycotoxins on growth, immune system, body organs in growing pigs.","Mycotoxin contamination in pig feeds has a negative impact on growth performance, the immune system, and major body organs. Arginine (Arg) plays an important role in animals' body biochemistry and physiology. This study aimed to determine the effect of dietary Arg supplementation on mitigating the negative effects of mycotoxins in growing pigs. A total of 72 growing pigs (Landrace × Large white) with initial mean body weight (BW) = 55 ± 2.5 kg were allotted to four treatment groups with three replicates per group of six pigs per replicate in a completely randomized design. The treatments included a non-toxin diet with 1.2% Arg (NT1.2) and mycotoxin-challenged treatments supplemented with 1.2% Arg (TX1.2), 1.3% Arg (TX1.3), and 1.4% Arg (TX1.4). Statistical analysis of data included the effects of dietary level of Arg. The results indicated a significantly higher BW (p < 0.05), average daily gain (p < 0.05), and gain-to-feed ratio (p < 0.05) in the NT1.2 group than in the TX1.2, TX1.3, and TX1.4 groups. The relative weight of the liver was higher (p < 0.05) in the TX1.2 compared to that of the NT1.2 group, although it was not different from that of TX1.3 and TX1.4. The level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was significantly up-regulated (p < 0.05) in the liver tissue of the TX1.2 group compared to that of the other treatments. Overall, dietary Arg supplementation remedied liver injury and alleviated the compromised immune system caused by mycotoxin toxicity.",0,2469

173,35982983,Association between Sleep Disturbances at Subacute Stage of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Long-Term Outcomes.,"Mild (mTBI) traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for the majority of all TBI cases. Evidence has suggested that patients with mTBI can suffer from long-lasting cognitive deficits, persistent symptoms, and decreased quality of life. Sleep disorders are commonly observed after TBI, with the prevalence rate of sleep disturbances in persons with TBI being much higher than that in the general population. Poor sleep quality can impair cognitive functions in the general population. This effect of sleep disturbances may impede the recovery processes in the population with TBI. The objective of this study is to add to our understanding of the relationship between self-reported sleep problems and other post-concussion symptoms and look at the association between early sleep problems and long-term outcomes in mTBI. Post-concussion symptoms, neurocognitive functions, level of global outcomes, and rating of satisfaction of life were assessed in 64 patients with mTBI. The results revealed that the presence of sleep disturbances co-occur with an increased level of overall post-concussion symptoms at the subacute stage of mTBI, particularly with symptoms including poor concentration, memory problems, and irritability. In addition, sleep disturbance at the subacute stage is associated with persistent poor concentration and memory problems, as well as worse neurocognitive function, slower overall recovery, and lower satisfactory of life at the long term. Our findings suggest that sleep disturbance can be a prognostic factor of long-term outcomes after mTBI. Early interventions to improve sleep quality can have potential benefits to facilitate the recovery process from mTBI.",0,2471
1770,35967905,Adenovirus-vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine expressing S1-N fusion protein.,"Additional COVID-19 vaccines that are safe and immunogenic are needed for global vaccine equity. Here, we developed a recombinant type 5 adenovirus vector encoding for the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit antigen and nucleocapsid as a fusion protein (Ad5.SARS-CoV-2-S1N). A single subcutaneous immunization with Ad5.SARS-CoV-2-S1N induced a similar humoral response, along with a significantly higher S1-specific cellular response, as a recombinant type 5 adenovirus vector encoding for S1 alone (Ad5.SARS-CoV-2-S1). Immunogenicity was improved by homologous prime-boost vaccination, and further improved through intramuscular heterologous prime-boost vaccination using subunit recombinant S1 protein. Priming with low dose (1 × 1010 v.p.) of Ad5.SARS-CoV-2-S1N and boosting with either wild-type recombinant rS1 or B.1.351 recombinant rS1 induced a robust neutralizing response, which was sustained against Beta and Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variants. This novel Ad5-vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate showed promising immunogenicity in mice and supports the further development of COVID-19-based vaccines incorporating the nucleoprotein as a target antigen.",0,2472
296,35981422,Phosphoproteome profiling of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.,"The balance between the actions of protein kinases and phosphatases is crucial for neuronal functions, including synaptic plasticity. Although the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of neuronal proteins are regulated by synaptic plasticity, no systematic analyses of this have yet been conducted. We performed a phosphoproteomic analysis of hippocampal synaptic plasticity using a nano-Acquity/Synapt LC-MS/MS system. Neuronal proteins were extracted from hippocampal tissues and cultured neurons exposed to long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD). Filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) was performed to remove residual anionic detergents for complete tryptic digestion. Phosphopeptides were then enriched using TiO2 chromatography, followed by immunoaffinity chromatography with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Among the 1500 phosphopeptides identified by LC-MS/MS, 374 phosphopeptides were detected simultaneously in both hippocampal tissues and cultured neurons. Semi-quantification counting the number of spectra of each phosphopeptide showed that 42 of 374 phosphopeptides changed significantly depending on synaptic plasticity. In conclusion, a new proteomic method using sequential enrichment of phosphopeptides and semi-quantification enabled the phosphoproteomic analysis of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.",0,2473
464,35978921,Transmembrane protein 121 as a novel inhibitor of cervical cancer metastasis.,"Transmembrane protein 121 (TMEM121) is isolated from the chicken heart using subtraction hybridisation. A previous study by the authors indicated that TMEM121 is highly expressed in adult mouse hearts and acts as an inhibitor of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. In the present study, the association between TMEM121 and cancer was investigated using bioinformatics tools, including Tumour Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 2.0, cBioPortal, LinkedOmics analysis, Kaplan-Meier plotter and UALCAN analysis. The expression, genetic variation, gene interaction network and co-expression pattern of TMEM121 in tumours were analysed. The results revealed that TMEM121 was expressed in various tumours and significantly downregulated in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC) when compared with its expression in paracancerous tissues, whereas the methylation level of its promoter was increased in tumour tissues. Additionally, associations between TMEM121 and the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, as well as the expression of cancer-related molecules, were detected. The aforementioned bioinformatics analysis suggests that TMEM121 may be involved in the development of cervical cancer. Therefore, gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in HeLa cells were conducted to verify the role of TMEM121 in cervical cancer. The assay using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) revealed that the cell viability of HeLa cells with TMEM121 overexpression was significantly reduced. High TMEM121 expression inhibited HeLa cell migration, as indicated by the decrease in the cell scratch healing rate. The western blot assay revealed that TMEM121 overexpression downregulated the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), cyclin D1, cyclin E2 and phosphorylated (p)-AKT, while upregulating that of p27, E-cadherin and p-p38. When TMEM121 was knocked down, retinoblastoma protein (RB), p53, p27, E-cadherin, p-JNK and p-p38 were inhibited, but cyclin E1 was promoted. By combining bioinformatics and experimental biology in the present study, the results demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that TMEM121 may be a novel inhibitor of cervical cancer that is linked to multiple signalling pathways, paving the way for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",0,2474
1345,35969703,Evaluation of different non-fasting molting methods on laying performance and egg quality during molting and post molting periods.,"The study evaluated different molt-inducing methods to achieve the main goal of molting in commercial layers during molting and post-molting periods. A total of 400 60-week-old Lohmann Brown layers were randomly divided into five groups (eight replicates of 10 birds for each group). Laying hens in the fasting control group received no diet from day 1 to day 10. The second group received a molt-inducing diet recommended by the breeding company. The third group received a wheat bran-based diet. The fourth group received a commercial layer diet with 8,000 ppm zinc (as zinc oxide, ZnO). The fifth group received an induced molting diet given to the second group with 8,000 ppm zinc, respectively. Egg production in the fasting control group and groups fed a diet with ZnO were significantly lower (p < 0.001) than those in groups fed the molt-inducing and wheat bran-based diets without ZnO during molting. Egg laying in the fasting control group was rapidly reduced and stopped on the 5.9th day of molting. In both groups having molt treatment with ZnO, egg production was similarly reduced and ceased on the 6.9th day and 7.0th day of molting, respectively, none of them differed significantly from the control. Layers fed molt-inducing diet or wheat bran-based diet did not reach the cessation of laying even on the 28th d of molting period. Relative weights of the ovary and growing oocytes of layers subjected to fasting or fed diets with ZnO were significantly lower than those of other groups. During the first two weeks of post molting, layers fed molt-inducing diet with ZnO showed higher egg production than the other two groups (p < 0.01). The eggshell strength in the group fed the commercial diet with ZnO was significantly higher than those fed the molt-inducing diet or wheat bran-based diets at 6 weeks of post molting (p < 0.05). These results suggest that the non-feed withdrawal molting using ZnO is more effective in inducing molting and increasing post-molt egg production and egg quality than other methods using a molt-inducing diet alone or wheat bran-based diet without ZnO.",0,2475
1724,35968020,Impact of fibronectin type III domain-containing family in the changes in metabolic and hormonal profiles during peripartum period in dairy cows.,"The peripartum period in dairy cows is frequently associated with excessive lipolysis due to Negative Energy Balance (NEB). These metabolic disorders are the cause of various pathologies. Some metabolites such as β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and Non-Esterified Fatty Acids (NEFA) are known to be biomarkers of NEB in dairy cows. The involvement of adipokines, including adiponectin and leptin, during fat mobilization in the peripartum period is well described, but little is known about the impact of myokines at this time. Fibronectin type III domain-containing proteins (FNDC) are myokines and adipokines recently discovered to play a role in metabolic dysfunctions. This study aimed to evaluate some FNDCs (FNDC5, 4, 3A and B) as potential plasma and adipose tissue indicators of NEB in cattle. We measured plasma FNDC concentrations and adipose tissue FNDC gene expression during the peripartum period, 4 weeks before the estimated calving day (4WAP), one (1WPP) and 16 (16WPP) weeks postpartum in two groups of dairy cows with low NEB (LNEB, n = 8) and high NEB (HNEB, n = 13) at 1WPP. Using specific bovine ELISAs, only plasma FNDC5 concentrations varied during the peripartum period in both LNEB and HNEB animals; concentrations were higher at 1WPP as compared to 4WAP and 16 WPP. FNDC5 plasma concentrations was negatively correlated with dry matter intake, live body weight, variation of empty body weight and glucose concentrations, and positively correlated with plasma non-esterified fatty acids and BHBA concentrations. Subcutaneous adipose tissue contained abundant FNDC5 mRNA and protein, as measured by RT-qPCR and immunoblotting, respectively. We also observed that FNDC5 mRNA abundance in subcutaneous adipose tissue was higher at 1 WPP as compared to 4WAP and 16WPP in HNEB cows and higher at 1 WPP as compared to 4 WAP in LNEB cows, and was higher in HNEB than in LNEB animals during early lactation. Finally, we showed that recombinant human irisin (a fragmented product of FNDC5) increased the release of glycerol and abundance of mRNA encoding adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive-lipase in bovine and human adipose tissue explants. In conclusion, FNDC5 is expressed in bovine adipose tissue and may be involved in lipid mobilization and regulation of NEB in cattle.",0,2476
1344,35969704,Effect of dietary salicylic acid supplementation on performance and blood metabolites of sows and their litters.,"The core intention to undertake this experiment for a period of 21 days is to evaluate the effect of salicylic acid (SA) supplemented diet on the performance and blood metabolites of sows and their litters. Sows weighing 208.5 ± 18.34kg and their neonates were used. From day 114 of gestation to 21st day of lactation(weaning), ten multiparous sows (n = 5/treatment) (Landrace x Yorkshire) were assigned randomly into one of two treatments: CON (basal diet) and TRT (CON + 0.05% SA). There was no significant difference in the body weight, backfat thickness, backfat loss, and body condition score in SA treated sows compared to sows fed the CON diet. However, the bodyweight of sow was dramatically reduced by an average of 16kg from farrowing to weaning time. The dietary inclusion of SA in the sow diet slightly improved the survival rate (p = 0.065) and showed a higher body weight (p = 0.009) in piglets. However, there was no significant difference in red blood cell, Fe, Hematocrit, and Hb concentrations between CON and TRT sows' groups, but the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) was significantly reduced in sows from the TRT group compared with the CON group from the beginning to weaning. The outcome of this trial shows that dietary addition of SA on sows diet from early lactation could increase the birth weight and TIBC of neonates at the end of the trial.",0,2477
1690,35968082,Identification and characterization of a novel gene involved in glandular trichome development in Nepeta tenuifolia.,"Nepeta tenuifolia is a medicinal plant rich in terpenoids and flavonoids with antiviral, immunoregulatory, and anti-inflammatory activities. The peltate glandular trichome (PGT) is a multicellular structure considered to be the primary storage organ for monoterpenes; it may serve as an ideal model for studying cell differentiation and the development of glandular trichomes (GTs). The genes that regulate the development of GTs have not yet been well studied. In this study, we identified NtMIXTA1, a GT development-associated gene from the R2R3 MYB SBG9 family. NtMIXTA1 overexpression in tobacco resulted in the production of longer and denser GTs. Virus-induced gene silencing of NtMIXTA1 resulted in lower PGT density, a significant reduction in monoterpene concentration, and the decreased expression of genes related to monoterpene biosynthesis. Comparative transcriptome and widely targeted metabolic analyses revealed that silencing NtMIXTA1 significantly influenced the expression of genes, and the production of metabolites involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids, flavonoids, and lipids. This study provides a solid foundation describing a mechanism underlying the regulation of GT development. In addition, this study further deepens our understanding of the regulatory networks involved in GT development and GT development-associated metabolite flux, as well as provides valuable reference data for studying plants with a high medicinal value without genetic transformation.",0,2478
2119,35967399,Macrophages: A communication network linking Porphyromonas gingivalis infection and associated systemic diseases.,"Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is a Gram-negative anaerobic pathogen that is involved in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and systemic diseases. P. gingivalis has recently been detected in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cardiovascular disease, and tumors, as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the presence of P. gingivalis in these diseases are correlated with poor prognosis. Macrophages are major innate immune cells which modulate immune responses against pathogens, however, multiple bacteria have evolved abilities to evade or even subvert the macrophages' immune response, in which subsequently promote the diseases' initiation and progression. P. gingivalis as a keystone pathogen of periodontitis has received increasing attention for the onset and development of systemic diseases. P. gingivalis induces macrophage polarization and inflammasome activation. It also causes immune response evasion which plays important roles in promoting inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and tumor development. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries on the interaction of P. gingivalis and macrophages in relevant disease development and progression, such as periodontitis, atherosclerosis, RA, AD, and cancers, aiming to provide an in-depth mechanistic understanding of this interaction and potential therapeutic strategies.",0,2479
2339,35967038,Hydrochloride Salt of the GABAkine KRM-II-81.,"Imidazodiazepine (5-(8-ethynyl-6-(pyridin-2-yl)-4H-benzo[f]imidazole[1,5-α][1,4]diazepin-3-yl) oxazole or KRM-II-81) is a potentiator of GABAA receptors (a GABAkine) undergoing preparation for clinical development. KRM-II-81 is active against many seizure and pain models in rodents, where it exhibits improved pharmacological properties over standard-of-care agents. Since salts can be utilized to create opportunities for increased solubility, enhanced absorption, and distribution, as well as for efficient methods of bulk synthesis, a hydrochloride salt of KRM-II-81 was prepared. KRM-II-81·HCl was produced from the free base with anhydrous hydrochloric acid. The formation of the monohydrochloride salt was confirmed by X-ray crystallography, as well as 1H NMR and 13C NMR analyses. High water solubility and a lower partition coefficient (octanol/water) were exhibited by KRM-II-81·HCl as compared to the free base. Oral administration of either KRM-II-81·HCl or the free base resulted in high concentrations in the brain and plasma of rats. Oral dosing in mice significantly increased the latency to both clonic and tonic convulsions and decreased pentylenetetrazol-induced lethality. The increased water solubility of the HCl salt enables intravenous dosing and the potential for higher concentration formulations compared with the free base without impacting anticonvulsant potency. Thus, KRM-II-81·HCl adds an important new compound to facilitate the development of these imidazodiazepines for clinical evaluation.",0,2480
361,35979313,Intestinal mucosal barrier in functional constipation: Dose it change?,"The intestinal mucosal barrier is the first line of defense against numerous harmful substances, and it contributes to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. Recent studies reported that structural and functional changes in the intestinal mucosal barrier were involved in the pathogenesis of several intestinal diseases. However, no study thoroughly evaluated this barrier in patients with functional constipation (FC). To investigate the intestinal mucosal barrier in FC, including the mucus barrier, intercellular junctions, mucosal immunity and gut permeability. Forty FC patients who fulfilled the Rome IV criteria and 24 healthy controls were recruited in the Department of Gastroenterology of China-Japan Friendship Hospital. The colonic mucus barrier, intercellular junctions in the colonic epithelium, mucosal immune state and gut permeability in FC patients were comprehensively examined. Goblet cells were stained with Alcian Blue/Periodic acid Schiff (AB/PAS) and counted. The ultrastructure of intercellular junctional complexes was observed under an electron microscope. Occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in the colonic mucosa were located and quantified using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Colonic CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and CD3+ lymphocytes in the lamina propria were identified and counted using immunofluorescence. The serum levels of D-lactic acid and zonulin were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Compared to healthy controls, the staining of mucus secreted by goblet cells was darker in FC patients, and the number of goblet cells per upper crypt in the colonic mucosa was significantly increased in FC patients (control, 18.67 ± 2.99; FC, 22.42 ± 4.09; P = 0.001). The intercellular junctional complexes in the colonic epithelium were integral in FC patients. The distribution of mucosal occludin and ZO-1 was not altered in FC patients. No significant differences were found in occludin (control, 5.76E-2 ± 1.62E-2; FC, 5.17E-2 ± 1.80E-2; P = 0.240) and ZO-1 (control, 2.29E-2 ± 0.93E-2; FC, 2.68E-2 ± 1.60E-2; P = 0.333) protein expression between the two groups. The mRNA levels in occludin and ZO-1 were not modified in FC patients compared to healthy controls (P = 0.145, P = 0.451, respectively). No significant differences were observed in the number of CD3+ IELs per 100 epithelial cells (control, 5.62 ± 2.06; FC, 4.50 ± 2.16; P = 0.070) and CD3+ lamina propria lymphocytes (control, 19.69 ± 6.04/mm2; FC, 22.70 ± 11.38/mm2; P = 0.273). There were no significant differences in serum D-lactic acid [control, 5.21 (4.46, 5.49) mmol/L; FC, 4.63 (4.31, 5.42) mmol/L; P = 0.112] or zonulin [control, 1.36 (0.53, 2.15) ng/mL; FC, 0.94 (0.47, 1.56) ng/mL; P = 0.185] levels between FC patients and healthy controls. The intestinal mucosal barrier in FC patients exhibits a compensatory increase in goblet cells and integral intercellular junctions without activation of mucosal immunity or increased gut permeability.",0,2481
2291,35967140,Fetal Macrosomia Among Non-diabetic Women: Our Experience in a Developing Country.,"Background The prevalence of fetal macrosomia varies worldwide. Its trend has increased over the past decades in many developed nations. It is associated with various maternal and fetal complications. The information regarding the frequency of fetal macrosomia among non-diabetic women is limited in resource-limited countries such as Pakistan. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the number of fetal macrosomia cases among non-diabetic women. Methodology This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan. A total of 119 pregnant women were enrolled in the study. All pregnant women aged 15 to 45 years who had singleton pregnancies with any parity or gravida and a gestational age of ≥37 weeks were included in the study. Pregnant women with underlying chronic systemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, renal or cardiac disorders, and sickle cell anemia were excluded from the study. Women who did not consent to participate and those with a gestational age of ≥42 weeks at the time of delivery were also excluded from our study. Based on a 5.2% prevalence of fetal macrosomia in the general population, the sample size was calculated using the World Health Organization calculator at a confidence interval of 95%, absolute precision of 0.05 with anticipated population proportion, and a 4% margin of error. The required sample size was calculated at 119. The chi-square test was applied. P-values of ≤0.05 were considered significant. Results Out of 119 participants, fetal macrosomia among non-diabetic women was seen in 10 (8.4%) cases. The mean age of patients in our study was 29.80 ± 4.33 years. The mean gestational age was 36.05 ± 1.31 weeks, whereas the mean body mass index of participants was 29.17 ± 2.36 kg/m2. Post-stratification, spontaneous vaginal delivery was the only significant variable with a P-value of <0.05 in our study. Conclusions The number of fetal macrosomia among non-diabetic women in our study was 10 (8.4%). Because this was a single-center, hospital-based, cross-sectional study, we need to conduct large multi-centered randomized controlled studies to identify the actual prevalence of fetal macrosomia in non-diabetic women in our population.",0,2482
1739,35968003,"Measures of insulin sensitivity, leptin, and adiponectin concentrations in cats in diabetic remission compared to healthy control cats.","Firstly, to compare differences in insulin, adiponectin, leptin, and measures of insulin sensitivity between diabetic cats in remission and healthy control cats, and determine whether these are predictors of diabetic relapse. Secondly, to determine if these hormones are associated with serum metabolites known to differ between groups. Thirdly, if any of the hormonal or identified metabolites are associated with measures of insulin sensitivity. Twenty cats in diabetic remission for a median of 101 days, and 21 healthy matched control cats. A casual blood glucose measured on admission to the clinic. Following a 24 h fast, a fasted blood glucose was measured, and blood sample taken for hormone (i.e., insulin, leptin, and adiponectin) and untargeted metabolomic (GC-MS and LC-MS) analysis. A simplified IVGGT (1 g glucose/kg) was performed 3 h later. Cats were monitored for diabetes relapse for at least 9 months (270 days). Cats in diabetic remission had significantly higher serum glucose and insulin concentrations, and decreased insulin sensitivity as indicated by an increase in HOMA and decrease in QUICKI and Bennett indices. Leptin was significantly increased, but there was no difference in adiponectin (or body condition score). Several significant correlations were found between insulin sensitivity indices, leptin, and serum metabolites identified as significantly different between remission and control cats. No metabolites were significantly correlated with adiponectin. No predictors of relapse were identified in this study. Insulin resistance, an underlying factor in diabetic cats, persists in diabetic remission. Cats in remission should be managed to avoid further exacerbating insulin resistance.",0,2483

More recently, a significant impact of parental NAFLD in the offspring was demonstrated and has been widely discussed. However, pathogenetic pathways implicated in the inheritance by the offspring and relatives are still under debate. Probably, multiple mechanisms are involved as well as in NAFLD pathogenesis itself. Among the multifactorial involved mechanisms, genetic, epigenetic and environmental backgrounds are strongly related to NAFLD development in the offspring. Thus, based on recent evidence from the available literature concerning genetic, epigenetic and environmental disease modifiers, this review aimed to discuss the relationship between parental NAFLD and its impact on the offspring.",0,2484
1570,35968316,Analysis of routine blood parameters in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and evaluation of a possible correlation with disease progression-a multicenter study.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis is still unclear, its course is considerably variable, and prognosis is hard to determine. Despite much research, there is still a lack of easily accessible markers predicting prognosis. We investigated routine blood parameters in ALS patients regarding correlations with disease severity, progression rate, and survival. Additionally, we analyzed disease and patients' characteristics relating to baseline blood parameter levels. We analyzed creatine kinase (CK), albumin (ALB), creatinine (CREA), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and triglycerides (TG) levels around time of diagnosis in 1,084 ALS patients. We carried out linear regression analyses including disease and patients' characteristics with each blood parameter to detect correlations with them. Linear regression models were performed for ALSFRS-R at study entry, its retrospectively defined rate of decay and prospectively collected progression rate. Different survival analysis methods were used to examine associations between blood parameters and survival. We found higher CK (p-value 0.001), ALB (p-value <0.001), CREA (p-value <0.001), and HDL levels (p-value 0.044) at time of diagnosis being associated with better functional status according to ALSFRS-R scores at study entry. Additionally, higher CREA levels were associated with lower risk of death (p-value 0.003). Our results indicate potential of CK, ALB, CREA, and HDL as disease severity or progression markers, and may also provide clues to ALS pathogenesis. However, these values are highly dependent on other variables, and further careful, longitudinal analyses will be necessary to prove the relevance of our findings.",0,2485
2158,35967360,Research progress on the role of PKM2 in the immune response.,"Pyruvate kinase (PK) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate, and is responsible for the production of ATP during glycolysis. As another important isozyme of PK, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) exists in cells with high levels of nucleic acid synthesis, such as normal proliferating cells (e.g., lymphocytes and intestinal epithelial cells), embryonic cells, adult stem cells, and tumor cells. With further research, PKM2, as an important regulator of cellular pathophysiological activity, has attracted increasing attention in the process of autoimmune response and inflammatory. In this re]view, we examine the contribution of PKM2 to the human immune response. Further studies on the immune mechanisms of PKM2 are expected to provide more new ideas and drug targets for immunotherapy of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, guiding drug development and disease treatment.",0,2486
2134,35967384,CD8+ T cell trajectory subtypes decode tumor heterogeneity and provide treatment recommendations for hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Mounting evidence has revealed that the interactions and dynamic alterations among immune cells are critical in shaping the tumor microenvironment and ultimately map onto heterogeneous clinical outcomes. Currently, the underlying clinical significance of immune cell evolutions remains largely unexplored in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 3,817 immune cells and 1,750 HCC patients of 15 independent public datasets were retrieved. The Seurat and Monocle algorithms were used to depict T cell evolution, and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was further applied to identify the molecular classification. Subsequently, the prognosis, biological characteristics, genomic variations, and immune landscape among distinct clusters were decoded. The clinical efficacy of multiple treatment approaches was further investigated. According to trajectory gene expression, three heterogeneous clusters with different clinical outcomes were identified. C2, with a more advanced pathological stage, presented the most dismal prognosis relative to C1 and C3. Eight independent external cohorts validated the robustness and reproducibility of the three clusters. Further explorations elucidated C1 to be characterized as lipid metabolic HCC, and C2 was referred to as cell-proliferative HCC, whereas C3 was defined as immune inflammatory HCC. Moreover, C2 also displayed the most conspicuous genomic instability, and C3 was deemed as immune-hot, having abundant immune cells and an elevated expression of immune checkpoints. The assessments of therapeutic intervention suggested that patients in C1 were suitable for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization treatment, and patients in C2 were sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, while patients in C3 were more responsive to immunotherapy. We also identified numerous underlying therapeutic agents, which might be conducive to clinical transformation in the future. Our study developed three clusters with distinct characteristics based on immune cell evolutions. For specifically stratified patients, we proposed individualized treatment strategies to improve the clinical outcomes and facilitate the clinical management.",0,2487
1312,35970081,YY1/ITGA3 pathway may affect trophoblastic cells migration and invasion ability.,"Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is a disturbing pregnancy disorder experienced by ~2.5% of women attempting to conceive. The pathogenesis of RSA is still unclear. Previous findings revealed that transcription factor YIN-YANG 1(YY1) was related to the pathogenesis of RSA by influence trophoblastic cell invasion ability. Present study aimed to investigate more specific molecular mechanism of YY1 playing in trophoblastic cells. In our research, RNA-seq and Chip-seq were used to find significant changed genes between si-YY1(Knock down of YY1) HTR-8/SVneo cells(n = 3) and HTR-8/SVneo cells(n = 3). Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis results suggested that Integrins related pathway maybe necessary to biological functions of trophoblastic cells. Chip-seq dataset analysis results predict YY1 can regulate ITGA3/7 expression by binding to the promoter region of ITGA3/7. Furthermore, results from chip experiment, RT-PCR, Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay showed that YY1 was able to bind to the promoter region of ITGA3 and regulate ITGA3 mRNA and protein expression. However, ITGA7 could not be significant influenced by YY1. Besides, gene silencing experiment, Western blot and Immunofluorescence assay confirmed that both YY1 and ITGA3 can accelerate phosphorylation focal adhesion kinase and affect cytoskeleton formation in HTR-8/SVneo cells. In conclusion, YY1/ITGA3 play a critical role in trophoblast invasion ability by regulating cytoskeleton formation.",0,2488
1529,35968357,Different classes of antibiotics exhibit disparate negative impacts on the therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.,"It has been reported that antibiotics (ATBs) have adverse effect on the efficacy of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer patients. Since different classes of ATBs have different antibacterial spectrum, we aimed to study whether all ATBs had similar or different negative effects on the clinical outcomes of ICIs in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with advanced NSCLC who received ICIs were included in this retrospective study and grouped by the class of ATBs they had used around the ICIs treatment time. The overall survival (OS) and the progression free survival (PFS) of patients among these groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. A total of 148 eligible patients were enrolled, and 80 patients used ATBs. The results indicated that quinolones had no significant negative consequence on the clinical outcomes, while β-lactams significantly shortened the OS and PFS of patients. Furthermore, patients exposed to the combination of β-lactams and quinolones suffered the worst OS and PFS. Moreover, the subgroup analysis of β-lactams revealed that only penicillins, but not carbapenems and cephalosporins, markedly reduced both OS and PFS. In addition to the class of ATBs used, the time frame of ATBs used also affected the clinical outcomes of ICIs therapy. Patients receiving ATBs within 60 days prior to and 30 days after the initiation of ICI treatment had significantly shorter OS and PFS compared with those who did not use ATBs. This study demonstrated that different classes of ATBs had disparate negative impacts on the clinical outcomes, and the use of β-lactams, especially penicillins, should be avoided in advanced NSCLC patients who are receiving or scheduled to receive ICIs within 60 days.",0,2489
2421,35966875,A randomized triple-blind controlled clinical trial evaluation of sitagliptin in the treatment of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases without diabetes.,"The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of sitagliptin vs. placebo in treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In a triple-blind randomized clinical trial, we assigned 120 eligible subjects with NAFLD to receive daily dosing of 50 mg sitagliptin (n = 60) or the placebo (n = 60) for 56 weeks and lifestyle modification in both groups. Laboratory and anthropometric outcomes were measured, and liver stiffness was assessed using a fibroscan. The primary outcome measures were changes from baseline in fibrosis scores and liver transferases. Out of 120 patients randomized into sitagliptin and placebo groups, 76 patients completed the trial, of whom 44 were in the sitagliptin and 32 in the placebo groups. Patients receiving sitagliptin showed a significant decrease in the fibrosis scores (P = 0.001). The reductions in the alanine aminotransferase (AST) (P = 0.036) and aspartate AST (P < 0.001) levels were also statistically significant. The effect of sitagliptin in reducing fibrosis scores was significantly greater in normal-weight and overweight individuals than in obese individuals (p = 0.036, and p = 0.018, respectively), whereas the effects of sitagliptin on AST levels were greater among overweight/obese patients (p = 0.028, and p = 0.016, respectively). Sitagliptin reduced fibrosis scores and liver enzymes in NAFLD patients after 56 weeks of therapy. The changes in fibrosis scores were more prominent in patients with normal weight and overweight than obese patients, whereas the effects on AST levels were greater among overweight/obese patients. Other randomized trials with larger sample sizes and longer treatment durations may be required before precise results can be reached.

1306,35970132,Accuracy of bioimpedance equations for measuring body composition in a cohort of 2134 patients with obesity.,"Measuring body composition is an important issue to phenotype patients with obesity and to follow the nutritional care efficiency. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is a simple and rapid technique. However, validity of BIA in patients with obesity remains controversial. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the validity of several BIA equations to assess body composition in a large cohort of patients with obesity by using dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) as reference. Seven BIA equations have been retrospectively applied on electrical data measured by BIA in patients with obesity with BMI equal or higher than 30 kg/m2 and results were compared to DXA-derived fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM). BIA and DXA were done the same day after an overnight fasting. Results were compared with Bland-Altman method and Pearson correlation. We also calculated the accuracy defined as the percentage of patients with DXA-BIA difference within ± 10% of DXA measures for FFM and FM. Data from 2134 patients with class I and II obesity (ob1/2, n = 1452, 47.4 ± 14.2 y; 35.0 ± 2.7 kg.m-2) and class III obesity (ob3, n = 682, 48.2 ± 13.9 y; 44.1 ± 3.5 kg.m-2) were analyzed. The best results to evaluate FFM both in ob1/2 and ob3 groups were obtained with Roubenoff's equation: Bland Altman bias at -1.96 and -0.82 kg, Pearson correlation r at 0.93 and 0.87, accuracy at 75.7% and 83.3%, respectively. However, limits of agreements at 95% were high: [-9.42; 5.49 kg] and [-8.16; 6.52 kg]. For FM evaluation, Roubenoff's equation also showed best results for ob1/2 group (bias at -1.17 kg; correlation r at 0.89 and accuracy at 79.1%) but not for ob3 group. In this latter group, Deurenberg's equation exhibited the best results (bias at 2.09 kg; correlation r at 0.81 and accuracy at 76.8%). However, limits of agreements remained high. In patients with obesity, Roubenoff BIA equation should be recommended to assess fat free mass, even if limits of agreements remain high.",0,2491
2142,35967376,Innate immunity and microbial dysbiosis in hidradenitis suppurativa - vicious cycle of chronic inflammation.,"Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic multifactorial inflammatory skin disease with incompletely understood mechanisms of disease pathology. HS is characterized by aberrant activation of the innate immune system, resulting in activation of pathways that aim to protect against pathogenic microorganisms, and also contribute to failure to resolve inflammation. Imbalance in innate immunity is evident in deregulation of host antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and the complement system associated with the microbiome dysbiosis. The pathology is further complicated by ability of pathogens associated with HS to overcome host immune response. Potential roles of major AMPs, cathelicidin, defensins, dermcidin, S100 proteins, RNAse 7 and complement proteins are discussed. Dysregulated expression pattern of innate immunity components in conjunction with bacterial component of the disease warrants consideration of novel treatment approaches targeting both host immunity and pathogenic microbiome in HS.",0,2492
2130,35967388,Molecular profile reveals immune-associated markers of medulloblastoma for different subtypes.,"Medulloblastoma, a common pediatric malignant tumor, has been recognized to have four molecular subgroups [wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), group 3, group 4], which are defined by the characteristic gene transcriptomic and DNA methylomic profiles, and has distinct clinical features within each subgroup. The tumor immune microenvironment is integral in tumor initiation and progression and might be associated with therapeutic responses. However, to date, the immune infiltrative landscape of medulloblastoma has not yet been elucidated. Thus, we proposed MethylCIBERSORT to estimate the degree of immune cell infiltration and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to find modules of highly correlated genes. Synthesizing the hub genes in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and modules of the co-expression network, we identify three candidate biomarkers [GRB2-associated-binding protein 1 (GAB1), Abelson 1 (ABL1), and CXC motif chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)] via the molecular profiles of medulloblastoma. Given this, we investigated the correlation between these three immune hub genes and immune checkpoint blockade response and the potential of drug prediction further. In addition, this study demonstrated a higher presence of endothelial cells and infiltrating immune cells in Group 3 tumor bulk. The above results will be conducive to better comprehending the immune-related pathogenesis and treatment of medulloblastoma.",0,2493
2478,35966780,Identification and immunological characterization of cuproptosis-related molecular clusters in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common dementia with clinical and pathological heterogeneity. Cuproptosis is a recently reported form of cell death, which appears to result in the progression of various diseases. Therefore, our study aimed to explore cuproptosis-related molecular clusters in Alzheimer's disease and construct a prediction model. Based on the GSE33000 dataset, we analyzed the expression profiles of cuproptosis regulators and immune characteristics in Alzheimer's disease. Using 310 Alzheimer's disease samples, we explored the molecular clusters based on cuproptosis-related genes, along with the related immune cell infiltration. Cluster-specific differentially expressed genes were identified using the WGCNA algorithm. Subsequently, the optimal machine model was chosen by comparing the performance of the random forest model, support vector machine model, generalized linear model, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Nomogram, calibration curve, decision curve analysis, and three external datasets were applied for validating the predictive efficiency. The dysregulated cuproptosis-related genes and activated immune responses were determined between Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's disease controls. Two cuproptosis-related molecular clusters were defined in Alzheimer's disease. Analysis of immune infiltration suggested the significant heterogeneity of immunity between distinct clusters. Cluster2 was characterized by elevated immune scores and relatively higher levels of immune infiltration. Functional analysis showed that cluster-specific differentially expressed genes in Cluster2 were closely related to various immune responses. The Random forest machine model presented the best discriminative performance with relatively lower residual and root mean square error, and a higher area under the curve (AUC = 0.9829). A final 5-gene-based random forest model was constructed, exhibiting satisfactory performance in two external validation datasets (AUC = 0.8529 and 0.8333). The nomogram, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis also demonstrated the accuracy to predict Alzheimer's disease subtypes. Further analysis revealed that these five model-related genes were significantly associated with the Aβ-42 levels and β-secretase activity. Our study systematically illustrated the complicated relationship between cuproptosis and Alzheimer's disease, and developed a promising prediction model to evaluate the risk of cuproptosis subtypes and the pathological outcome of Alzheimer's disease patients.",0,2494
1780,35967877,eIF5A is activated by virus infection or dsRNA and facilitates virus replication through modulation of interferon production.,"Active hypusine-modified initiation elongation factor 5A is critical for cell proliferation and differentiation, embryonic development, and innate immune response of macrophages to bacterial infection. Here, we demonstrate that both virus infection and double-stranded RNA viral mimic stimulation induce the hypusination of eIF5A. Furthermore, we show that activation of eIF5A is essential for the replication of several RNA viruses including influenza A virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, chikungunya virus, mayaro virus, una virus, zika virus, and punta toro virus. Finally, our data reveal that inhibition of eIF5A hypusination using the spermidine analog GC7 or siRNA-mediated downmodulation of eIF5A1 induce upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress marker proteins and trigger the transcriptional induction of interferon and interferon-stimulated genes, mechanisms that may explain the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of eIF5A inhibition.",0,2495
1833,35967807,Potential health benefits of lowering gas production and bifidogenic effect of the blends of polydextrose with inulin in a human gut model.,"Polydextrose is a nutrient supplement, which is widely applied in the food industry. The use of polydextrose in combination with prebiotics and probiotics has recently increased, whereas the fermentation properties of its blend have not yet been fully revealed. We evaluated the metabolic profile of polydextrose, inulin, and their blends by a batch in vitro fermentation of fifteen human fecal inocula. After 24 h of fermentation, polydextrose increased the production of gas, ammonia, and several short chain fatty acids, including propionate and butyrate, when compared to its blends, inulin, and fructo-oligosaccharides. Furthermore, polydextrose had the slowest degradation rate of all the carbohydrates tested, consistent with its partial fermentation in the distal colon. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of the gut microbiome exhibited significantly increased relative abundance of Clostridium_XVIII, Megamonas, Mitsuokella, and Erysipelotrichaceae_incertae_sedis in polydextrose compared to other carbohydrates. On the other hand, the blends of polydextrose and inulin (1:1 or 2:1) showed reduced gas production and similar bifidogenicity to inulin alone. The blends not only had similar alpha-diversity and PCoA to inulin but also had a similar abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, suggesting potential health benefits. Also their low gas production was likely due to the abundance of Faecalibacterium and Anaerostipes, which were negatively correlated with gas production. Additionally, our in vitro fermentation model shows advantages in the large-scale assessment of fermentation performance.",0,2496
1791,35967864,Healed Lesions of Human Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Caused By Leishmania major Do Not Shelter Persistent Residual Parasites.,"In human cutaneous leishmaniasis (HCL) caused by Leishmania (L.) major, the cutaneous lesions heal spontaneously and induce a Th1-type immunity that confers solid protection against reinfection. The same holds true for the experimental leishmaniasis induced by L. major in C57BL/6 mice where residual parasites persist after spontaneous clinical cure and induce sustainable memory immune responses and resistance to reinfection. Whether residual parasites also persist in scars of cured HCL caused by L. major is still unknown. Cutaneous scars from 53 volunteers with healed HCL caused by L. major were biopsied and the tissue sample homogenates were analyzed for residual parasites by four methods: i) microscope detection of amastigotes, ii) parasite culture by inoculation on biphasic medium, iii) inoculation of tissue exctracts to the footpad of BALB/c mice, an inbred strain highly susceptible to L. major, and iv) amplification of parasite kDNA by a highly sensitive real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Our results show that the scars of healed lesions of HCL caused by L. major do not contain detectable residual parasites, suggesting that this form likely induces a sterile cure at least within the scars. This feature contrasts with other Leishmania species causing chronic, diffuse, or recidivating forms of leishmaniasis where parasites do persist in healed lesions. The possibility that alternative mechanisms to parasite persistence are needed to boost and maintain long-term immunity to L. major, should be taken into consideration in vaccine development against L. major infection.",0,2497
870,35974853,Bigger Is Not Always Better: Effects of Electrocautery Setting on Tissue Injury in a Porcine Model.,"Introduction Electrosurgery for dissection and hemostasis remains one of the foundational tools for the field of surgery as a whole. Monopolar cautery remains the most utilized modality for achieving the aforementioned goals. Given the prolonged history and pre-modern development of Bovie cautery, there remains a paucity of data regarding appropriate settings and intensity for various tissue types, procedures, or locales. As a result, utilized settings depend on precedent and personal preference. We aimed to determine the amount of secondary soft tissue injury by volume and depth beyond the electrocautery pen tip in the skin and subcutaneous tissue as well as skeletal muscle.  Methods Porcine samples were used for experimental testing using two testing types: 1) skin and subcutaneous tissue and 2) Skeletal muscle. Sample sizes were standardized at 1 cm3 cubes. For skin samples, tissue injury was created with either a scalpel or electrocautery pen on cut setting, and tested at intensities from 10 to 150 in increments of 10. Skeletal muscle samples were similarly tested using the electrocautery pen only in either a cut or coagulation setting. Samples were tested at incremental intensities from 10 to 120 for both settings. Electrocautery was tested for a period of five seconds with a continuous current. All samples were placed in formalin and underwent histologic staining with hematoxylin and eosin staining to be assessed for the extent of tissue injury in terms of depth, radius, and volume. The measurements were recorded in millimeters. Results For skin incision, there was a positive and significant correlation with respect to the radius (R=.73, p=0.006). When considering intensity with an interval of 10-70 there was a positive and significant correlation with respect to the radius, depth, and volume. The cold knife incision had no notable soft tissue injury beyond the depth of the incision. Regarding skeletal muscle, again, a significant and positive correlation between increasing monopolar settings was noted for both the coagulation and cut functions (R=.84, p=.0005; R=0.84, p=0.0006). A positive correlation was found between increasing cut intensity and volume of soft tissue injury (R=0.73, p=.008); this was not reflected in the coagulation setting. When limited to an intensity range of 10-60, a significant relationship was noted for depth, radius and volume (R=.95, p= <0.001; R=0.98, p= <.001; R=.92, p=.001). Conclusion In all samples, apart from the cold knife skin incision, additional soft tissue injury beyond the tip of the electrocautery pen was noted. Given our findings, recommendations include using the lowest setting required for the purposes of the given surgical case as well as minimizing electrocautery use for skin incisions given its association with a larger volume of tissue injury in comparison with a scalpel. Additionally, electrocautery should be used with care in, and around neurovascular structures as soft tissue injury did occur several millimeters beyond the tip of the electrocautery pen. Further study is needed to see if these patterns are similar in living animals as well as human tissue and whether they bear any clinical impact on surgical wound healing or other surgical complications.",0,2498
222,35982798,Infection order outweighs the role of CD4+ T cells in tertiary flavivirus exposure.,The link between CD4+ T and B cells during immune responses to DENV and ZIKV and their roles in cross-protection during heterologous infection is an active area of research. Here we used CD4+ lymphocyte depletions to dissect the impact of cellular immunity on humoral responses during a tertiary flavivirus infection in macaques. We show that CD4+ depletion in DENV/ZIKV-primed animals followed by DENV resulted in dysregulated adaptive immune responses. We show a delay in DENV-specific IgM/IgG antibody titers and binding and neutralization in the DENV/ZIKV-primed CD4-depleted animals but not in ZIKV/DENV-primed CD4-depleted animals. This study confirms the critical role of CD4+ cells in priming an early effective humoral response during sequential flavivirus infections. Our work here suggests that the order of flavivirus exposure affects the outcome of a tertiary infection. Our findings have implications for understanding the complex flavivirus immune responses and for the development of effective flavivirus vaccines.,0,2499
1151,35973768,Activating transcription factor 2 (AccATF2) regulates tolerance to oxidative stress in Apis cerana cerana.,"Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, plays a crucial role in immune and DNA damage response in mammals. However, the function of ATF2 in insects remains unknown. Here, we isolated the ATF2 gene from Apis cerana cerana (AccATF2) and found that AccATF2 was a main regulator of the honeybee response to oxidative stress. Our results showed that AccATF2 was highly expressed in the head, thorax and integument. AccATF2 was expressed throughout the development period of honeybees, and the highest AccATF2 transcript level was noted in brown-eyed pupae, indicating its indispensable roles in honeybee survival. Antioxidant function analysis showed that AccATF2 expression was markedly induced in response to oxidative stress caused by various environmental stresses. AccATF2 overexpression substantially enhanced the tolerance to oxidative stress of Escherichia coli cells compared with control cells. AccATF2 knockdown significantly increased the production of malondialdehyde (MDA), the transcription of antioxidant genes and the activity of antioxidant enzymes in honeybees, suggesting that AccATF2 knockdown resulted in oxidative damage to honeybees. Moreover, AccATF2 knockdown decreased honeybee resistance to oxidative stress caused by high temperature. Overall, AccATF2 plays an important role in maintaining redox homeostasis and protecting honeybees from oxidative stress caused by various environmental stimuli. Our discoveries add to a growing understanding of how honeybees cope with various adverse environmental conditions to ensure their survival.",0,2500
