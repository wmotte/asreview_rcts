Ham. ex Sm. is a perennial rhizomatous herb belonging to the family Zingiberaceae. The aim of the present study was to compare the chemical composition and biological activities of H. coccineum rhizome essential oil (HCCRO) and H. coccineum aerial part essential oil (HCCAO). The plant material was subjected to hydro-distillation using Clevenger's apparatus in order to obtain volatile oil and analyzed for its chemical constituents using GC-MS. The comparative study of the rhizome and aerial part essential oils of H. coccineum displayed that (E)-nerolidol (15.9%), bornyl acetate (13.95%), davanone B (10.9%), spathulenol (8.9%), and 1, 8-cineol (8.5%) contributed majorly to the HCCRO, while 7-hydroxyfarnesen (15.5%), α-farnesene (11.1%), α-pinene (10.9%), spathulenol (7.7%), and β-pinene (6.8%) were present as major constituents in the HCCAO. Both the essential oils were studied for their biological activities, such as nematicidal, insecticidal, herbicidal, antifungal, and antibacterial activities. The essential oils exhibited significant nematicidal activity against Meloidogyne incognita, insecticidal activity against Spodoptera litura, and moderate herbicidal activity against R. raphanistrum sub sp. sativus, and good antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum and Curvularialunata. Essential oils were also tested for antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. Both oils showed good to moderate activity against the tested pathogens. The significant nematicidal, insecticidal, herbicidal, antifungal, and antibacterial activities of both the essential oils might be helpful for the development of environmentally friendly pesticides that could be an alternative to synthetic pesticides in the future.","misc","wim","misc"

In defense, plants can increase the production of secondary metabolites in order to mitigate the harmful effects caused by them. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of two types of copper salts (CuSO4 and Cu(NO3)2), added in two different amounts in soil (150 mg/kg, respectively 300 mg/kg), on assimilating pigments, total polyphenols, antioxidant activity and the elemental composition of wheat. The obtained results were compared with those from control plants grown in the same conditions but without copper salts. The amount of assimilating pigments, total polyphenols, and antioxidant activity respectively increases or decreases in the plants treated with copper salts compared to the control depending on the stage of development of the plant. No significant damage induced in the leaves of the wheat plants treated with the selected salts was observed following the TEM analysis. In six-week-old plants it was observed by EDX analysis that the salts are transformed into nanoparticles. The bioactive compounds, elemental composition and their interaction is influenced by concentration of metal's salt, type of salt and exposure period.","misc","wim","misc"

The influence of CO2 and N2 gases during the carbonization process on the porosity of AC were studied. The highest specific surface area of AC was estimated at 1300 to 1500 m2/g, which presented characteristics of microporous materials. SEM micrographs revealed that chemical activation using an impregnation reagent ZnCl2 increases the porosity of the AC, which in turn leads to an increase in the surface area, and the SEM image showed that particle size diameter ranged between 48.88 and 69.95 nm. The performance of prepared AC for adsorption of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) dye was tested. The results showed that the adsorption percentage by AC (2.5 g/L) was equal to 94.76% after just 15 min, and the percentage of removal increased to be ~100% after 60 min. The maximum adsorption capacity was 473.93 mg g-1. A Langmuir model (LM) shows the best-fitted equilibrium isotherm, and the kinetic data fitted better to the pseudo-second-order and Film diffusion models. The removal of AO7 dye using AC from Pisum sativum pods was optimized using a response factor model (RSM), and the results were reported.","misc","wim","misc"

The technical opportunities to reach this high-level control have considerably evolved since 2004 due to the development of advanced analytical sensors and chemometric tools. However, their transfer to the highly regulated pharmaceutical sector has been limited. To this respect, data fusion strategies have been extensively applied in different sectors, such as food or chemical, to provide a more robust performance of the analytical platforms. This survey evaluates the challenges and opportunities of implementing data fusion within the PAT concept by identifying transfer opportunities from other sectors. Special attention is given to the data types available from pharmaceutical manufacturing and their compatibility with data fusion strategies. Furthermore, the integration into Pharma 4.0 is discussed.","misc","wim","misc"

The present study evaluated the total phenolic and investigated the blood-glucose-lowering potential of different aqueous extracts of this selected truffle using in vitro and in vivo models. The phytochemical profile was examined using UPLC-MS. The macerate and the microwave-assisted extract were the richest in phenolic compounds. All T. claveryi extracts exhibited a remarkable α-glucosidase inhibitory effect in vitro, with an IC50 of 2.43, 3.26, 5.18 and 3.31 mg/mL for the aqueous microwave-assisted extract macerate, infusion and decoction, respectively. On the other hand, in the high-fat diet alloxan-induced diabetic mice model, all tested crude aqueous extracts exhibited a significant antihyperglycemic activity (p &lt; 0.05). Four hours after the administration of the 250 mg/kg dose, the macerate was able to induce a 29.4% blood-glucose-lowering effect compared to a 24.8% reduction induced by the infusion, which was sustained for a further two hours. The hypoglycemic effect (29.3% and 32.4%) was also recorded six hours after the administration of the single dose 500 mg/kg of the macerate and the infusion, respectively. Truffle extracts exhibited antidiabetic activity both in vitro and in vivo, providing a rationale for the traditional use as a natural hypoglycemic.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"6",35956795,"Fit-for-Purpose Assessment of QuEChERS LC-MS/MS Methods for Environmental Monitoring of Organotin Compounds in the Bottom Sediments of the Odra River Estuary.","Organotin compounds (OTCs) are among the most hazardous substances found in the marine environment and can be determined by either the ISO 23161 method based on extraction with non-polar organic solvents and gas chromatography analysis or by the recently developed QuEChERS method coupled to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). To date, the QuEChERS LC/MS and ISO 23161 methods have not been compared in terms of their fit-for-purpose and reliability in the determination of OTCs in bottom sediments. In the case of ISO 23161, due to a large number of interferences gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was not suitable for the determination of OTCs contrary to more selective determination by gas chromatography with an atomic emission detector. Moreover, it has been found that the derivatization of OTCs to volatile compounds, which required prior gas chromatography determination, was strongly affected by the sediments' matrices. As a result, a large amount of reagent was needed for the complete derivatization of the compounds. Contrary to ISO 23161, the QuEChERS LC-MS/MS method did not require the derivatization of OTC and is less prone to interferences. Highly volatile and toxic solvents were not used in the QuEChERS LC-MS/MS method. This makes the method more environmentally friendly according to the principles of green analytical chemistry. QuEChERS LC-MS/MS is suitable for fast and reliable environmental monitoring of OTCs in bottom sediments from the Odra River estuary. However, determination of di- and monobutyltin by the QuEChERS LC-MS/MS method was not possible due to the constraints of the chromatographic system. Hence, further development of this method is needed for monitoring di- and monobutyltin in bottom sediments.","misc","wim","misc"
"7",35956799,"The Distance between Minima of Electron Density and Electrostatic Potential as a Measure of Halogen Bond Strength.","In this study, we present results of a detailed topological analysis of electron density (ED) of 145 halogen-bonded complexes formed by various fluorine-, chlorine-, bromine-, and iodine-containing compounds with trimethylphosphine oxide, Me3PO. To characterize the halogen bond (XB) strength, we used the complexation enthalpy, the interatomic distance between oxygen and halogen, as well as the typical set of electron density properties at the bond critical points calculated at B3LYP/jorge-ATZP level of theory. We show for the first time that it is possible to predict the XB strength based on the distance between the minima of ED and molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) along the XB path. The gap between ED and ESP minima exponentially depends on local electronic kinetic energy density at the bond critical point and tends to be a common limiting value for the strongest halogen bond.","misc","wim","misc"

The practical use of SC devices is hindered by their low energy density and poor rate capability due to the binding agents in fabricating electrodes. Herein, we proposed flower-like highly open-structured binder-free ZnCo2O4 micro-flowers composed of nanosheets supported in nickel foam (ZnCoO@NF) with improved rate capability up to 91.8% when current varied from 2 to 20 A·g-1. The ZnCoO@NF electrode exhibited a superior specific capacitance of 1132 F·g-1 at 2 A·g-1 and revealed 99% cycling stability after 7000 cycles at a high current density of 20 A·g-1. The improved performance of the ZnCoO@NF electrode is attributed to the highly stable structure of the micro/nano-multiscale architecture, which provides both the high conduction of electrons and fast ionic transportation paths simultaneously.","misc","wim","misc"
"9",35956801,"Actions of Novel Angiotensin Receptor Blocking Drugs, Bisartans, Relevant for COVID-19 Therapy: Biased Agonism at Angiotensin Receptors and the Beneficial Effects of Neprilysin in the Renin Angiotensin System.","Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) used in the treatment of hypertension and potentially in SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit inverse agonist effects at angiotensin AR1 receptors, suggesting the receptor may have evolved to accommodate naturally occurring angiotensin 'antipeptides'. Screening of the human genome has identified a peptide (EGVYVHPV) encoded by mRNA, complementary to that encoding ANG II itself, which is an inverse agonist. Thus, opposite strands of DNA encode peptides with opposite effects at AR1 receptors. Agonism and inverse agonism at AR1 receptors can be explained by a receptor 'switching' between an activated state invoking receptor dimerization/G protein coupling and an inverse agonist state mediated by an alternative/second messenger that is slow to reverse. Both receptor states appear to be driven by the formation of the ANG II charge-relay system involving TyrOH-His/imidazole-Carboxylate (analogous to serine proteases). In this system, tyrosinate species formed are essential for activating AT1 and AT2 receptors. ANGII is also known to bind to the zinc-coordinated metalloprotease angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) used by the COVID-19 virus to enter cells. Here we report in silico results demonstrating the binding of a new class of anionic biphenyl-tetrazole sartans ('Bisartans') to the active site zinc atom of the endopeptidase Neprilysin (NEP) involved in regulating hypertension, by modulating humoral levels of beneficial vasoactive peptides in the RAS such as vasodilator angiotensin (1-7). In vivo and modeling evidence further suggest Bisartans can inhibit ANG II-induced pulmonary edema and may be useful in combatting SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting ACE2-mediated viral entry to cells.","misc","wim","misc"

Previous studies have shown that nicotine has a potential inhibitory effect on the toxicity of NNK. However, due to the lack of CYP2A13 activity in conventional lung cell lines, there had been no systematic in vitro investigation for the key target organ, the lung. Here, BEAS-2B cells stably expressing CYP2A13 (B-2A13 cells) were constructed to investigate the effects of nicotine on the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of NNK. The results showed more sensitivity for NNK-induced cytotoxicity in B-2A13 cells than in BEAS-2B and B-vector cells. NNK significantly induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and chromosomal damage in B-2A13 cells, but had no significant effect on BEAS-2B cells and the vector control cells. The combination of different concentration gradient of nicotine without cytotoxic effects and a single concentration of NNK reduced or even counteracted the cytotoxicity and multi-dimensional genotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, CYP2A13 caused the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of NNK in BEAS-2B cells, and the addition of nicotine could inhibit the toxicity of NNK.","misc","wim","misc"
"11",35956807,"Biofilm-i: A Platform for Predicting Biofilm Inhibitors Using Quantitative Structure-Relationship (QSAR) Based Regression Models to Curb Antibiotic Resistance.","Antibiotic drug resistance has emerged as a major public health threat globally. One of the leading causes of drug resistance is the colonization of microorganisms in biofilm mode. Hence, there is an urgent need to design novel and highly effective biofilm inhibitors that can work either synergistically with antibiotics or individually. Therefore, we have developed a recursive regression-based platform Biofilm-i employing a quantitative structure-activity relationship approach for making generalized predictions, along with group and species-specific predictions of biofilm inhibition efficiency of chemical(s). The platform encompasses eight predictors, three analysis tools, and data visualization modules. The experimentally validated biofilm inhibitors for model development were retrieved from the aBiofilm resource and processed using a 10-fold cross-validation approach using the support vector machine and andom forest machine learning techniques. The data was further sub-divided into training/testing and independent validation sets. From training/testing data sets the Pearson's correlation coefficient of overall chemicals, Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, fungus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Escherichia coli was 0.60, 0.77, 0.62, 0.77, 0.73, 0.83, 0.70, and 0.71 respectively via Support Vector Machine. Further, all the QSAR models performed equally well on independent validation data sets. Additionally, we also checked the performance of the random forest machine learning technique for the above datasets. The integrated analysis tools can convert the chemical structure into different formats, search for a similar chemical in the aBiofilm database and design the analogs. Moreover, the data visualization modules check the distribution of experimentally validated biofilm inhibitors according to their common scaffolds. The Biofilm-i platform would be of immense help to researchers engaged in designing highly efficacious biofilm inhibitors for tackling the menace of antibiotic drug resistance.","misc","wim","misc"

The effects of Ce/Mn ratio and thermal calcination temperature on the NH3-SCR activity of the CeO2-MnO2 nanocomposites were studied comprehensively. The as-prepared CeO2-MnO2 catalysts show high NOx reduction efficiency in the temperature range of 150-300 °C, with a complete NOx conversion at 200 °C for the optimal sample. The excellent NH3-SCR performance could be ascribed to high surface area, intimate contact, and strong synergistic interaction between CeO2 nanoparticles and MnO2 nanoflowers of the well-designed composite catalyst. The in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTs) characterizations evidence that the SCR reaction on the surface of the CeO2-MnO2 nanocomposites mainly follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism. Our work provides useful guidance for the development of composite oxide-based low temperature NH3-SCR catalysts.","misc","wim","misc"

The presented review focuses on modern alternatives for the production of wood-based panels; i.e., substitutes for formaldehyde in the production of amino and phenolic resins, as well as novel hardeners for formaldehyde-free wood adhesives. Solutions in which formaldehyde in completely replaced are presented in this review. Recent advances indicate that it is possible to develop new formaldehyde-free systems of resins with compatible hardeners. The formaldehyde substitutes that have primarily been tested are glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and dimethoxyethanal. The use of such substitutes eliminates the problem of free formaldehyde emission originating from the resin used in the production of wood-based panels. However, these alternatives are mostly characterized by worse reactivity, and, as a result, the use of formaldehyde-free resins may affect the mechanical and strength properties of wood-based panels. Nonetheless, there are still many substantial challenges for the complete replacement of formaldehyde and further research is needed, especially in the field of transferring the technology to industrial practice.","misc","wim","misc"

In this study, biochars were prepared by the co-pyrolysis of cotton stalk with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in the proportions of 1:0, 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1 (w/w) at 400 °C, 450 °C, and 500 °C and maintaining them for 1 h. The effects of the co-pyrolysis of cotton stalk with LDPE on the properties of biochars (e.g., pH, yield, elemental analysis, specific surface area, etc.) and the Pb(II) removal capacity were analyzed. Co-pyrolysis cotton stalks with LDPE could delay the decomposition of LDPE but could promote the decomposition of cotton stalk. At 400 °C and 450 °C, the addition of LDPE decreased the H/C ratio, while no significant difference was found between the pristine biochar and the blended biochar pyrolyzed at 500 °C. An FTIR analysis indicated that the surface functional groups of biochar were not affected by the addition of LDPE, except for CH3 and CH2. The results of the SEM showed that LDPE could cover the surface of biochar when pyrolyzed at 400 °C, while many macropores were found in the blended biochar that was pyrolyzed at 450 °C and 500 °C, thus increasing its surface area. The blended biochar that was pyrolyzed at 500 °C was more effective in the removal of Pb(II) than the cotton-stalk-derived biochar, which was dominated by monolayer adsorption with a maximum adsorption capacity of approximately 200 mg·g-1. These results suggested that the co-pyrolysis of cotton stalks and LDPE may be used to produce biochar, which is a cost-effective adsorbent for heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions.","misc","wim","misc"

Chemical protein synthesis allows preparation of ubiquitinated and phosphorylated proteins to study their biochemical properties in great detail. However, monitoring these modifications in intact cells or in cell extracts mostly depends on antibodies, which often have off-target binding. Here, we report that the most widely used antibody for ubiquitin (Ub) phosphorylated at serine 65 (pUb) has significant off-targets that appear during mitosis.

Cell viability was monitored by an MTT assay. The occurrence of apoptosis was evaluated by detecting caspase-3 activation and chromatin fragmentation. The ability of these compounds to induce autophagy was analysed by monitoring two markers of the autophagic process, LC3 and p62. Our results indicated that all cardenolides had cytotoxic effects, with IC50 ranging from 0.127 to 6.285 μM. All compounds were able to induce apoptosis and autophagy, calactin being the most active one. Some of them also caused a reduction in cell migration and a partial block of the cell cycle into the S-phase.

In this study, the effects of different denaturants on the properties of a hot-pressed peanut meal (HPM)-based adhesive before and after crosslinking were studied. Papain, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), urea and crosslinker-polyamide epichlorohydrin (PAE) were used to prepare HPM-based adhesives. The functional groups, bonding strength, thermal behaviors, mass loss, moisture uptake value, viscosity and fracture surface of adhesive samples were analyzed. As a result, (1) papain was used to break HPM protein (HPMP) into polypeptide chains and to reduce the water resistance. (2) SDS and urea unfold the HPMP molecule and expose internal hydrophobic groups to improve the water resistance of the adhesive. (3) A denser network structure was formed by PAE and HPMP molecules, which significantly improved the bonding strength and water resistance of adhesives. In particular, after SDS denaturation and PAE crosslinking, compared with pure HPM adhesive, the wet shear strength increased by 96.4%, the mass loss and moisture uptake value reduced by 41.4% and 69.4%, and viscosity increased by 30.4%.

Therefore, developing electrode materials with high energy density, high electrochemical activity, and remarkable flexibility is challenging. Herein, we designed nitrogen-doped porous MXene (N-MXene), using melamine-formaldehyde (MF) microspheres as a template and nitrogen source. We combined it with an electrospinning process to produce a highly flexible nitrogen-doped porous MXene nanofiber (N-MXene-F) as a self-supporting electrode material and assembled it into a symmetrical supercapacitor (SSC). On the one hand, the interconnected mesh structure allows the electrolyte to penetrate the porous network to fully infiltrate the material surface, shortening the ion transport channels; on the other hand, the uniform nitrogen doping enhances the pseudocapacitive performance. As a result, the as-assembled SSC exhibited excellent electrochemical performance and excellent long-term durability, achieving an energy density of 12.78 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 1080 W kg-1, with long-term cycling stability up to 5000 cycles.

In this study, we succeeded in detecting the interaction of low-molecular-weight (LMW) compounds with a membrane protein mixture derived from cultured cells expressing target membrane proteins by using the size exclusion chromatography-mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) method under the condition of 0.001% lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol as detergent and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. This method allowed us to analyze the interaction of a mixture of medicinal herbal ingredients with a mixture of membrane proteins to identify the two interacting ingredients. As it does not require specialized equipment (e.g., a two-dimensional liquid chromatography system), this SEC-MS method enables the analysis of interactions between LMW compounds and relatively high-expressed membrane proteins without immobilization or derivatization of the molecules.","misc","wim","misc"
"25",35956841,"A Preliminary Assessment of the Nutraceutical Potential of Acai Berry (Euterpe sp.) as a Potential Natural Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by progressive neuronal atrophy and the loss of neuronal function as a consequence of multiple pathomechanisms. Current AD treatments primarily operate at a symptomatic level to treat a cholinergic deficiency and can cause side effects. Hence, there is an unmet need for healthier lifestyles to reduce the likelihood of AD as well as improved treatments with fewer adverse reactions. Diets rich in phytochemicals may reduce neurodegenerative risk and limit disease progression. The native South American palm acai berry (Euterpe oleraceae) is a potential source of dietary phytochemicals beneficial to health. This study aimed to screen the nutraceutical potential of the acai berry, in the form of aqueous and ethanolic extracts, for the ability to inhibit acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase (ChE) enzymes and scavenge free radicals via 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) or 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assays. In addition, this study aimed to quantify the acai berry's antioxidant potential via hydrogen peroxide or hydroxyl scavenging, nitric oxide scavenging, lipid peroxidation inhibition, and the ability to reduce ferric ions. Total polyphenol and flavonoid contents were also determined. Acai aqueous extract displayed a concentration-dependent inhibition of acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase enzymes. Both acai extracts displayed useful concentration-dependent free radical scavenging and antioxidant abilities, with the acai ethanolic extract being the most potent antioxidant and displaying the highest phenolic and flavonoid contents. In summary, extracts of the acai berry contain nutraceutical components with anti-cholinesterase and antioxidant capabilities and may therefore provide a beneficial dietary component that limits the pathological deficits evidenced in AD.","misc","wim","misc"

Herein, we compared the modulation and consequent pharmacological effects of oral administration of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-loaded β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) NPs (EGCG@β-CD NPs) and EGCG on gut microbiota. EGCG@β-CD NPs were prepared using self-assembly and their influence on the intestinal microbiome structure was analyzed using a metagenomics approach. The Encapsulation efficiency (EE), particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential of EGCG@β-CD NPs were recorded as 98.27 ± 0.36%, 124.6 nm, 0.313 and -24.3 mV, respectively. Surface morphology of EGCG@β-CD NPs was observed as spherical. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and molecular docking studies confirmed that EGCG could be well encapsulated in β-CD and formed as EGCG@β-CD NPs. After being continuously administered EGCG@β-CD NPs for 8 weeks, the serum cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the rats were significantly decreased, while the levels of catalase (CAT) and apolipoprotein-A1 (apo-A1) in the liver increased significantly in the hyperlipidemia model of rats, when compared to the high-fat-diet group. Furthermore, metagenomic analysis revealed that the ratio of Verrucomicrobia/Bacteroidetes was altered and Bacteroidetes decreased in the high-fat diet +200 mg/kg·bw EGCG@β-CD NPs group, while the abundance of Verrucomicrobia was significantly increased, especially Akkermansia muciniphila in rat feces.

This study aimed to characterize the chemical profile of the essential oil isolated from leaves of Backhousia citriodora (BCEO) and its biological properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, and antibiofilm activities. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 21 compounds were identified in BCEO, representing 98.50% of the total oil content. The isomers of citral, geranial (52.13%), and neral (37.65%) were detected as the main constituents. The evaluation of DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power showed that BCEO exhibited strong antioxidant activity at IC50 of 42.57 μg/mL and EC50 of 20.03 μg/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity results showed that BCEO exhibited stronger antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) than against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). For the agar disk diffusion method, S. epidermidis was the most sensitive to BCEO with an inhibition zone diameter of 50.17 mm, followed by S. aureus (31.13 mm), E. coli (20.33 mm), and K. pneumoniae (12.67 mm). The results from the microdilution method showed that BCEO exhibited the highest activity against S. epidermidis and S. aureus, with the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 6.25 μL/mL. BCEO acts as a potent antibiofilm agent with dual actions, inhibiting (85.10% to 96.44%) and eradicating (70.92% to 90.73%) of the biofilms formed by the four tested bacteria strains, compared with streptomycin (biofilm inhibition, 67.65% to 94.29% and biofilm eradication, 49.97% to 89.73%). This study highlights that BCEO can potentially be a natural antioxidant agent, antibacterial agent, and antibiofilm agent that could be applied in the pharmaceutical and food industries.

Almost 75% of FDA-approved drugs are mainly nitrogen- and sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds, implying the importance of such compounds in drug discovery. Among heterocycles, thiazole-based heterocyclic compounds have demonstrated a broad range of pharmacological activities. In the present study, a novel set of 1,3-thiazole derivatives was designed and synthesized based on the coupling of acetophenone derivatives, and phenacyl bromide was substituted as a key reaction step. The activity of synthesized compounds was screened against the proliferation of two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). Almost all compounds exhibited a considerable antiproliferative activity toward the breast cancer cells as compared to staurosporine, with no significant cytotoxicity toward the epithelial cells. Among the synthesized compounds, compound 4 exhibited the most potent antiproliferative activity, with an IC50 of 5.73 and 12.15 µM toward MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, compared to staurosporine (IC50 = 6.77 and 7.03 µM, respectively). Exploring the mechanistic insights responsible for the antiproliferative activity of compound 4 revealed that compound 4 possesses a significant inhibitory activity toward the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) with (IC50 = 0.093 µM) compared to Sorafenib (IC50 = 0.059 µM). Further, compound 4 showed the ability to induce programmed cell death by triggering apoptosis and necrosis in MCF-7 cells and to induce cell cycle arrest on MCF-7 cells at the G1 stage while decreasing the cellular population in the G2/M phase. Finally, detailed in silico molecular docking studies affirmed that this class of compounds possesses a considerable binding affinity toward VEGFR2 proteins.

This research incorporates ultrasonic extraction to extract the aromatic compound in pandan leaves. The parameters varied in this study are the extraction time, sonicator amplitude, concentration of solvent and the mass of pandan leaves. The experiment was conducted using a central composite design (CCD) model generated by the response surface methodology (RSM). From the extraction process, it can be deduced that the effect of leaves' mass is comparably higher than other parameters, while sonicator amplitude gives the most negligible impact on the process. The obtained p-value was 0.0014, which was less than 0.05. The high R-squared 0.9603 and adjusted R-squared 0.8809 indicate the model is well agreed with the actual data. The optimal control variables of ultrasonic extraction of 2AP are at an extraction time of 20 min, 60% of solvent concentration, amplitude of 25% and 12.5 g of pandan leaves, which produced 60.51% of yield of the extract and 1.43 ppm of 2AP.

In view of the ability of germinated brown rice (GBR) to improve learning and memory, this present study aimed to investigate the mechanistic basis of GBR's neuroprotection in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced oxidative changes in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Ferulate-rich GBR ethyl acetate extract (GBR-EA; 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg body weight) was supplemented orally for the last 3 months of 6 months HFD feeding during the study. GBR-EA supplementation was found to improve lipid profile and serum antioxidant status, when compared to the HFD group. Elevated mRNA expressions of SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, Catalase, and GPX were demonstrated in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of GBR-EA treated animals. The pro-inflammatory changes induced by HFD in the hippocampus were attenuated by GBR-EA through the downregulation of CRP and TNF- α and upregulation of PPAR-γ. GBR also reduced the hippocampal mRNA expression and enzyme level of acetylcholinesterase. In conclusion, this study proposed the possible transcriptomic regulation of antioxidant and inflammation in neurodegenerative processes resulting from high cholesterol consumption, with an emphasis on GBR's potential to ameliorate such changes.","rodent","wim","rodent"

The doped Al atom loses electrons and tends to be electronically positive; moreover, a local electronic field can be formed around itself, inducing the adsorbed H2 molecules to be polarized. The polarized H2 molecules were found to be adsorbed by both the N and Al atoms, giving rise to the electrostatic attractions between the H2 molecules and the Al-doped g-CN surface. We found that each 2 × 2 supercell can adsorb at most, 24 H2 molecules, and the corresponding adsorption energies ranged from -0.11 to -0.31 eV. The highest hydrogen-storage capacity of the Al-doped g-CN can reach up to 6.15 wt%, surpassing the goal of 5.50 wt% proposed by the U.S. Department of Energy.

In this study, potential barriers and injection efficiency of LDs are investigated by simulation methods. It is found that different indium content in quantum barrier layers results in different potential barrier heights, leading to different recombination rates in upper and lower waveguide layers, and the injection efficiency can be modulated effectively. An eclectic choice of indium content can suppress recombination in two waveguide layers, improving the output characteristics of green LDs. Additionally, a composite lower waveguide layer structure is proposed to reduce the negative effect of potential barriers. High output power and low threshold current are achieved owing to the reduction in electron injection blockage and hole leakage effects.","misc","wim","misc"

Accordingly, this work aimed to produce and characterize LN containing the insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin (LC) and evaluate their safety to crops (Solanum lycopersicum and Zea mays), soil invertebrates (Folsomia candida and Eisenia fetida), and soil microbial parameters. The average particle size for LN-loaded with LC (LN-LC) was 165.4 ± 2.34 nm, with narrow size distribution and negative charge (-38.7 ± 0.954 mV). LN were able to encapsulate LC with an entrapment efficacy of 98.44 ± 0.04%, maintaining the stability for at least 4 months. The LN-LC showed no risk to the growth of crops and reproduction of the invertebrates. The effect on microbial parameters showed that the activity of certain soil microbial parameters can be inhibited or stimulated by the presence of LN at highest concentrations, probably by changing the pH of soil or by the intrinsic properties of LN.","misc","wim","misc"

With the creation of a high specific surface area (1501.9 m2/g), a hierarchical porous structure, and the incorporation of oxygen-/nitrogen-functional groups, the as-prepared biochar (BC-24) exhibits great potential for supercapacitor application and organic pollutant elimination.

Moreover, BC-24 also exhibits superior catalytic activity for phenol degradation through peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation. The phenol (0.2 mM) can be effectively absorbed and then completely degraded within only 25 min over a wide pH range with low catalyst and PDS dosages. More importantly, TOC analysis indicates 81.7% of the phenol is mineralized within 60 min, confirming the effectiveness of the BC-24/PDS system.

The establishment of D-C sp3 hybrid bonds is also clearly determined by high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and spatially correlated to the Auger spectroscopy signal.

The Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis system is a promising technique for the generation of hydrogen due to its high electrolytic efficiency, safety and reliability, compactness, and quick response to renewable energy sources. However, the instability of catalysts for electrochemical water splitting under operating conditions limits their practical applications. Until now, only precious metal-based materials have met the requirements for rigorous long-term stability and high catalytic activity under acid conditions. In this review, the recent progress made in this regard is presented and analyzed to clarify the role of precious metals in the promotion of the electrolytic decomposition of water. Reducing precious metal loading, enhancing catalytic activity, and improving catalytic lifetime are crucial directions for developing a new generation of PEM water electrolysis catalysts. A summary of the synthesis of high-performance catalysts based on precious metals and an analysis of the factors affecting catalytic performance were derived from a recent investigation.

Through a scalable photolithographic process in this study, we fabricated graphene-based ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) arrays that can continuously monitor sodium ions in real-time. As the sodium ion concentration increased, the current-gate voltage characteristic curves shifted towards the negative direction, showing that sodium ions were captured and could be detected over a wide concentration range, from 10-8 to 10-1 M, with a sensitivity of 152.4 mV/dec. Time-dependent measurements and interfering experiments were conducted to validate the real-time measurements and the highly specific detection capability of our sensor. Our graphene ISFETs (G-ISFET) not only showed a fast response, but also exhibited remarkable selectivity against interference ions, including Ca2+, K+, Mg2+ and NH4+.

However, the partial usage of the full capacity and the low rate capability are caused by poor ionic and electronic conduction. In this work, the effects of two approaches, such as electrode binder carbonization by heat treatment and 3-dimensionalization by the laser structuring of ultra-thick graphite anodes to lithium-ion batteries for high energy density, are investigated. During the heat treatment, the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder is carbonized to form fluorinated graphitic carbons, thereby increasing the number of lithium-ion storage sites and the improvement of the electrode capacity by 14% (420 mAh g-1 and 20 mAh cm-2). Further, the carbonization improves the rate capability by 31% at 0.1 C by simultaneously reducing the ionic and electronic resistances. Furthermore, after the laser structuring of the carbonized electrode, the areal discharge capacity increases to 50% at the increasing current rates, resulting from drastically improved ionic conduction. In addition to the electrochemical characteristics, these two approaches contribute considerably to the fast wetting of the electrolyte into the ultra-thick electrode. The carbonization and laser structuring of the ultra-thick graphite anodes are practical approaches for high-energy batteries to overcome the thickness limitation.","misc","wim","misc"

Slurries with different Al2O3 particle sizes were prepared with varying concentrations of photoinitiator, and subjected to different exposure times to prepare a printing object. All slurries exhibit shear-thinning behavior, and the viscosity increases with decreasing Al2O3 particle size. The 100 nm Al2O3 slurry is confirmed to be more sol-like, while the 500 nm and 2 μm Al2O3 slurries have a gel-like structure. As the Al2O3 particle size increases, a thick sedimentation layer forms due to rapid settling, but as the distance between particles increases, the UV light scattering reduces, and the curing rate increases. The exposure time range viable for printing, and the dimension conformity of the printed specimen with the design file, is improved by increasing the Al2O3 particle size. In the case of 500 nm and 2 μm Al2O3 slurries, the maximum heat flow, curing enthalpy, and conversion rate are high with respect to photoinitiator concentration, in the order of 1.0 &gt; 0.1 &gt; 3.0 wt.%.

For this purpose, three months of evaluation of MDR's prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in the military regional university hospital of Constantine from different services and samples was carried out. Among a total of 196 isolates, 35.2% were MDR. The use of essential oils such as Origanum glandulosum Desf. as an alternative to antibiotics is attractive due to their rich content of bioactive compounds conferring many biological activities. Also, to overcome the drawbacks of using oils as the hydrophobicity and negative interaction with the environmental conditions, in addition to increasing their activity, encapsulation for the oil was performed using high-speed homogenization (HSH) into nanocapsules and high-pressure homogenization (HPH) into nanoemulsion. Nine volatile constituents were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (GC-MS) in hydrodistilled oil with thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, and γ-terpinene as dominants. A dramatic decrease in the major volatile components was observed due to the use of HSH and HPH but generated the same oil profile. The mean particle size of the nanoemulsion was 54.24 nm, while that of nanocapsules was 120.60 nm. The antibacterial activity of the oil and its nanoparticles was estimated on MDR isolates using the disk diffusion, aromatogram, and broth microdilution methods. Consistent with the differences in volatile constituents, the oil exhibited a higher antibacterial activity compared to its nanoforms with the diameters of the inhibition zone against E. coli (20 mm), S. aureus (35 mm), and A. baumannii (40 mm). Both formulations have shown relatively significant activity against the biofilm state at sub-inhibitory concentrations, where nanoemulsion was more potent than nanocapsules. The results obtained suggested that nanoformulations of essential oils are strongly recommended for therapeutic application as alternatives to antibiotics.","misc","wim","misc"

However, there remains a practical challenge in the design of voltage stress, efficiency, and power density. In this paper, a single-ended resonant converter with a primary parallel resonant-matching network is investigated to absorb the bulky input-choke inductors of the Class-E inverters into the coil inductance. The analytical expressions for all the converter parameters are derived based on time-domain resonant waveforms, including: (1) analysis of critical zero-voltage switching (ZVS) conditions and (2) power transfer capabilities under the given maximum switch voltage stress. Furthermore, this paper elaborates on the design methodology of the proposed single-ended resonant converters, and an optimal operating point is chosen to ensure soft-switching operation and rated power.

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies offer high capacity at the cost of high attenuation and blockage losses. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted mmWave networks consist of smaller antenna elements that control the propagation channel between the base station (BS) and the user by appropriately tuning the phase and the reflection of the incident electromagnetic signal. The deployment of RIS is considered to be an energy efficient solution to improve the coverage of regions with high blocking probability. However, if every BS is associated with one or more dedicated RIS, then the density of RIS increases proportionally with the density of BSs. Hence in this work, we propose RIS sharing mechanisms where multiple BSs share one RIS. We formulate resource allocation of RIS sharing in terms of time and the RIS elements as an optimization problem, and we propose heuristics to solve both. Further, we present detailed simulation results to compare time and the element based RIS sharing methods for various scenarios with the benchmark and the RIS system without sharing. The proposed time and element based RIS sharing methods improve throughput upto 53% and 25%, respectively, compared to the RIS system without sharing in specific scenarios.","misc","wim","misc"

Then, the evaluation of the filter strips was used to refine the partial importance of the filter, cut off the unimportant filter strips and reorganize the remaining filter strips. Finally, the training of the neural network after recombination was quantified to further compress the computational amount of the neural network. The results show that the method can significantly reduce the computational effort of the neural network and compress the number of parameters in the model.

This study aimed to characterize the grazing activity and protein-energy requirements of grazing dairy goats in a Mediterranean woodland in northern Morocco by combining two sensors, the Global Positioning System (GPS) and three axis accelerometers. An experiment was conducted in a representative woodland with eight dairy goats. Measurements were undertaken during the three main grazing seasons (spring, summer, and autumn) for two consecutive and contrasting years. Grazing activity parameters were assessed using GPS collars and leg position sensors. The results showed that grazing time was higher in spring (57% and 59%) than in summer (39% and 36%) and autumn (41% and 45%), respectively, for the dry and wet years (p &lt; 0.001). During the two studied years, the daily horizontal distance traveled by the goats increased from spring (about 4.5 km) to summer (about 6.5 km) and autumn (about 7.4 km), while greater daily vertical distances were recorded over similar distances during summer-autumn. Several protein-energy intakes that were insufficient to cover the requirements of the grazing goats were recorded, especially in summer. The combination of GPS collars and accelerometers contributed to a better understanding of the grazing activities of dairy goats in the studied Mediterranean woodland. These findings provide useful data on the protein-energy balances of dairy goats and offer additional information that could be useful for herders and managers to enhance goat-feeding strategies and guarantee high-performance in the semi-extensive traditional goat farming system.","misc","wim","misc"

However, the BCI-enabled automobile industry is has been comparatively less investigated. In particular, there are currently no studies focusing on brain-controlled driving mode selection. Specifically, different driving modes indicate different driving styles which can be selected according to the road condition or the preference of individual drivers. In this paper, a steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP)-based driving mode selection system is proposed. Upon this system, drivers can select the intended driving modes by only gazing at the corresponding SSVEP stimuli. A novel EEG processing algorithm named inter-trial distance minimization analysis (ITDMA) is proposed to enhance SSVEP detection. Both offline and real-time experiments were carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The results show that a high selection accuracy of up to 92.3% can be realized, although this depends on the specific choice of flickering duration, the number of EEG channels, and the number of training signals. Additionally, energy consumption is investigated in terms of which the proposed brain-controlled system considerably differs from a traditional driving mode selection system, and the main reason is shown to be the existence of a detection error.","misc","wim","misc"

This article presents a monitoring system applied to an aeroponic greenhouse based on an IoT architecture that provides user information on the status of the climatic variables and the appearance of the crop in addition to managing the irrigation timing and the frequency of visual inspection using an application developed for Android mobile devices called Aeroponics Monitor. The proposed IoT architecture consists of four layers: a device layer, fog layer, cloud layer and application layer. Once the information about the monitored variables is obtained by the sensors of the device layer, the fog layer processes it and transfers it to the Thingspeak and Firebase servers. In the cloud layer, Thingspeak analyzes the information from the variables monitored in the greenhouse through its IoT analytic tools to generate historical data and visualizations of their behavior, as well as an analysis of the system's operating status. Firebase, on the other hand, is used as a database to store the results of the processing of the images taken in the fog layer for the supervision of the leaves and roots. The results of the analysis of the information of the monitored variables and of the processing of the images are presented in the developed app, with the objective of visualizing the state of the crop and to know the function of the monitoring system in the event of a possible lack of electricity or a service line failure in the fog layer and to avoid the loss of information.

Children with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) experience deficits in auditory, motor, and executive function domains. Therefore, we hypothesized that short-term music training in children with an FASD due to prenatal alcohol exposure may improve brain function. Children (N = 20) with an FASD were randomized to participate in either five weeks of piano training or to a control group. Selective attention was evaluated approximately seven weeks apart (pre-/post-music training or control intervention), examining longitudinal effects using the Attention Networks Test (ANT), a well-established paradigm designed to evaluate attention and inhibitory control, while recording EEG. There was a significant group by pre-/post-intervention interaction for the P250 ms peak of the event-related potential and for theta (4-7 Hz) power in the 100-300 ms time window in response to the congruent condition when the flanking stimuli were oriented congruently with the central target stimulus in fronto-central midline channels from Cz to Fz. A trend for improved reaction time at the second assessment was observed for the music trained group only. These results support the hypothesis that music training changes the neural indices of attention as assessed by the ANT in children with an FASD. This study should be extended to evaluate the effects of music training relative to a more closely matched active control and determine whether additional improvements emerge with longer term music training.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Gait kinematics was obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope data after sensor orientation estimation and sensor-to-segment (S2S) calibration steps. The S2S calibration steps were also applied to the cluster data. IMU-based and cluster-based kinematics were compared to the reference through root mean square errors (RMSEs), centered RMSEs (after mean removal), correlation coefficients (CCs) and differences in amplitude. The mean RMSE and centered RMSE were, respectively, 7.5° and 4.0° for IMU-kinematics, and 7.9° and 3.8° for cluster-kinematics. Very good CCs were found in the sagittal plane for both IMUs and cluster-based kinematics at the hip, knee and ankle levels (CCs &gt; 0.85). The overall mean amplitude difference was about 7°. These results reflected good accordance in our system with the reference, especially in the sagittal plane, but the presence of offsets requires caution for clinical use.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The repetition of lifting tasks increases the risk of back and shoulder injuries among these workers. While lifting in this industry is composed of loaded and unloaded picking and placing, the existing literature does not address the separate analysis of the biomechanics of the back and shoulder for these events. To that end, we investigated the kinematics of the back and shoulder movements of nine healthy male participants who performed three sessions of a simulated de/palletization task. Their back and shoulder kinematics were sensed using an optical motion capture system to determine the back inclination and shoulder flexion. Comparison of the kinematics between the first and last sessions indicated statistically significant changes in the timings, angles, coordination between the back and shoulder, and moments around the shoulder (p&lt;0.05). The majority of the significant changes were observed during the loaded events, which confirms the importance of the separation of these events for biomechanical analysis. This finding suggests that focusing worker evaluation on the loaded periods can provide important information to detect kinematic changes that may affect musculoskeletal injury risk.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The sensor incorporates a unique four-line, single-sensor chemiluminescence imaging-based approach, which relies on the ratio of C2* and CH* radical-species intensities to obtain measurements of equivalence ratios. The advantage of the four-line sensor is the use of additional filtering to mitigate broadband luminescence signals, and its improvements over conventional two-line chemiluminescence diagnostics are discussed. The sensor was calibrated using a premixed bluff-body jet burner with a propane-air flame operating over a wide range of equivalence ratios. The results showed that the four-line processing technique improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the chemiluminescence images for all test cases. Calibrations of C2*/CH* intensity ratio to equivalence ratio were developed for both the four-line and two-line techniques. The calibrations were then used to create maps of local equivalence ratios in the flame-holding region. The maps revealed a non-uniform field of equivalence ratios due to the nature of the radical-species intensity profiles within the flame. Therefore, special consideration is required for calibration in order to accurately quantify equivalence ratios and apply these to diffusion flames.","misc","wim","misc"

In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in medical imaging due to the powerful learning ability with the help of the advanced hardware technology. Unfortunately, CNNs have significant overhead on memory usage and computational resources and are labeled 'black-box' by scholars for their complex underlying structures. To this end, an interpretable graph-based method has been proposed for motion artifacts detection from head CT images in this paper. From a topological perspective, the artifacts detection problem has been reformulated as a complex network classification problem based on the network topological characteristics of the corresponding complex networks. A motion artifacts detection method based on complex networks (MADM-CN) has been proposed. Firstly, the graph of each CT image is constructed based on the theory of complex networks. Secondly, slice-to-slice relationship has been explored by multiple graph construction. In addition, network topological characteristics are investigated locally and globally, consistent topological characteristics including average degree, average clustering coefficient have been utilized for classification. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed MADM-CN has achieved better performance over conventional machine learning and deep learning methods on a real CT dataset, reaching up to 98% of the accuracy and 97% of the sensitivity.","misc","wim","misc"

Moreover, chiral isomerism may lead to sensing errors. In this paper, a six-hole helical microstructured optical fiber (HMSF) with a thin-gold-film-coat based on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect was designed. The twist sensing characteristics of this fiber were further analyzed. Numerical calculation and analysis show that the combination of helical effect and SPR effect can design an HMSF-based sensor that is very sensitive to distortion. In the torsion range of ±300°, the distortion sensitivity can reach 2470.7 pm/(rad/m), and the linear correlation coefficient is 0.99996. Based on the special sensing mechanism, it has a good linear coefficient over a large range. Additionally, the direction of the twist can be easily discerned. The HMSF in this work not only has high sensitivity, high linearity, high fault tolerance rate, and a wide range of measurement, but is also easy to manufacture. Therefore, it is promising in the field of twist sensing and has a good application prospect.","misc","wim","misc"

Most existing methods for RF-based device localization choose to ignore or remove the impact of multipath effects. However, exploiting the multipath effect caused by the complex indoor environment helps to improve the model's localization accuracy. In response to this question, this paper proposes a multipath-assisted localization (MAL) model based on millimeter-wave radar to achieve the localization of indoor electronic devices. The model fully considers the help of the multipath effect when describing the characteristics of the reflected signal and precisely locates the target position by using the MAL area formed by the reflected signal. At the same time, for the situation where the radar in the traditional Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) mode cannot obtain the 3D spatial position information of the target, the advantage of the MAL model is that the 3D information of the target can be obtained after the mining process of the multipath effect. Furthermore, based on the original hardware, it can achieve a breakthrough in angular resolution. Experiments show that our proposed MAL model enables the millimeter-wave multipath positioning model to achieve a 3D positioning error within 15 cm.","misc","wim","misc"

The optical sensor has a 1 × 2 splitter structure with reference and sensing channels, each consisting of a U-shaped waveguide structure that is configured by connecting C bends. This design allows for the sensor device to have a probe structure wherein the surface interconnected with activity devices (i.e., an optical source and optical detector) is placed on one side. The reference channel is bent with a minimum optical loss, and the sensing channel has a bent structure, involving a C-bend waveguide with a maximum loss. The C-bend waveguide with a maximum loss is conformally aligned to have a trench structure with the same bending radius, designed to selectively expose the sidewall of the core layer. The local index contrast varies depending on the material in contact with the trench, resulting in a change in the optical output power of the waveguide. The sensitivity of the proposed sensor was 0 and 2070 μW/refractive index unit (RIU) for the reference and sensing channels, respectively, as the RI changed from 1.385 to 1.445 at a 1550 nm wavelength. These results suggest that the proposed structure enables efficient RI measurement through the use of a simple dip-type method.","misc","wim","misc"

Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an emerging technique for material and elemental analysis, especially heavy metals, based on atomic emission spectroscopy. The LIBS technique has been widely used for rapid detection of heavy metals with its advantages of convenient operation, simultaneous detection of multi-elements, wide range of elements, and no requirement for the state and quantity of samples. However, the development of LIBS is limited by its detection sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD). Therefore, in order to improve the detection sensitivity and LOD of LIBS, it is necessary to enhance the LIBS signal to achieve the purpose of detecting heavy metal elements in agriculture. This review mainly introduces the basic instruments and principles of LIBS and summarizes the methods of enhanced LIBS signal detection of heavy metal elements in agriculture over the past 10 years. The three main approaches to enhancing LIBS are sample pretreatment, adding laser pulses, and using auxiliary devices. An enhanced LIBS signal may improve the LOD of heavy metal elements in agriculture and the sensitivity and stability of the LIBS technique. The enhanced LIBS technique will have a broader prospect in agricultural heavy metal monitoring and can provide technical support for developing heavy metal detection instruments.","misc","wim","misc"

Although there are many new approaches based on deep learning for remaining useful life prediction emerging in recent years, these methods still have the following weaknesses: (1) The correlation between the information collected by each sensor and the remaining useful life of the machinery is not sufficiently considered. (2) The accuracy of deep learning algorithms for remaining useful life prediction is low due to the high noise, over-dimensionality, and non-linear signals generated during the operation of complex systems. To overcome the above weaknesses, a general deep long short memory network-based approach for mechanical remaining useful life prediction is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a two-step maximum information coefficient method was built to calculate the correlation between the sensor data and the remaining useful life. Secondly, the kernel principal component analysis with a simple moving average method was designed to eliminate noise, reduce dimensionality, and extract nonlinear features. Finally, a deep long short memory network-based deep learning method is presented to predict remaining useful life. The efficiency of the proposed method for remaining useful life prediction of a nonlinear degradation process is demonstrated by a test case of NASA's commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation data. The experimental results also show that the proposed method has better prediction accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods.","misc","wim","misc"

By determining the module surface temperature, hot spots that can potentially cause this power loss can be detected. Temperature measurement by radiation allows a complete, reliable, and fast qualitative determination of hot spots on PV modules in outdoor operation. However, to obtain quantitative values, it is necessary to consider multiple factors: emissivity, reflected radiation, wind speed, intensity, shading, etc. Temperature quantitative measurement evaluation by contact is more studied, although by this technique it is impossible to examine the temperature of the entire module to detect hot spots because it is a point measurement and due to shading caused by the measurement probe on the surface. In this work, a method of temperature measurement by radiation is described, evaluating the uncertainty components, and a comparison is made with temperature measurement by contact on the module rear side points where module heating has been detected, also evaluating the uncertainty components. This comparison of both methods and uncertainty determination allows establishing a methodology in quantitative temperature measurement by radiation in photovoltaic modules in outdoor operation.","misc","wim","misc"

This novel approach is motivated by several facts. First, the UAVs, acting as relay nodes, represent an easy-to-deploy and adaptive network that can provide line-of-sight between the base stations and the gateways connected to the core network. Second, FSO communications offer high data rates between the UAVs and the network nodes, while avoiding any potential interference with the 5G radio access networks. Third, energy harvesting in the optical domain has the potential to extend the UAVs' battery life. Nevertheless, the presence of atmospheric turbulence, atmospheric attenuation, and pointing errors in the FSO links severely degrades their performance. For this reason an accurate yet tractable modelling framework is required to fully understand whether an UAV-FSO backhaul/fronthaul network with energy harvesting can be applied. To this end, we consider a composite channel attenuation model that includes the effect of turbulence fading, pointing errors, and atmospheric attenuation. Using this model, we derive analytical closed-form expressions of the average harvested energy as a function of the FSO link parameters. These expressions can be used to improve energy harvesting efficiency in FSO link design. We have applied our proposed expressions to evaluate the energy harvested in vertical FSO links for a variety of real scenarios under a modified on-off keying (OOK) scheme optimized for energy harvesting. From the simulations carried out in this paper, we demonstrate that significant values of harvested energy can be obtained. Such performance enhancement can complement the existing deployment charging stations.","misc","wim","misc"

Healthy participants aged 40-80 years were prospectively recruited, and three models were built to predict individual step length. The first model was the best-fit model (R2 = 0.244, p &lt; 0.001); the root mean square (RMS) values at maximal knee flexion and height were included as significant variables. The second model used all candidate variables, except sEMG variables, and revealed that age, height, and body fat mass (BFM) were significant variables for predicting the average step length (R2 = 0.198, p &lt; 0.001). The third model, which was used to predict step length without sEMG and BIA, showed that only age and height remained significant (R2 = 0.158, p &lt; 0.001). This study revealed that the RMS value at maximal strength knee flexion, height, age, and BFM are important predictors for individual step length, and possibly suggesting that strengthening knee flexor function and reducing BFM may help improve step length.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

As a result, the image matching may no longer be represented by a low-dimensional homographic warping, thus complicating an application of the commonly used Image of Warped Events (IWE). We introduce a new solution to this problem by performing contrast maximization in 3D. The 3D location of the rays cast for each event is smoothly varied as a function of a continuous-time motion parametrization, and the optimal parameters are found by maximizing the contrast in a volumetric ray density field. Our method thus performs joint optimization over motion and structure. The practical validity of our approach is supported by an application to AGV motion estimation and 3D reconstruction with a single vehicle-mounted event camera. The method approaches the performance obtained with regular cameras and eventually outperforms in challenging visual conditions.","misc","wim","misc"

In order to apply controlling rules to the WT blade, a state-of-the-art semi-analytical solution is developed to obtain WT blade lateral displacement under external loadings. The proposed method maps the WT blade to a Euler-Bernoulli beam under the same conditions to find the blade's vibration and dynamic responses by solving analytical vibration solutions of the Euler-Bernoulli beam. The governing equations of the beam with PZT patches are derived by integrating the PZT transducer vibration equations into the vibration equations of the Euler-Bernoulli beam structure. A finite element model of the WT blade with PZT patches is developed. Next, a unique transfer function matrix is derived by exciting the structures and achieving responses. The beam structure is projected to the blade using the transfer function matrix. The results obtained from the mapping method are compared with the counter of the blade's finite element model. A satisfying agreement is observed between the results. The results showed that the method's accuracy decreased as the sensors' distance from the base of the wind turbine increased. In the designing process of the LQR controller, various weighting factors are used to tune control actions of the AVC system. LQR optimal control gain is obtained by using the state-feedback control law. The PZT actuators are located at the same distance from each other an this effort to prevent neutralizing their actuating effects. The LQR shows significant performance by diminishing the weights on the control input in the cost function.

To classify nonmagnetic metals in three shapes-planar, cylindrical, and spherical-a triple-coil electromagnetic sensor that operates as two coil pairs is used, and the difference in the phase tangent of the impedance change of the two coil pairs is used as a feature for the classification. The effect of spatial position drift between the sensor and the sample divided into lift-off vertically and horizontal drift horizontally on this feature is considered. Experimental results prove that there is a linear relationship between the feature and lift-off regardless of the metal shape, whereas horizontal drift has no effect on this feature. In addition, the slope of the curve between the feature and the lift-off is different for different shapes. Finally, a classification method eliminating the effect of lift-off variation has been constructed, and the classification accuracy of Cu-Al-Zn-Ti metals reached 96.3%, 96.3%, 92.6%, and 100%, respectively, with an overall correct classification rate of 96.3%.","misc","wim","misc"

The receiver MMIC consists of a low-noise amplifier, double-balanced image-reject mixer, frequency quadrupler, and analog phase shifter. In order to integrate these devices into a compact single chip without affecting the core performance, coupling problems need to be solved. We analyze the influence of coupling effects on the image rejection ratio, and propose corresponding solutions for three different coupling paths. (1) The coupling in the LO-RF path of the mixer is solved by designing a double-balanced mixer with high isolation characteristics. (2) The coupling between the LO chain and the LNA from space and dielectric is suppressed by optimizing the two main transmission lines spacing and adding isolation vias.

The four-core fiber (FCF) between the fan-in and fan-out couplers was tapered and the diameter became smaller, so that the distance between the four cores arranged in a square became gradually smaller to produce supermodes. The two ends of the TFCF were respectively connected to the fan-in and fan-out couplers so that the individual cores in the FCF could link to the separate single-mode fibers. A broadband light source (superluminescent diodes (SLD)) spanning 1250-1650 nm was injected into any one of the four cores, and the orientation was thus determined. In the tapering process, the remaining three cores gradually approached the excitation core in space to excite several supermodes based on the tri-core structure first, and then transited to the quadruple-core structure. The field distributions of the excited supermodes were asymmetric due to the corner-core excitation scheme, and the interference thus resulted in a higher measurement sensitivity.

Therefore, always-on monitoring is essential for deployed systems to enhance bridge safety through the reliable detection of such events and the rapid assessment of bridge conditions. Traditional bridge monitoring systems using wired sensors are too expensive for widespread implementation, mainly due to their significant installation cost. In this paper, an intelligent wireless monitoring system is developed as a cost-effective solution. It employs ultralow-power, event-triggered wireless sensor prototypes, which enables on-demand, high-fidelity sensing without missing unpredictable impact events. Furthermore, the proposed system adopts a smart artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework for rapid bridge assessment by utilizing artificial neural networks. Specifically, it can identify the impact location and estimate the peak force and impulse of impacts. The obtained impact information is used to provide early estimation of bridge conditions, allowing the bridge engineers to prioritize resource allocation for the timely inspection of the more severe impacts. The performance of the proposed monitoring system is demonstrated through a full-scale field test. The test results show that the developed system can capture the onset of bridge impacts, provide high-quality synchronized data, and offer a rapid damage assessment of bridges under impact events, achieving the error of around 2 m in impact localization, 1 kN for peak force estimation, and 0.01 kN·s for impulse estimation.

In this work, the authors present the results of the experimentally conducted thermal characterization of a prototype installation of the bearing. A novel method of temperature identification, based on integrated thermocouples readings, has been employed to determine the thermal properties of the specialized sensing top foil mounted in the tested bearing. Two measurement campaigns have been subsequently completed, applying freely-suspended and two-node support configurations, to gather complementary knowledge regarding the bearing's operation. Apart from the rotational speed and temperature field measurements, the authors have also studied the friction torque and the shaft's journal trajectories based on its radial displacements. The temporal courses for the above-mentioned quantities have enabled inference on the effects present during run-up, run-out and stable state operation at a constant speed. As confirmed, the applied distribution of the integrated sensors allows for temperature readings on the entire outer surface of the foil, and therefore, provides useful data for the bearing characterization. The work is concluded with presentation of the recommended directions regarding future improvements of the proposed measurement technique and more comprehensive study of the bearing's characteristics.","misc","wim","misc"
"100",35957274,"Sea Cucumber Detection Algorithm Based on Deep Learning.","The traditional single-shot multiBox detector (SSD) for the recognition process in sea cucumbers has problems, such as an insufficient expression of features, heavy computation, and difficulty in application to embedded platforms. To solve these problems, we proposed an improved algorithm for sea cucumber detection based on the traditional SSD algorithm. MobileNetv1 is selected as the backbone of the SSD algorithm. We increase the feature receptive field by receptive field block (RFB) to increase feature details and location information of small targets. Combined with the attention mechanism, features at different depths are strengthened and irrelevant features are suppressed. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm has better performance than the traditional SSD algorithm. The average precision of the improved algorithm is increased by 5.1%. The improved algorithm is also more robust. Compared with YOLOv4 and the Faster R-CNN algorithm, the performance of this algorithm on the P-R curve is better, indicating that the performance of this algorithm is better. Thus, the improved algorithm can stably detect sea cucumbers in real time and provide reliable feedback information.","misc","wim","misc"

The present accelerometers based on Arduino or Raspberry Pi technologies in the literature share some of the following drawbacks: (1) high Noise Density (ND), (2) low sampling frequency, (3) not having the Internet's timestamp with microsecond resolution, (4) not being used in experimental eigenfrequency analysis of a flexible and a less-flexible bridge, and (5) synchronization issues. To solve these problems, a new low-cost triaxial accelerometer based on Arduino technology is presented in this work (Low-cost Adaptable Reliable Accelerometer-LARA). Laboratory test results show that LARA has a ND of 51 µg/√Hz, and a frequency sampling speed of 333 Hz.

"102",35957281,"Data-Driven Threat Analysis for Ensuring Security in Cloud Enabled Systems.","Cloud computing offers many benefits including business flexibility, scalability and cost savings but despite these benefits, there exist threats that require adequate attention for secure service delivery. Threats in a cloud-based system need to be considered from a holistic perspective that accounts for data, application, infrastructure and service, which can pose potential risks. Data certainly plays a critical role within the whole ecosystem and organisations should take account of and protect data from any potential threats. Due to the variation of data types, status, and location, understanding the potential security concerns in cloud-based infrastructures is more complex than in a traditional system. The existing threat modeling approaches lack the ability to analyse and prioritise data-related threats. The main contribution of the paper is a novel data-driven threat analysis (d-TM) approach for the cloud-based systems. The main motivation of d-TM is the integration of data from three levels of abstractions, i.e., management, control, and business and three phases, i.e., storage, process and transmittance, within each level. The d-TM provides a systematic flow of attack surface analysis from the user agent to the cloud service provider based on the threat layers in cloud computing. Finally, a cloud-based use case scenario was used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The result shows that d-TM revealed four critical threats out of the seven threats based on the identified assets. The threats targeted management and business data in general, while targeting data in process and transit more specifically.","misc","wim","misc"
"103",35957285,"Strategies for the Accurate Measurement of the Resonance Frequency in QCM-D Systems via Low-Cost Digital Techniques.","In this paper, an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)-based digital architecture for the measurement of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) oscillating frequency of transient responses, i.e., in QCM-D (QCM and Dissipation) applications, is presented. The measurement system is conceived for operations in liquid, with short QCM transient responses due to the large mechanical load. The proposed solution allows for avoiding the complex processing systems typically required by the QCM-D techniques and grants frequency resolutions better than 1 ppm. The core of the architecture is a reciprocal digital frequency meter, combined with the preprocessing of the QCM signal through mixing operations, such as a step-down of the input frequency and reducing the measurement error. The measurement error is further reduced through averaging. Different strategies are proposed to implement the proposed measurement solution, comprising an all-digital circuit and mixed analog/digital ones. The performance of the proposed architectures is theoretically derived, compared, and analyzed by means of experimental data obtained considering 10 MHz QCMs and 200 μs long transient responses. A frequency resolution of about 240 ppb, which corresponds to a Sauerbrey mass resolution of 8 ng/cm2, is obtained for the all-digital solution, whereas for the mixed solution the resolution halves to 120 ppb, with a measurement time of about one second over 100 repetitions.","misc","wim","misc"

The linear calibration-free wavelength modulation spectroscopy (LCF-WMS) approach combined with the temperature profile-fitting strategy was utilized for trace NO and NO2 concentration detection with broad spectral interference from gaseous water (H2O). Transition lines near 1308 nm, 5238 nm, and 6250 nm were selected to investigate the H2O, NO, and NO2 generated from combustion. Experiments were performed under different equivalence ratios in a combustion exhaust tube, which was heated at 450-700 K, with an effective optical length of 1.57 m. Ultra-low NOx emissions were captured by optical measurements under different equivalence ratios. The mole fractions of H2O were in agreement with the theoretical values calculated using Chemkin.

The safety distance is longer for rail vehicles such as trams because of the adherence limitations of the wheel-to-rail system. The major issues of fixed frontal sensing are fake target detection, blind spots related to rail slopes, curves, and random changes in the target's illumination or reflectivity. In this experimental study, distance measurements were performed using a scaled tram model equipped with a LiDAR sensor with a narrow field of view, under different conditions of illumination, size, and reflectivity of the target objects, and using different track configurations, to evaluate the effectiveness of such sensors in collision-avoidance systems for rail applications. The experimental findings are underlining the sensor's sensitivity to fake targets, objects in the sensor's blind spots, and special optical interferences, which are important for evaluating long-range LiDAR capabilities in sensing safety distance for vehicles. The conclusions can help developers to produce a dedicated colliding prevention system for trams and to identify the zones with high risk in the track where additional protection methods should be used. The LiDAR sensor must be used in conjunction with additional sensors to perform all the security tasks of an anti-colliding system for the tram.","misc","wim","misc"

This paper reports on a novel CMOS seven-contact VHS (7CVHS), which is formed by adding two additional contacts to a traditional five-contact VHS (5CVHS) to alleviate the offset. The offset voltage and offset magnetic field of the 7CVHS are reduced by 90.20% and 88.31% of those of the 5CVHS, respectively, with a 16.16% current-related sensitivity loss. Moreover, the size and positions of the contacts are optimized in standard GLOBALFOUNDRIES 0.18 μm BCDliteTM technology by scanning parameters using FEM simulations.

"107",35957291,"Dual-Coupled CNN-GCN-Based Classification for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data.","Deep learning techniques have brought substantial performance gains to remote sensing image classification. Among them, convolutional neural networks (CNN) can extract rich spatial and spectral features from hyperspectral images in a short-range region, whereas graph convolutional networks (GCN) can model middle- and long-range spatial relations (or structural features) between samples on their graph structure. These different features make it possible to classify remote sensing images finely. In addition, hyperspectral images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) images can provide spatial-spectral information and elevation information of targets on the Earth's surface, respectively. These multi-source remote sensing data can further improve classification accuracy in complex scenes. This paper proposes a classification method for HS and LiDAR data based on a dual-coupled CNN-GCN structure. The model can be divided into a coupled CNN and a coupled GCN. The former employs a weight-sharing mechanism to structurally fuse and simplify the dual CNN models and extracting the spatial features from HS and LiDAR data. The latter first concatenates the HS and LiDAR data to construct a uniform graph structure. Then, the dual GCN models perform structural fusion by sharing the graph structures and weight matrices of some layers to extract their structural information, respectively. Finally, the final hybrid features are fed into a standard classifier for the pixel-level classification task under a unified feature fusion module. Extensive experiments on two real-world hyperspectral and LiDAR data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art baseline methods, such as two-branch CNN and context CNN. In particular, the overall accuracy (99.11%) on Trento achieves the best classification performance reported so far.","misc","wim","misc"
"108",35957298,"Effect of Behavioral Precaution on Braking Operation of Elderly Drivers under Cognitive Workloads.","The number of accidents by elderly drivers caused by the erroneous tread of a brake pedal or accelerator pedal has increased. A recent study reported that the number of accidents could be reduced by preparing for braking mistakes due to driving behavior by using a simulator. However, related studies have pointed out that driving behavior in simulators does not always reflect driving behavior in the real world. This paper focuses on the posture of the left foot as a behavioral precaution and provides insights into braking mistakes by comparing behavioral precautions taken on simulators and on public roads. In the experimental results, cognitive and action errors increased with age, but elderly drivers are less likely to have an accident when they are exposed to the risk of collision in situations with a mental workload by making space for the right foot to step on the brake pedal. Elderly drivers with coping skills had their left foot perpendicular to the ground and their body was unstable. This result was different from the driving behavior in the simulator, but it was not possible to identify that this difference was the cause of the collision accidents. Coping skills were predicted with 70% accuracy from the left foot posture of an elderly driver near the intersection. We expanded the system's range of use and enhanced its usefulness by predicting coping skills derived from natural driving behavior in the real world. The contributions of this study are as follows. We clarify the effect of behavioral precautions on the braking operation of elderly drivers when under a cognitive workload. We provide new insights into the use of behavioral precautions in older drivers' braking operations in the real world.

We were inspired by mussels' adhesive components to synthesize polydopamine nanoparticles and then use a carbonization process to prepare fluorescent CNPs. Using some surfactants, we could control the sizes of CNPs and increase their dispersion in water. Fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed the excitation of CNPs at 360 nm and emission of blue light with a 400-450 nm wavelength. High quantum yields of greater than 20% were also measured. Transmission electron microscopy proved that the addition of surfactants could shrink particles to several nanometers in size. The fluorescent and conductive CNPs were applied to stain L929 fibroblast cells in vitro, finding no harmful effects on cells. Due to the polydopamine-derived CNPs' good electrical, fluorescent, and biocompatible response, we designed a platform to manipulate the cells after endocytosis of conductive CNPs to observe the effects of electrical stimulation on cell attachment, cell growth, and cell death. The nanoparticles endocytosed by cells seemed more easily attracted to the electric field, leading to enhanced cell attachment and growth. Therefore, CNP uptake can increase the attachment of cells onto a conductive plate electrode in a short time (within 10 min at 4°C). When the source of the electric field was changed to rod electrodes in the medium, cells that had been pre-adsorbed onto a non-conductive plate were desorbed from the plate and destroyed. Therefore, addition of CNPs during cell incubation can allow control of cell growth and death via manipulation of electric fields.","misc","wim","misc"

Three individual Pseudomonas sp. strains showed different capabilities of growing and producing PHAs in the presence of a synthetic mixture of SMCFAs. Pseudomonas sp. GL06 exhibited the highest SMCFA tolerance and produced PHAs with the highest productivity (2.7 mg/L h). Based on these observations, this strain was selected for further investigations on PHA production in a fed-batch bioreactor with a SMCFA-rich stream extracted from the effluent. The results showed that PHA productivity reached up to 4.5 mg/L h at 24 h of fermentation together with the ammonium exhaustion in the growth medium. Moreover, the PHA monomeric composition varied with the bacterial strain and the type of the growth medium used. Furthermore, a differential scanning calorimetric and thermogravimetric analysis showed that a short- and medium-chain-length PHA copolymer made of 3-hydroxybutyric, -hexanoic, -octanoic, -decanoic, and -dodecanoic has promising properties. The ability of Pseudomonas sp. to produce tailored PHA copolymers together with the range of possible applications opens new perspectives in the development of PHA bioproduction as a part of an integrated valorization process of SMCFAs derived from waste streams.","misc","wim","misc"

While conventional in vitro cell cultures under-represent the complexity and dynamic crosstalk of the tumor microenvironment, animal models do not allow deciphering the anti-tumor activity of the human immune system. Therefore, the development of reliable and predictive preclinical models has become crucial for the screening of immune-therapeutic approaches. We here present an organ-on-chip organ on chips (OOC)-based approach for recapitulating the immune cell Natural Killer (NK) migration under physiological fluid flow, infiltration within a 3D tumor matrix, and activation against neuroblastoma cancer cells in a humanized, fluid-dynamic environment. Circulating NK cells actively initiate a spontaneous extravasation process toward the physically separated tumor niche, retaining their ability to interact with matrix-embedded tumor cells, and to display a cytotoxic effect (tumor cell apoptosis). Since NK cells infiltration and phenotype is correlated with prognosis and response to immunotherapy, their phenotype is also investigated: most importantly, a clear decrease in CD16-positive NK cells within the migrated and infiltrated population is observed. The proposed immune-tumor OOC-based model represents a promising approach for faithfully recapitulating the human pathology and efficiently employing the immunotherapies testing, eventually in a personalized perspective.

At present, the commonly used filling material is bone cement, which can only provide physical support without bone regeneration effect. The long-term stress at the interface may cause the loosening of bone cement. The ideal filling material should provide not only strong mechanical support but also promote bone regeneration.

In this system, bone cement was used to provide immediate fixation, and the frame provided long-term fixation by promoting osteogenic induction and conduction between the interface. The results showed that the degradation of bioactive glass in the frame promoted osteogenic metabolism, induced M2 polarization of macrophages, and inhibited local inflammatory response.

The Pharmacists Coordinated Care Oncology Model (PCOM) is a two-month intervention that builds upon current pharmacist clinical responsibilities. Generally, participants will complete a patient-reported outcome measure at 2 and 6 weeks post-OAA initiation that is sent to their oncology pharmacist, and they will also receive a comprehensive medication review at week 4 from a primary care pharmacist for their chronic medications. The pharmacists will communicate about the results via electronic medical record (EMR) and intervene if necessary.

Interestingly, we found that the proposed absorber possesses high spatial directivity and performs similar to an antenna, which can also be utilized as a thermal emitter. Besides, the spectral position of the absorption peak can not only be adjusted by changing the geometrical parameters of dielectric grating, but it is also tunable by a small change in the Fermi level of the graphene sheet.

Graphene in solution, obtained through electrochemical exfoliation or other methods, is typically polydisperse, containing particles of various sizes, which is not optimal for applications. We employed cascade centrifugation to select specific particle sizes in solution and prepared thin films from those graphene particles using the Langmuir-Blodgett assembly. Employing centrifugation speeds of 3, 4, and 5 krpm, further diluting the solutions in different volumes of solvent, we reliably and consistently obtained films of tunable thickness. We show that there is a limit to how thin these films can be, which is imposed by the percolation threshold. The percolation threshold is quantitatively compared to results found in literature that are obtained using other, more complex graphene film fabrication methods, and is found to occur with a percolation exponent and percolative figure of merit that are of the same order as results in literature. A maximum optical transparency of 82.4% at a wavelength of 660 nm is obtained for these films, which is in agreement with earlier works on Langmuir-Blodgett assembled ultrasonic-assisted liquid-phase exfoliated graphene. Our work demonstrates that films that are in all respects on par with films of graphene obtained through other solution-based processes can be produced from inexpensive and widely available centrifugal post-processing of existing commercially available solutions of electrochemically exfoliated graphene.

We succeeded in directly measuring the local SPV by AC-KPFM with higher resolution, thanks to the exclusion of the thermal drift. We found that AC-KPFM can achieve a SPV response faster by about one to eight orders of magnitude than classical KPFM. Moreover, AC-KPFM is applicable in both amplitude modulation and frequency modulation mode. Thus, it contributes to advancing SPV measurements in various environments, such as vacuum, air, and liquids.

Preoperative CT and MRI enhancement examination were performed routinely, and the DICOM data were collected and imported into Medraw Print software. According to the specific anatomical morphology of acetabula, this study adopted the reverse calculation and direct design to print the individualized puncture guide plate using 3D printing technology. The puncture point and sampling approaches were determined by the guide plate morphology and the double guide-hole and slideable groove design. First, we evaluated the fitness of the 3D guide plate to the local anatomical structure, its assisted-puncture accuracy was estimated by imaging examinations, and postoperative complications were recorded. The accuracy of the needle biopsy pathological result was estimated with reference to that of the tumor resection. Results: Our results showed that the 3D printing individualized guide plate matched the patients' pelvic skin well, the puncture approach was consistent with the preoperative design, and no significant anatomical injuries including vascular and neural complications occurred after surgery. Nine patients' (90%) biopsy results were consistent with their postoperative pathological results, and one patient gave up the tumor resection.

Additionally, we examined the relative importance of sexual and asexual reproduction in the studied populations and their genetic diversity. A total of 541 individuals from 20 localities were sampled and analysed with 19 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Of the genotyped individuals, 482 (89%) had unique multilocus genotypes. Clonality percentages of the populations varied from 0% (in eight populations) to nearly 69% (in one population from Crete). A heterozygosity deficit and a high degree of inbreeding was the general trend in our data set. Population differentiation in C. caespitosa was characterised by significant pairwise F ST values with lower ones observed at an intraregional scale and higher ones, between populations from different biogeographic regions. Genetic structure analyses showed that the populations are divided according to the three main sub-basins of the Mediterranean Sea: the Western (Balearic, Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas), the Central (Adriatic and Ionian seas) and the Eastern (Levantine and Aegean seas), coinciding with previously described gene flow barriers. However, the three easternmost populations were also clearly separated from one another, and a substructure was observed for the other studied areas. An isolation-by-distance pattern was found among, but not within, the three main population groups. This substructure is mediated mainly by dispersal along the coastline and some resistance to larval movement through the open sea. Despite the low dispersal ability and high self-recruitment rate of C. caespitosa, casual dispersive events between regions seem to be enough to maintain the species' considerable genetic diversity. Understanding the population connectivity and structure of this endangered scleractinian coral allows for more informed conservation decision making.","misc","wim","misc"

L.T. Shen is a member of Campanulaceae, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine. However, apart from a few Codonopsis species, no detailed knowledge is available on the metabolite composition and respective transcriptome signatures. We performed a combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis of the tuber, stem, and leaf of C. convolvulacea and found 1,144 metabolites and 231,840 unigenes in three experimental groups. The analysis revealed considerable variations in the three tissues. Tubers were rich in amino acids and derivatives, flavonoids, and organic acids, whereas the stems and leaves were rich in alkaloids and flavonoids, respectively. Transcriptome sequencing revealed candidate genes being involved in flavonoid, tryptophan, and alkaloid biosyntheses. In particular, we indicated that the variation in the isoflavone content is linked to the expressions of CHI, CYP73A, C3'H, F3H, CYP75B1, anthocyanidin synthase, and FLS. In a similar way, the levels of indole, L-tyrosine, and tryptamine were also consistent with the expressions of TDC/DDCs in the respective tissues.

"123",35957694,"Identification of novel biomarkers in septic cardiomyopathy via integrated bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation.","Purpose: Septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) is an important world public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. It is necessary to identify SCM biomarkers at the genetic level to identify new therapeutic targets and strategies. Method: DEGs in SCM were identified by comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of microarray datasets (GSE53007 and GSE79962) downloaded from the GEO database. Subsequently, bioinformatics analysis was used to conduct an in-depth exploration of DEGs, including GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, PPI network construction, and key gene identification. The top ten Hub genes were identified, and then the SCM model was constructed by treating HL-1 cells and AC16 cells with LPS, and these top ten Hub genes were examined using qPCR. Result: STAT3, SOCS3, CCL2, IL1R2, JUNB, S100A9, OSMR, ZFP36, and HAMP were significantly elevated in the established SCM cells model. Conclusion: After bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification, it was demonstrated that STAT3, SOCS3, CCL2, IL1R2, JUNB, S100A9, OSMR, ZFP36, and HAMP might play important roles in SCM.","misc","wim","misc"
"124",35957695,"Effect of quercetin on muscle growth and antioxidant status of the dark sleeper Odontobutis potamophila.","Quercetin is a flavanol beneficial in reducing fat, promoting muscle growth, and Anti-oxidation. To study its effects in freshwater fish, the full-length cDNA of the follistatin (FST) and myostatin (MSTN) genes of the dark sleeper Odontobutis potamophila were cloned for the first time. Juvenile individual O. potamophila was exposed to quercetin at one of four concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/L) for 21 days. The expression level of MSTN which inhibits muscle growth in the quercetin solution was lower than in the unexposed control group. The genes that promote muscle growth are in TGF-β superfamily like FST, TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-beta 1), and Myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) like Myf5 (myogenic factor 5), MyoD (myogenic differentiation), MyoG (myogenin), were higher than in the control group. Apolipoprotein and growth hormone receptor transcription levels in the quercetin-treated fish were significantly lower than in the control group. The concentrations of triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the muscle tissue decreased, and the lipid-lowering function of quercetin was also demonstrated at the biochemical level. In this study, we analyzed the mRNA levels of AKT, Keap1 (kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) oxidation-related genes in the Nrf2/ARE antioxidant pathway, and Malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT) activity and glutathione (GSH) content in the hepatopancreas of O. potamophila after quercetin treatment, the mRNA expression of AKT, Nrf2 and CAT activity and GSH content are higher than in the control group. Quercetin enhances antioxidant properties and positively affects muscle growth. The results showed that quercetin has no significant effects on the growth performance of O. potamophila, but is effective in increasing muscle growth rate and lowering muscle fat content.","misc","wim","misc"

Nck-associated protein 1 (NCKAP1) is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression in several cancer types, but the function and prognostic value of NCKAP1 in ccRCC remain poorly understood. Methods: Using the Ualcan database, we evaluated the correlation between NCKAP1 expression and clinical features of ccRCC. These data were validated by immunohistochemical staining for NCKAP1 in a cohort of ccRCC patients. We assessed the prognostic value of NCKAP1 using GEPIA2 survival analysis. NCKAP1 function was characterized in vitro and in vivo using NCKAP1-overexpression ACHN cell lines. The LinkedOmics and GSCALite databases were used to investigate identify potential NCKAP1-targeted medicines that may play a role in the treatment of ccRCC. The impact of NCKAP1 expression on immune infiltration was also evaluated. Results: NCKAP1 was significantly downregulated in ccRCC and correlated with advanced clinicopathological features and poor prognosis. Overexpression of NCKAP1 in ACHN cells reduced proliferation, invasion and migration capacity in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. According to the LinkedOmics, GSCALite and TIMER databases, NCKAP1 and related genes function primarily in ribosomal signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, TGF-β, and EMT-related signaling pathways. NCKAP1 was also shown to positively correlate with immune cell types, biomarkers, and immune checkpoints in ccRCCs. Conclusions: NCKAP1 may play a vital tumor-suppressive role in ccRCC and is potentially a useful prognostic biomarker.","misc","wim","misc"

The liver and kidneys represent two major secondary organs to which osteosarcoma metastasizes. In this study, we assessed Shilajit, a phytomineral diffusion traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine, for its possible protective effects against metastasis induced liver and kidney damages in an osteosarcoma rat model. Osteosarcoma rats displayed typical dysregulation of serum levels of hepatic and renal functional markers (p < 0.05) including aspartate aminotransferase (AST)* and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total proteins, albumin, bilirubin, creatinine, urea, and uric acid. Changes in functional markers were also positively correlated with marked histopathological alterations in liver and kidney tissues. Whereas Shilajit's treatment of osteosarcoma rates in combination with CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy drug cocktail significantly (p < 0.05) reversed the studied functional markers to their near-normal levels. Co-treatment of shilajit and drug cocktails also markedly alleviated histopathological changes in liver and kidney tissues. Correlation co-efficient analysis of hepatic and renal functional markers revealed a significant inter-association among these markers. Collectively, present data indicate that shilajit may potentiate the effects of chemotherapy drugs and mitigate the metastasis-induced liver and kidney damage in osteosarcoma. Thus, the findings of this study substantiate the beneficial health effects of shilajit and promote its regular consumption.","rodent","wim","rodent"

New combinations of novel agents are needed to improve the prognosis of patients with t (11;14) MM. As a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), palbociclib (PAL) has been used to treat various malignancies, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and so on. However, the effects of PAL on MM remain unclear, and thus, further investigations are warranted. Two t (11;14) MM cell lines, U266 and KMS27, were used in this study. The cell viability and cell cycle were detected to evaluate the anti-myeloma effect of the combination of pralatrexate (PTX) and methotrexate (MTX) with PAL. Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid and mouse models were built to verify the effect of the combination treatment. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2 (MCM2), Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 3 (MCM3), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). It was observed that PAL had obvious anticancer effects on U266 and KMS27 cells, which had synergistic effects together with PTX and MTX. Importantly, it was found that PAL could promote cell cycle genes including MCM2 and MCM3, and increase the number of MM cells in the G1 phase. Moreover, PAL reduced the expression level of DHFR and exerted its anticancer effects on MM cells by targeting DHFR. It was also determined that PAL exerted anticancer effects on MM in the spheroid and mouse models. PAL exerted obvious anticancer effects on t (11;14) MM cells, which had synergistic effects together with PTX and MTX. PAL could promote cell cycle genes and the G1 phase of MM cells.

However, whether Sal B has a neuroprotective function in ischemic stroke by promoting angiogenesis is still unclear. In the present study, ischemic stroke models were induced in rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and Sal B (10 or 20 mg/kg/d) was intraperitoneally injected according to a previous study. Neurological deficits were evaluated by the modified Longa five-point scale, modified Bederson scores and cerebral infarction sizes by triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Apoptotic cells were tested by cleaved-caspase3 immunofluorescence staining and an in situ cell death (TUNEL) detection kit. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to hypoxia were used to investigate the effects of Sal B on angiogenesis and tube formation in vitro. Sal B ameliorated the neurological deficits, decreased the cerebral infarction volumes in rats with ischemic stroke, significantly increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and VEGFA and promoted angiogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, Sal B increased stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) expression, induced the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, enhanced cell migration, and activated VEGFR2/VEGFA signaling in endothelial cells. This study showed that Sal B promoted angiogenesis and alleviated neurological apoptosis in rats with ischemic stroke by promoting STC1.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Elucidating the various changes that occur during pregnancy may assist with understanding maternal health and the factors affecting pregnancy outcomes. A longitudinal cohort of 84 pregnant women was established. The urinary proteomes of women in different trimesters of pregnancy (6-8, 22-24, and 32-34 weeks) were characterized using data-independent acquisition tandem mass spectrometry. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was diagnosed at 24 to 28 weeks. Functional analysis of serial changed proteins was performed. Fifteen women had GDM, 50 were healthy, and 19 experienced spontaneous abortion (SA). Functional analysis showed that the urinary proteome reflected physiological and pathological changes during pregnancy. Compared to those of women with a normal pregnancy, the urinary proteomes of women with GDM and SA showed significant disease-related changes in insulin secretion and estrogen receptor activity, respectively, during the first trimester. Urinary protein during the first trimester of pregnancy achieved an area under the curve of 0.91 and 0.81 for GDM and SA, respectively. The urinary proteome has the potential to reflect serial changes of pregnancy progression; therefore, its use might facilitate early diagnosis of pregnancy complications.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

However, additional IC may lead to immunosuppression and can negatively affect the prognosis. We evaluated whether receiving IC improved the prognosis of patients with NPC co-infected with HBV, on the basis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). This large-scale retrospective cohort study included data of patients with pathologically confirmed NPC that were collected from two hospitals between January 2010 and March 2014. Patients were followed-up every 3 months during the first 2 years and once every 6 months thereafter. Univariate analysis identified confounding factors associated with prognosis. Stage-based subgroup analyses and 1:1 random-matched pair analyses were performed to compare the survival differences between patients treated with IC + CCRT and those treated with CCRT alone. Among the 1,076 enrolled patients, 16.6% were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive. Among HBsAg-positive patients with stage II/III/IV NPC, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (79.3% vs. 89.9%; P=0.045) and progression-free survival (PFS) (70.6% vs. 83.7%; P=0.025) were lower in patients who received IC + CCRT than in those who received CCRT alone. After adjusting for confounding factors, IC + CCRT was validated as a negative prognosticator for DMFS and PFS, while matched-pair analysis with HBsAg-negative patients showed a better overall survival (OS) for IC + CCRT (88.4% vs. 82.6%; P=0.04). Compared with CCRT alone, IC + CCRT negatively affects DMFS and PFS in patients with NPC with chronic HBV infection. We advocate withholding IC but administering stronger initial treatment in NPC patients complicated with HBV infection.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

We aimed to study the relationship between PCSK9 levels, genetic polymorphisms, and stroke outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke. A total of 9,782 acute ischemic stroke patients registered in the China National Stroke Registry-III were included in this prospective study. Circulating PCSK9 concentrations and 11 key single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined. The clinical outcomes included stroke recurrence, death, and poor functional outcome at 12 months. The median PCSK9 level was 361.28 ng/mL. After adjusting for confounders, patients in the highest quartile of circulating PCSK9 had a relatively lower risk of 12-month stroke recurrence (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67-0.96). No significant relationship between PCSK9 level and death or poor functional outcome was found. No significant relationship between SNPs and stroke outcomes at 12 months was found. The high level of PCSK9 was associated with decreased stroke recurrence at 12 months in ischemic stroke patients. There was no significant association between PCSK9 polymorphisms and acute ischemic stroke based on a Chinese registry.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Different concentrations of ZnO NPs were administered by gavage to Sprague Dawley (SD) rats to examine the adverse effects resulting from pre- and post-natal exposure. Systemic distribution of ZnO NPs, developmental performance, sperm parameters, reproductive performance, histopathological examination, and sex hormone levels were determined scheduled in the experimental rats and their male offspring. The comparative in vitro cytotoxicity of the ZnO NPs was determined among C18-4, TM3, and TM4 cells. The toxicity exerted by ZnO NPs on germ cells in vitro and the effects on the expression of cytoskeleton and blood-testis barrier (BTB)-related proteins were also determined. After oral gavage, ZnO NPs mainly accumulated in the liver and testes of rats; 350 mg/kg ZnO NPs adversely affected the epididymal weight, sperm motility, and hormone levels but did not affect the fertility of rats. In addition, 350 mg/kg ZnO NPs significantly reduced the reproductive and developmental performance of offspring male rats. Testicular histopathological and electron microscopic ultrastructure examinations showed more significant abnormal structural changes than those observed in parental rats. The results of in vitro cell experiments further showed that ZnO NPs exerted cytotoxic effects on germ cells, and led to DNA damage, nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton alterations, and could regulate actin changes through changes in LC3B. It is possible that ZnO NPs act directly on TM4 cells by penetrating the BTB, causing damage to the cytoskeleton and disrupting the dynamic balance of the BTB, thereby destroying the microenvironment necessary for spermatogenesis, which may lead to poor reproduction in rats.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Although parental reports have been traditionally used, emerging research highlights the importance of child and adolescent reports of the household food environment. Extending research from high- and upper-middle-income countries, this study of adolescent compared with adult reports of household food insecurity in Kenya, a lower-middle-income country, examined 1) prevalence of and correspondence between adolescent and adult reports of household food insecurity, and 2) associations of adolescent and adult reports of household food insecurity with adolescent nonnutritional and nutritional outcomes. Using data from the Kenya Violence Against Children Surveys (n = 1182), we assessed prevalence of household food insecurity reported by adolescents (ages 13-17 y) and adults, with McNemar χ2 and κ analysis of correspondence between reports. Ordinal and binary logistic regression assessed associations between adolescent and adult reports and adolescent mental health and self-rated physical health and food sufficiency outcomes. Household food insecurity was reported by 36% of adolescents and 63% of adults; 36% of adult reports were discordant with adolescent reports (κ = 0.333). Odds of adolescent mental health difficulties were highest with adolescent-only report (OR = 2.11, P = 0.02), followed by adult and adolescent (OR = 1.83, P = 0.001) and adult-only (OR = 1.06, P = 0.77) report. Odds of poor adolescent self-rated physical health were highest with adult and adolescent report (OR = 2.47, P < 0.001) followed by adolescent-only (OR = 2.04, P = 0.08) and adult-only (OR = 1.37, P = 0.20) report.

Univariate and multivariate regressions were used to determine the association of CRAE, CRVE, and AVR with age, sex, smoking status, presence of cilioretinal artery, and AMD severity at baseline and 5 years using the 9-step AMD severity score. Only CRAE and CRVE were higher in men (P < 0.001), current smokers (P < 0.001), and the eyes with a cilioretinal artery (P=0.009 - 0.043). AMD severity was greater in older patients (P=0.001), current smokers (P=0.012), the eyes without a cilioretinal artery (P=0.001), and lower AVR (P=0.034) on multivariate regression but was not influenced by CRAE or CRVE (P=0.240 - 0.500).

Nearly, half of the patients who have glaucoma in the United States are unaware of their diagnosis, and this number is far greater in resource poor areas. The risk of progressive and irreversible loss of vision is decreased with an early diagnosis, and better access to treatment is vital to improve the visual outcome for patients. We therefore postulated that a minimally invasive, low-cost calculator used to predict the risk of glaucoma and inform the course of follow-up care will improve patient prognosis. We retrospectively examined data from 104 eyes of patients who underwent a complete ocular examination, visual field, and corneal pachymetry at Advanced Eye Care of New York (54 with glaucoma and 50 controls). Receiver operating curves (ROC) were utilized to determine the correct glaucoma classification rates of the Laroche glaucoma calculator (Range -3 to 18), a novel tool that combines age, intraocular pressure (IOP), and central corneal thickness (CCT) into a composite metric. Additionally, we compared the discriminatory power of this calculator to age, intraocular pressure (IOP), and central corneal thickness (CCT) separately. A score of greater than or equal to 6 on the Laroche glaucoma calculator (sensitivity 90.74%, specificity 64.00%, correct classification 77.88%) optimizes the accuracy of this tool. Compared to IOP (Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.72, chi2 = 4.21, p=0.04) and CCT (AUC = 0.53), chi2 24.72 p < 0.001), the Laroche glaucoma calculator (AUC = 0.81) was significantly better at discriminating against glaucoma patients vs. controls. These results demonstrate that the Laroche calculator is a novel, effective tool for identifying glaucoma, and it may provide a low-cost risk stratification tool, particularly in areas with limited resources.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

We investigated the influence of trematode infection on the shell morphology of Bulinus tropicus, a common host of medically important trematodes. We focused on a snail population from crater lake Kasenda (Uganda). We sampled a single homogeneous littoral habitat to minimize the influence of environmental variation on shell phenotype, and barcoded snails to document snail genotypic variation. Among the 257 adult snails analysed, 99 tested positive for trematode infection using rapid-diagnostic PCRs. Subsequently we used high-throughput amplicon sequencing to identify the trematode (co-)infections. For 86 out of the 99 positive samples trematode species delineation could discriminate among combinations of (co-)infection by 11 trematode species. To avoid confounding effects, we focused on four prevalent trematode species. We performed landmark-based geometric morphometrics to characterize shell phenotype and used regressions to examine whether shell size and shape were affected by trematode infection and the developmental stage of infection (as inferred from read counts). Snails infected by Petasiger sp. 5, Echinoparyphium sp. or Austrodiplostomum sp. 2 had larger shells than uninfected snails or than those infected by Plagiorchiida sp. Moreover, the shell shape of snails infected solely by Petasiger sp. 5 differed significantly from that of uninfected snails and snails infected with other trematodes, except from Austrodiplostomum sp. 2. Shape changes included a more protuberant apex, an inward-folded outer apertural lip and a more adapically positioned umbilicus. Size differences were more pronounced in snails with 'late' infections (>25 days) compared to earlier-stage infections. No phenotypic differences were found between snails infected by a single trematode species and those harbouring co-infections.

This study aims to explore the effect of long non-coding RNA growth arrest specific 5 (GAS5) on hepatic lipid metabolism in fatty liver models. Obese mice, high fat diet-fed mice and free fatty acid-stimulated cells were used for GAS5 expression detection. GAS5 overexpression or knockdown models were established to elucidate the regulatory function of GAS5 in de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and mitochondrial function. Bioinformatic analyses and dual luciferase assays were used to investigate the interaction between GAS5, miR-26a-5p and phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4B. The involvement of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway was evaluated using H89 and forskolin treatment. GAS5 was activated in vitro and in vivo fatty liver models. Knockdown of GAS5 reduced lipid droplet accumulation, DNL associated enzymes and preserved mitochondrial function, while GAS5 overexpression exacerbated hepatic lipid accumulation. Mechanistically, GAS5 sponged miR-26a-5p to increase PDE4B expression and subsequently modulated DNL and mitochondrial function via the cAMP/CREB pathway. Downregulation of GAS5 can activate the cAMP/CREB pathway through miR-26a-5p/PDE4B axis to mitigate hepatic lipid accumulation. This study provides evidence that downregulation of GAS5 may be a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of NAFLD.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"143",35957810,"Detection of Antiviral Tissue Responses and Increased Cell Stress in the Pancreatic Islets of Newly Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes Patients: Results From the DiViD Study.","The Diabetes Virus Detection (DiViD) study has suggested the presence of low-grade enteroviral infection in pancreatic tissue collected from six of six live adult patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The present study aimed to compare the gene and protein expression of selected virally induced pathogen recognition receptors and interferon stimulated genes in islets from these newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (DiViD) subjects vs age-matched non-diabetic (ND) controls. RNA was extracted from laser-captured islets and Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST arrays used to obtain gene expression profiles. Lists of differentially expressed genes were subjected to a data-mining pipeline searching for enrichment of canonical pathways, KEGG pathways, Gene Ontologies, transcription factor binding sites and other upstream regulators. In addition, the presence and localisation of specific viral response proteins (PKR, MxA and MDA5) were examined by combined immunofluorescent labelling in sections of pancreatic tissue. The data analysis and data mining process revealed a significant enrichment of gene ontologies covering viral reproduction and infectious cycles; peptide translation, elongation and initiation, as well as oxidoreductase activity. Enrichment was identified in the KEGG pathways for oxidative phosphorylation; ribosomal and metabolic activity; antigen processing and presentation and in canonical pathways for mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation and EIF2 signaling. Protein Kinase R (PKR) expression did not differ between newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and ND islets at the level of total RNA, but a small subset of β-cells displayed markedly increased PKR protein levels. These PKR+ β-cells correspond to those previously shown to contain the viral protein, VP1. RNA encoding MDA5 was increased significantly in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes islets, and immunostaining of MDA5 protein was seen in α- and certain β-cells in both newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and ND islets, but the expression was increased in β-cells in type 1 diabetes. In addition, an uncharacterised subset of synaptophysin positive, but islet hormone negative, cells expressed intense MDA5 staining and these were more prevalent in DiViD cases. MxA RNA was upregulated in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes vs ND islets and MxA protein was detected exclusively in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes β-cells. The gene expression signatures reveal that pathways associated with cellular stress and increased immunological activity are enhanced in islets from newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients compared to controls. The increases in viral response proteins seen in β-cells in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes provide clear evidence for the activation of IFN signalling pathways. As such, these data strengthen the hypothesis that an enteroviral infection of islet β-cells contributes to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.","misc","wim","misc"
"144",35957813,"Association Between the Ratio of Ovarian Stimulation Duration to Original Follicular Phase Length and In Vitro Fertilization Outcomes: A Novel Index to Optimise Clinical Trigger Time.","The duration of ovarian stimulation which is largely dependent on the ovarian response to hormonal stimulation may influence in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. Menstrual cycle length is potentially a good indicator of ovarian reserve and can predict ovarian response. Ovarian stimulation and the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle are both processes of follicular development. There is no published research to predict the duration of ovarian stimulation based on the length of the menstrual cycle. Our retrospective cohort study included 6110 women with regular menstrual cycles who underwent their first IVF treatment between January 2015 and October 2020. Cycles were classified according to quartiles of the ratio of ovarian stimulation duration to original follicular phase length (OS/FP). Multivariate generalized linear models were applied to assess the association between OS/FP and IVF outcomes. The odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) was estimated for each quartile with the lowest quartile as the comparison group. OS/FP of 0.67 to 0.77 had more retrieved and mature oocytes (adjusted RR 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.15, p for trend = 0.001; adjusted RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.09-1.19, p for trend = 0.001). OS/FP of 0.67 to 0.77 showed the highest rate of fertilization (adjusted OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.17, p for trend = 0.001). OS/FP > 0.77 had the lowest rate of high-quality blastocyst formation (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71-0.93, p for trend = 0.01). No apparent association was noted between OS/FP and clinical pregnancy, live birth, or early miscarriage rate. In conclusion, OS/FP has a significant effect on the number of oocytes, fertilization rate, and high-quality blastocyst formation rate. MCL could be used to predict the duration of ovarian stimulation with an OS/FP of 0.67 to 0.77, which provides a new indicator for the individualized clinical optimization of the trigger time.","misc","wim","meta_analysis"

The postpartum is a critical moment regarding these outcomes particularly in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We investigated the cardio-metabolic and mental health outcomes before and during the pandemic in this population. This cohort study included 418 women with GDM, recruited during two distinct periods. This included 180 women exposed to the pandemic (E+) and recruited between May 2020-April 2021 and 238 women who were not exposed to the pandemic during their postpartum period (attended a year before=non-exposed (E-)) and recruited between January-December 2019. Among the E+, a nested-subcohort of 120 women were exposed both during pregnancy and postpartum. During the pandemic, we adopted a hybrid follow-up of women that consisted of in-person consultations, regular contact via phone calls (35%), sent recorded exercise guide to patients to follow at home and linked to our website. We specifically focused on maintaining motivation and keeping a strong focus on healthy lifestyle behaviors. Obstetric, neonatal, cardio-metabolic and mental health outcomes were assessed during pregnancy and postpartum. The pandemic was not associated with worsened weight, weight retention, glucose tolerance, metabolic syndrome, well-being or depression in the postpartum with the exception of a minimally increased HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure and lower emotional eating scores in E+ women (all p ≤ 0.046). In the nested subcohort, E+ women had a slightly increased HbA1c at the first GDM visit and a higher need for glucose-lowering medication (both p ≤ 0.014), but HbA1c at the end of pregnancy and other cardio-metabolic, mental health, obstetric and neonatal outcomes during pregnancy were similar. The pandemic was not associated with any clinically relevant worsening of cardio-metabolic, mental health, obstetrical and neonatal outcomes in our GDM cohort. This was possibly due to a continued hybrid follow-up, and the partial lockdown in Switzerland.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Twelve patients with obese type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia (traditional Chinese medicine syndrome differentiation was excess heat syndrome of the stomach and intestines) were treated with JTTZR for 24 weeks, and 12 patients were included in the healthy control group. First, blood samples from 6 patients in each group (disease group before treatment, disease group after treatment, and healthy control group) were collected for RNA microarray analysis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to validate these target lncRNAs and mRNAs. Finally, a detailed analysis of the differences in the disease group before treatment vs. the healthy control group and the disease group after treatment vs. the disease group before treatment was undertaken. In addition, we focused on disease-related pathways and analyzed the correlation between the differential expression of target lncRNAs and clinical indicators. (1) Disease group before treatment vs. healthy control group: There were 557 up-regulated lncRNAs, 273 down-regulated lncRNAs, 491 up-regulated mRNAs, and 1639 down-regulated mRNAs. GO analysis and pathway analysis showed that T2DM may be related to cell proliferation in the forebrain, post-embryonic organ development, calcium signaling pathway. qPCR validation showed that the expression of XLOC-005590 and HNF1A-AS1 as target lncRNAs increased, and this was verified by gene chip analysis. (2) Disease group after treatment vs. disease group before treatment: 128 lncRNAs were upregulated, 32 lncRNAs were downregulated, 45 mRNAs were upregulated, and 140 mRNAs were downregulated. GO analysis and pathway analysis showed that JTTZR may treat T2DM through endosome transport, the insulin signaling pathway, and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. qPCR validation showed that in the healthy control group, XLOC_005590 was upregulated, whereas the downstream gene (ECI2) was downregulated in the disease group before treatment. However, after 24 weeks of intervention with JTTZR, XLOC_005590 was downregulated and ECI2 was upregulated compared with the disease group before treatment (0 weeks) (P <0.05). JTTZR may interfere in patients with obese T2DM with dyslipidemia by regulating pathways such as fatty acid degradation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate metabolism.","misc","wim","human_intervention"
"147",35957829,"Electro-Acupuncture Regulates Metabolic Disorders of the Liver and Kidney in Premature Ovarian Failure Mice.","As per the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the liver and kidney dysfunction are important pathogenies for premature ovarian failure (POF). POF is a common gynecological disease that reduced the pregnancy rate. Electro-acupuncture (EA) is a useful non-pharmaceutical therapy that supposedly regulates the function of the liver and kidney in the treatment of POF with TCM. However, the underlying mechanism of EA in the treatment of POF has not been adequately studied through metabonomics with reference to the theory of TCM. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of EA on the liver and kidney metabolites in POF mice through metabolomics. POF mice were established via intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin. Both Sanyinjiao (SP6) and Guanyuan (CV4) were stimulated by EA for 3 weeks. The biological samples (including the serum and the ovary, liver, and kidney tissues) were evaluated by histopathology, molecular biology, and hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR)-based metabolomics to assess the efficacy of EA. 1HNMR data were analyzed by the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The results revealed that EA was beneficial to ovarian function and the menstrual cycle of POF. Both the energy metabolism and neurotransmitter metabolism in the liver and kidney were regulated by EA. Notably, EA played an important role in regulating energy-related metabolism in the kidney, and the better effect of neurotransmitter-related metabolism in the liver was regulated by EA. These findings indicated that the ovarian functions could be improved and the metabolic disorder of the liver and kidney caused by POF could be regulated by EA. Our study results thus suggested that the EA therapy, based on the results for the liver and kidney, were related to POF in TCM, as preliminarily confirmed through metabolomics.","rodent","wim","rodent"

The study was designed as a retrospective cohort trial at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. From January 2017 to December 2020, a total of 1,262 patients with DM were enrolled to assess the risk factors for DPN. The patients were divided into two groups (DPN group and non-DPN group). The Mann-Whitney U test or t-test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, univariate chi-square analyses, and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the adjusted predictors of DPN. The overall prevalence of DPN in DM patients was 72.7% (n = 793/1,091). Multivariate analysis revealed that age > 66 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.647; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.469-4.770; p = 0.002), history of hypertension (OR, 1.829; 95% CI 1.146-2.920; p = 0.011), neutrophil (NE) levels exceeding 4.0 × 109/L (OR 0.256; 95% CI 0.162-0.405; p = 0.001), lymphocyte (LY) levels over 3.0 × 109/L (OR 7.173; 95% CI 4.258-12.086; p = 0.000), HbA1c > 7.7% (OR 3.151; 95% CI 1.959-5.068; p = 0.000), and FT3 > 4.4 pmol/L (OR 0.417; 95% CI 0.263-0.662; p = 0.000) were six significant predictive factors for the prevalence of DPN. High levels of LY, HbA1c, history of hypertension, and > 66 years of age increase the risk of DPN in adult patients with DM, while high levels of NE and FT3 were protective factors of DPN. Thus, the prediction of DPN can significantly be improved by identifying older patients over the age of 66 and history of hypertension, as well as establishing the biochemical cutoff values of NE, LY, HbA1c, and FT3.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

In this study, we investigated the association between GGT and the risk of T2DM using real-world data, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, and literature mining. A cross-sectional study enrolled 3,048 participants (>40 years) from a community in Northeastern China was conducted. A generalized additive model was used to examine the relation between GGT and T2DM. A two-sample MR was performed to investigate the causal effect of GGT (61,089 individuals, mostly of European ancestry) on T2DM (29,193 cases and 182,573 controls of European ancestry). GGT was related to glucose metabolism indicators, such as fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (P < 0.05). The odds ratios (ORs) [95% confidence interval (95% CI), P] for T2DM across the GGT categories (14-16, 17-20, 21-25, 26-35, ≥36) were 1.14 [(0.88-1.47), P = 0.330], 1.55 [(1.22-1.98), P < 0.001], 1.87 [(1.47-2.28), P < 0.001], 1.97 [(1.55-2.52), P < 0.001], and 2.29 [(1.78-2.94), P < 0.001] versus GGT ≤ 13 category after adjusting for potential confounding factors. A generalized additive model identified a non-linear correlation between GGT and T2DM and indicated that the risk of T2DM almost levelled out when GGT exceeded 34 IU/L. The MR analysis showed that the odds of having T2DM for a one-time increase in genetically determined GGT was 0.998 [(0.995-1.002), P = 0.34]. Our analysis of observational study suggested that GGT, its increment, within a certain range, is indicative of the development of T2DM. However, MR analysis provided no evidence that GGT is a linear causal factor of T2DM. Further investigation is required to determine if GGT exerts a non-linear causal effect on T2DM.","misc","wim","meta_analysis"

However, the optimal strategy of capecitabine-based chemotherapy remains uncertain. We conducted this network meta-analysis to address this issue. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to retrieve eligible studies published before September 2021. Two independent reviewers extracted information from eligible studies using a pre-designed data extraction sheet. The primary outcome included disease-free survival, and the second outcome showed overall survival and adverse events. Direct meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4, and Bayesian network analysis was performed using R version 3.6.1 with the gemtc and rjags packages. Nine studies involving 3661 TNBC patients met the selection criteria. The network meta-analysis suggested that the addition of capecitabine to adjuvant chemotherapy achieved a significantly longer disease-free (HR = 0.66, 95% CrI = 0.49 to 0.86) and overall survival time (HR = 0.60, 95% CrI = 0.43 to 0.83) than standard chemotherapy. All comparisons did not achieve statistical significance. The addition of capecitabine to adjuvant chemotherapy was the most effective treatment for improving disease-free (81.24%) and overall survival (78.46%) times, and the replacement of capecitabine to adjuvant chemotherapy was the safest regime. Based on available evidence, capecitabine-based chemotherapy benefits TNBC patients, and the addition of capecitabine with adjuvant chemotherapy was the most effective regime. In contrast, the replacement of capecitabine to adjuvant chemotherapy was the safest regime. More studies of high quality and large scale are needed to confirm our findings.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

Growing evidence suggests that pregnancy complications are more frequent and severe in pregnant women with pregestational type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the different types of maternal diabetes may lead to targeted strategies to prevent or reduce pregnancy complications. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs), one of the most common epigenetic mechanisms, have emerged as key players in the pathophysiology of pregnancy-related disorders including diabetes. This review aims to provide an update on the status of miRNA profiling in pregnancies complicated by maternal diabetes. Four databases, Pubmed, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and Scopus were searched to identify studies that profiled miRNAs during maternal diabetes. A total of 1800 articles were identified, of which 53 are included in this review. All studies profiled miRNAs during GDM, with no studies on miRNA profiling during pregestational T1DM and T2DM identified. Studies on GDM were mainly focused on the potential of miRNAs to serve as predictive or diagnostic biomarkers. This review highlights the lack of miRNA profiling in pregnancies complicated by T1DM and T2DM and identifies the need for miRNA profiling in all types of maternal diabetes. Such studies could contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that link maternal diabetes type with pregnancy complications.","misc","wim","systematic_review"

Health promotion and lifestyle modification programmes (LMPs) may be effective on reducing the symptoms. The objective of this study was to analyse the clinical effectiveness of a LMP and a LMP plus Information and Communication Technologies, when compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU) over 6 months. The interventions were offered as an adjuvant treatment delivered in Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCs) for people with depression symptoms. We conducted an open-label, multicentre, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial. Participants were recruited from several PHCs. Those participants visiting general practitioner for any reason, who also met the inclusion criteria (scoring 10 to 30 points on the Beck II Self-Applied Depression Inventory) were invited to take part in the study. TAU+LMP consisted of six weekly 90-min group sessions focused on improving lifestyle. TAU+LMP + ICTs replicated the TAU+LMP format, plus the addition of a wearable smartwatch to measure daily minutes walked and sleep patterns. A total of 188 participants consented to participate in the study and were randomized. We used linear mixed models, with a random intercept and an unstructured covariance to evaluate the impact of the interventions compared to TAU. Both interventions showed a statistically significant reduction on depressive symptoms compared to TAU (TAU+LMP vs. TAU slope difference, b = -3.38, 95% CI= [-5.286, -1.474] p = 0.001 and TAU+LMP+ICTs vs. TAU slope difference, b = -4.05, 95% CI = [-5.919, -2.197], p < 0.001). These reductions imply a moderate effect size. In the TAU+LMP+ICTs there was a significant increase regarding minutes walking per week (b = 99.77) and adherence to Mediterranean diet (b = 0.702). In the TAU+LMP there was a significant decrease regarding bad sleep quality (b = -1.24). TAU+LMPs administered in PHCs to people experiencing depression symptoms were effective on reducing these symptoms compared to TAU. They also have a positive impact on changing several lifestyle factors. These findings indicate that these interventions can be promising strategies for PHCs.","misc","wim","randomized_trial"

The review was conducted following the JBI methodology for systematic reviews. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for grading the certainty of the evidence is reported (registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, CRD42020198267). Thirty studies that fulfilled selection criteria were included; 19 primary studies provided estimates of sensitivity (0.91, 95%CI = [0.88-0.93]) and specificity (0.73, 95%CI = [0.61; 0.82]) of chest CT for COVID-19.

Evidence for sensitivity estimates was graded as MODERATE, and for specificity estimates it was graded as LOW. The value of chest CT appears to be that of an additional screening tool that can easily detect PCR false negatives, which are reportedly highly frequent.

Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) has been widely used in children with Rb and has achieved an ideal therapeutic effect. However, IAC has side effects, including anemia and bone marrow suppression, for which explicit evidence on the risk factors is lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the covariates that may affect the occurrence of anemia and bone marrow suppression in children with Rb after IAC. Children with Rb admitted between May 2019 and January 2021 were included into the study. The differences in the number of children with anemia and bone marrow suppression before and after IAC according to different covariates were recorded. All potential impact factors were included into the univariate and multivariate regression models to identify the related covariates of post-IAC anemia and bone marrow suppression. Data of 282 children with Rb were retrospectively collected. After IAC, children with Rb had increased severities of anemia (p <0.0001, chi-square test) and bone marrow suppression (p = 0.001, chi-square test). Moreover, the number of children with Rb who had an increased cross-level change in the severity of anemia and degree of bone marrow suppression was 80 (41.24%) and 64 (32.49%), respectively. The univariate regression analysis showed that numerous factors (such as pre-IAC intravenous chemotherapy, results of pre-IAC routine blood tests, and some serological indicators for liver and kidney function) affected the anemia severity and degree of bone marrow suppression in children with Rb after IAC. Additionally, the predictive model of the multivariate regression could predict anemia and bone marrow suppression. Children with Rb may have an increased risk of anemia and bone marrow suppression after IAC, but this is temporary and can be influenced by several factors. Therefore, IAC should be maintained as the standard of care. We generated predictive equations for predicting anemia severity and degree of bone marrow suppression, which can guide the prediction and timely control of anemia and bone marrow suppression after IAC.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

This study investigated the feasibility of combining radionuclides with photothermal agents in the diagnosis and treatment of ATC. 131I was labeled on human serum albumin (HSA) by the standard chloramine T method. 131I-HSA and indocyanine green (ICG) were non-covalently bound by a simple stirring to obtain 131I-HSA-ICG nanoparticles. Characterizations were performed in vitro. The cytotoxicity and imaging ability were investigated by cell/in vivo experiments. The radio-photothermal therapy efficacy of the nanoparticles was evaluated at the cellular and in vivo levels. The synthesized nanoparticles had a suitable size (25-45 nm) and objective biosafety. Under the irradiation of near-IR light, the photothermal conversion efficiency of the nanoparticles could reach 24.25%. In vivo fluorescence imaging and single-photon emission CT (SPECT)/CT imaging in small animals confirmed that I-HSA-ICG/131I-HSA-ICG nanoparticles could stay in tumor tissues for 4-6 days. Compared with other control groups, 131I-HSA-ICG nanoparticles had the most significant ablation effect on tumor cells under the irradiation of an 808-nm laser. In summary, 131I-HSA-ICG nanoparticles could successfully perform dual-modality imaging and treatment of ATC, which provides a new direction for the future treatment of iodine-refractory thyroid cancer.","misc","wim","misc"
"159",35957871,"The IFN-γ-related long non-coding RNA signature predicts prognosis and indicates immune microenvironment infiltration in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma.","One of the most common diseases that have a negative impact on women's health is endometrial carcinoma (EC). Advanced endometrial cancer has a dismal prognosis and lacks solid prognostic indicators. IFN-γ is a key cytokine in the inflammatory response, and it has also been suggested that it has a role in the tumor microenvironment. The significance of IFN-γ-related genes and long non-coding RNAs in endometrial cancer, however, is unknown. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to download RNA-seq data from endometrial cancer tissues and normal controls. Genes associated with IFN-γ were retrieved from the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) website. Co-expression analysis was performed to find lncRNAs linked to IFN-γ gene. The researchers employed weighted co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to find lncRNAs that were strongly linked to survival. The prognostic signature was created using univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The training cohort, validation cohort, and entire cohort of endometrial cancer patients were then split into high-risk and low-risk categories. To investigate variations across different risk groups, we used survival analysis, enrichment analysis, and immune microenvironment analysis. The platform for analysis is R software (version X64 3.6.1). Based on the transcript expression of IFN-γ-related lncRNAs, two distinct subgroups of EC from TCGA cohort were formed, each with different outcomes. Ten IFN-γ-related lncRNAs were used to build a predictive signature using Cox regression analysis and the LASSO regression, including CFAP58, LINC02014, UNQ6494, AC006369.1, NRAV, BMPR1B-DT, AC068134.2, AP002840.2, GS1-594A7.3, and OLMALINC. The high-risk group had a considerably worse outcome (p < 0.05). In the immunological microenvironment, there were also substantial disparities across different risk categories. Our findings give a reference for endometrial cancer prognostic type and immunological status assessment, as well as prospective molecular markers for the disease.","misc","wim","misc"

However, the prognosis and risk factors for recurrence in patients with sHCC remain unclear. This study investigated the risk factors for the recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related sHCC after SBRT. A total of 240 HBV-related sHCC patients treated with SBRT between March 2011 and March 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The cumulative probability of recurrence was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with Cox proportional hazard models. Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma developed in 134 (55.8%) patients at a median time of 27 months after SBRT. The one- and two-year rates of recurrence were 20.9 and 45.0%, respectively. The median follow-up time was 30 months. The Cox multivariate analysis indicated that age (P = 0.029, HR [1.019, 1.002-1.037]), tumor size (P = 0.012, HR [1.227, 1.045-1.440]), and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (P = 0.005, HR [1.911, 1.221-2.989]) were independent risk factors for recurrence.

This study investigated the role of CEMIP in the progression and metastasis of osteosarcoma, CEMIP was found to be overexpressed in osteosarcoma tissues when compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, and its expression was positively associated with a poor prognosis in osteosarcoma patients. Silencing CEMIP decreased osteosarcoma cells proliferation, migration, and invasion, but enhanced apoptosis in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, CEMIP promoted osteosarcoma cells growth and metastasis through activating Notch signaling pathway, silencing CEMIP would reduce the protein expression and activation of Notch/Jagged1/Hes1 signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo, activation of Notch signaling pathway could partially reversed cell proliferation and migration in shCEMIP osteosarcoma cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that CEMIP plays a substantial role in the progression of osteosarcoma via Notch signaling pathway, providing a promising therapeutic target in osteosarcoma.","misc","wim","misc"

Consecutive mid to low RC cases who underwent transabdominal resection between June 2020 and August 2021 were retrospectively enrolled. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out for identifying factors (clinical factors and MRI-based pelvimetry parameters) independently associated with the difficulty level of rectal surgery. A nomogram model was established with the selected parameters for predicting the probability of high surgical difficulty. The predictive ability of the nomogram model was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 122 cases were included. BMI (OR = 1.269, p = 0.006), pelvic inlet (OR = 1.057, p = 0.024) and intertuberous distance (OR = 0.938, p = 0.001) independently predicted surgical difficulty level in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The nomogram model combining these predictors had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.801 (95% CI: 0.719-0.868) for the prediction of a high level of surgical difficulty. The DCA suggested that using the nomogram to predict surgical difficulty provided a clinical benefit. The nomogram model is feasible for predicting the difficulty level of rectal surgery, utilizing MRI-based pelvimetry parameters and clinical factors in mid to low RC cases.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Understanding the cybernetics of cancer requires the integration of information dynamics across multidimensional spatiotemporal scales, including genetic, transcriptional, metabolic, proteomic, epigenetic, and multi-cellular networks. However, the time-series analysis of these complex networks remains vastly absent in cancer research. With longitudinal screening and time-series analysis of cellular dynamics, universally observed causal patterns pertaining to dynamical systems, may self-organize in the signaling or gene expression state-space of cancer triggering processes. A class of these patterns, strange attractors, may be mathematical biomarkers of cancer progression. The emergence of intracellular chaos and chaotic cell population dynamics remains a new paradigm in systems medicine. As such, chaotic and complex dynamics are discussed as mathematical hallmarks of cancer cell fate dynamics herein. Given the assumption that time-resolved single-cell datasets are made available, a survey of interdisciplinary tools and algorithms from complexity theory, are hereby reviewed to investigate critical phenomena and chaotic dynamics in cancer ecosystems. To conclude, the perspective cultivates an intuition for computational systems oncology in terms of nonlinear dynamics, information theory, inverse problems, and complexity.

"164",35957881,"RET signaling pathway and RET inhibitors in human cancer.","Rearranged during transfection (RET) receptor tyrosine kinase was first identified over thirty years ago as a novel transforming gene. Since its discovery and subsequent pathway characterization, RET alterations have been identified in numerous cancer types and are most prevalent in thyroid carcinomas and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In other tumor types such as breast cancer and salivary gland carcinomas, RET alterations can be found at lower frequencies. Aberrant RET activity is associated with poor prognosis of thyroid and lung carcinoma patients, and is strongly correlated with increased risk of distant metastases. RET aberrations encompass a variety of genomic or proteomic alterations, most of which confer constitutive activation of RET. Activating RET alterations, such as point mutations or gene fusions, enhance activity of signaling pathways downstream of RET, namely PI3K/AKT, RAS/RAF, MAPK, and PLCγ pathways, to promote cell proliferation, growth, and survival. Given the important role that mutant RET plays in metastatic cancers, significant efforts have been made in developing inhibitors against RET kinase activity. These efforts have led to FDA approval of Selpercatinib and Pralsetinib for NSCLC, as well as, additional selective RET inhibitors in preclinical and clinical testing. This review covers the current biological understanding of RET signaling, the impact of RET hyperactivity on tumor progression in multiple tumor types, and RET inhibitors with promising preclinical and clinical efficacy.","misc","wim","misc"

However, the mechanism involved in this early stage of metastasis remains largely unknown. Microarray analysis was used to carry out differential genomics analyses between matched pairs of metastatic sentinel lymph node tissues and breast primary tumors. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system was used for in vivo screening by transplanting a loss-of-function cell pool into immunocompromised mice. MAGeCK was used to analyze the screening results. Survival analysis was performed via the Kaplan-Meier method. Cell proliferation, wound healing, migration and invasion assays were performed to confirm the phenotype. A tail vein model and subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model were used for the in vivo study. The relationship between coiled-coil domain containing 102B (CCDC102B) and receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) was examined using coimmunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, nuclear protein extraction and immunofluorescence assays. The primary biological functions and pathways related to CCDC102B were enriched by RNA sequencing. We identified CCDC102B through screening and found that it was significantly upregulated in metastatic lesions in lymph nodes compared to matched primary tumors. Increased expression of CCDC102B promoted breast cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, high expression of CCDC102B was correlated with poor clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. We further identified that CCDC102B was stabilized by the loss of RACK1, a protein negatively correlated with breast cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, we found that RACK1 promoted CCDC102B lysosomal degradation by mediating chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). The aggressive behavior of CCDC102B in breast cancer cells could be reversed by the expression of RACK1. Moreover, CCDC102B was correlated with the significant enrichment of NF-κB pathway components. Overexpressing CCDC102B led to less interaction between RACK1 and IKKa. Thus, CCDC102B positively regulates the NF-κB pathway by interacting with RACK1. Taken together, our findings uncover a novel role of CCDC102B in breast cancer metastasis. CCDC102B serves as a potential metastasis promoter by regulating the activation of the NF-κB pathway and can be degraded by RACK1 via CMA.","misc","wim","rodent"

The lncRNA-mRNA regulatory network has not been fully elucidated. We downloaded the NPC-related gene expression datasets GSE53819 and GSE12452 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database; GSE53819 included 18 NPC tissues and 18 normal tissues, and GSE12452 included 31 NPC tissues and 10 normal tissues. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed on mRNA and lncRNA to screen out modules that were highly correlated with tumor progression. The two datasets were subjected to differential analysis after removing batch effects, and then Venn diagrams were used to screen for overlapping genes in the module genes and differential genes. The lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was then constructed, and key mRNAs were identified by MCODE analysis and expression analysis. GSEA analysis and qRT-PCR were performed on key mRNAs. Through a series of analyses, we speculated that BTK, CD72, PTPN6, and VAV1 may be independent predictors of the prognosis of NPC patients.Taken together, our study provides potential candidate biomarkers for NPC diagnosis, prognosis, or precise treatment.","misc","wim","misc"

Recently, the presence of tumor-infiltrating T cells has been associated with significant survival advantages in a variety of disease sites. The present study will determine if the inclusion of T cell specific markers (CD3, CD4 and CD8) would enhance the prognostic value of EGFR in OSCCs. Tissue microarrays containing 146 OSCC cases were analyzed for EGFR, CD3, CD4 and CD8 expression using immunohistochemical staining. EGFR and T cell expression scores were correlated with clinicopathological parameters and survival outcomes. Results showed that EGFR expression had no impact on overall survival (OS), but EGFR-positive (EGFR+) OSCC patients demonstrated significantly worse progression free survival (PFS) compared to EGFR-negative (EGFR-) patients. Patients with CD3, CD4 and CD8-positive tumors had significantly better OS compared to CD3, CD4 and CD8-negative patients respectively, but no impact on PFS. Combined EGFR+/CD3+ expression was associated with cases with no nodal involvement and significantly more favorable OS compared to EGFR+/CD3- expression. CD3 expression had no impact on OS or PFS in EGFR- patients. Combinations of EGFR/CD8 and EGFR/CD4 expression showed no significant differences in OS or PFS among the expression groups. Altogether these results suggest that the expression of CD3+ tumor-infiltrating T cells can enhance the prognostic value of EGFR expression and warrants further investigation as prognostic biomarkers for OSCC.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

However, there is lacking systematic assessment of stem-like indices and associations with a response of sorafenib in HCC. Our study thus aimed to evaluate the status of tumor dedifferentiation for HCC and further identify the regulatory mechanisms under the condition of resistance to sorafenib. Datasets of HCC, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs) expression, somatic mutation, and clinical information were collected. The mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi), which can represent degrees of dedifferentiation of HCC samples, was calculated to predict drug response of sorafenib therapy and prognosis. Next, unsupervised cluster analysis was conducted to distinguish mRNAsi-based subgroups, and gene/geneset functional enrichment analysis was employed to identify key sorafenib resistance-related pathways. In addition, we analyzed and confirmed the regulation of key genes discovered in this study by combining other omics data. Finally, Luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate their regulation. Our study demonstrated that the stemness index obtained from transcriptomic is a promising biomarker to predict the response of sorafenib therapy and the prognosis in HCC. We revealed the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway (the PPAR signaling pathway), related to fatty acid biosynthesis, that was a potential sorafenib resistance pathway that had not been reported before. By analyzing the core regulatory genes of the PPAR signaling pathway, we identified four candidate target genes, retinoid X receptor beta (RXRB), nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3 (NR1H3), cytochrome P450 family 8 subfamily B member 1 (CYP8B1) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), as a signature to distinguish the response of sorafenib. We proposed and validated that the RXRB and NR1H3 could directly regulate NR1H3 and SCD, respectively. Our results suggest that the combined use of SCD inhibitors and sorafenib may be a promising therapeutic approach.","misc","wim","misc"

Great attention has been given to the impact of damp-heat syndrome on tumorigenesis and progression, but less attention has been given to damp-heat modeling per se. Studying PC in a proper damp-heat syndrome animal model can recapitulate the actual pathological process and contribute to treatment strategy improvement. Here, an optimized damp-heat syndrome mouse model was established based on our prior experience. The Fibonacci method was applied to determine the maximum tolerated dosage of alcohol for mice. Damp-heat syndrome modeling with the old and new methods was performed in parallel of comparative study about general appearance, food intake, water consumption and survival. Major organs, including the liver, kidneys, lungs, pancreas, spleen, intestines and testes, were collected for histological evaluation. Complete blood counts and biochemical tests were conducted to characterize changes in blood circulation. PC cells were subcutaneously inoculated into mice with damp-heat syndrome to explore the impact of damp-heat syndrome on PC growth. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson staining and immunohistochemistry were performed for pathological evaluation. A chemokine microarray was applied to screen the cytokines mediating the proliferation-promoting effects of damp-heat syndrome, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were conducted for results validation. The new modeling method has the advantages of mouse-friendly features, easily accessible materials, simple operation, and good stability. More importantly, a set of systematic indicators was proposed for model evaluation. The new modeling method verified the pancreatic tumor-promoting role of damp-heat syndrome. Damp-heat syndrome induced the proliferation of cancer-associated fibroblasts and promoted desmoplasia. In addition, circulating and tumor-located chemokine levels were altered by damp-heat syndrome, characterized by tumor promotion and immune suppression. This study established a stable and reproducible murine model of damp-heat syndrome in TCM with systematic evaluation methods. Cancer associated fibroblast-mediated desmoplasia and chemokine production contribute to the tumor-promoting effect of damp-heat syndrome on PC.","rodent","wim","rodent"

When curative resection is not possible, palliative systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and platinum derivate as first line followed by a 5-FU doublet combination as second line is the standard therapy. Recently, targeted therapy and immunotherapy have rapidly emerged as personalized therapeutic approaches requiring previous tumor sequencing and molecular profiling. BRCA mutations are well-characterized targets for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). However, BRCA gene mutations in CCA are rare and few data of PARPi in the treatment of CCA are available. Immunotherapy with programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) has been shown to be effective in combination with chemotherapy or in PD-L1-positive CCA. However, data from immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy, including PARPi, are lacking. In this report, we present the case of a male patient with PD-L1-positive and BRCA2-mutated metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, who was treated with a combined therapy with PARP (PARPi), olaparib, and a PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, as second-line therapy after gemcitabine/platinum derivate failure. Combined therapy was able to induce a long-lasting complete remission for over 15 months. The combined therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Only mild anemia and immune-related thyroiditis were observed, which were easily manageable and did not result in discontinuation of olaparib and pembrolizumab. The presented case showed substantial clinical activity of a combination with olaparib/pembrolizumab in advanced BRCA2-mutated CCA. Thus, identifying targetable molecular signatures and combinations of targeted therapies with immunotherapy reveals a promising strategy to effectively treat patients with cholangiocarcinoma and should be considered after failure of standard chemotherapy.","misc","wim","misc"

The main goal of this paper is to analyze and compare out-of-field neutron and non-neutron organ doses inside 5- and 10-year-old pediatric anthropomorphic phantoms for the treatment of a 5-cm-diameter brain tumor. Proton irradiations were carried out at the Cyclotron Centre Bronowice in IFJ PAN Krakow Poland using a pencil beam scanning technique (PBS) at a gantry with a dedicated scanning nozzle (IBA Proton Therapy System, Proteus 235). Thermoluminescent and radiophotoluminescent dosimeters were used for non-neutron dose measurements while secondary neutrons were measured with track-etched detectors. Out-of-field doses measured using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) were compared with previous measurements performed within a WG9 for three different photon radiotherapy techniques: 1) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 2) three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D CDRT) performed on a Varian Clinac 2300 linear accelerator (LINAC) in the Centre of Oncology, Krakow, Poland, and 3) Gamma Knife surgery performed on the Leksell Gamma Knife (GK) at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia. Phantoms and detectors used in experiments as well as the target location were the same for both photon and proton modalities. The total organ dose equivalent expressed as the sum of neutron and non-neutron components in IMPT was found to be significantly lower (two to three orders of magnitude) in comparison with the different photon radiotherapy techniques for the same delivered tumor dose. For IMPT, neutron doses are lower than non-neutron doses close to the target but become larger than non-neutron doses further away from the target. Results of WG9 studies have provided out-of-field dose levels required for an extensive set of radiotherapy techniques, including proton therapy, and involving a complete description of organ doses of pediatric patients. Such studies are needed for validating mathematical models and Monte Carlo simulation tools for out-of-field dosimetry which is essential for dedicated epidemiological studies which evaluate the risk of second cancers and other late effects for pediatric patients treated with radiotherapy.","misc","wim","misc"

This retrospective trial included data from 169 patients received surgical treatment for CBT from October 2008 to September 2018 in this retrospective study. Postoperative follow-up was conducted under the guidance of both vascular surgeon and neurologist. The symptoms existed less than 2 years postoperatively were regarded as temporary injuries. The red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were obtained from the complete blood count results of the participants. Analyses of multilevel multivariable regression and descriptive statistics were conducted. The baseline data showed no significant difference. Patients were predominantly women (53.8%), with a mean age of 42.6 years. The total incidence of temporary postoperative complications was 22 (13.0%), including transient ischemic attack (8, 4.7%), tongue bias (7, 4.1%), dysphagia (2, 1.2%), hoarseness (4, 1.8%), and eyelid ptosis (1, 2.4%). The univariate and multivariate regression analysis results revealed that the occurrence of temporary postoperative complications was increased with age [odd ratio (OR, 0.09; 95% CI (CI), 0.9-1.0; P = 0.014], length of operation time (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.0-1.0; P = 0.005), Shamblin type II vs. I (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-0.5; P = 0.008), red blood cell count postoperative (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.8; P = 0.026), hemoglobin (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.9-1.0; P = 0.011), and hematocrit (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-1.0; P = 0.025). The smooth curve fitting showed that the trend of complications occurrence rate was reduced with the increase of patients' postoperative red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Gender, weight, length of operation, Shamblin type, postoperative red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were included in the risk model with AUC = 0.86.

We used a single sample gene set enrichment assay (ssGSEA) to quantify the relative abundance of 28 cells, then used the LASSO COX regression model to develop a riskScore prognostic model, followed by a small molecule drug screening and molecular docking validation, which was then validated using qRT-PCR and IHC. We developed a prognosis model around seven essential protective genes for the first time, dramatically elevated in tumor tissues, as did immune cell infiltration. Multivariate Cox regression results indicated that riskScore is an independent and robust prognostic indicator, and its predictive value in immunotherapy was verified. Additionally, we identified Gabapentin as a possible small molecule therapeutic for CM. A riskScore model was developed in this work to analyze patient prognosis, TME cell infiltration features, and treatment responsiveness. The development of this model not only aids in predicting patient response to immunotherapy but also has significant implications for the development of novel immunotherapeutic agents and the promotion of tailored treatment regimens.","misc","wim","misc"

A comparison cohort of four age- and marital status-matched healthy individuals was selected for RTRs. The clinical characteristics and cervical screening results of RTRs were analyzed. Our study included 196 female renal transplant recipients (RTRs), none of whom had been vaccinated against HPV. Overall high-risk HPV (hrHPV) infection and abnormal cytology rates in the RTR group were 23.5% and 20.9%, respectively. The odds ratios of hrHPV infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ in RTRs vs. non-RTRs were 3.033 (95% CI, 2.013-4.568) and 3.628 (95% CI, 1.863-7.067), respectively. The prevalence of HPV16 in RTRs was much higher (30.4% vs. 8.3%, P=0.002). The multi-infection rate was much higher in HPV-infected RTRs (23.9% vs. 1.14%, P<0.001). The only risk factor for hrHPV infection was the duration of immunosuppression, which increased with time. RTRs had significantly higher HPV infection rates and increased risks of HPV-related cervical premalignancies and cancers due to the immunosuppressed state. The duration of immunosuppression is a risk factor for transplant recipients. Female RTRs may benefit from more frequent cervical cancer screening after renal transplantation than healthy women. Prospective research on HPV infection dynamics in RTRs and optimal screening methods should be further explored in the future.","misc","wim","human_intervention"
"177",35957912,"A distinct lipid metabolism signature of acute myeloid leukemia with prognostic value.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly aggressive hematological malignancy characterized by extensive genetic abnormalities that might affect the prognosis and provide potential drug targets for treatment. Reprogramming of lipid metabolism plays important roles in tumorigenesis and progression and has been newly recognized a new hallmark of malignancy, and some related molecules in the signal pathways could be prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. However, the clinical value of lipid metabolism reprogramming in AML has not been systematically explored. In this study, we aim to explore the clinical value of lipid metabolism reprogramming and develop a prognostic risk signature for AML. We implemented univariate Cox regression analysis to identify the prognosis-related lipid metabolism genes, and then performed LASSO analysis to develop the risk signature with six lipid metabolism-related genes (LDLRAP1, PNPLA6, DGKA, PLA2G4A, CBR1, and EBP). The risk scores of samples were calculated and divided into low- and high-risk groups by the median risk score. Survival analysis showed the high-risk group hold the significantly poorer outcomes than the low-risk group. The signature was validated in the GEO datasets and displayed a robust prognostic value in the stratification analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed the signature was an independent prognostic factor for AML patients and could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in clinical evaluation. Furthermore, the risk signature was also found to be closely related to immune landscape and immunotherapy response in AML. Overall, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of lipid metabolism in AML and constructed a risk signature with six genes related to lipid metabolism for the malignancy, prognosis, and immune landscape of AML, and our study might contribute to better understanding in the use of metabolites and metabolic pathways as the potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AML.","misc","wim","misc"

To clarify its impact on the development of early cardiac dysfunction, we developed an experimental model in which the hearts of rats were exposed, in a fractionated plan, to clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation for oncological patients that undergo thoracic radiotherapy. Rat hearts were exposed to daily doses of 0.04, 0.3, and 1.2 Gy for 23 days, achieving cumulative doses of 0.92, 6.9, and 27.6 Gy, respectively. We demonstrate that myocardial deformation, assessed by global longitudinal strain, was impaired (a relative percentage reduction of >15% from baseline) in a dose-dependent manner at 18 months. Moreover, by scanning electron microscopy, the microvascular density in the cardiac apex was significantly decreased exclusively at 27.6 Gy dosage. Before GLS impairment detection, several tools (qRT-PCR, mass spectrometry, and western blot) were used to assess molecular changes in the cardiac tissue. The number/expression of several genes, proteins, and KEGG pathways, related to inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiac muscle contraction, were differently expressed in the cardiac tissue according to the cumulative dose. Subclinical cardiac dysfunction occurs in a dose-dependent manner as detected by molecular changes in cardiac tissue, a predictor of the severity of global longitudinal strain impairment. Moreover, there was no dose threshold below which no myocardial deformation impairment was detected. Our findings i) contribute to developing new markers and exploring non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging to assess cardiac tissue changes as an early predictor of cardiac dysfunction; ii) should raise red flags, since there is no dose threshold below which no myocardial deformation impairment was detected and should be considered in radiation-based imaging and -guided therapeutic cardiac procedures; and iii) highlights the need for personalized clinical approaches.","misc","wim","rodent"

Based on a review of all historical clinical TMLI treatments plans, we retrieved a 12-Gy cohort of 108 patients with a prescription dose of 12 Gy to the skeletal bones, lymph nodes, spleen, and spinal canal, and retrieved a 20-Gy cohort of 120 patients with an escalated prescription dose of 20 Gy to the skeletal bones, lymph nodes, spleen, and spinal cord, and 12 Gy to the brain and liver. Representative dosimetric parameters including mean and median dose, D80, and D10 (dose covering 80% and 10% of the structure volume, respectively) for targets and normal organs were extracted and compared between the two groups of patients. For the 12-Gy cohort, the average mean dose for normal organs ranged from 18.3% to 78.3% of 12 Gy, and the average median dose ranged from 18.3% to 77.5% of 12 Gy. For the 20-Gy cohort, the average mean dose for normal organs ranged from 13.0% to 76.0% of 20 Gy, and the average median dose ranged from 12.5% to 75.0% of 20 Gy. Compared to the mean dose to normal organs in the 12-Gy cohort, the average mean dose to normal organs increased from 0.0% to 73.1%, with only four normal organs showing a >50% increase. Normal organ dose in TMLI plans using volumetric modulated arc therapy fields fell within the dose range in historical TMLI plans. Dosimetric data in historical TMLI plans at our institution are summarized at prescription dose levels of 12 Gy and 20 Gy, respectively. Compared to the normal organ dose with a prescription dose of 12 Gy, the mean and median dose to most normal organs at an escalated prescription dose of 20 Gy had an increase less than prescription dose scaling. Dosimetric results from this study can be used as reference data to facilitate clinical implementation of TMLI at other institutions.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

However, MET fusions in NSCLC have rarely been revealed. In this report, a 63-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma (LADC), harboring EGFR exon 18 G719D and exon 21 L861Q mutations, received first-generation, EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) icotinib therapy. Next generation sequencing (NGS) results only displayed an EGFR T790M point mutation following icotinib resistance. Thus, the patient was treated with osimertinib and achieved a stable disease (SD). However, disease progressed after 15 months and a novel MET fusion (CUX1 exon14-MET exon15) in addition to EGFR G719D/L861Q mutations were simultaneously detected in a tissue biopsy sample. After more than nine months, the patient subsequently achieved a PR with the combination of icotinib and crizotinib. To our knowledge, this is the first case of LADC patient displaying the presence of EGFR double uncommon mutations and an acquired novel CUX1-MET fusion that has benefited from icotinib plus crizotinib treatment. Following nine months of PR with icotinib plus crizotinib, the patient, until the time of publication, is exhibiting stable disease. The results suggest that the CUX1-MET fusion may be sensitive to crizotinib, although previous reports indicated that some MET fusion cases did not respond to crizotinib. Given this disparity, distinguishing MET fusion partners when crizotinib is used in LADC treatment is also very important.","misc","wim","misc"

Here we set out to assess (1) the understudied relation between contextual Pavlovian inhibitory control and hyperactivity/impulsivity in adults with ADHD and (2) whether this inhibition can be enhanced by mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Within the framework of a randomized controlled trial 50 Adult ADHD patients were assessed before and after 8 weeks of treatment as usual (TAU) with (n = 24) or without (n = 26) MBCT. We employed a well-established behavioral Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer task that quantifies Pavlovian inhibitory control over instrumental behavior. Task results revealed (1) less aversive Pavlovian inhibition in ADHD patients with clinically relevant hyperactivity/impulsivity than in those without; and (2) enhanced Pavlovian inhibition across all ADHD patients after TAU+MBCT compared with TAU. These findings offer new insights in the neurocognitive mechanisms of hyperactivity/impulsivity in ADHD and its treatment: We reveal a role for Pavlovian inhibitory mechanisms in understanding hyperactive/impulsive behaviors in ADHD and point toward MBCT as an intervention that might influence these mechanisms.","misc","wim","randomized_trial"
"183",35957922,"Synergistic consequences of early-life social isolation and chronic stress impact coping and neural mechanisms underlying male prairie vole susceptibility and resilience.","Chronic stress can be challenging, lead to maladaptive coping strategies, and cause negative mental and physical health outcomes. Early-life adversity exposes developing young to physical or psychological experiences that risks surpassing their capacity to effectively cope, thereby impacting their lifetime physical and mental wellbeing. Sensitivity to stressful events, like social isolation, has the potential to magnify stress-coping. Chronic stress through social defeat is an established paradigm that models adverse early-life experiences and can trigger enduring alterations in behavioral and neural phenotypes. To assess the degree to which stress resilience and sensitivity stemming from early-life chronic stress impact sociability, we exposed male prairie voles to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) during adolescence. We simultaneously exposed subjects to either social isolation (CSDS+Isol) or group housing (CSDS+Soc) during this crucial time of development. On PND41, all subjects underwent a social approach test to examine the immediate impact of isolation, CSDS, or their combined effects on sociability. Unlike the CSDS+Isol group which primarily displayed social avoidance, the CSDS+Soc group was split by individuals exhibiting susceptible or resilient stress phenotypes. Notably, the Control+Soc and CSDS+Soc animals and their cage-mates significantly gained body weight between PND31 and PND40, whereas the Control+Isol and CSDS+Isol animals did not. These results suggest that the effects of early-life stress may be mitigated by having access to social support. Vasopressin, oxytocin, and opioids and their receptors (avpr1a, oxtr, oprk1, oprm1, and oprd1) are known to modulate social and stress-coping behaviors in the lateral septum (LS). Therefore, we did an mRNA expression analysis with RT-qPCR of the avpr1a, oxtr, oprk1, oprm1, and oprd1 genes to show that isolation and CSDS, or their collective influence, can potentially differentially bias sensitivity of the LS to early-life stressors. Collectively, our study supports the impact and dimensionality of early-life adversity because the type (isolation vs. CSDS), duration (acute vs. chronic), and combination (isolation + CSDS) of stressors can dynamically alter behavioral and neural outcomes.","misc","wim","rodent"
"184",35957923,"A modified mouse model for observational fear learning and the influence of social hierarchy.","Indirectly experiencing traumatic events either by witnessing or learning of a loved one's suffering is associated with the highest prevalence rates of epidemiological features of PTSD. Social species can develop fear by observing conspecifics in distress. Observational fear learning (OFL) is one of the most widely used paradigms for studying fear contagion in mice. However, the impact of empathic fear behavior and social hierarchy on fear transfer in mice is not well understood. Fear emotions are best characterized in mice by using complementary tests, rather than only freezing behavior, and simultaneously avoiding behavioral variability in different tests across time. In this study, we modified the OFL model by implementing freezing (FZ), open field (OF), and social interaction (SI) tests in a newly designed experimental facility and applied Z-normalization to assess emotionality changes across different behaviors. The integrated emotionality scores revealed a robustly increased emotionality of observer mice and, more importantly, contributed to distinguishing susceptible individuals. Interestingly, fos-positive neurons were mainly found in the interoceptive network, and mice of a lower social rank showed more empathy-like behaviors. Our findings highlight that combining this experimental model with the Z-scoring method yields robust emotionality measures of individual mice, thus making it easier to screen and differentiate between empathic fear-susceptible mice and resilient mice, and refining the translational applicability of these models.","rodent","wim","rodent"

We aimed to verify the main risk factors related to DM that contribute to COVID-19 progression and mortality in a kidney transplant setting. From March to August 2020, we evaluated 300 kidney transplant recipients affected by COVID-19. We used propensity score matching (PSM) to estimate the impact of DM on COVID-19. After matching, all baseline characteristics were well balanced between those with and without DM (n = 100 in each group). Case fatality rate, the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and acute kidney injury (AKI) were associated with previous fasting blood glucose, and C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels on admission. These findings were similar in kidney transplant patients with and without DM. Glycemia on admission and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) either on admission or basal correlated to the need of IMV and development of AKI, respectively. Poor glycaemic control, eGFR, markers of inflammation (CRP) and tissue damage (LDH) were indicative of COVID-19 burden in kidney transplant recipients and may be useful tools for risk-stratifying this population, independently of the DM status, during the pandemic.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

What this diversity reflects is unclear, and appears counter-productive in generating selective somatic responses to specific stimuli. One possibility is that this diversity reflects the propagation of information from one neural population to another. To test this possibility, we bridge population coding theory with measurements of synaptic inputs recorded in vivo with two-photon calcium imaging. We construct a probabilistic decoder to estimate the stimulus orientation from the responses of a realistic, hypothetical input population of neurons to compare with synaptic inputs onto individual neurons of ferret primary visual cortex (V1) recorded with two-photon calcium imaging in vivo. We find that optimal decoding requires diverse input weights and provides a straightforward mapping from the decoder weights to excitatory synapses. Analytically derived weights for biologically realistic input populations closely matched the functional heterogeneity of dendritic spines imaged in vivo with two-photon calcium imaging. Our results indicate that synaptic diversity is a necessary component of information transmission and reframes studies of connectivity through the lens of probabilistic population codes. These results suggest that the mapping from synaptic inputs to somatic selectivity may not be directly interpretable without considering input covariance and highlights the importance of population codes in pursuit of the cortical connectome.","misc","wim","rodent"

The 1975 Signal Hypothesis also predicted that proteins targeted to different intracellular membranes would possess distinct signals and integral membrane proteins contained uncleaved signal sequences which initiate translocation of the polypeptide chain. This review summarizes the central role that the signal peptides play as address codes for proteins, their decisive role as targeting factors for delivery to the membrane and their function to activate the translocation machinery for export and membrane protein insertion. After shedding light on the navigation of proteins, the importance of removal of signal peptide and their degradation are addressed.

Previous studies have shown distinctive differences in cellular electrophysiology and excitability between myocytes and fibroblasts. However, it is still unclear how the electrical coupling between the two and the increased population of fibroblasts affects the electromechanical dynamics of cardiac tissue. This paper focuses on investigating effects of fibroblast-myocyte electrical coupling (FMEC) and fibroblast population on atrial electrical conduction and mechanical contractility by using a two-dimensional Discrete Element Method (DEM) model of cardiac tissue that is different to finite element method (FEM). In the model, the electro-mechanics of atrial cells are modelled by a biophysically detailed model for atrial electrical action potentials and myofilament kinetics, and the atrial fibroblasts are modelled by an active model that considers four active membrane ionic channel currents. Our simulation results show that the FMEC impairs myocytes' electrical action potential and mechanical contractibility, manifested by reduced upstroke velocity, amplitude and duration of action potentials, as well as cell length shortening. At the tissue level, the FMEC slows down the conduction of excitation waves, and reduces strain of the tissue produced during a contraction course. These findings provide new insights into understandings of how FMEC impairs cardiac electrical and mechanical dynamics of the heart.","misc","wim","misc"

Despite the promising results of immunotherapies, ICI-related pneumonitis (ICIP) is a potentially fatal adverse event. Therefore, early detection of patients at risk for developing ICIP before the initiation of immunotherapy is critical for alleviating future complications with early interventions and improving treatment outcomes. In this study, we present the first reported work that explores the potential of deep learning to predict patients who are at risk for developing ICIP. To this end, we collected the pretreatment baseline CT images and clinical information of 24 patients who developed ICIP after immunotherapy and 24 control patients who did not. A multimodal deep learning model was constructed based on 3D CT images and clinical data. To enhance performance, we employed two-stage transfer learning by pre-training the model sequentially on a large natural image dataset and a large CT image dataset, as well as transfer learning. Extensive experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the key components used in our method. Using five-fold cross-validation, our method accurately distinguished ICIP patients from non-ICIP patients, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.918 and accuracy of 0.920. This study demonstrates the promising potential of deep learning to identify patients at risk for developing ICIP. The proposed deep learning model enables efficient risk stratification, close monitoring, and prompt management of ICIP, ultimately leading to better treatment outcomes.","misc","wim","misc"

Methods: Eleven healthy participants undertook several BFR sessions with 2 different cuffs of similar width on their lower and upper limbs at different pressures [200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 mmHg for BStrong and 0, 40, and 60% of the arterial occlusion pressure (AOP) for Hokanson]. Doppler ultrasound recorded blood flows through the brachial and femoral artery at rest. Results: With BStrong, only 350 and 400 mmHg pressures were significantly different from resting values (0% AOP). With Hokanson, both 40% and 60% of the AOP were significantly different from resting values (p < 0.05). Discussion: While both cuffs elicited BFR, they failed to accurately modulate blood flow. Hokanson is appropriate for research settings while BStrong appears to be a convenient tool for practitioners due to its safety (i.e., the impossibility of completely occluding arteries) and the possibility of exercising freely detached from the pump.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Here we describe an autonomous circadian clock system in the murine ventromedial POA (VMPO) in close proximity to cells which express the atypical violet-light sensitive opsin, Opn5. We analyzed the light-sensitivity and thermal-sensitivity of the VMPO circadian clocks ex vivo. The phase of the VMPO circadian oscillations was not influenced by light. However, the VMPO clocks were reset by temperature changes within the physiological internal temperature range. This thermal-sensitivity of the VMPO circadian clock did not require functional Opn5 expression or a functional circadian clock within the Opn5-expressing cells.

Cell-division cycle protein 20 homologue (CDC20) is a key regulator of APC/C function in mitosis. The formation of the APC/CCDC20 complex is required for the ubiquitination and degradation of select substrates, which is necessary to maintain the mitotic state. In contrast to the roles of CDC20 in animal species, little is known about CDC20 roles in the regulation of chromosome segregation in plants. Here we address this gap in knowledge and report the expression in insect cells; the biochemical and biophysical characterisation of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCDC20) WD40 domain; and the nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of full-length AtCDC20 when transiently expressed in tobacco plants. We also show that most AtCDC20 degrons share a high sequence similarity to other eukaryotes, arguing in favour of conserved degron functions in AtCDC20. However, important exceptions were noted such as the lack of a canonical MAD1 binding motif; a fully conserved RRY-box in all six AtCDC20 isoforms instead of a CRY-box motif, and low conservation of key residues known to be phosphorylated by BUB1 and PLK1 in other species to ensure a robust SAC response.

BCOR regulates downstream genes via BCL6 as a transcriptional corepressor. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the occurrence of radiculomegaly is still unknown. Thus, this study was aimed at identifying BCOR-regulated genetic pathways in radiculomegaly. The microarray profile of affected tissues revealed that the gene-specific transcriptional factors group, wherein nucleus factor 1B, distal-less homeobox 5, and zinc finger protein multitype 2 (ZFPM2) were the most upregulated, was significantly expressed in periodontal ligament (PDL) cells of the diseased patient with a frameshift mutation (c.3668delC) in BCOR. Wild-type BCOR overexpression in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts cells significantly hampered cellular proliferation and ZFPM2 mRNA downregulation. Promoter binding assays showed that wild-type BCOR was recruited in the BCL6 binding of the ZFPM2 promoter region after immunoprecipitation, while mutant BCOR, which was the same genotype as of our patient, failed to recruit these promoter regions. Knockdown of ZFPM2 expression in mutant PDL cells significantly reduced cellular proliferation as well as mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase, an important marker of odontoblasts and cementoblasts. Collectively, our findings suggest that BCOR mutation-induced ZFPM2 regulation via BCL6 possibly contributes to hyperactive root formation in OFCD syndrome.

The most suitable model was chosen by characterizing the effects of this hypoxic-ischemic insult on development of myelin, glial cell conditions, and neurological outcomes by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining performed at postnatal day 17 (P17), western blot measuring myelin basic protein (MBP) at postnatal day 10 (P10) and P17, immunofluorescence staining of MBP-neurofilament protein heavy chain (NFH), oligodendrocyte transcription factor-2 (Olig2)-adenomatous polyposis coli clone (CC1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionic calcium linker protein (Iba-1) at P17, electron microscopy observing myelin microstructure at postnatal day 52 (P52) and behavioral testing at postnatal day 45-50 (P45-P50). The 90-min group showed neuroanatomical changes in the ipsilateral side of the brain, the 80-min group showed minor changes, and the 100-min group showed severe injury. Mice in the 90-min group subsequently showed marked activation of astrocytes, augmentation of microglia, a notable decrease in expression of MBP with a normal level of NFH, long-term cognitive dysfunction, and impairment of the myelin ultrastructure in adulthood. In conclusion, a mouse model of preterm diffuse WMI rather than cystic periventricular leukomalacia was successfully achieved by ligating one of the common carotid arteries on P3 followed by 90 min of hypoxia in a mixture of 10%±0.2% oxygen-nitrogen. The attempt provides an adequate translational animal model for elucidating the underlying mechanism.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of maternal age on mortality and major morbidity among very preterm infants admitted to Chinese neonatal intensive care units. Data from a retrospective multi-center cohort of all complete care very preterm infants admitted to 57 neonatal intensive care units that participated in the Chinese Neonatal Network from January 1st to December 31st, 2019 were analyzed. Neonatal outcomes including mortality or any major morbidity, defined as necrotizing enterocolitis stage 2 or 3, moderate & severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, severe retinopathy of prematurity, or sepsis. A multiple logistic regression model was constructed to analyze the independent association between maternal age and neonatal outcome. Among 7,698 eligible newborns, 80.5% of very preterm infants were born to mothers between the ages of 21 and 35 years, with 18.0% born to mothers >35 years and 1.5% born to mothers <21 years. Higher rates of maternal hypertension, maternal diabetes, cesarean deliveries, antenatal steroid usage were noted as maternal age increased. The proportion of prenatal care, cesarean section, antenatal steroid usage and inborn for very preterm infants born to mothers <21 years was lower than those of mothers of other ages. Compared to the ages of 21-35 years group, the odds of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (adjusted odd ratio: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.08-3.71) was significantly higher in the ages of 15-20 years group. Increasing maternal age was associated with higher rates of small for gestational age and lower birth weight of very preterm infants, but no correlation between advanced maternal age and very preterm infants mortality or major morbidity. Among very preterm infants, increasing maternal age was associated with higher rates of small for gestational age but not neonatal mortality or major morbidity. Young maternal age may increase the risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage of very preterm infants.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Although many studies have explored the relationship between dexmedetomidine and restlessness in the wake-up period of sevoflurane anesthesia in children, they can't keep consistent conclusions and lack evidence-based medical evidence. Meta-analysis was conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in the treatment of restlessness during the recovery period of sevoflurane anesthesia in children, and to provide reference for clinic. Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Science Direct, The Cochrane Library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, the Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, and the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM). The Chinese and English search keywords included dexmedetomidine, children, sevoflurane, and emergence agitation. The articles included were independently evaluated and cross-checked by 2 professionals in strict accordance with the 5 evaluation criteria for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (version 5.0.1). A total of 16 articles were included in this meta-analysis. Of the 16 RCTs, 14 described the generation of random sequences in detail, 8 described allocation concealment in detail, no patient blinding was described due to different surgical methods, 8 articles used operator blinding, and all 16 articles had complete outcome measures. The incidence of emergence agitation in the 0.5 µg/kg dexmedetomidine group was significantly lower than that in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant [odds ratio (OR) =0.22, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.40, P<0.00001].

However, the molecular mechanism of OS occurrence is not completely clear. Thus, we screened potential biomarkers of OS and analyze their prognostic value. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were used to analyze the differential lncRNAs in patients with OS of different immune score and the lncRNAs expressed by immune cells. Cox regression was used to develop the prognosis prediction model and specify the prognosis outcomes. Risk-proportional regression model was constructed, and the samples were divided into high and low groups based on the risk scores for the survival analysis. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were calculated and the risk-score model was verified. Finally, using 4 gene sets (comprising chemokines, immune checkpoint blockades, immune activity-related genes, and immune cells), and 4 analysis tools (CIBERSORT, TIMER, XCELL and MCP) to evaluated tumor immune infiltration. Twenty-nine long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) were obtained from the intersection of the screened lncRNAs. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 8-antisense RNA 1 (CARD8-AS1), lncRNA five prime to Xist (FTX), KAT8 regulatory NSL complex unit 1-antisense RNA 1 (KANSL1-AS1), Neuroplastin Intronic Transcript 1 (NPTN-IT1), oligodendrocyte maturation-associated long intervening non-coding RNA (OLMALINC) and RPARP Antisense RNA 1 (RPARP-AS1) were found to be correlated with survival. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis showed risk score [HR (hazard ratio) 3.5, P value 0.0043; HR 3.7, P value 0.0033] and metastasis (HR 4.7, P value 6.60E-05; HR 4.8, P value 8.36E-05) were the key factors of patients with OS. The areas under curves (AUCs) of the 1-, 3-, and 5-year ROC curves of the prognostic model were 0.715, 0.729, and 0.771. The low-risk patients tended to have a high abundance of immune cells. This study showed that a risk score based on 6 lncRNAs has potential value in the prognosis of OS, and patients with low-risk scores have high immune cell infiltration and good prognosis.

However, little research analyzing these variables focuses on the preschool education stage. Thus, the objective of this research is to study the relationship between PA, fatness and fitness in 3-6 years old boys and girls. This cross-sectional study includes 150 boys and girls at age between 3 and 6 years. Fatness and fitness were assessed using a PREFIT (FITness testing in PREschool children) battery as well as the sit and reach test. PA levels were measured using accelerometers for 7 days. Higher PA levels were related to better fitness values. In addition, differences were found in the PA levels between boys and girls. However, PA subcomponents were not related to fatness. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in fitness tests between underweight, normal-weight and over-weight children, except in handgrip strength. The few studies that have analyzed the relationship between fatness, fitness and PA in preschool have revealed controversial results. However, our study is in accordance with the majority of studies which prove that PA is associated with better fitness performances in preschool children. Since fitness is an important indicator of health, schools and parents should encourage children to practice more daily PA, especially girls, who are less active than boys. However, the discrepancy about the relationship between PA and fatness between the results of the different research highlights the necessity of carrying out further studies that analyze the relationship between these 3 variables separately in each age group (3, 4, 5 and 6 years). This is due to the fact that associations were stronger in older children rather than in younger children.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Here we present a case of a 4-year-old boy who came to our hospital for medical help because of abdominal distension for 1 day. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a huge retroperitoneal soft tissue mass with unclear boundaries with kidneys and adrenal glands, and low-density cystic necrosis areas were seen in the tumor. Contrast-enhanced scan showed that the mass showed mild heterogeneous enhancement. Based on these findings in the patient, he was initially considered to have Wilms tumor, but was finally pathologically confirmed as renal NB. The purpose of this article is to provide the clinicopathological features and CT manifestations of renal NB, and to discuss its differential diagnosis with other renal tumors, in order to better provide clinicians with a better understanding of the rare solid tumor. The renal NB is usually a large lobulated soft tissue mass with unclear boundary and incomplete capsule, which is prone to hemorrhage, necrosis, cystic degeneration and calcification. On CT, the mass is usually isodensity or slightly hypodense, and the cystic degeneration and necrosis area is hypodense, and on contrast-enhanced scan, it can be mildly to significantly enhanced, but the cystic degeneration and necrosis area have no enhancement. The CT findings of our case were atypical and overlapped with those of Wilms, so our case suggests that renal NB should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of Wilms, the most common malignancy of the kidney in children.","misc","wim","misc"

The purpose of this study is to investigate the distinctions between intra- and juxta-articular OO, trying to avoid delaying diagnosis and optimize treatment strategies. Thirty patients diagnosed with OO in the intra- and juxta joint at our institution who underwent surgical resection were included. Clinical and epidemiological factors, preoperative radiograph parameters, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scan, were documented. The outcomes of the involved extremity were evaluated at the final follow-up. Mean age at diagnosis, interval time, and follow-up time was 8.37±3.79 years old, 4.67±5.88 months, 3.57±2.18 years, respectively. Factors identified to be significantly associated with intra- and juxta-articular OO including pain with activity (P=0.004) and abnormal range of motion (P=0.00). The factor of abnormal range of motion (P=0.03) also influenced the existence of complications. Six children had a secondary operation to cure the recurrence. It is essential for clinicians and radiologists to be aware of the atypical clinical and radiographic features of intra- and juxta-articular OO, as the delayed diagnosis can lead to unnecessary pain and further complications after surgeries. The pain with activity and abnormal range of motion is helpful to identify the location of OO. The persistently abnormal range of motion also significantly leads to complications.

Therefore, this time, meta-analysis is used to study the therapeutic effect of endoscopic sinus surgery on children with chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps, analyze its effectiveness and safety, and provide theoretical basis for clinical treatment. Boolean logic searching was adopted to retrieve articles from various databases, including PubMed, Medline, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), published from the establishment of the database to December 30, 2021. The following search terms were used: endoscopic sinus surgery, antrochoanal polyps, chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps, and nasal polyps. Comparative studies on traditional surgical treatment and endoscopic sinus surgery were also screened out. Review Manager was utilized for meta-analysis. A total of 9 references were included in the study, and most of them were low risk bias (medium and high quality). Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical heterogeneity between the control group and the experimental group (Chi2=0.03, I2=0%, P=0.98).

"206",35958012,"An intelligent prediagnosis system for disease prediction and examination recommendation based on electronic medical record and a medical-semantic-aware convolution neural network (MSCNN) for pediatric chronic cough.","Due to the phenotypic similarities among different pediatric respiratory diseases with chronic cough, primary doctors often misdiagnose and the misuse of examinations is prevalent. In the pre-diagnosis stage, the patients' chief complaints and other information in the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a powerful reference for respiratory experts to make preliminary disease judgment and examination plan. In this paper, we proposed an intelligent prediagnosis system to predict disease diagnosis and recommend examinations based on EMR text. We examined the clinical notes of 178,293 children with chronic cough symptoms from retrospective EMR data. The dataset is split into 7:3 for training and testing. From the testing set, we also extract 5% of samples for validation. We proposed a medical-semantic-aware convolution neural network (MSCNN) framework that can accomplish two downstream tasks from the same medical language model through transfer learning. First, a medical language model based on the word2vec algorithm was built to generate embeddings for the text data. Then, text convolutional neural network (TextCNN) was used to build models for disease prediction and examination recommendation. We implemented 5 algorithms for disease prediction. In the disease prediction task, our algorithm outperformed the baseline methods on all metrics, with a top-1 accuracy (AC) of 0.68 and a top-3 AC of 0.923 on the testing set. By adding data enhancement, the top-3 AC reached 0.926. In the examination recommendation task, the overall AC on the testing set was 0.93 and the macro average (MA) F1-score was 0.88. The average area under the curve (AUC) on the training set was 0.97 while on the testing set it was 0.86. We constructed an intelligent prediagnosis system with an MSCNN framework that can predict diseases and make examination recommendations based on EMR data. Our approach achieved good results on a retrospective clinical dataset and thus has great potential for the application of automated diagnosis assist in clinical practice during pre-diagnosis stage, which will provide help for primary level doctors or doctors in basic-level hospitals. Due to the generality of the proposed framework, it can be straight forwardly extended to prediagnosis for other diseases.","misc","wim","misc"

We aimed to investigate the protective effects of micro (mi)R-27a on HIE in neonatal rats. A rat model of neonatal HIE was constructed by modification of the Rice-Vannucci model. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to test the expressions of miR-27a, FOXO1 messenger RNA (mRNA), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) mRNA, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA, and western blot was applied to test the expression of FOXO1. In order to overexpress miR-27a, an intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v) of miR-27a mimic was administered. We adopted 2,3,5-triphenytetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and brain water content measurement to test the effects of miR-27a on the infarcted volume and edema in brain after HIE. Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis was applied to test the effects of miR-27a on the infiltrated peripheral immune cells in the rat brains after HIE. We successfully established a rat model of neonatal HIE. It was revealed that the expressions of miR-27a decreased gradually after HIE, however, the expressions of FOXO1 mRNA increased. After injection of the miR-27a mimic, the expression of miR-27a in the rat HIE model brains was significantly upregulated, however, the expression of FOXO1 was robustly downregulated. Both TTC staining and brain water content showed that the infarcted volume and brain edema was markedly increased after HIE. Interestingly, the overexpression of miR-27a reduced the infarcted volume and edema induced by HIE. Additionally, RT-qPCR and FCM analysis showed that HIE lead to increases of IL-1β, TNF-α, and infiltrated immune cells. Overexpression of miR-27a could reduce the expressions of IL-1β mRNA and TNF-α mRNA, and the cell numbers of infiltrated peripheral macrophages and neutrophils in the brain. MiR-27a plays protective roles by reducing infarct volume and brain edema, and inhibiting inflammatory factors and infiltrated peripheral immune cells by targeting FOXO1 in neonatal HIE rats.","rodent","wim","rodent"

"209",35958042,"Cupid's quiver: Integrating sensory cues in rodent mating systems.","In many animal species, males and females exploit different mating strategies, display sex-typical behaviors, and use distinct systems to recognize ethologically relevant cues. Mate selection thus requires mutual recognition across diverse social interactions based on distinct sensory signals. These sex differences in courtship and mating behaviors correspond to differences in sensory systems and downstream neural substrates engaged to recognize and respond to courtship signals. In many rodents, males tend to rely heavily on volatile olfactory and pheromone cues, while females appear to be guided more by a combination of these chemosensory signals with acoustic cues in the form of ultrasonic vocalizations. The mechanisms by which chemical and acoustic cues are integrated to control behavior are understudied in mating but are known to be important in the control of maternal behaviors. Socially monogamous species constitute a behaviorally distinct group of rodents. In these species, anatomic differences between males and females outside the nervous system are less prominent than in species with non-monogamous mating systems, and both sexes engage in more symmetric social behaviors and form attachments. Nevertheless, despite the apparent similarities in behaviors displayed by monogamous males and females, the circuitry supporting social, mating, and attachment behaviors in these species is increasingly thought to differ between the sexes. Sex differences in sensory modalities most important for mate recognition in across species are of particular interest and present a wealth of questions yet to be answered. Here, we discuss how distinct sensory cues may be integrated to drive social and attachment behaviors in rodents, and the differing roles of specific sensory systems in eliciting displays of behavior by females or males.","rodent","wim","misc"

Other literature has reported associations between childhood lead exposure and antisocial and criminal behavior. Little is known about the relationships among childhood maltreatment, adult lead exposure, and crime and violence. As part of a prospective longitudinal study of the long-term consequences of childhood maltreatment, children with documented histories of abuse and neglect and demographically matched control children (ages 0-11 years) were followed into adulthood and interviewed. Participants included 556 individuals who had valid blood lead level (BLL) measures at a mean age of 41.2 years. Participants had a mean age of 50.5 (SD = 3.53) years at the time of the last criminal history check used to determine the number of arrests. Childhood maltreatment predicted a higher number of arrests for any crime and any violence after the blood was collected but not higher BLLs in adulthood. There were significant paths from adult BLLs to arrests after the blood was collected, despite controlling for age, sex, race, and IQ and the inclusion of individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status, and paths from neighborhood socioeconomic status to higher BLLs in models predicting any arrest and any violent arrest after the blood was collected. These findings demonstrate how environmental toxins such as lead can affect outcomes in adulthood, including crime, and provide evidence that links neighborhood disadvantage to higher BLLs in adulthood.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

To address this question, we constructed a Cas12a targeting system in Escherichia coli, where Cas12a cleaved a high-copy target plasmid to unleash the trans ssDNA cleavage activity. Then, we analyzed the effect of the Cas12a targeting on a non-target plasmid and a ssDNA phage. The results show that Cas12a efficiently eliminates target plasmid but exerts no impact on the maintenance of the non-target plasmid or plague formation efficiency of the phage. In addition, a two-spacer CRISPR array, which facilitates target plasmid depletion, still has no detectable effect on the non-target plasmid or phage either. Together, the data suggest that the trans ssDNA cleavage of Cas12a does not contribute to immunity in vivo.","misc","wim","misc"

A possible limitation is the lack of methods for CaOx crystals isolation at high concentration and high purity, which is required for the analysis of their associated biomolecules such as proteins. To our knowledge, there are only four works that have isolated proteins from CaOx crystals. Those methods basically consist of grinding the plant material, filtration steps, enzymatic digestions, and density-based separation. However, they lack of steps to evaluate the quality and purity of the isolated crystals. Likewise, those works do not evaluate whether the crystals obtained carry contaminating proteins. In the present work a detailed method for CaOx crystals isolation from amaranth leaves is described, which can be used to isolate crystals from other plant leaves. The present method is based on previous works with the addition of cleaning steps to removal contaminating protein, separation of crystals by size, and microscopic monitoring to validate the purification efficiency. Main steps for CaOx crystals isolation:•Plant leaves are ground and several washing steps, including enzymatic digestions and centrifugation, are carried out to remove cellular debris and contaminating proteins.•CaOx crystals are enriched by centrifugation in sodium polytungstate.•The different forms of crystals are separated by filtration.","misc","wim","misc"

Our previous studies showed that in arid landscapes, water-soluble U released from corroded DU penetrators that were buried underground were co-transported upwards with water by evaporation-driven capillary action and eventually precipitated on the ground surface. The first objective of this study was to develop a visualization system to simulate this complex U upward transport mechanism involving cyclic capillary wetting-drying cycles. Multiple visual components such as visual elements, canvases, and animations were created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS programming languages and coordinated to visualize this biogeochemical process in arid ecosystem landscapes. The second objective was to develop an interactive visualization exercise to allow users to study the effect of the type of capillarity solutions on the speed of the U upward transport. This study is significant in the following aspects:•Contributing a clear and comprehensible visualization of the complex U transport mechanism;•Developing a novel visualization coding framework with more advantages in simulating heavy metal upward transport mechanisms than regular software-based simulations; and•Providing educational uses such as an instructional tool in secondary and college STEM classrooms, an outreach material in promoting student interest in STEM topics and raising public awareness of U pollution, and an educational aid for understanding U mobility in order to develop effective heavy metal pollution control and remediation strategies and policies.","misc","wim","misc"

The current treatments for ABMR involve nonspecific inhibition and clearance of T/B cells or plasma cells. However, the prognosis of patients following current treatment is poor. T follicular helper cells (Tfh) play an important role in allograft-specific antibodies secreting plasma cell (PC) development. Tfh cells are therefore considered to be important therapeutic targets for the treatment of antibody hypersecretion disorders, such as transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases. Tacrolimus (Tac), the primary immunosuppressant, prevents rejection by reducing T cell activation. However, its administration should be closely monitored to avoid serious side effects. In this study, we investigated whether Tac delivery to helper T (CD4+) cells using functionalized mesoporous nanoparticles can block Tfh cell differentiation after alloantigen exposure. Results showed that Tac delivery ameliorated humoral rejection injury in rodent kidney graft by suppressing Tfh cell development, PC, and donor-specific antibody (DSA) generation without causing severe side effects compared with delivery through the drug administration pathway. This study provides a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing humoral rejection in solid organ transplantation.

"218",35958110,"Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2-Neutralizing Nanobody Using Virus Receptor Binding Domain-Administered Model Mice.","Due to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is an urgent requirement for the development of additional diagnostic tools for further analysis of the disease. The isolated nanobody Nb11-59 binds to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor-binding domain (RBD) with high affinity to neutralize the virus and block the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2- (ACE2-) RBD interaction. Here, we introduce a novel nanobody-based radiotracer named 68Ga-Nb1159. The radiotracer retained high affinity for the RBD and showed reliable radiochemical characteristics both in vitro and in vivo. Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) studies of 68Ga-Nb1159 in mice revealed its rapid clearance from circulation and robust uptake into the renal and urinary systems. Fortunately, 68Ga-Nb1159 could specifically reveal the distribution of the RBD in mice. This study also helped to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of the neutralizing nanobody. Moreover, 68Ga-Nb1159 may be a promising tool to explore the distribution of the RBD and improve the understanding of the virus. In particular, this study identified a novel molecular radioagent and established a reliable evaluation method for specifically investigating the RBD through noninvasive and visual PET technology.","misc","wim","rodent"
"219",35958111,"Proteome-Wide Profiling of the Covalent-Druggable Cysteines with a Structure-Based Deep Graph Learning Network.","Covalent ligands have attracted increasing attention due to their unique advantages, such as long residence time, high selectivity, and strong binding affinity. They also show promise for targets where previous efforts to identify noncovalent small molecule inhibitors have failed. However, our limited knowledge of covalent binding sites has hindered the discovery of novel ligands. Therefore, developing in silico methods to identify covalent binding sites is highly desirable. Here, we propose DeepCoSI, the first structure-based deep graph learning model to identify ligandable covalent sites in the protein. By integrating the characterization of the binding pocket and the interactions between each cysteine and the surrounding environment, DeepCoSI achieves state-of-the-art predictive performances. The validation on two external test sets which mimic the real application scenarios shows that DeepCoSI has strong ability to distinguish ligandable sites from the others. Finally, we profiled the entire set of protein structures in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) with DeepCoSI to evaluate the ligandability of each cysteine for covalent ligand design, and made the predicted data publicly available on website.","misc","wim","misc"

Here, with the integration of microfluidic droplet printing and wettability-induced drawing photolithography, we present an innovative spatiotemporal serial multistep dip-printing strategy to generate novel independent microneedle motors (IMNMs) for orally delivering macromolecular drugs. As the strategy combines the advantages of the hydrophilic wettability, extension effects, and capillary effects, the IMNMs with an oblate basement and a needle-shaped head or a core-shell structured multicomponent head can be created by simply printing pregel droplets layer by layer, following with simultaneous wiredrawing and solidification. Owing to the polarized magnetic particles in the bottom basement and the rapidly dissolvable polymers as the middle basement, the resultant IMNMs can respond to magnetic fields, move to desired places under a magnet, penetrate tissue-like substrates, induce head-basement separation, and leave only the needles for cargo release. Based on these features, we have demonstrated that these IMNMs can deliver insulin via intestinal tracts to realize effective blood glucose control of diabetic rabbit models. These results indicate the practical values and bright future of the dip-printing stratagem and these IMNMs in clinical applications.","misc","wim","rodent"

Thus, new strategies to design organ-specific drugs that induce little toxicity are needed. Based on characteristic tissue niche-mediated drug distribution (TNMDD) and patterns of drug metabolism into specific intermediates, we propose a strategy of distribution- and metabolism-based drug design (DMBDD); through a physicochemical property-driven distribution optimization cooperated with a well-designed metabolism pathway, SH-337, a candidate potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), was designed. SH-337 showed specific distribution in the stomach in the long term and was rapidly cleared from the systemic compartment. Therefore, SH-337 exerted a comparable pharmacological effect but a 3.3-fold higher no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) compared with FDA-approved vonoprazan. This study contributes a proof-of-concept demonstration of DMBDD and provides a new perspective for the development of highly efficient, organ-specific drugs with low toxicity.","misc","wim","misc"

The aim of this study was to analyze the molecular mechanisms of florfenicol and oxazolidinone resistance in Enterococcus isolates from anal feces of domestic animals. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels were determined by the agar dilution method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to analyze the distribution of the resistance genes. Whole-genome sequencing and comparative plasmid analysis was conducted to analyze the resistance gene environment. A total of 351 non-duplicated enteric strains were obtained. Among these isolates, 22 Enterococcus isolates, including 19 Enterococcus. faecium and 3 Enterococcus. faecalis, were further studied. 31 florfenicol resistance genes (13 fexA, 3 fexB, 12 optrA, and 3 poxtA genes) were identified in 15 of the 19 E. faecium isolates, and no florfenicol or oxazolidinone resistance genes were identified in 3 E. faecalis isolates. Whole-genome sequencing of E. faecium P47, which had all four florfenicol and oxazolidinone resistance genes and high MIC levels for both florfenicol (256 mg/L) and linezolid (8 mg/L), revealed that it contained a chromosome and 3 plasmids (pP47-27, pP47-61, and pP47-180). The four florfenicol and oxazolidinone resistance genes were all related to the insertion sequences IS1216 and located on two smaller plasmids. The genes fexB and poxtA encoded in pP47-27, while fexA and optrA encoded in the conjugative plasmid pP47-61. Comparative analysis of homologous plasmids revealed that the sequences with high identities were plasmid sequences from various Enterococcus species except for the Tn6349 sequence from a Staphylococcus aureus chromosome (MH746818.1). The current study revealed that florfenicol and oxazolidinone resistance genes (fexA, fexB, poxtA, and optrA) were widely distributed in Enterococcus isolates from animal in China.

In this retrospective study, we studied hospitalized COVID-19 patients with data on chest CT scans performed during hospital stay (February 2020-April 2021) in a training dataset (TD) (n = 2,251) and an external validation dataset (eVD) (n = 993). We used the most relevant demographical, clinical, and laboratory variables (n = 25) as potential predictors of COVID-19-related outcomes. The primary and secondary endpoints were the severity of lung involvement quantified as mild (≤25%), moderate (26-50%), severe (>50%), and in-hospital death, respectively. We applied random forest (RF) classifier, a machine learning technique, and multivariable logistic regression analysis to study our objectives. In the TD and the eVD, respectively, the mean [standard deviation (SD)] age was 57.9 (18.0) and 52.4 (17.6) years; patients with severe lung involvement [n (%):185 (8.2) and 116 (11.7)] were significantly older [mean (SD) age: 64.2 (16.9), and 56.2 (18.9)] than the other two groups (mild and moderate). The mortality rate was higher in patients with severe (64.9 and 38.8%) compared to moderate (5.5 and 12.4%) and mild (2.3 and 7.1%) lung involvement. The RF analysis showed age, C reactive protein (CRP) levels, and duration of hospitalizations as the three most important predictors of lung involvement severity at the time of the first CT examination. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed a significant strong association between the extent of the severity of lung involvement (continuous variable) and death; adjusted odds ratio (OR): 9.3; 95% CI: 7.1-12.1 in the TD and 2.6 (1.8-3.5) in the eVD. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the severity of lung involvement is a strong predictor of death. Age, CRP levels, and duration of hospitalizations are the most important predictors of severe lung involvement. A simple prediction model based on available clinical and imaging data provides a validated tool that predicts the severity of lung involvement and death probability among hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to compare epiphytic bacterial community structures on the intertidal macroalgae Sargassum thunbergii and their receptacles between male and female samples. The epiphytic bacteria on the male and female algal bodies and receptacles had similar community structures with a large number of shared bacteria, but the samples clearly clustered separately, and the abundances of dominant taxa, specific bacteria, and indicator species differed, indicating that epiphytic bacterial communities differed significantly between the male and female S. thunbergii and their receptacles. In addition, the abundance of many predicted functional genes was significantly different between epiphytic bacteria on male and female algal bodies and receptacles, especially metabolism-related genes, and the abundances of predicted functional genes of epiphytic bacteria were significantly higher on both types of male samples than on female samples. Our study confirmed that the sex of the host algae influenced the epiphytic bacterial community structures on algae and algal reproductive tissues, and this role was mainly related to the host metabolism. The results reveal the role of host plant sex in the formation of epiphytic bacterial communities. These findings are helpful for obtaining an in-depth understanding of the construction mechanism of algae-associated bacteria.","misc","wim","misc"

In this study, three compounds extracted from A. continentalis were identified as acanthoic acid, continentalic acid, and kaurenoic acid by NMR and were further investigated how these diterpenoids affect the physiology of the S. mutans. When S. mutans was exposed to individual or mixed fraction of diterpenoids, severe growth defects and unique morphology were observed. The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the cell membrane was increased compared to that of saturated fatty acids in the presence of diterpenoids. Genome-wide gene expression profiles with RNA-seq were compared to reveal the mode of action of diterpenoids. Streptococcus mutans commonly enhanced the expression of 176 genes in the presence of the individual diterpenoids, whereas the expression of 232 genes was considerably reduced. The diterpenoid treatment modulated the expression of genes or operon(s) involved in cell membrane synthesis, cell division, and carbohydrate metabolism of S. mutans. Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into the antibacterial effect of diterpenoids to control S. mutans infection, which causes human dental caries.","misc","wim","misc"

However, information on the effect of autotoxins on root secretion characteristics and regulation of the composition of rhizosphere microorganisms by altered root exudates is limited. In this study, autotoxin ρ-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) was added to the soil of potted grapevine seedlings, CO2 pulse-labeling, and DNA stable isotope probing were used to track the rhizosphere microbiome that assimilates root exudates. Bacterial and fungal microbiomes that assimilated plant-derived carbon were identified by high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that 4-HBA treatment altered bacterial and fungal communities in 13C-labeled organisms, with a lower abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Gemmatimonas, Streptomyces, and Bacillus) and a higher abundance of potential pathogen fungi (e.g., Fusarium, Neocosmospora, Gibberella, and Fusicolla) by changing the composition of root exudates. The exogenous addition of upregulated compound mixtures of root exudates reduced the abundance of beneficial bacterial Bacillus and increased the abundance of potential pathogen fungi Gibberella. These results suggest that 4-HBA can alter root secretion properties and altered root exudates may enrich certain potential pathogens and reduce certain beneficial bacteria, thereby unbalancing the structure of the rhizosphere microbial community.","misc","wim","misc"
"229",35958143,"Phenol-soluble modulin contributes to the dispersal of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates from catheters.","Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), a human commensal, has been implicated in invasive infection in humans due to their ability to form biofilm. It is assumed that when a biofilm is dispersed it will subsequently cause a more severe infection. The clinical significance of S. epidermidis isolated from sterile body fluid (BF) remains unclear, and might be related to dispersal from catheter-associated biofilm infection. To evaluate this relationship, we evaluated S. epidermidis isolates from catheters (CA) or BF in hospitalized patients. Sequence type 2 (ST2) is the most prevalent type isolated from infection sites. Although the specific STs were also observed in isolates from different sites, we observed that the main sequence type was ST2, followed by ST59, among all the 114 isolates from different infection sites. Interestingly, ST2 strains isolated from BF exhibited significantly thicker biofilm than those from CA. The thicker biofilm was due to the higher expression of accumulation-associated protein (aap) but not intercellular adhesion (ica) operon. Moreover, the transcription of PSMδ and PSMε were significantly increased in ST2 strains isolated from BF. Although the bacterial loads on catheters were similar infected by CA- or BF-originated strains in mouse biofilm-associated infection model, we observed a higher CFU in peri-catheter tissues infected by ST2 clones isolated from BF, suggesting that S. epidermidis with thicker biofilm formation might be able to disperse. Taken together, our data suggested that S. epidermidis originated from diverse infection sites exhibited different biofilm forming capacity. The major ST2 clone isolated from BF exhibited thicker biofilm by increasing the expression of Aap. The higher expression of PSM of these strains may contribute to bacteria dispersal from biofilm and the following bacterial spread.","misc","wim","misc"

Accelerating reestablishment of biocrusts may facilitate the establishment of vascular plant communities within the timeframes of restoration targets (typically 5-15 years). One technique is to inoculate the soil surface using slurries of biocrust material harvested from another site. However, this is destructive to donor sites, and hence the potential to dilute slurries will govern the feasibility of this practice at large spatial scales. We conducted a replicated experiment on a disturbed mine site to test the individual and combined effects of two strategies for accelerating soil cryptogamic biocrust reestablishment: (1) slurry inoculation using biocrust material harvested from native vegetation; and (2) the use of psyllium husk powder as a source of mucilage to bind the soil surface, and to potentially provide a more cohesive substrate for biocrust development. The experiment comprised 90 experimental plots across six treatments, including different dilutions of the biocrust slurries and treatments with and without psyllium. Over 20 months, the reestablishing crust was dominated by cyanobacteria (including Tolypothrix distorta and Oculatella atacamensis), and these established more rapidly in the inoculated treatments than in the control treatments. The inoculated treatments also maintained this cover of cyanobacteria better through prolonged adverse conditions. The dilute biocrust slurry, at 1:100 of the biocrust in the remnant vegetation, performed as well as the 1:10 slurry, suggesting that strong dilution of biocrust slurry may improve the feasibility of using this technique at larger spatial scales. Psyllium husk powder did not improve biocrust development but helped to maintain a soil physical crust through hot, dry, and windy conditions, and so the potential longer-term advantages of psyllium need to be tested.","misc","wim","misc"

The laccase activity by ERM C-1 was estimated as 37.53, 57.16, and 87.57 enzyme U mL-1 after 5, 10, and 15 days of incubation, respectively. Chlorpyrifos degradation was associated with ERM C-1 and laccase activity, and the degree of enzyme activity was higher in the consortium than in individual strains. The biodegradation study with developed consortium ERM C-1 showed a decreased chlorpyrifos concentration from the 7th day of incubation (65.77% degradation) followed by complete disappearance (100% degradation) after the 30th day of incubation in the MS medium. First-order degradation kinetics with a linear model revealed a high k -day value and low t 1/2 value in ERM C-1.

Although many technical solutions have been proposed, in this perspective, we touch on the grave problem of kingdom-level bias in network representation and interpretation. We underscore the eco-evolutionary significance of using cross-kingdom (bacterial-fungal) co-occurrence networks to increase the network's representability of natural communities. To do so, we demonstrate how ecosystem-level interpretation of plant microbiome evolution changes with and without multi-kingdom analysis. Then, to overcome oversimplified interpretation of the networks stemming from the stereotypical dichotomy between bacteria and fungi, we recommend three avenues for ecological interpretation: (1) understanding dynamics and mechanisms of co-occurrence networks through generalized Lotka-Volterra and consumer-resource models, (2) finding alternative ecological explanations for individual negative and positive fungal-bacterial edges, and (3) connecting cross-kingdom networks to abiotic and biotic (host) environments.","misc","wim","misc"

They were randomized into two groups: the VD group, which received doses of 1,000 (children < 1 year) or 2,000 IU/day (from 1 to 17 years) and the group without VD (control). The outcome variables were the progression of oxygen requirement, the development of complications, and death. For comparison between groups, we used the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) and the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated. p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. From 24 March 2020 to 31 March 2021, 87 patients were eligible to participate in the trial; 45 patients were randomized: 20 to the VD group and 25 to the control group. There was no difference in general characteristics at baseline, including serum VD levels (median 13.8 ng/ml in the VD group and 11.4 ng/ml in the control group). 2/20 (10%) in the VD group vs. 9/25 (36%) in the control group progressed to a superior ventilation modality (p = 0.10); one patient in the VD group died (5%) compared to 6 (24%) patients in the control group (p = 0.23). ARR was 26% (95% CI 8.8 to 60.2%) and NNT was 3 (2 to 11) for progression and ARR was 19% (95% CI -3.9 to 42.8%) and NNT was 6 (2 to 26) for death. None of the patients receiving VD had adverse effects. The trial was stopped for ethical reasons; since after receiving the results of the basal VD values, none of the patients had normal levels. In this trial, VD supplementation in pediatric patients seems to decrease the risk of COVID-19 progression and death. More studies are needed to confirm these findings. This protocol was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with the registration number NCT04502667.","randomized_trial","wim","randomized_trial"

Yet, pediatricians and pediatric dentists find it challenging to reach a diagnosis and provide appropriate care when facing lesions of the masticatory or lining mucosa, of the hard or soft palate, of the tongue or salivary glands. Here, we propose a decision tree for the diagnosis of the most frequent viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases starting from their oral lesions in children. By first focusing on describing the elementary lesion itself before its localization and characteristics, it aims to guide the practitioner toward the diagnosis and any necessary complementary exams. To generate this tool, we conducted a literature review of the childhood viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic diseases with oral mucosal symptoms. For each of the 42 reported diagnoses-20 viral, 9 bacterial, 5 fungal, and 8 parasitic-we collected the infection mechanism and agent(s), the oral lesions and their description, the associated systemic signs and the incidence/prevalence. In fine, our decision tree indexes the 28 diseases for which epidemiological data was available, mainly in Europe and the United States.","misc","wim","misc"

In the present study, the effects of soil-treated fluopimomide on soil micro biomass, disease incidence, plant growth, soil enzyme activity, and marketable yield of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) were investigated via field trial. In addition, the application prospect in China was also evaluated. In the experiment, five treatments with three replications and a randomized complete block design were followed. The treatments were: furrow application of fluopimomide (25% suspension concentrate, SC) at the dosage of 375, 750, and 1,500 g ha-1, which was recommended, double recommended, and quadruple recommended dosages, respectively. Besides, common control fungicide fluopicolide (5% SC) furrow was applied at recommended application dosages of 750 mL ha-1, and a non-treated control was also undertaken. Results indicated that fluopimomide exhibited no effects on the amount of soil bacteria and actinomycetes, and its inhibition effect on fungi amount could be recovered at 60 days after treatment (DAT). With the recommended application dosage, fluopimomide could efficiently reduce the number of plant pathogens in soil by 79.56-85.80%, significantly reduce the disease incidences in tomato plants by 80.00-88.24%, and improve plant height by 13.25-24.05% and marketable yield by 16.88%. Furthermore, soil enzymes exhibited a complex response to fluopimomide, and AOB and nifH gene copy numbers were increased by the double and quadruple recommended dosage of fluopimomide. Based on the above results, fluopimomide could be recommended as an efficient fungicide for the tomato field.","misc","wim","misc"

Biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are diverse chemical substances emitted by Trichoderma spp. The potential role of VOCs in biological control and plant growth promotion has recently been recognized. Here, the Trichoderma-VOCs' performance for plant growth promotion and suppression of plant pathogens are evaluated. We further investigated VOC emission profiles of T. harzianum using GC-MS. The Trichoderma-VOCs exhibited significant (p < 0.05) antifungal properties against all tested pathogenic fungi. T. atroviride-VOCs showed a decisive inhibition of Alternaria panax, Botrytis cinerea, Cylindrocarpon destructans, and Sclerotinia nivalis. The germinating seeds demonstrated growth enhancement in the presence of Trichoderma-VOCs emitted by different strains. Low levels of cyclopentasiloxane, decamethyl, cyclotetrasiloxane, and octamethyl were found in T. harzianum KNU1 strain whereas cyclopentasiloxane, decamethyl, cyclotetrasiloxane, and octamethyl showed higher emission levels as Si-containing compounds. The results reveal the potentiality of VOCs as a biocontrol resource against deleterious rhizosphere microorganisms and underline the importance of Trichoderma-VOCs emissions in regulating plant growth and development.","misc","wim","misc"

To meet the demand of the ever-growing population in the next few decades, an extra increase in rice yield is an urgent need. Given that various agronomic traits contribute to the yield of rice, deciphering the key regulators involved in multiple agronomic trait formation is particularly important. As a superfamily of transcription factors, zinc finger proteins participate in regulating multiple genes in almost every stage of rice growth and development. Therefore, understanding zinc finger proteins underlying regulatory network would provide insights into the regulation of agronomic traits in rice. To this end, we intend to summarize the current advances in zinc finger proteins, with emphasis on C2H2 and CCCH proteins, and then discuss their potential in improving rice yield.","misc","wim","misc"

Therefore, breeding varieties with a thin pericarp is important for the quality breeding of sweet corn. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pericarp development remain largely unclear. We performed an integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA sequencing to elucidate the genetic mechanism regulating pericarp thickness during kernel development (at 15 days, 19 days, and 23 days after pollination) of two sweet corn inbred lines with different pericarp thicknesses (M03, with a thinner pericarp and M08, with a thicker pericarp). A total of 2,443 and 1,409 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in M03 and M08, respectively. Our results indicate that phytohormone-mediated programmed cell death (PCD) may play a critical role in determining pericarp thickness in sweet corn. Auxin (AUX), gibberellin (GA), and brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction may indirectly mediate PCD to regulate pericarp thickness in M03 (the thin pericarp variety). In contrast, abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), and ethylene (ETH) signaling may be the key regulators of pericarp PCD in M08 (the thick pericarp variety). Furthermore, 110 differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMIs) and 478 differentially expressed target genes were identified. miRNA164-, miRNA167-, and miRNA156-mediated miRNA-mRNA pairs may participate in regulating pericarp thickness. The expression results of DEGs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating pericarp thickness and propose the objective of breeding sweet corn varieties with a thin pericarp.","misc","wim","misc"
"245",35958195,"The Original Form of C4-Photosynthetic Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase Is Retained in Pooids but Lost in Rice.","Poaceae is the most prominent monocot family that contains the primary cereal crops wheat, rice, and maize. These cereal species exhibit physiological diversity, such as different photosynthetic systems and environmental stress tolerance. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in Poaceae is encoded by a small multigene family and plays a central role in C4-photosynthesis and dicarboxylic acid metabolism. Here, to better understand the molecular basis of the cereal species diversity, we analyzed the PEPC gene family in wheat together with other grass species. We could designate seven plant-type and one bacterial-type grass PEPC groups, ppc1a, ppc1b, ppc2a, ppc2b, ppc3, ppc4, ppcC4, and ppc-b, respectively, among which ppc1b is an uncharacterized type of PEPC. Evolutionary inference revealed that these PEPCs were derived from five types of ancient PEPCs (ppc1, ppc2, ppc3, ppc4, and ppc-b) in three chromosomal blocks of the ancestral Poaceae genome. C4-photosynthetic PEPC (ppcC4 ) had evolved from ppc1b, which seemed to be arisen by a chromosomal duplication event. We observed that ppc1b was lost in many Oryza species but preserved in Pooideae after natural selection. In silico analysis of cereal RNA-Seq data highlighted the preferential expression of ppc1b in upper ground organs, selective up-regulation of ppc1b under osmotic stress conditions, and nitrogen response of ppc1b. Characterization of wheat ppc1b showed high levels of gene expression in young leaves, transcriptional responses under nitrogen and abiotic stress, and the presence of a Dof1 binding site, similar to ppcC4 in maize. Our results indicate the evolving status of Poaceae PEPCs and suggest the functional association of ppc1-derivatives with adaptation to environmental changes.","misc","wim","misc"

Sonneratia caseolaris is a common tree located in inner mangroves, and its range extends inland along tidal creeks, as far as the influence of salinity extends. This study investigated the physiological and molecular response mechanisms of S. caseolaris by analyzing its antioxidant defense capacity, including its differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under similar salt stress conditions. Salt treatment significantly affected the osmoprotectants and lipid peroxidation in S. caseolaris seedlings, which increased proline (Pro) content by 31.01-54.90% during all sample periods and decreased malonaldehyde (MDA) content by 12.81 and 18.17% at 25 and 40 days under 3.0% NaCl treatment. Antioxidant enzyme activities increased significantly following 3.0% NaCl treatment. Transcriptome analysis following De novo assembly showed 26,498 matched unigenes. The results showed that 1,263 DEGs responded to transcription factors (TFs) and plant phytohormones and mediated oxidoreductase activity to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the control vs. 3.0% NaCl comparison. In addition, the transcription levels of genes associated with auxin and ethylene signal transduction also changed. Under salt stress, ROS scavenging genes (POD, CAT, and APX) and part of AP2, MYB, NAC, C2C2, bHLH, and WRKY TFs were upregulated.

"247",35958197,"Characterization of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) accessions using morpho-physiological traits under varying levels of salinity stress at seedling stage.","Abiotic stresses are the major stressors affecting wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production worldwide. The world population is increasing continuously. It is very difficult to feed the population because one-third world's population consumes wheat as a staple food. Among all abiotic stresses, salinity is one that led to a drastic reduction in wheat crop fitness and productivity. Thus, understanding the effects of salinity stress becomes indispensable for wheat improvement programs which have depended mainly on the genetic variations present in the wheat genome through conventional breeding. Therefore, an experiment was conducted using a complete randomized design with four replications, to determine the selection criteria for salinity-tolerant germplasm based on morphophysiological traits at the seedling stage. Three levels of salt solutions, i.e., 4, 8, and 12 dSm-1 were applied and the performance of different genotypes under these three salinities levels was observed. Results depicted that leaf water content and relative water content were correlated with each other. Notably, selection based on these traits increased the performance of other characters. The genotypes G11, G13, G18, G22, and G36 performed best in the salinity stress. So, these genotypes are considered salinity-tolerant genotypes. The genotypes G4, G17, G19, G30, and G38 performed worst in the stress and these were salinity-susceptible genotypes. From the results of the principal component (PC) analysis, the first five PCs were indicated to have a substantial genetic variation from the total of 14 PCs. These PCs showed 75, 73, 65.324, and 65.162% of total variation under normal, salinity level 4, 8, and 12 dSm-1, respectively. Stomatal conductance, fresh shoot weight and fresh root weight, and dry shoot weight and dry root weight were not significant and negatively associated with all other traits studied, except for relative water and leaf water content. Overall, the results suggested that selection based on leaf water content and relative water content at the seedling stage would genetically improve salinity tolerance. Genotypes with good performance under salt stress conditions may be useful in future breeding programs and will be effective in developing high-yielding salt-tolerant wheat varieties.","misc","wim","misc"

Although the energetic costs of these responses are expected, with their consequences going far beyond an individual, their underlying molecular and metabolic mechanisms are not fully known. One, so far hardly considered, is if and how the photosynthetic efficiency of phytoplankton might change in response to the predation cues. Our main aim was to identify such responses in phytoplankton and to detect if they are taxon-specific. We exposed seven algae and seven cyanobacteria species to the chemical cues of an efficient consumer, Daphnia magna, which was fed either a green alga, Acutodesmus obliquus, or a cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus (kairomone and alarm cues), or was not fed (kairomone alone). In most algal and cyanobacterial species studied, the quantum yield of photosystem II increased in response to predator fed cyanobacterium, whereas in most of these species the yield did not change in response to predator fed alga. Also, cyanobacteria tended not to respond to a non-feeding predator. The modal qualitative responses of the electron transport rate were similar to those of the quantum yield. To our best knowledge, the results presented here are the broadest scan of photosystem II responses in the predation context so far.","misc","wim","misc"

In soybean, a typical short-day plant, 11 FT homologues are found in its genome, of which several homologues are functionally diversified in flowering pathways and the others including GmFT3a are yet unknown. In the current study, we characterized GmFT3a, which is located on the same chromosome as the flowering promoters GmFT2a and GmFT5a. Overexpression of GmFT3a significantly promoted flowering of Arabidopsis under the inductive long-day (LD) photoperiod. GmFT3a over-expressed soybean also flowered earlier than the control under LD, but they were not significantly different under inductive short-day (SD) conditions, indicating that GmFT3a acts as a flowering promoter in the non-inductive photoperiod in soybean. Compared with other GmFT homologues, GmFT3a exhibited a slighter effect in flowering promotion than GmFT2a, GmFT5a and GmFT2b under LD conditions. GmFT3a promoted flowering by regulating the expression of downstream flowering-related genes and also affected the expression of other GmFTs. According to the re-sequencing data, the regional distributions of two major haplotypes in 176 soybean varieties were analyzed. The varieties with GmFT3a-Hap2 haplotype matured relatively early, and relative higher expression of GmFT3a was detected in early maturing varieties, implying that Hap2 variation may contribute to the adaptation of soybean to higher latitude regions by increasing expression level of genes in metabolism and signaling pathways. The early flowering germplasm generated by overexpression of GmFT3a has potential to be planted at higher latitudes where non-inductive long day is dominant in the growing season, and GmFT3a can be used to fine-tune soybean flowering and maturity time and improve the geographical adaptation.","misc","wim","misc"
"250",35958202,"Shift in subsistence crop dominance from broomcorn millet to foxtail millet around 5500 BP in the western Loess Plateau.","Broomcorn and foxtail millet were the most important crops in northern China during the Neolithic period. Although the significance of broomcorn millet in human subsistence exceeded that of foxtail millet during the early Neolithic, this pattern was reversed by the end of Neolithic period. However, the process underlying this shift remains unclear. The recent excavation of the Gedachuan (GDC) in Zhangjiachuan county has revealed an abundance of relics including millet crop remains from relatively continuous strata of the Yangshao and Qijia cultures, and therefore provides a unique opportunity to examine how and when foxtail millet replaced broomcorn millet as the dominant crop in the western Loess Plateau during the Neolithic period. In this study, we identify 1,738 and 2,686 broomcorn and foxtail millet remains, respectively, from 74 flotation samples, accounting for 38.81% and 59.98% of total plant remains, respectively. Compared with 23 direct dates of carbonized crop grains in GDC, we propose that the weight of foxtail millet in plant subsistence of GDC first exceeded that of broomcorn millet as early as ∼5,500 BP, filling an important gap in the archaeobotanical record from the western Loess Plateau. Further comparative analysis of multidisciplinary data suggests the shift in significance of these two millet crops during the late Neolithic may have been triggered by variations in human settlement intensity and climate change in the western Loess Plateau. The results of this study also suggest that the Banpo Phase of Yangshao Culture survived in the western Loess Plateau as late as ∼5,600 BP.","misc","wim","misc"

The experimental treatments were comprised of Ck: without Pb and GABA (control), GABA: 1 mM GABA is applied under normal conditions (without Pb), Pb + GABA: 1 mM GABA is applied under Pb toxicity (800 mg kg-1 of soil), and Pb= only Pb (800 mg kg-1 of soil) is applied (no GABA). The required concentrations of GABA were applied as a foliar spray. Results revealed that Pb stress induced oxidative damage in terms of enhanced malondialdehyde (MDA), electrolyte leakage (EL), and H2O2 contents, while exogenous GABA application improved leaf chlorophyll, proline, protein and GABA contents, photosynthesis and gas exchange, and antioxidant defense under Pb toxicity in both rice cultivars. Moreover, glutamine synthetase (GS) and nitrate reductase (NR) activities were variably affected due to GABA application under Pb stress. The yield and related traits, that is, productive tillers/pot, grains/panicle, filled grain %, 1,000-grain weight, and grain yield were 13.64 and 10.29, 0.37% and 2.26%, 3.89 and 19.06%, 7.35 and 12.84%, and 17.92 and 40.56 lower under Pb treatment than Pb + GABA for GXZ and NX-18, respectively.

Here, we identified a novel yellowish-pericarp embryo lethal (yel) mutant of the japonica rice cultivar Sindongjin (Oryza sativa L.), namely, yel-sdj. Seeds of the yel-sdj mutant showed a yellowish pericarp and black embryo, and were embryonic lethal. Compared with wild-type seeds, the yel-sdj mutant seeds exhibited significantly reduced grain size, grain weight, and embryo weight, and a remarkably lower rate of embryo retention in kernels subjected to milling. However, the volume of air space between embryo and endosperm, density of embryo, and total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity of mature grains were significantly higher in the yel-sdj mutant than in the wild type. Genetic analysis and mapping revealed that the yel-sdj mutant was non-allelic to the oscop1 null mutants yel-hc, yel-cc, and yel-sk, and its phenotype was controlled by a single recessive gene, LOC_Os01g01484, an ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana DE-ETIOLATED 1 (DET1). The yel-sdj mutant carried a 7 bp deletion in the second exon of OsDET1. Seeds of the osdet1 knockout mutant, generated via CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing, displayed the yel mutant phenotype.

Results showed that 0.8 mM H3BO3 inhibited pollen germination and led to abnormal morphology of the pollen tubes. B toxicity also affected the distribution of cell wall components of the pollen tube. In control pollen tube, esterified and acid pectins were distributed unevenly, with the former mainly at the tip and the latter on the distal region. Cellulose was distributed uniformly on the surface with less at the tip; callose reduced gradually from base to sub-tip of the pollen tubes and no callose at the tip of the tube was detected. B toxicity led to the deposition of esterified and acid pectins, cellulose, and callose at the tip of the pollen tube. Results from scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that B toxicity also altered pollen tube wall ultrastructure.

For shoot multiplication, two types of explants (shoot tips and nodal tips) of three varieties of mung bean (Mung NCM-13, MgAT-7, and MgAT-4) were used. Both types of explants from in vitro and in vivo sources were cultured on the MS medium supplemented with different concentrations (0.25-3.0 mg/L, increment of 0.5 mg/L) and combinations of BAP and IBA as independent treatments. For callus induction, leaf explants (in vitro source) were cultured on MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D (1-3 mg/L) alone or in combination with BAP or NAA (0.5 and 1.0 mg/L). For the enhanced production of phenolics and glycosides, calli were cultured on MS media supplemented with zinc oxide (0.5 mg/L) and copper oxide nanoparticles (0.5 mg/L) as nano-elicitors. Results showed that in vitro explants responded better in terms of shoot length, number of shoots, and number of leaves per explant when compared to in vivo explants. Moreover, shoot tips were better than nodal explants to in vitro culturing parameters. All three varieties showed the optimized results in the MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/L BAP, while roots were produced only in cultures fortified with 1 mg/L IBA. The leaf explants of in vitro and soil-grown plantlets showed a maximum callogenic response of 90 and 80%, respectively, on MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D (3 mg/ml). Maximum phenolic content (101.4 μg of gallic acid equivalent/g) and glycoside content (34 mg of amygdalin equivalent/g of plant material) was observed in the calli cultured on MS medium supplemented with 3 mg/L of 2,4-D. Furthermore, the addition of zinc oxide (0.5 mg/L) and copper oxide (0.5 mg/L) nanoparticles to the callus culture medium significantly enhanced the phenolic content of Mung NCM-13 (26%), MgAT-7 (25.6%), and MgAT-4 (22.7%). Glycosidic content was also found to be increased in Mung NCM-13 (50%), MgAT-7 (37.5%), and MgAT-4 (25%) varieties when compared to the control.

In this study, we aim to evaluate the relative role of geographical and ecological forces in the origin and evolution of the Madeiran ivy (Hedera maderensis), a single-species endemic belonging to the western polyploid clade of Hedera. To determine the phylogenetic placement of H. maderensis within the western polyploid clade, we analyzed 40 populations (92 individuals) using genotyping-by-sequencing and including Hedera helix as outgroup. Climatic niche differences among the study species were evaluated using a database with 867 records representing the entire species ranges. To test species responses to climate, 13 vegetative and reproductive functional traits were examined for 70 populations (335 individuals). Phylogenomic results revealed a nested pattern with H. maderensis embedded within the south-western Iberian H. iberica. Gradual niche differentiation from the coldest and most continental populations of H. iberica to the warm and stable coastal population sister to H. maderensis parallels the geographical pattern observed in the phylogeny. Similarity in functional traits is observed for H. maderensis and H. iberica. The two species show leaves with higher specific leaf area (SLA), lower leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and thickness and fruits with lower pulp fraction than the other western polyploid species H. hibernica. Acquisition of a Macaronesian climatic niche and the associated functional syndrome in mainland European ivies (leaves with high SLA, and low LDMC and thickness, and fruits with less pulp content) was a key step in the colonization of Madeira by the H. iberica/H. maderensis lineage, which points to climatic pre-adaptation as key in the success of island colonization (dispersal and establishment). Once in Madeira, budding speciation was driven by geographical isolation, while ecological processes are regarded as secondary forces with a putative impact in the lack of further in situ diversification.","misc","wim","misc"
"259",35958234,"A Novel Organic Dopant for Spiro-OMeTAD in High-Efficiency and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells.","Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs); however, there still exist some major challenges on device stability due to hydrophilic bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium (Li-TFSI), which is commonly introduced as a p-dopant to increase the hole mobility and conductivity of 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) hole-transporting materials (HTMs). Ion migration, corrosiveness, and hygroscopicity induced by the additive Li-TFSI are detrimental to the device stability, which significantly hinders further commercialization of PSCs. Herein, a hydrophobic organic ionic compound, trityltetra(pentafluorophenyl)borate (TPP), is explored as a novel efficient and stable alternative p-dopant, avoiding the long-term aging process to improve the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD. As a result, the champion efficiency of TPP-based devices delivers performance up to 23.03%, which is higher than that of the Li-TFSI-based devices (22.39%). In addition, the TPP-based devices also exhibit higher average PCE values. The excellent performance with TPP may be associated with the higher work function of doped spiro-OMeTAD and a better alignment of energy levels with the valence band of perovskite, which substantially accelerate interfacial carrier transportation and minimize the open-circuit voltage (V oc) loss of PSCs. More importantly, the un-encapsulated TPP-doped devices also display much superior operational stability under maximum power point (MPP) tracking with continuous light illumination in an ambient humid environment, which maintained 96-97% of the initial PCE over 1,100 h outputting. Thus, this work will open up new possibilities for hydrophilic Li-TFSI dopant replacements.","misc","wim","misc"

In this work, the first-principles methods are explored to investigate the electronic and the optical abilities of the heterostructure constructed by monolayered MoTe2 and PtS2. Then, the external biaxial strain is employed on the MoTe2/PtS2 heterostructure, which can persist in the intrinsic type-II band structure and decrease the bandgap. In particular, the MoTe2/PtS2 vdW heterostructure exhibits a suitable band edge energy for the redox reaction for water splitting at pH 0, while it is also desirable for that at pH 7 under decent compressive stress. More importantly, the MoTe2/PtS2 vdW heterostructure shows a classy solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, and the light absorption properties can further be enhanced by the strain. Our results showed an effective theoretical strategy to tune the electronic and optical performances of the 2D heterostructure, which can be used in energy conversion such as the automotive battery system.","misc","wim","misc"

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm well-distributed NPs with sizes from 2 to 13 nm stabilized on the CTF particles. Metal contents between 10 and 41 wt% were determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Nitrogen sorption measurements of the metal-loaded CTFs revealed Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas between 904 and 1353 m2 g-1. The composites show superior performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with low overpotentials from 47 to 325 mV and toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with high half-wave potentials between 810 and 872 mV. IrOx samples in particular show high performances toward HER while the Pd samples show better performance toward ORR. In both reactions, electrocatalysts can compete with the high performance of Pt/C. Exemplary cyclic voltammetry durability tests with 1000 cycles and subsequent TEM analyses show good long-term stability of the materials. The results demonstrate the promising synergistic effects of NP-decorated CTF materials, resulting in a high electrocatalytic activity and stability.","misc","wim","misc"

The results showed that the flavor of HGM decreased significantly after freezing. With the increase of freezing rate, the contents of aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, acids, esters, others, free amino acids and 5'-nucleotides were higher, and the content of specific substances was also generally increased. All samples from unfrozen and frozen HGM could be divided into four groups using an electronic nose based on different flavor characteristics. Seven common key aroma components were determined by relative odor activity value (ROAV), including hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, (E)-oct-2-enal, (2E,4E)-deca-2,4-dienal and oct-1-en-3-ol. The higher the freezing rate, the greater the ROAVs. Taste activity values calculated by all taste substances were far <1, and the direct contribution of the substances to the taste of HGM was not significant. The equivalent umami concentration of HGM frozen at -80°C was the highest. These findings indicated that higher freezing rate was more conducive to the retention of flavor substances in HGM, and the flavor fidelity effect of freezing at -80°C was particularly remarkable.","misc","wim","misc"

The goal of the current analysis was to examine associations between meal duration, rate of eating, and body mass index (BMI) and to assess the variance of meal duration and eating rate across different meals during the day. Using an observational cross-sectional study design, non-smoking participants aged 18-45 years (N = 29) consumed all meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) on a single day in a pseudo free-living environment. Participants were allowed to choose any food and beverages from a University food court and consume their desired amount with no time restrictions. Weighed food records and a log of meal start and end times, to calculate duration, were obtained by a trained research assistant. Spearman's correlations and multiple linear regressions examined associations between BMI and meal duration and rate of eating. Participants were 65% male and 48% white. A shorter meal duration was associated with a higher BMI at breakfast but not lunch or dinner, after adjusting for age and sex (p = 0.03). Faster rate of eating was associated with higher BMI across all meals (p = 0.04) and higher energy intake for all meals (p < 0.001). Intra-individual rates of eating were not significantly different across breakfast, lunch, and dinner (p = 0.96). Shorter beakfast and a faster rate of eating across all meals were associated with higher BMI in a pseudo free-living environment. An individual's rate of eating is constant over all meals in a day. These data support weight reduction interventions focusing on the rate of eating at all meals throughout the day and provide evidence for specifically directing attention to breakfast eating behaviors.","misc","wim","human_intervention"
"268",35958247,"The role of honey in the ecology of the hive: Nutrition, detoxification, longevity, and protection against hive pathogens.","Honey is the source of energy for the European honey bee, Apis mellifera. Beyond simple nutrition and a hedge against the seasonal, geographic, and chemical unpredictability of nectar, honey has properties that protect the hive against various stresses. Enzyme-mediated detoxification during honey ripening neutralizes potentially toxic phytochemicals, and bees that consume honey have enhanced tolerance to other ingested toxins. Catalase and antioxidant phenolics protect honey bees from oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species, promoting their longevity. Phytochemical components of honey and microRNAs have the potential to influence developmental pathways, with diet playing a large role in honey bee caste determination. Components of honey mediate stress response and promote cold tolerance during overwintering. Honey has a suite of antimicrobial mechanisms including osmotic pressure, low water activity, low pH, hydrogen peroxide, and plant-, honey bee-, and microbiota-derived compounds such as phytochemicals and antimicrobial peptides. Certain types of honey, particularly polyfloral honeys, have been shown to inhibit important honey bee pathogens including the bacteria responsible for American and European Foulbrood, the microsporidian Nosema ceranae, and the fungi responsible for Stonebrood. Understanding the diverse functional properties of honey has far-ranging implications for honey bee and hive health and management by beekeepers.","misc","wim","misc"

A retrospective cohort study of 11,549 pregnant women attending a district specialized hospital and who had serum folate (SF) and serum vitamin B12 (SVB12) levels measured at delivery was performed. The levels of SF, SVB12, and SFVB12R were defined as high (>95th percentile), normal (5-95th percentile), and low (<5th percentile). Information on pregnancy outcomes was retrieved from medical records. Linear regression was performed to examine the association of abnormal SF, SVB12, and SFVB12R levels with fetal growth indicators. Logistic regression was applied to estimate the association between abnormal SF, SVB12, and SFVB12R levels and pregnancy outcomes.

We explored the mediating role of vitamin D on the cross-sectional association between physical frailty and cognitive function using data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). We analyzed data from 1944 subjects aged 60 years and older from the 2011 CLHLS cohort. Frailty status was identified by the Osteoporotic Fracture Study (SOF) index. The Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function. Linear regression models were used to examine the association between frailty, vitamin D, and cognition, adjusted for a range of covariates. Mediation analyses tested the indirect effects of vitamin D on physical frailty and cognitive function. Physical frailty was negatively associated with vitamin D levels and scores on the MMSE, and vitamin D levels were positively associated with scores on the MMSE. Linear regression analysis showed that physical frailty and serum vitamin D concentration were significant predictors of cognitive function. Importantly, mediation analysis showed that serum vitamin D concentration significantly mediated the relationship between physical frailty and cognitive function. The association between physical frailty and cognitive function appears to be mediated by vitamin D. Future studies should explore whether serum vitamin D concentrations may mediate the association between physical frailty and cognitive decline and whether this mediating role is moderated by other factors.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

To explore the protective effect of anthocyanin on atherosclerosis from a metabolic perspective, alterations in plasma metabolic profiling of apoE-deficient (apoE-/-) mice in response to treatment with anthocyanin extracts derived from Xinjiang wild cherry plum (Prunus divaricata Ledeb) peel was investigated through UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The mice were fed with a normal diet or high-fat diet supplementation with or without anthocyanin extracts (ACNE, 75, 150, 250 mg/kg body weight) for 18 weeks, corresponding to control (Con), model (Mod), and treatment group (LD, low dose; MD, medium dose; HD, high dose), respectively, along with a positive control group (posCon, treatment with Atorvastatin, 0.003 mg/kg body weight). The results showed that ACNE could significantly enhance the antioxidant capacity and lower the plasma lipid, but have no evident influence on the body weight of apoE-/- mice. A series of differential metabolites, predominantly related to lipid metabolism, were identified, including docosahexaenoic acid, palmitoyl ethanolamide, stearoylcarnitine, L-palmitoylcarnitine, indoxyl sulfate (IS), 1-palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine, phenylacetylglycine (PAGly), and so on. Among these, both IS and PAGly were host-microbial metabolites. These differential metabolites were mainly enriched in the pathway of glycerophospholipid metabolism and linoleic acid metabolism. Several important enzymes related to glycerophospholipid metabolisms such as LCAT, LPCAT, GPCPD1, PLA2G1B, PPARG, LIPE, PNPLA2, AGPAT1, and ENPP2 were recognized as underlying targets for anti-atherogenic effects of ACNE.

Cox proportional hazard model was used to investigate the association between vitamin D status and psoriasis in a prospective cohort study from UK Biobank. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are strongly associated with circulating 25OHD were constructed as instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization (MR) to determine the causality between vitamin D and psoriasis. During a median follow-up of 10.99 years, we identified 2,856 participants with incident psoriasis. The prospective cohort study demonstrated individuals with 25OHD deficiency (< 25 nmol/L) at baseline were associated with approximately 20% increased risk of incident psoriasis in different categories of sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) after adjusting for covariates. The largest effect size was observed in the obese group (BMI > 30 kg/m2), as 25OHD deficiency presented with 30% additional risk of incident psoriasis compared to those with 25OHD > 50 nmol/L (HR = 0.701; 95% CI: 0.583-0.843; p < 0.001). Additionally, 69 independent SNPs associated with circulating 25OHD level were selected for the MR analysis, and the result suggested that genetically predicted one standard deviation (SD) increment in log-transformed 25OHD was associated with 24% decreased risk of psoriasis (OR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60-0.98, p = 0.020).

Blood films and serological examination for malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) were done for identification of Plasmodium parasites while an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for detecting the antibodies of T. gondii among participants. Data were analyzed using statistical packages for the social sciences (SPSS). The mean age of the study participants was 27.83, and ranges from 18 to 40 years. The majority of the participants (82.2%) had never experienced stillbirth nor spontaneous abortion. Intestinal parasites were found in 36.7% of participants. Giardia lamblia (28.1%), Cryptosporidium parvum (5.3%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (3.3%) were among the intestinal protozoans detected. T. gondii antibodies were detected by high levels of immunoglobulins, resulting in IgG (48.0%) and IgM (11.3%) being found among participants, with 7.3% testing positive for both IgM and IgG. The prevalence of malaria infection among the study participants was 2.7%. The consumption of raw or cooked vegetables had significant influence on their intestinal and blood protozoan infections status (p = 0.004) (OR = 0.32, CI = 0.12-0.86). There was a significant association between Hb levels and malaria (p = 0.014) and that of intestinal protozoans (p = 0.035). The prevalence of intestinal protozoans and blood protozoans such as T. gondii were high and therefore effective measures should be put in place to reduce the infectivity. Environmental hygiene should be improved and education by relevant agencies should be intensified on the possible transmission of intestinal and blood parasite infections given the possible role of these infections in adverse pregnancy outcomes.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Consequently, aging is a major risk factor for the development of heart disease, the leading cause of death in the developed world. In this review, we will summarize the classic and recently uncovered pathological changes within the aged heart with an emphasis on the mitochondria. Specifically, we describe the metabolic changes that occur in the aging heart as well as the loss of mitochondrial fitness and function and how these factors contribute to the decline in cardiomyocyte number. In addition, we highlight recent pharmacological, genetic, or behavioral therapeutic intervention advancements that may alleviate age-related cardiac decline.","misc","wim","misc"

EGFR mutation testing and EGFR 181946C>T genotyping were performed in 101 advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients using qRT-PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively. Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the start of TKI therapy to date of progression, and overall survival as the time from diagnosis to death from any cause. Pain level was evaluated using a Numerical Rating Scale and the Verbal Descriptor Scale. Statistical significance was considered for P < .05. Patients were treated with EGFR-TKIs for a period of 1-39months (median 9), with a median PFS of 12.0 months (10.4-13.6, CI 95%), and a median OS of 19.0 months (15.1-22.7, CI 95%). The presence of pain was significantly correlated with the existence of bone (P < .001) and adrenal glands metastases (P = .029). Genetic factors did not have a direct impact on pain management but had a significant effect on the response to TKIs leading to pain alleviation. EGFR mutation subtype and the EGFR 181946 C>T SNP had a significant effect on the response to TKI inducing an indirect anti-dolorous effect.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 4,8-dicarboxyl-8,9-iridoid-1-glycoside (388) on proliferation and differentiation of embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs were treated with 388 and stem cell differentiation was determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. The role of MeCP2 in 388-mediated embryonic NSCs differentiation was examined. The results showed that in the presence of mitogen when NSCs proliferated and maintained their multipotency, treatment with 388 did not affect the viability of NSCs. Following mitogen withdrawal to initiate NSC differentiation, treatment with 388 at the doses of 10 and 50 μg/mL significantly increased neural differentiation in both cortex and spinal cord-derived culture. 388 also significantly up-regulated MeCP2 expression. The expression of the neuronal and oligodendrocytic markers was enhanced after addition of 388 in the differentiation culture. However, knockdown of MeCP2 results in inhibition of NSC differentiation, and the pro-differentiation effect of 388 was mostly abolished. This study confirmed that 388 stimulates differentiation of NSCs and identifies its mechanism of action by upregulating MeCP2.","misc","wim","misc"

To investigate the risk factors for in-stent restenosis (ISR) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in Han and Uygur patients with coronary heart disease. The clinical data of 345 Han and 127 Uygur patients who underwent intracoronary stent implantation were divided into an ISR group and a non-ISR group. The general clinical data, laboratory indicators, and coronary artery lesions were compared. Age (OR = 1.040, 95% CI: 1.006∼1.075), triglycerides (OR = 1.440, 95% CI: 1.050∼1.973), total cholesterol (OR = 5.256, 95% CI: 2.826∼9.773), and ApoB (OR = 137.540, 95% CI: 11.364∼899.455) were independent risk factors for ISR after PCI in the Han patients, while ApoAI (OR = 0.002, 95% CI: 0.001∼0.011), MCV (OR = 0.824, 95% CI: 0.744∼0.911), MCH (OR = 0.421, 95% CI: 0.324∼0.548), and MCHC (OR = 0.934, 95% CI: 0.903∼0.965) were protective factors of ISR after PCI in Han patients, and the logistic regression equation composed of various factors predicted that the area under the ROC curve of ISR was 0.905. ApoB (OR = 11.571, 95% CI: 1.667∼80.340), Gensini score (OR = 1.017, 95% CI: 1.003∼1.031), and diabetes history (OR = 3.474, 95% CI: 1.189∼10.151) were independent risk factors for ISR after PCI in Uygur patients, and the area under ROC curve of ISR predicted by logistic regression equation is 0.807.

Nano-selenium (NSe) is an antioxidant that plays many biological roles such as oxidative stress alleviation. The purpose of this study is to explore the mechanism of action by which NSe inhibits Cd-induced hepatic toxicity and oxidative stress. Sixty eight-week-old male Kunming mice were randomly divided into four groups (15 mice per group). The control group and cadmium groups received distilled water, whereas the sodium-selenite group received 0.2 mg/kg SSe and the NSe group received 0.2 mg/kg NSe intragastrically for 2 weeks. On the last day, all the other groups were treated with Cd (126 mg/kg) except for the control group. The results obtained in this study showed that NSe alleviated Cd-induced hepatic pathological changes. Furthermore, NSe reduced the activities of ALT and AST as well as the content of MDA, while elevated the activities of T-AOC, T-SOD and GSH (P < 0.05). In addition, the NSe group significantly increased mRNA expressions of Nrf2 pathway related molecules (Nrf2, HO-1, NQO-1, GST, GSH-Px, CAT and SOD) compared to the Cd group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, NSe shows its potentiality to reduce Cd-induced liver injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and activating the Nrf2 pathway.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Inactivated cells of E. rhusiopathiae strain HG-1 were prepared as the antigen in five adjuvanted inactivated vaccines, including a mineral-oil-adjuvanted vaccine (Oli vaccine), aluminum-hydroxide-gel-adjuvanted vaccine (Alh vaccine), ISA201-biphasic-oil-emulsion-adjuvanted vaccine (ISA201 vaccine), GEL02-water-soluble-polymer-adjuvanted vaccine (GEL vaccine), and IMS1313-water-soluble-nanoparticle-adjuvanted vaccine (IMS1313 vaccine). The safety test results of subcutaneous inoculation in mice showed that Oli vaccine had the most severe side effects, with a combined score of 35, followed by the ISA201 vaccine (25 points), Alh vaccine (20 points), GEL vaccine (10 points), and IMS1313 vaccine (10 points). A dose of 1.5LD50 of strain HG-1 was used to challenge the mice intraperitoneally, 14 days after their second immunization. The protective efficacy of Oli vaccine and Alh vaccine was 100% (8/8), whereas that of the other three adjuvanted vaccines was 88% (7/8). Challenge with 2.5LD50 of strain HG-1 resulted in a 100% survival rate, demonstrating the 100% protective efficacy of the Oli vaccine, followed by the GEL vaccine (71%, 5/7), IMS1313 vaccine (57%, 4/7), ISA201 vaccine (43%, 3/7), and Alh vaccine (29%, 2/7). Challenge with 4LD50 of strain HG-1 showed 100% (7/7) protective efficacy of the Oli vaccine and 71% (5/7) protective efficacy of the GEL vaccine, whereas the protective efficacy of other three adjuvanted vaccine was 14% (1/7). The Alh and GEL vaccines were selected for comparative tests in piglets, and both caused minor side effects. A second immunization with these two adjuvanted vaccines conferred 60 and 100% protective efficacy, respectively, after the piglets were challenged via an ear vein with 8LD100 of strain HG-1. After challenge with 16LD100 of strain HG-1, the Alh and GEL vaccines showed 40% and 100% protective efficacy, respectively.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of calcium propionate feeding levels on the immune function, liver function, and fecal microbial composition of dairy cows in early lactation. Thirty-two multiparous Holstein cows were randomly assigned to four treatments after calving. Treatments were a basal diet plus 0, 200, 350, and 500 g calcium propionate per cow per day throughout a 5-week trial period. Cows were milked three times a day, and blood was sampled to measure immune function and liver function on d 7, 21, and 35. The rectal contents were sampled and collected on d 35 to analyze the microbial composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicated that increasing amounts of calcium propionate did not affected the serum concentrations of total protein, IgG, IgM, and calcium, but the concentrations of albumin and IgA changed quadratically. With the increase of calcium propionate, the activity of serum alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase increased linearly, in contrast, the activity of alkaline phosphatase decreased linearly. Moreover, dietary supplementation with increasing levels of calcium propionate tended to quadratically decrease the relative abundance of Firmicutes while quadratically increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes, and consequently linearly decreased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the rectal microbiota. Additionally, the supplementation of calcium propionate increased the relative abundances of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 and Prevotellaceae_UCG-004 linearly, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 quadratically, but decreased the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group and Family_XIII_AD3011_group quadratically. Compared with the CON group, the calcium propionate supplementation significantly decreased the relative abundance of Acetitomaculum but increased the abundances of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Alistipes. In summary, these results suggested that the supplementation of calcium propionate to dairy cows in early lactation could beneficially alter the rectal microbiota.","misc","wim","randomized_trial"

Although the genetic diversity of this apicomplexan parasite has long been recognized, there is little information on whether infection with different genotypes results in different clinical outcomes or whether infection by a given genotype impairs protective immunity against abortion induced by different genotypes. Here, we provide evidence supporting that natural subclinical infection with isolate NcUru3 of N. caninum in a pregnant heifer did not provide protection against abortion caused by a different N. caninum genotype in the subsequent gestation. A Holstein heifer delivered a healthy calf congenitally infected with N. caninum. Specific anti-N. caninum IgG was detected by indirect ELISA in sera obtained from the dam at calving and the calf before ingestion of colostrum, indicating in utero exposure to the parasite in the latter. A N. caninum strain named NcUru3 was isolated and characterized by multilocus microsatellite typing from the brain of this neonate euthanized at 9 days of age. Sixty days after calving, the cow got pregnant, although she aborted spontaneously at ~6 months of gestation. Pathologic examination of the aborted fetus and placenta revealed typical lesions of neosporosis, including encephalitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, myositis, and placentitis. Neospora caninum DNA was amplified from the fetal brain, heart, kidney, and placenta, and multilocus microsatellite typing revealed a genotype that differed from isolate NcUru3 at the level of microsatellite marker 6A (MS6A). Serum obtained from the dam at the time of abortion had IgG that cross-recognized isolate NcUru3, as demonstrated by immunoblotting, indicating that the humoral immune response did not prevent the other genotype from infecting the fetus and inducing fetoplacental lesions and abortion. This is the first description of one same dam transmitting two N. caninum genotypes to her offspring in subsequent gestations.","misc","wim","misc"

While the demographic factors that are associated with OA diagnosis are well established, the factors that are associated with joint supplement use are not as well studied. Using data collected from the Dog Aging Project, we analyzed owner survey responses regarding joint supplement administration and OA diagnosis for 26,951 adult dogs. In this cross-sectional analysis, logistic regression models and odds-ratios (OR) were employed to determine demographic factors of dogs and their owners that were associated with joint supplement administration. Forty percent of adult dogs in our population were given some type of joint supplement. Perhaps not surprisingly, dogs of older age, larger size, and those that were ever overweight were more likely to receive a joint supplement. Younger owner age, urban living, owner education, and feeding commercial dry food were associated with a reduced likelihood of administration of joint supplements to dogs. Interestingly, mixed breed dogs were also less likely to be administered a joint supplement (OR: 0.73). Dogs with a clinical diagnosis of OA were more likely to receive a joint supplement than those without a reported OA diagnosis (OR: 3.82). Neutered dogs were more likely to have a diagnosis of OA, even after controlling for other demographic factors, yet their prevalence of joint supplement administration was the same as intact dogs. Overall, joint supplement use appears to be high in our large population of dogs in the United States. Prospective studies are needed to determine if joint supplements are more commonly administered as a preventative for OA or after an OA clinical diagnosis.","misc","wim","misc"
"288",35958316,"Resting behavior of broilers reared with or without artificial brooders.","Rest and sleep are important for the welfare of mammals and birds. A large part of the daily time budget of broiler chickens is taken up by resting behavior and the quality of resting is important. However, in intensive broiler production systems, disruptions of resting behaviors are common. These disruptions of resting behavior could be negative for the health and growth of the birds. This study investigated if artificial brooders that provide a delimited and darker resting place, away from active birds, reduce disruptions of resting behavior compared to a control situation without artificial brooders. Six pens of each treatment were used in the same building, keeping 60 chickens (Ross 308) per pen. The artificial brooders were removed at 21 days of age. Data on disturbances and duration of resting bouts and activity between resting bouts were collected on 20 and 34 days of age. Also, as an indicator of the quality of rest, the animals' cognitive performance was evaluated in a spatial learning test that was performed at 11 days of age. The results showed that birds housed in pens with access to brooders have longer resting bouts (260.7 ± 5.2 vs. 132.8 ± 5.3s, p < 0.001) and are less likely to be disturbed during resting by other individuals (0.15 vs. 0.48, p < 0.001). The effect of the artificial brooders on both the duration of resting bouts and the proportion of disturbances remained after the removal of the brooders at 21 days of age. The duration of activity between resting bouts was shorter if the resting bout was ended by a disturbance (9.98 ± 1.0 vs. 61.0 ± 2.4s, p < 0.001). Birds reared with brooders were more likely to solve the spatial learning task (0.5 vs. 0.27, p < 0.01), but those succeeding were not faster at solving it. Broilers may be exposed to disrupted rest due to the lack of a dedicated resting place separated from areas with high activity. Using artificial brooders reduces disturbances but does not eliminate them. Therefore, additional changes to the housing conditions or management will be needed to prevent disturbances.","misc","wim","misc"

Berbamine (BE), a natural substance obtained primarily from Berberis vulgaris L, is a traditional herbal medicine with several bioactivities, such as antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Thymoquinone (TQ), a phytochemical molecule derived from the Nigella sativa plant's black cumin seeds, has attracted interest owing to itsanti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. This current study's aims was to examine the protective impacts of BE and TQ in Concanavalin A (ConA)- induced acute liver injury and the action's underlying mechanism. sixty mice of both sexes were used and divided into four groups (each group with six mice) as follows: Group I obtained distilled water (negative control group). Group II received distilled water with a single dose of 0.1 ml ConA (20 mg/kg) on day 4 by retro-orbital route (model group). Groups III and IV received BE (30 mg/kg/day) and TQ (25 mg/kg/day), respectively, by oral gavage for four successive days, with a single dose of ConA (20 mg/kg) on day 4, then all animals were sacrificed after 8 h and prepared for liver and blood collection. ConA administration increased the ALT, AST, TNF-α, INFγ, and NF-κB significantly (p < 0.001) in the model group. Both BE and TQ could reduce these parameters significantly (p < 0.001) in groups III and IV, respectively, compared to the model group. Both BE and TQ prominently attenuated ConA immune-mediated liver injury. These findings give a remarkable insight into developing a new therapeutic agent for treating hepatitis and other autoimmune diseases.","misc","wim","rodent"

Patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer who underwent surgical resection at two tertiary medical centers between 2010 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. A multi-state model was employed with one initial state (surgery), two intermediate states (locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis), and one absorbing state (death), comprising five transitions: surgery to locoregional recurrence, surgery to distant metastasis, surgery to death without recurrence, locoregional recurrence to death, and distant metastasis to death. Cox proportional hazards models stratified for these transitions were performed with the risk factors; transition probabilities for each patient were predicted. A total of 949 patients were identified [median age: 67 years, male: 614 (64.6%)]. Recurrence occurred in 194 (20.4%) patients (locoregional recurrence: 7.3%, distant metastasis: 13.1%). Hazard ratios for distant metastasis after surgery were higher for older age (hazard ratio: 1.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.06) and adenocarcinoma (hazard ratio: 1.67, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.61). Lower lobe location exhibited a higher hazard ratio for death after surgery without recurrence (hazard ratio: 1.59, 95% confidence interval: 1.00-2.53). Stage IIB lung cancer showed a higher probability of transition to distant metastasis after surgery than other stages. Cumulative transition hazards rapidly increased in both recurrence patterns until approximately two years after surgery (locoregional recurrence: 0.052; distant metastasis: 0.104). Patients with distant metastasis were more likely to die within 5 years of surgery than those with locoregional recurrence (6.8% and 2.6%, respectively). With the multi-state model, risk factors and post-relapse survival probabilities differed between locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis. These findings may enable clinicians to establish personalized follow-up strategies for patients undergoing curative resection for early stage non-small cell lung cancer.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Traditional prognostic factors have limited importance after including other parameters. Thus, developing a more credible prognostic model combined with genes and clinical parameters is necessary. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and clinical information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD datasets and microarray data from three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were obtained. We identified differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between lung tumor and normal tissues through integrated analysis of the three GEO datasets. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to select survival-associated DEGs and to establish a prognostic gene signature which was associated with overall survival (OS). The expression of gene proteins was assessed in 180 LUAD tissue microarrays (TMAs) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We verified its predictive performance with a Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and validated it in external GEO databases. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify the significant prognostic indicators in LUAD. Furthermore, we established a prognostic nomogram based on TCGA-LUAD dataset. A three-gene signature was constructed to predict the OS of LUAD patients. The KM analysis, ROC curve, and C-index present a good predictive ability of the gene signature in TCGA dataset [P<0.0001; C-index 0.6375; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5632-0.7118; area under the ROC curve (AUC) 0.674] and the external GEO datasets (P=0.05, 0.004, and 0.04, respectively). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses also verified that LUAD patients with low-risk scores had a decreased risk of death compared to those with a high-risk score in TCGA database [hazard ratio (HR) =0.3898; 95% CI: 0.1938-0.7842; P<0.05]. Finally, we constructed a nomogram integrating the gene signature and clinicopathological parameters (P<0.0001; C-index 0.762; 95% CI: 0.714-0.845; AUC 0.8136). Compared with conventional staging, a nomogram can effectively improve prognosis prediction. The nomogram is closely associated to the OS of LUAD patients.

Using a case-control study design, we evaluated the association between mtDNA content and risk of lung cancer in 465 cases and 378 controls. We also evaluated the association between mtDNA content and survival in 189 cases with surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Relative mtDNA content was measured using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in peripheral blood genomic DNA. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, race, and smoking history. mtDNA content was lower in cases compared to controls, with medians of 1.26 [interquartile range (IQR), 0.98-1.70)] and 1.79 (IQR, 1.34-2.10; P<0.001), respectively. Compared to the quartile of subjects with the highest mtDNA content, there was significantly higher likelihood of lung cancer in the second lowest quartile (OR 3.44; 95% CI: 2.06-5.75) and the lowest quartile (OR 6.36; 95% CI: 3.86-10.47). In patients with resected NSCLC, there was no association between lower mtDNA content and recurrence-free survival (RFS) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.89; 95% CI: 0.47-1.66] or overall survival (OS) (HR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.35-1.46). Thus, our results counter previous studies and find that lower mtDNA content is associated with lung cancer risk. Our results suggest that mtDNA content could potentially serve as a risk biomarker, but is not associated with survival outcomes in NSCLC.","misc","wim","meta_analysis"

In MR analysis, 202 significant causative relationship features were identified. 7-alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate (ORIVW =1.45; 95% CI: 1.06-1.97; PIVW =0.018), gamma-glutamylisoleucine (ORIVW =1.40; 95% CI: 1.16-1.69; PIVW =0.0004), 1-oleoylglycerophosphocholine (ORIVW =1.22; 95% CI: 1.1-1.35; PIVW =0.0001), gamma-glutamylleucine (ORIVW =4.74; 95% CI: 1.18-18.93; PIVW =0.027) were the most dangerous metabolites for lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and glioma, respectively; while pseudouridine (ORIVW =0.50; 95% CI: 0.30-0.83; PIVW =0.007), 2-methylbutyroylcarnitine (ORIVW =0.77; 95% CI: 0.68-0.86; PIVW =2.9×10-6), 2-methylbutyroylcarnitine (ORIVW =0.77; 95% CI: 0.70-0.85; PIVW =3.4×10-7), glycylvaline (ORIVW =0.13; 95% CI: 0.02-0.75; PIVW =0.021) were associated with lower risk of lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and glioma, respectively. Interestingly, 2-methylbutyroylcarnitine was also associated with decreased risk of lung cancer (ORIVW =0.59; 0.50-0.70; P IVW =1.98×10-9) expect ovarian cancer and breast cancer. In subgroup analysis, 2-methylbutyroylcarnitine was associated with decreased risk of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer (ORIVW =0.72; 0.64-0.80; PIVW =3.55×10-9), lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) (ORIVW =0.60; 0.48-0.70; PIVW =1.14×10-5). Metabolic pathways analysis identified 4 significant pathways. Our study integrated metabolomics and genomics to explore the risk factors involved in the development of cancers. It is worth exploring whether metabolites with causality can be used as biomarkers to distinguish patients at high risk of cancer in clinical practice.

This current study evaluated the relationship between histology of NSCLC and protein expression of exosomes in the plasma from NSCLC patients, and furthermore investigate the impact of the exosome profile on the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification. Plasma samples were collected from 26 NSCLC patients before surgery. The exosomes were extracted from the plasma and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used to evaluate the expression of the proteins in the exosomes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed using the Cytoscape 3.8.2 software. Multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify proteins which could effectively distinguish between lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. The relationship between protein expression and the TNM stage was calculated using Spearman rank correlation. The expression levels of ZSWIM9, FYB1, SERPINF1, C1orf68, MASP2, and IGHV3-72 were higher in patients with lung adenocarcinoma compared to patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma. MFGE8 was associated with the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma. CORO1A was positively correlated with the TNM stage of the patients, and COL4A2 was negatively correlated with TNM stage. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that cholesterol metabolism was important in NSCLC development. Lung adenocarcinoma may be distinguished from squamous cell carcinoma by the molecular profile of exosomes in the plasma samples. And, proteomics analysis suggested that cholesterol metabolism may play an important role of cancer progress in NSCLC.","misc","wim","misc"

However, the mechanism of the Warburg effect is still largely unknown. This research aimed to reveal the effects of BarH-like homeobox 2 (BARX2) in regulating tumor progression and glucose metabolism in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Expression of BARX2 was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in LUAD cell line and tissues, and the tumor-promoting function of BARX2 in LUAD cells was detected in vitro and in vivo xenograft models. The metabolic effects of BARX2 were examined by detecting glucose uptake, the production levels of lactate and pyruvate, and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and luciferase reporter gene assay were used to identify the underlying molecular mechanism of BARX2 regulation of HK2. Further studies showed that transcription factor FOXA1 directly interacts with BARX2 and promotes the transcriptional activity of BARX2. BARX2 was remarkably up-regulated in LUAD tissues and positively linked to advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis. In vitro and in vivo data indicated ectopic expression of BARX2 enhanced cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, whereas BARX2 knockdown suppressed these effects. Metabolic-related experiments showed BARX2 promoted the reprogramming of glucose metabolism. Mechanistically, the BARX2/FOXA1/HK2 axis promoted LUAD progression and energy metabolism reprogramming. In summary, our research first defined BARX2 as a tumor-promoting factor in LUAD and that it may act as a novel prognostic biomarker and new therapeutic target for the disease.","misc","wim","misc"

A thin convex probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (TCP-EBUS) with a 5.9-mm tip was designed to improve peripheral access over conventional EBUS bronchoscopes to facilitate real-time sampling of intrapulmonary lesions under ultrasound guidance. TCP-EBUS was inserted into the distal airways of ex-vivo human lungs to assess bronchial accessibility relative to clinically available bronchoscopes. The short- (≤1 h) and medium-term (≤10 d) safety of TCP-EBUS insertion and EBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) using a 25-gauge needle were evaluated physiologically and radiologically in live pigs. TCP-EBUS-guided TBNA feasibility was assessed in-vivo with pig intrapulmonary pseudo-tumors and ex-vivo with resected human lung cancer specimens. For bronchial accessibility, TCP-EBUS demonstrated greater reach than the 6.6-mm convex probe endobronchial ultrasound (CP-EBUS) in all bronchi, as well as surpassed a 5.5-mm conventional bronchoscope in 63% (131/209) and a 4.8-mm conventional bronchoscope in 27% (57/209) of assessed bronchi. The median bronchial generation and the mean diameter of bronchi TCP-EBUS reached was 4 (range, 3-7) and 3.3±0.7 mm, respectively. No major complications related to TCP-EBUS-guided TBNA in distal airways were observed in the live pigs. Scattered mucosal erythema of the bronchial walls was observed immediately after TCP-EBUS insertion; this self-resolved by day 10. TCP-EBUS could successfully reach and visualize intrapulmonary targets via ultrasound, with no difficulty in needle deployment or sampling.

PCD is thought to be caused by proteins expressed by tumor cells which trigger an antibody-mediated immune response. Despite PCD being commonly associated with anti-Yo, anti-Hu and anti-Tr/DNER antibodies, PCD is the most prevalent paraneoplastic syndrome in patients harboring anti-Zic4 antibodies. We report what, to our knowledge, is the first known case of anti-Zic4 mediated PCD in a patient with EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our patient was in complete response (CR) to targeted therapy and presented to the emergency room with drowsiness, unsteady gait and memory lapses. The diagnostic work-up revealed a diffuse cerebellar atrophy in the MRI, ruling out brain metastasis and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. A body-CT scan showed no signs of recurrent disease. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was within normal parameters. An onconeural antibody panel was conducted in a peripheral blood sample, detecting high levels of anti-Zic4 antibody by indirect immunofluorescence (IFI), results later confirmed by immunoblot testing. With the suspected diagnosis of an anti-Zic4 PCD, the case was discussed with the neurology department and treatment with high dose methylprednisolone was initiated. Considering the lack of substantial clinical benefit, the patient was then treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) for 5 days, showing modest improvement. At this time, the patient presented minor disease relapse in the form of a sub-centimetric pulmonary nodule. Despite one cycle of chemotherapy, the patient's neurological condition deteriorated leading to fatal pneumonia secondary to progressive dysphagia. There is scarce evidence of paraneoplastic syndromes in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Further research is warranted to stablish a possible association between anti-Zic4 and the EGFR molecular pathway.","misc","wim","misc"

We aimed to evaluate the predictive performances of validated, recalibrated, and developed prognostic risk prediction tools used in the Southeast Asian population with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) events for secondary events. We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Central databases until March 2022. We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies that exclusively evaluated populations in the Southeast Asian region with a confirmed diagnosis of an AMI event and evaluated for risk of secondary events such as mortality, recurrent AMI, and heart failure admission. The CHARMS and PRISMA checklists and PROBAST for risk of bias assessment were used in this review. We included 7 studies with 11 external validations, 3 recalibrations, and 3 new models from 4 countries. Both short- and long-term outcomes were assessed. Overall, we observed that the external validation studies provided a good predictive accuracy of the models in the respective populations. The pooled estimate of the C-statistic in the Southeast Asian population for GRACE risk score is 0.83 (95%CI 0.72-0.90, n = 6 validations) and for the TIMI risk score is 0.80 (95%CI: 0.772-0.83, n = 5 validations). Recalibrated and new models demonstrated marginal improvements in discriminative values. However, the method of predictive accuracy measurement in most studies was insufficient thereby contributing to the mixed accuracy effect. The evidence synthesis was limited due to the relatively low quality and heterogeneity of the available studies. Both TIMI and GRACE risk scores demonstrated good predictive accuracies in the population. However, with the limited strength of evidence, these results should be interpreted with caution.

Conventional echocardiography was performed on 107 subjects with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≥ 50%), who comprised patients with HCM (n = 40), H-LVH (n = 35), and healthy people with normal blood pressure and left ventricular structure (n = 32). Except for the conventional echocardiographic parameters, the left ventricular myocardial work parameters based on pressure-strain loops, including global myocardial work index (GWI), global constructive work (GCW), global wasted work (GWW), and global work efficiency (GWE), were evaluated in three groups. Multivariate discriminant analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the incremental value of NMWI for distinguishing HCM from H-LVH. Compared to the control group, GWI and GCW were significantly lower in HCM patients (P < 0.05), whereas GWI was significantly higher in H-LVH patients. GWW was higher and GWE was significantly decreased in both HCM and H-LVH patients than in the control group (P < 0.05).

Early prophylactic low dose administration (150 mg) of acetylsalicylic acid is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of early-onset PE, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and neonatal mean stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Universal implementation of a first-trimester screening system including angiogenic and antiangiogenic markers [the Placental Growth Factor (PlGF) and/or soluble fms-like Tyrosine Kinase-1 (sFlt-1)] has shown a prediction rate of 90% for early-onset PE but entails a high financial cost. The aim of this study is to determine the predictive and preventive capacity of a universal PE first-trimester two-step sequential screening model, determining the PlGF only in patients previously classified as intermediate risk by means of a multivariate model based on resources already used in the standard pregnancy control, in a real clinical setting. We hypothesize that this screening model will achieve similar diagnostic performance as the universal determination of PlGF but at a lower economic cost. This is a prospective, multicentric, cohort study in a real-world clinical setting. Every singleton pregnancy will be recruited at the routine first pregnancy visit. In a first step, the first-trimester risk of PE will be calculated using a multivariate Gaussian distribution model, based on medical history, mean blood pressure, Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPP-A), and Uterine Artery Doppler Pulsatility Index (UTPI). Patients will be classified into three risk groups for PE: (1) risk ≥ 1/50, high-risk with no further testing (blinded PlGF); (2) risk between 1/51 and 1/500, medium-risk requiring further testing; and (3) risk ≤ 1/501, low-risk with no further testing. In a second step, the PlGF will only be determined in those patients classified as intermediate risk after this first step, and then reclassified into high- or low-risk groups. Prophylactic administration of aspirin (150 mg/day) will be prescribed only in high risk patients. As a secondary objective, sFlt-1 values will be blindly determined in patients with high and intermediate risk to assess its potential performance in the screening for PE.

The risk of atherosclerotic CVD was estimated in 137,127 Taiwanese patients with CKD using six LDL-C trajectory classes determined by the latent class mixed model as optimal, near optimal, above optimal, borderline, sustained high, and declined high over 5 years. The risk of CVD was higher in the sustained high LDL-C [>160 mg/dL over time; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.45-1.94], declined high LDL-C (>160 to <100 mg/dL; aHR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.11-1.38), and borderline LDL-C (approximately 140 mg/dL over time; aHR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.07-1.26) groups than in the optimal LDL-C group (<100 mg/dL over time). There was no such association in patients with an eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2. Persistent diabetes was associated with a 1.15-2.47-fold increase in CVD in patients with high LDL-C (>120 mg/dL). The LDL-C trajectory pattern was associated with the phenotype of CVD risk. The degree of risk varied according to eGFR and diabetes status. A stable low LDL-C over time was potentially beneficial for prevention of CVD.

Cardiac shock wave therapy (CSWT) is a novel and non-invasive therapy for CAD. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of CSWT on CAD. We performed a comprehensive search of electronic databases such as PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Wanfang Data in October 2021. The results were reported as weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity scores were assessed with the standard Cochran's Q test and the I 2 statistic. A total of 8 randomized trials and 2 prospective cohort studies, together involving 643 patients (n = 336 CSWT and n = 307 control), were included in our study. Eight studies with 371 patients showed significantly improved rest left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with CSWT as compared to that of the control group (WMD 3.88, 95% CI 1.53-6.23, p = 0.001, I 2 = 51.2%). Seven studies with 312 patients reported left ventricular internal diameter in diastole (LVIDd) were markedly decreased in the CSWT group compared to the control group (WMD -1.81, 95% CI -3.23 to -0.39, p = 0.012, I 2 = 20.3%). The summed stress score significantly favored the CSWT group (WMD -3.76, 95% CI -6.15 to -1.37, p = 0.002, I 2 = 56.8%), but there was no significant difference for the summed rest score. Our data were acquired from studies without a perceived high risk of bias, so plausible bias is unlikely to seriously affect the main findings of the current study. Based on data from our present meta-analysis, CSWT was shown to moderately improve myocardial perfusion and cardiac function among patients with CAD, which would provide the clinicians with a meaningful and valuable option. The meta-analysis was registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) (https://osf.io/r2xf9).","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

We thus conducted this meta-analysis to investigate the overall incidence and risk of developing PICC-related VTE in hospitalized patients. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception until January 26, 2022. In studies with a non-comparison arm, the pooled incidence of PICC-related VTE was calculated. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated to assess the risk of VTE in the studies that compared PICC to the central venous catheter (CVC). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess methodological quality. A total of 75 articles (58 without a comparison arm and 17 with), including 109292 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled incidence of symptomatic VTE was 3.7% (95% CI: 3.1-4.4) in non-comparative studies. In the subgroup meta-analysis, the incidence of VTE was highest in patients who were in a critical care setting (10.6%; 95% CI: 5.0-17.7). Meta-analysis of comparative studies revealed that PICC was associated with a statistically significant increase in the odds of VTE events compared with CVC (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.83-3.37; P < 0.01). However, in subgroup analysis stratified by the study design, there was no significant difference in VTE events between the PICC and CVC in randomized controlled trials (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 0.77-6.74; P = 0.13). Best practice standards such as PICC tip verification and VTE prophylaxis can help reduce the incidence and risk of PICC-related VTE. The risk-benefit of inserting PICC should be carefully weighed, especially in critically ill patients. Cautious interpretation of our results is important owing to substantial heterogeneity among the studies included in this study.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

This study analyzed the outcomes after nonreinforced RAA in two Austrian centers. Patients with RAA at two Austrian centers between 6/2,009 and 6/2,017 were retrospectively analyzed. Aortic diameters were measured by CT pre- and post-operatively. Patients were assigned according to valve morphology and imaging modality. Overall, 253 patients underwent RAA [women: 30.8%; median age 74 (63-79) years] with a mean preoperative ascending diameter of 44.7 (±3.5) mm. RAA-related postoperative adverse events occurred in 1.2% (n = 3) over a follow-up of a median of 3.8 (2.4-5.5) years: One type A aortic dissection, one lethal aortic rupture at the suture line, and one suture line bleeding with cardiac tamponade and need of surgical revision. The overall survival rate was 89.7%. Aortic valve morphology itself was no risk factor for mortality (Log-Rank: 0.942). One hundred and forty patients had a tricuspid [TAV: (55.3%)] aortic valve and 113 patients had a bicuspid aortic valve [BAV: (44.7%)]. Redilatation to a diameter >50 mm according to CT follow-up occurred in 5.7% (n = 5 of 87). One patient needed reoperation with RAA and aortic valve replacement due to a prosthesis-patient mismatch after aortic valve replacement and aortic redilatation. Non-reinforced RAA is a safe, feasible, and reproducible procedure with low rates of perioperative complications in selected patients primarily undergoing aortic valve repair with a dilated ascending aorta.

A total of 65 patients with non-obstructive HCM and normal left ventricular ejection fraction were enrolled and 60 healthy subjects were selected as controls. The automated function imaging (AFI)-two-dimensional ultrasonic speckle-tracking technology was used to obtain the values for peak global longitudinal strain (GLS), longitudinal strain peak time dispersion (PSD), 18-segment systolic longitudinal peak strain (LPS), 18-segment longitudinal strain peak time (TTPLS), global waste work (GWW), global constructive work (GCW), global work index (GWI), global work efficiency (GWE), and exercise metabolic equivalents (METS). (1) Values for LV-GLS (-17.77 ± 0.20 vs. -21.66 ± 0.42%) were lower and PSD (95.10 ± 8.15 vs. 28.97 ± 1.50 ms) was prolonged in patients with HCM (p < 0.01). (2) An increasing trend was shown in the basal segment < intermediate segment < apical segment for both patients with HCM and controls, although each segment had lower values in the HCM group. (3) TTPLS was prolonged in the HCM group (p < 0.01). (4) GWE, GWI, and GCW were all lower (p < 0.01) and GWW was higher in patients with HCM (p < 0.01). (5) Values of GWE were less than 92.5%, GWI less than 1,200 mmHg, GCW less than 1,399 mmHg, these abnormal values are helpful for the diagnosis of impaired exercise tolerance and poor prognosis (6) The METS and LV-GLS of HCM in the asymmetric group were significantly lower than that in AHCM group, but the PSD was significantly greater than that in the AHCM group. Values of LPS-BL (-13.13% ± 2.51% vs -10.17% ± 2.20%) in the apical HCM group were better than in the asymmetric HCM group (p < 0.05). GCW, GWI, and GWE can be safely measured by resting echocardiography to evaluate exercise tolerance in patients with HCM who cannot perform an exercise-based examination.

However, tools to predict individualized readmission risk are lacking. This study aimed to develop machine learning models to predict 30-day unplanned readmission in children with PH. This study collected data on pediatric inpatients with PH from the Chongqing Medical University Medical Data Platform from January 2012 to January 2019. Key clinical variables were selected by the least absolute shrinkage and the selection operator. Prediction models were selected from 15 machine learning algorithms with excellent performance, which was evaluated by area under the operating characteristic curve (AUC). The outcome of the predictive model was interpreted by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). A total of 5,913 pediatric patients with PH were included in the final cohort. The CatBoost model was selected as the predictive model with the greatest AUC for 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77-0.86), high accuracy for 0.74 (95% CI: 0.72-0.76), sensitivity 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.87), and specificity 0.74 (95% CI: 0.72-0.76). Age, length of stay (LOS), congenital heart surgery, and nonmedical order discharge showed the greatest impact on 30-day readmission in pediatric PH, according to SHAP results. This study developed a CatBoost model to predict the risk of unplanned 30-day readmission in pediatric patients with PH, which showed more significant performance compared with traditional logistic regression. We found that age, LOS, congenital heart surgery, and nonmedical order discharge were important factors for 30-day readmission in pediatric PH.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The mutation of the gene of the nodal tail causes myocardial injury. Rarely does desmin myopathy cause bilateral ventricular changes. We present a case of a 48-year-old man admitted with dyspnea and edema of both lower extremities. Due to bilateral lower limb weakness and calf muscle atrophy, gene sequencing was performed. The results showed that there was a pure missense mutation in the 8th exon region of the DES gene (c.1366G>A), encoding amino acid p.G456R (glycine>arginine). Supplementary examination suggests a high possibility of heart failure, atrial flutter, and desmin myopathy. Atrial flutter was treated by radiofrequency ablation. The clinical symptoms were stable after oral administration of rivaroxaban, coenzyme Q10, and ARNI. In our case, mutation results are the gold standard for the diagnosis of nodular myopathy. Cardiac magnetic resonance can define the extent and degree of cardiomyopathy and quantitatively evaluate cardiac function. At present, there is a lack of specific treatment for proteolytic myopathy. Therefore, the treatment for heart failure proves effective. Due to the multiple systems involved, early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management are critical to improving patient outcomes.","misc","wim","misc"
"319",35958418,"Mechanism of histone deacetylases in cardiac hypertrophy and its therapeutic inhibitors.","Cardiac hypertrophy is a key process in cardiac remodeling development, leading to ventricle enlargement and heart failure. Recently, studies show the complicated relation between cardiac hypertrophy and epigenetic modification. Post-translational modification of histone is an essential part of epigenetic modification, which is relevant to multiple cardiac diseases, especially in cardiac hypertrophy. There is a group of enzymes related in the balance of histone acetylation/deacetylation, which is defined as histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). In this review, we introduce an important enzyme family HDAC, a key regulator in histone deacetylation. In cardiac hypertrophy HDAC I downregulates the anti-hypertrophy gene expression, including Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and inositol-5 phosphatase f (Inpp5f), and promote the development of cardiac hypertrophy. On the contrary, HDAC II binds to myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), inhibit the assemble ability to HAT and protect against cardiac hypertrophy. Under adverse stimuli such as pressure overload and calcineurin stimulation, the HDAC II transfer to cytoplasm, and MEF2 can bind to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) or GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), mediating inappropriate gene expression. HDAC III, also known as SIRTs, can interact not only to transcription factors, but also exist interaction mechanisms to other HDACs, such as HDAC IIa. We also present the latest progress of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), as a potential treatment target in cardiac hypertrophy.","misc","wim","misc"

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics, risk factors, diagnostic methods, management, and clinical outcomes of patients with VTE. This study was based on a VTE registry created over ten years at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All adult inpatients and outpatients referred to the thrombosis unit of the KFMC with clinically suspected VTE including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were enrolled. Data were collected using a standardized case report form, which included demographic and clinical characteristics, risk factors, diagnostic methods, management, and outcomes. A total of 1,008 patients were recruited. Most patients were women (73.2%), and more than half of all patients had unprovoked VTE (58%). Among the provoked cases, the most frequent cause was surgery (29.8%), followed by hospitalization (24.2%). There was a significant statistical association between provoked status and sex, family history of VTE, smoking, recent hospitalization within 3 months for a medical condition, the site of VTE, and underlying peripheral vascular disease and varicose veins (all p < 0.05). The majority (88.3%) of patients with deep vein thrombosis was hospitalized for ≤3 days (n = 433, 79.9%), while fewer than half of the patients with PE needed hospitalization (45.3%). Thrombolytic therapy was administered to 14.1% (n = 142) of patients, and catheter-directed thrombolysis was performed in 1.0% (n = 10) of patients. The odds of mortality for provoked VTE were 3.20 times higher than those of unprovoked VTE [2.12-4.83; p-value < 0.001]. Unprovoked VTE was more common than provoked VTE in the Saudi Arabian cohort, implying hereditary predisposition. Furthermore, male sex, family history of VTE, prior history of VTE, type of VTE, underlying obesity, history of trauma, surgery, hospitalization, pregnancy, and 3-6 months of anticoagulation therapy were the most critical risk factors for VTE recurrence.

The Cochrane collaboration tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Meta-analysis and subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted by RevMan 5.3 software. The evidence's certainty was evaluated by grading recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) methods. A total of 8 studies were included with a total of 614 patients with AHF.

Animal models of Takotsubo syndrome have been developed, either through the application of a stressor, or administration of exogenous catecholamine. We found that in a model of isoproterenol-induced Takotsubo syndrome in anesthetized rats hyperthermia (40-41°C) would occur after the administration of isoproterenol. Maintenance of this hyperthermia would result in an apical hypocontractility typical of the syndrome, whereas prevention of hyperthermia with active cooling to maintain a euthermic core body temperature prevented (but did not subsequently reverse) apical hypocontractility. In vitro experimentation with isolated cardiomyocytes showed no effect of hyperthermia on either baseline contractility or contractility change after beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. We suggest that the rise in body temperature that is characteristic of catecholamine storm may be a component in the development of Takotsubo syndrome.","rodent","wim","rodent"

To date, only invasive surgical options are available to treat cardiovascular calcification despite the growing understanding of underlying pathological mechanisms. Key players in vascular calcification are vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which transform into calcifying SMCs and secrete mineralizing extracellular vesicles that form microcalcifications, subsequently increasing plaque instability and consequential plaque rupture. There is an increasing, practical need for a large scale and inexhaustible source of functional SMCs. Here we describe an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived model of SMCs by differentiating iPSCs toward SMCs to study the pathogenesis of vascular calcification. Specifically, we characterize the proteome during iPSC differentiation to better understand the cellular dynamics during this process. First, we differentiated human iPSCs toward an induced-SMC (iSMC) phenotype in a 10-day protocol. The success of iSMC differentiation was demonstrated through morphological analysis, immunofluorescent staining, flow cytometry, and proteomics characterization. Proteomics was performed throughout the entire differentiation time course to provide a robust, well-defined starting and ending cell population. Proteomics data verified iPSC differentiation to iSMCs, and functional enrichment of proteins on different days showed the key pathways changing during iSMC development. Proteomics comparison with primary human SMCs showed a high correlation with iSMCs. After iSMC differentiation, we initiated calcification in the iSMCs by culturing the cells in osteogenic media for 17 days. Calcification was verified using Alizarin Red S staining and proteomics data analysis. This study presents an inexhaustible source of functional vascular SMCs and calcifying vascular SMCs to create an in vitro model of vascular calcification in osteogenic conditions, with high potential for future applications in cardiovascular calcification research.","misc","wim","misc"

Overall, CGM devices significantly reduced hypoglycemia incidence (Risk ratio (RR) 0.35; 95% CI, 0.25-0.49; P<0.00001) than the POC measurement. Further subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed this result. The CGM group also had lower overall mortality (RR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34-0.86; P=0.01), lower glucose variability, and nosocomial infection. The time in, below, or above target blood glucose range, insulin use, and length of stay in the ICU were comparable between the two groups. In addition, few studies provided data in favor of decreased nursing workload and medical costs in the CGM group. The CGM technique could significantly reduce hypoglycemia incidence, overall mortality, and glucose variability compared to POC measurement in critically ill patients. However, further large, well-designed RCTs are required to confirm our results.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"
"332",35958453,"Characterization of antidepressant activity of Saraca asoca flower (Roxb.) Wilde in mice subjected to acute restraint stress.","Long-term stress and chronic stress events play an important role in the etiology of depression. The study aimed to investigate the antidepressant-like effect of freshly prepared crude ethanolic extract of Saraca asoca flower (ESAF) in a mice model of acute restraint stress. Rhamnazin, Myricetin and Quercetin were analytically characterized through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography from Saraca asoca flower in a 0.1% acetic acid fraction of ethanol. The antidepressant effect was tested by repeated administration of freshly prepared ESAF on mice subjected to repeated and different forms of stress induction for 2 hours every day in the morning and night for seven consecutive days. The antidepressant activity was measured by known behavioral animal models: forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). At the end of the experiment, each group of mice was sacrificed by cervical dislocation, followed by an estimation of the biochemical data. The oral administration of ESAF in doses of 50, 100, & 250 mg/kg for seven consecutive days gave a significant decrease in the time of immobility (P<0.05) and reversed the depression-like behavior induced by acute restraint methods and behavioral models. ESAF treated groups showed a significant increase in glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity in the hippocampus of the acutely restrained mice. In addition, ESAF 250 mg/kg reduced plasma corticosterone levels in mice subjected to different forms of acute restraint stress compared to other groups, comparable to the standard imipramine. Our study showed the antidepressant activity of the ESAF. This effect may be attributed to the presence of antioxidant bioflavonoids namely, Rhamnazin, Myricetin and quercetin. Reduction in the plasma corticosterone levels along with an increase in the antioxidant enzymatic activity such as GSP-PX and SOD in the mice's hippocampus is the proposed molecular hypothesis for its neuroprotective mechanism.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"333",35958464,"Role of matrix metalloproteinase in wound healing.","Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of endopeptidases that play a vital role in the restoration of damaged skin. Through mediating various cellular events such as angiogenesis and vasodilation, MMPs are very crucial for the mechanism of wound healing. These enzymes are endopeptidases that are reliant on zinc which are concealed through the extracellular matrix (ECM). MMPs have different targets in different phases of wound healing through which they are capable of promoting timely healing in the body. This review discusses all the possible role of MMPs and their inhibitors that are involved during every step of the wound healing process. This review highlights the latest advances in the respective field about the regulation and mediation of MMPs in human skin and how these studies can be applied to other branches of medical sciences as well. Published papers were searched via MEDLINE, PubMed and MDPI from the available peer reviewed journals. Research done in the past suggests that active MMPs are involved in the healing progression of the wounds or they have a positive effect towards healing of wounds. Present studies in the relative field will further enhance the knowledge about enzymes working along with their inhibitors. These studies will help in a way to resolve some of the parameters that are necessary for modulating them either positively or negatively.","misc","wim","systematic_review"

Thoracic spinal cord hemisection injuries were performed on adult female Kunming mice. The mice with spinal cord injury (SCI) were injected with hUC-MSCs suspended in normal saline, while the control mice received an equal volume of normal saline. The histological HE staining and Nissl staining were performed 4 and 8 weeks after hUC-MSC transplantation in SCI mice. The Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale was used to assess functional recovery after SCI. Western blotting was performed to determine the protein expressions. hUC-MSCs transplantation decreased cavitation and tissue loss and increased the number of Nissl bodies in the damaged areas of the spinal cord after 4 and 8 weeks. The BBB locomotor performance of the transplanted mice was significantly improved (P<0.01). The wet weight of the injured side of the gastrocnemius muscle was significantly higher in the transplant group than that in the control group. Western blotting showed that TUJ1 and Olig2 expressions were significantly higher in hUC-MSC-grafted mice than those in vehicle controls. Three days after hUC-MSC transplantation, the expressions of TNF-α and NF-κB were higher in MSC-grafted mice than those in vehicle controls. However, 4 weeks after stem cell transplantation, the expressions of these two factors decreased in hUC-MSC-grafted mice compared with those in the vehicle controls. At 8 weeks after hUC-MSC transplantation, the expression of PTBP-1 was decreased in hUC-MSC-grafted mice compared with that in vehicle controls. hUC-MSC transplantation can protect neuron survival, promote myelin repair, and control glial scar formation in SCI mice.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: model, low-dose NBP (L-NBP), middle-dose NBP (M-NBP), or high-dose NBP (H-NBP) (n=10/group). All groups received intraperitoneal injections of isoprinosine hydrochloride daily for 14 days. Additionally, the L-NBP, M-NBP, and H-NBP groups received NBP at 3, 6, and 12 mg per kg body weight, respectively, by intraperitoneal injection. An additional 10 rats (control group) received 0.9% sodium chloride via intraperitoneal injection for 14 consecutive days. Echocardiography was used for the measurement of heart function. Immunohistochemical staining for factor VIII-related antigen and microvascular density determination were performed. The protein and mRNA expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CMI areas were measured by western blot and RT-PCR, respectively. Electrocardiograms showed that NBP improved cardiac function by regulating left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening. Compared with the control and model groups, the L-NBP, M-NBP, and H-NBP groups showed increased mRNA and protein expression of VEGFA and HIF-1α in myocardial tissue. The mRNA and protein expression of VEGFA and HIF-α in the H-NBP group were the highest. NBP treatment promotes VEGF and HIF-1α protein expression during myocardial ischemia, which may represent useful biomarkers for coronary collateral establishment and offer potential targets for therapeutic induction of angiogenesis in patients with CMI.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Patients were divided into single group (n=35) and combined group (n=36) based on treatment methods. The single group received only acupuncture treatment, while the combined group received balanced acupuncture combined with TongduZhengji manipulation. The treatment efficacy, pain level, lumbar function and motion of the lumbar spine were compared between the two groups. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores of the combined group were lower than those of the single group after 3, 4, and 5 days of treatment (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in VAS scores between the two groups after 1 and 2 days of treatment (P>0.05). The Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score of the combined group showed no significant difference compared with that of the single group after 1 and 2 days of treatment (P>0.05), and were lower than those of the single group after 3, 4, and 5 days of treatment (P<0.05). The Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score of the combined group after 1, 2, and 3 days of treatment showed no significant difference compared with the single group (P>0.05), and was higher than that of the single group after 4 and 5 days of treatment (P<0.05).

Thus, this research aimed to investigate whether miR-762 is involved in GC development. MiR-762 expression in the tumor tissues from GC patients and GC cell lines was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The assays including CCK-8, transwell, and flow cytometry were performed to reveal the functions of miR-762 in GC. The target genes of miR-762 were searched by online databases, and then were verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Western blot was performed to investigate the activation of PI3K/AKT and Hippo pathways in GC. MiR-762 was aberrantly upregulated in the tumor tissues and cell lines, and miR-762 silencing could effectively reduce the viability and promote apoptosis of GC cell lines. The study identified LZTS1 as a target gene of miR-762. It was also found that the effects of miR-762 on GC cells could be reversed by LZTS1, and miR-762 could upregulate the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway but inhibit the Hippo pathway by targeting LZTS1. MiR-762 activates PI3K/AKT and suppresses Hippo pathways to boost GC proliferation and invasion by targeting LZTS1.","misc","wim","misc"

Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were used to simulate and analyze the interactions and binding free energies between HLA-A*2402-restricted antigen peptides and HLA molecules, before and after the single residue substitution. HLA-A*2402 restricted antigen peptides before and after the single residue replacement were loaded into dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro, and further Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELispot) test was carried out to evaluate the effect of modified antigen peptides on the immune activation of CTL cells. After replacing the antigen peptides with a single residue, some of them could promote the formation of pi-stacking interaction. The binding free energy between the modified antigen peptides and HLA-A*2402, as well as the level of immune activation of CTL cells were mostly higher than before, especially after the replacement of the 9th residue of the polypeptide, such as C9F and C9W. There was a significant negative correlation between the level of activated CTL cells by modified antigen peptides and the total interaction amount of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Promoting the formation of pi-stacking interaction between antigen peptides and HLA-A*2402 molecules could increase the total binding free energy of p-HLA complex and the level of CTL cells activation. In addition, the amount of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between peptides and HLA could reduce the level of immune activation.

Anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QOLIE-31) were assessed at both baseline and endpoint using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Hamilton Depression Scale (HDMA) and quality of life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31) scales. The statistical analyses included between-and within-group comparisons of the effects of CBT on these measures and associations with demographic and clinical variables. No differences were found between variables at baseline (P>0.05). The repeated-measures analyses found that CBT group had greater improvement in depression score compared to the control group (P<0.05). The analysis of anxiety score showed that compared to the control group, CBT intervention had no statistical significance in the total anxiety population. However, the CBT intervention decreased anxiety in women and Combined-drug group (P<0.05).

The objective of this study is to investigate the chronic dose-dependent effects of sirolimus in the thymus. This was monitored using body weight, histomorphology, caspase-3 expression, cytochrome C immunohistochemistry, and cellular bioenergetics as surrogate biomarkers. BALB/c mice received intraperitoneal injections of either sirolimus (2.5, 5, or 10 µg/g) or dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1 µL/g) as a control for 4 weeks. At the end of the treatment, fragments were collected from the thymus, small intestine, adrenal gland, and kidney. They were processed for assessing histologic changes, measuring cellular respiration and ATP levels. Immunohistochemical stain of caspase-3 and cytochrome C was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue. The treated animals exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in weight gain despite adequate food intake. Sirolimus produced significant thymic derangements, manifested by dose-dependent tissue involution, increased cortical apoptotic bodies, increased caspase-3-positive lymphocytes, and increased rate of cellular respiration without a concomitant increase in cellular ATP. There were no similar changes in cellular ATP in the other assessed organs. The effects on thymic cellular bioenergetics suggest mitochondrial derangements, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and induction of apoptosis.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Currently, the management of patients has improved, making it possible to reduce myocardial infarction injury with new strategies of reperfusion and pharmacologic treatment. A rat model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury (MIRI) was created and subjected to cryptotanshinone (CRY) with or without JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib (FILGO) treatment. H&E staining was used for histopathologic evaluation of heart injury, and TTC staining was employed for evaluation of the infarct size. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to measure the protein expression and qRT-PCR for determining mRNA expression. CRY significantly reduced the area of the infarct, the number of apoptotic cells, and the concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Subsequent analysis showed that CRY repressed the expression of caspase-12, CHOP, and GRP78, but enhanced the phosphorylation of JAK and STAT3. However, FILGO treatment markedly abolished the beneficial effect of CRY pretreatment on cardiomyocyte damage, apoptosis, cardiac function, and inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-dependent apoptosis marker proteins. CRY may alleviate MIRI by inhibiting ERS-dependent apoptosis by activating the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Functional enrichment analysis of BRCA differentially expressed TDGs was assesed. We used univariate Cox, lasso, and multivariate Cox regression to identify the independent prognostic TDGs of BRCA. Then we constructed a prognostic signature and verified its predictive performance. Gene set enrichment analysis of the signal pathway revealed the differences between the prognostic signature high- and low-risk groups. Finally, a nomogram related to the prognostic model was established and verified. A total of 595 differentially expressed TDGs were identified, which are related to various molecular mechanisms of BRCA progression. We identified 8 independent prognostic TDGs for BRCA and validated their expression and prognosis with public data and clinical samples. The BRCA cohort was divided into training and validation cohorts, and prognostic signatures were constructed separately. The log-rank test showed that the survival rate of the high-risk group was significantly lower than that of the low-risk group in the prognostic signature (P<0.001); the AUC in the three cohorts were 0.805, 0.712, and 0.760, respectively; the nomogram also showed better predictive performance. Analyzing the difference between the two risk subtypes, the high-risk group is mainly enriched in angiogenesis, MTORC1, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and glycolysis, which means it is highly malignant. The prognostic signature and nomogram was confirmed to accurately predict the prognosis of patients with BRCA and we validated the hub genes, suggesting their potential as future therapeutic targets.","misc","wim","misc"

Previous studies have shown that cell-free fat extract (CEFFE) is a kind of bioactive extraction from adipose tissues and exhibits a potent anti-inflammatory effect on wound healing and inflammatory diseases. However, the potential role of CEFFE in sepsis remains unclear. CEFFE was extracted from healthy donors and was intraperitoneally injected into septic mice. The septic mice models were constructed using lipopolysaccharide (LPS), E. coli, and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The survival of septic mice was detected for 96 h and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the differences of survival rates. Lung tissues that were collected from septic mice were subjected to HE staining to evaluate the extent of lung injury, and the mice serum was obtained for inflammasome-related cytokines detection. Moreover, peritoneal macrophages were extracted from C57 mice and treated with CEFFE and/or inflammasome activators. The level of IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-α was detected by ELISA, and the activation of NLRP3 were evaluated by Western Blot. Total mtDNA and mitochondrial permeability transition pore were determined to explore the mitochondrial dysfunction in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome with or without CEFEE. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed to confirm the mechanism of NLRP3 activation induced by CEFFE. CEFFE significantly improved the survival of sepsis mice and alleviate sepsis-induced lung injury. Moreover, CEFFE significantly decreased the level of inflammasome-cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18) but not the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. Moreover, CEFFE markedly suppressed the canonical activation of NLRP3 inflammasome without affecting inflammasomes NLRC4 and AIM2. Additionally, the non-canonical activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was significantly inhibited by CEFFE. CEFFE treatment attenuated the mtDNA outflow and the increase of mitochondrial permeability induced by both canonical and non-canonical pathway of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The results of Co-IP assays revealed that CEFFE remarkably attenuated the oligomerization of ASC and inhibited the association between NLRP3 and ASC. Our study revealed that CEFFE could significantly alleviate sepsis-related injuries possibly by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. CEFFE was a promising approach for sepsis treatment.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Rats were orally gavaged with Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 once a day for 5 days before being subjected to CPB. Rats were euthanized post-CPB, and samples of lung tissue were processed for later investigation. The levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA. The expression levels of ferroptosis markers in lungs were assessed by western blot. The microbes in feces and proximal colon of rats were analyzed by using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing method. The ratio and maturity of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) were determined by flow-cytometry. Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 treatment improved lung function, attenuated pathologic lung changes and decelerated the exacerbation of inflammatory cytokine level after experimental CPB. Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 treatment also inhibited CPB-induced ferroptosis, as evidenced by the changes of main markers of ferroptosis, namely, the increase of Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and the decrease of Acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4). In addition, after Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 treatment, the ratio and maturity of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) in the guts of rats with CPB were significantly up-regulated.

The clinical efficacy, inflammatory factors, and myocardial injury markers were compared between the two groups. The influencing factors on recovery after PFNA treatment were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis. Compared to the DHS group, the PFNA group had shorter surgical time, length of stay in hospital, postoperative weight-bearing time, time of healing and detumescence, and less intraoperative blood loss (all P<0.001). The incidence of post-surgical complications with PFNA was lower than with DHS (P<0.05).

Thus, we explored whether moxibustion could adjust the circadian rhythm of RA by modulating the core clock genes CLOCK and BMAL1 at the molecular level. 144 Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (group A), model group (group B), 7-9 am moxibustion treatment group (group C), and 5-7 pm moxibustion treatment group (group D). Each group was divided into 6 time points (0 am, 4 am, 8 am, 12 N, 6 pm, and 8 pm) with an equal number of rats at each time point. Except for group A, all rats were injected with Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) 0.15 ml on the right foot pad to establish the RA model. The rats of the two moxibustion treatment groups were respectively subjected to moxibustion at 7-9 am and 5-7 pm. After 3 weeks of treatment, the tissues were collected at 6 time points during the next 24 hours. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to test the mRNA expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 in the hypothalamus and synovial tissues. CLOCK and BMAL1 protein expression in synovial tissues were detected with western blot. Compared to group A, group B showed significantly down-regulated expression levels of CLOCK and BMLA1 at synovial tissue (P < 0.05), while no statistically significant difference was found in the hypothalamus (P > 0.05). The expression levels of CLOCK and BMLA1 were up-regulated in the moxibustion treatment groups in different tissues, especially in synovial tissue (P < 0.05) compared to group B. Nevertheless, no difference was observed between groups C and D (P > 0.05). Moxibustion could treat RA by modulating clock core genes CLOCK and BMAL1 to regulate the circadian rhythm.

The transcatheter endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) affords a minimally invasive technique to save the lives of these critical patients, and an appropriate stent-graft gets to be the key medical device during an EVAR procedure. Herein, we report a trilayer stent-graft and corresponding delivery system used for the treatment of the AD disease. The stent-graft is made of nitinol stents with an asymmetric Z-wave design and two expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membranes. Each of the inner and outer surfaces of the stent-graft was covered by an ePTFE membrane, and the two membranes were then sintered together. The biological studies of the sintered ePTFE membranes indicated that the stent-graft had excellent cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility in vitro. Both the stent-graft and the delivery system exhibited satisfactory mechanical properties and operability. The safety and efficacy of this stent-graft and the corresponding delivery system were demonstrated in vivo. In nine canine experiments, the blood vessels of the animals implanted with the stent-grafts were of good patency, and there were no thrombus and obvious stenosis by angiography after implantation for 6 months. Furthermore, all of the nine clinical cases experienced successful implantation using the stent-graft and its postrelease delivery system, and the 1-year follow-ups indicated the preliminary safety and efficacy of the trilayer stent-graft with an asymmetric Z-wave design for interventional treatment.","misc","wim","misc"
"350",35958528,"Normal and abnormal development of the aortic valve and ascending aortic wall: a comprehensive overview of the embryology and pathology of the bicuspid aortic valve.","A bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most prevalent congenital cardiac anomaly, in which the valve has only two leaflets, instead of the normal three. Patients with a BAV have an increased risk of aneurysm formation and the development of an aortic dissection. Vascular smooth muscle cells in both the non- and dilated aortic wall are characterized by a maturation defect in all BAV patients, as compared to patients with a tricuspid aortic valve, which can contribute to inherent developmental susceptibility. Besides structural abnormalities of the vascular wall, a turbulent blood flow, caused by bicuspid valve geometry, could expedite the pathological process in the aortic wall, leading to aortopathy. Although the risk for aortopathy is significant, not all BAV patients experience (acute) aortic complications in their lifespan, highlighting the complexity of the pathogenetic process. Recent studies have focused on the embryonic development of semilunar valves and the ascending aortic wall. Their findings highlight that a defect in the embryogenesis could not only explain the development of a malformed aortic valve but also the increased risk for ascending aorta and arch pathology. This review presents an overview of the normal and abnormal development of the aortic valve and the aortic wall: a common defect in early embryogenesis causes the development of a BAV and associated aortopathy.","misc","wim","misc"

However, recent advancements in the field have provided a wealth of promising data and more clinicians are opting for TAVR as an alternative to surgical repair. We aim to review and analyze the available data for TAVR in BAV patients, targeting procedural outcomes, clinical outcomes and mortality with up to two years of follow-up. A literature search of five databases was performed and all primary studies published between 2002 and 2021 that reported procedural, clinical or mortality outcome data were identified. Following data extraction, a meta-analysis of means or proportions was performed using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. A total of 22 studies with 1,945 BAV patients were identified. The mean age was 74.1 years and 58.8% of patients were male. Device success rates was 87.5%. Moderate to severe paravalvular leak (PVL) was seen in 3.7% of procedures. Clinical outcomes included new permanent pacemaker insertion (PPI) (11.8%), major bleeding (3.5%), major vascular complications (2.5%), stroke (2.3%), acute kidney injury (2.1%) and coronary obstruction (0.1%). Mortality in hospital, at 30-days, one and two years of follow-up were 1.9%, 2.1%, 9.6% and 12.9%, respectively. This assessment of the available data on TAVR for BAV shows promising outcomes and low rates of complications.

It is also a strategy frequently employed in patients with acute aortic dissection type A (AADA), involving the aortic root. Although more patients have undergone valve sparing procedures over the past decades, the classic 'modified Bentall technique' remains a valid option, particularly for patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). We aimed to compare the results of elective and emergency modified Bentall procedures in patients with bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs). We retrospectively reviewed our database for patients undergoing either elective or emergency modified Bentall procedures between 2000 and 2018 and identified 827 elective cases (44% BAV) and 258 emergency cases (15% BAV). Analysis of intra- and postoperative outcomes and early mortality was performed. Due to inequality of the groups, a matching analysis was performed. We found BAV patients to be significantly younger (elective: 58±18 vs. 65±14, P<0.001; emergency: 49±17 vs. 62±19, P<0.001) and healthier at time of surgery. In the AADA cohort, malperfusion rate was not different between bicuspid and tricuspid patients, however bicuspid AADA patients presented more often with an entry in the aortic root. After matching, procedure times and early outcomes did not differ between the groups, except for significantly higher rates of respiratory failure in elective TAV patients (10% vs. 5%, P=0.033). The 30-day mortality was 2% in elective cases and 22% in emergency AADA surgery. A subgroup analysis of elective patients with aortic diameter <55 mm also showed excellent outcomes.

"353",35958532,"Twenty-five years' experience with root remodeling and bicuspid aortic valve repair.","Bicuspid aortic valves may be associated with ascending aortic aneurysm, or develop severe aortic regurgitation with variable aortic dilatation. If aortic dilatation involves the root, valve-preserving root replacement is a treatment option, and we prefer root remodeling for this purpose. The objective of this study is to review our experience encompassing 25 years. Between November 1995 and August 2021, 472 patients (429 male; age 9-80 years; mean 48±13 years) were treated by bicuspid aortic valve repair and root remodeling. Aortic regurgitation was present in 322 cases. The primary indication for surgery was aortic regurgitation (n=317), aortic aneurysm (n=143) or acute type A aortic dissection (n=12). In 271 instances, a suture annuloplasty was added. Cusp calcification was present beyond the raphe in 80 cases, and a pericardial patch was used for partial cusp replacement in 44 cases. Follow-up was 92.8% complete with a mean of 71±68 months (median 61 months). Hospital mortality was 0.4% and survival at 20 years was 76.9%. Reoperation was necessary for recurrent aortic regurgitation in 26 patients; nine patients underwent reoperation for stenosis. The overall freedom of reoperation was 90.5% after ten years and 76.6% after 20 years. Annuloplasty was associated with a higher proportion of competent aortic valves at discharge (P=0.001), and had no effect on ten-year freedom from reoperation. The use of a pericardial patch for cusp repair was a predictor for reoperation (P=0.003). The presence of cusp calcification was a predictor for the development of aortic stenosis and reoperation (P=0.032). Bicuspid aortic valve repair combined with root remodeling leads to excellent ten- and 20-year results. Cusp calcification and partial cusp replacement are associated with an increased probability of valve failure requiring reoperation.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

We have therefore previously proposed a new repair-oriented surgical classification for BAVs in order to facilitate our understanding of any given phenotype and to guide surgical repair. BAVs can range from symmetric to very asymmetric, and classification is determined by commissural orientation. This can therefore range from 180° to 120° respectively, and as such has further implications for the presence or absence of a raphe; the height of the non-functional commissure (raphe); the length of the line of cusp fusion; and the architecture of the aortic valve sinuses. Over the last three decades, we have attempted different repair strategies for BAVs, with its respective learning curves and have achieved the best long-term repair results with our signature approach: the 180°-Reimplantation technique (El Khoury technique). Although very asymmetric and tricuspid aortic valve-like phenotypes are sometimes best repaired through tricuspidization, we have found that the majority of BAVs are amenable to our 180°-Reimplantation technique. This technique creates a symmetric valve, through a selective annuloplasty, and stabilization of the entire functional aortic annulus (FAA) with reimplantation of the commissure at 180° at the level of the virtual basal ring (VBR) and sinotubular junction (STJ). Depending on the valve phenotype, additional cusp modifications are often required to address one or two prolapsing cusps and/or a fibrous raphe.

A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the risk of osteoarthritis. Survival analysis was utilized to assess the time-dependent effect of periodontitis on osteoarthritis. Age and gender were stratified to identify subgroups at risk. A symmetrical case-control analysis was designed to determine the relationship between present periodontitis and history of osteoarthritis. Patients with periodontitis had higher risk of osteoarthritis (hazard ratio, HR =1.15, 95% CI =1.12-1.17, p < 0.001) and severe osteoarthritis that led to total knee replacement or total hip replacement (TKR/THR) (HR =1.12, 95% CI =1.03-1.21, p < 0.01) than controls, which was time-dependent (log-rank test p < 0.01). The effect of periodontitis on osteoarthritis was significant in both genders and age subgroups over 30 years-old (all p < 0.001). Among them, females (HR=1.27, 95% CI = 1.13-1.42, p < 0.001) and patients aged over 51 (HR= 1.21, 95% CI =1.10-1.33, p < 0.001) with periodontitis were predisposed to severe osteoarthritis. In addition, periodontitis patients were more likely to have a history of osteoarthritis (odds ratio = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06 - 1.17, p < 0.001). These findings suggest an association between periodontitis and a higher risk of osteoarthritis, including severe osteoarthritis that led to TKR/THR. Likewise, periodontitis is more likely to develop following osteoarthritis. A bidirectional relationship between osteoarthritis and periodontitis was observed.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

However, unlike other poultries, surgical removal of pigeon BF did not limit humoral immune responsiveness. To investigate the expression profiles and the potential role of mRNA and long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) in squab BFs, transcriptome analysis was performed by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) over three developmental stages (1-day, 13 and 26 days old). We identified 13,072 mRNAs and 19,129 lncRNAs, of which 2,752 mRNAs and 1,515 lncRNAs were differential expressed (DE) in pigeon BFs over three developmental stages. Cluster analysis presented different expression patterns in DE mRNAs and lncRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that DE lncRNAs and mRNAs with distinct expression patterns might play crucial roles in the immune system process and tissue morphogenesis. In particular, some DE genes and lncRNAs with higher expression levels in 13D or 26D are related to lymphocyte activation and differentiation, adaptive immune response, positive regulation of immune response, leukocyte migration, etc. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) analysis sreened six significant modules containing 37 genes from immune-related DE gene cluster, which is closely linked in B cell activation, lymphocyte differentiation, B cell receptor signaling pathway, etc. Our study characterizes mRNA and lncRNA transcriptomic variability in pigeon BFs over different developmental stages and enhances understanding of the mechanisms underlying physiological functions of pigeon BF.","misc","wim","misc"

Female mice were divided into four groups, with 10 mice in each group. Mycelial suspensions were administered into the vaginal lumen close to the cervix in groups B, F, and M. Mice in group B were given boric acid gel, and group F was treated with fluconazole gel for 30 min every 12 h. Group M was treated with sterile water, and group N was not given treatment. After the seventh day of treatment, each group was observed with the naked eye, and vaginal lavage fluid and vaginal tissue were collected. Expression levels of cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining was used to measure the fungi in vaginal tissues. There were no significant changes in group M. In groups B and F, there was less vaginal injury and less exudate, with group B doing better than group F. The numbers of CA colonies were higher in groups B, F, and M than in group N (P < 0.01). There was less vaginal colonization of CA in group B than in group F (P < 0.01). After the seventh day of treatment, levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-6, TGF-β, IL-4, and IL-10 were significantly greater in groups B, F, and M than in group N (P < 0.001); levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-6, and TGF-β in groups B and F were higher than those of group M (P < 0.01), while IL-4 and IL-10 levels were significantly lower (P < 0.001). The trends of cytokine increases and decreases were more significant in group B than in group F (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical results were similar to ELISA results. PAS staining revealed that boric acid inhibited hyphal reproduction. The boric acid significantly reduced the symptoms associated with CA vaginal infection. It inhibited the CA growth, prevented vaginal lesions, promoted the secretion of Th1 and Th17 cytokines, and reduced Th2 cytokines.","rodent","wim","rodent"

To overcome eradication by the innate immune system during infection, A. baumannii developed a number of immune evasion strategies. Previously, we identified CipA as a plasminogen-binding and complement-inhibitory protein. Here we show that CipA inhibits all three complement activation pathways and interacts with key complement components C3, C3b, C4b, C5, Factor B, Factor D, and in particular Factor I. CipA also targets function of the C5 convertase as cleavage of C5 was impaired. Systematic screening of CipA variants identified two separate binding sites for C3b and a Factor I-interacting domain located at the C-terminus. Structure predictions using AlphaFold2 and binding analyses employing CipA variants lacking Factor I-binding capability confirmed that the orientation of the C-terminal domain is essential for the interaction with Factor I. Hence, our analyses point to a novel Factor I-dependent mechanisms of complement inactivation mediated by CipA of A. baumannii. Recruitment of Factor I by CipA initiates the assembly of a quadripartite complex following binding of either Factor H or C4b-binding protein to degrade C3b and C4b, respectively. Loss of Factor I binding in a CipA-deficient strain, or a strain producing a CipA variant lacking Factor I-binding capability, correlated with a higher susceptibility to human serum, indicating that recruitment of Factor I enables A. baumannii to resist complement-mediated killing.","misc","wim","misc"

Increasing evidence has reported that hypoxia and immune status contribute to the progression of MM. In this research, the prognostic value of the hypoxia-immune-related gene SLC19A1 in MM was evaluated by bioinformatics analysis. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data along with clinical information on MM were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Consistent clustering analysis and ESTIMATE algorithms were performed to establish the MM sample subgroups related to hypoxia and immune status, respectively, based on the GSE24080 dataset. The differentially expressed analysis was performed to identify the hypoxia-immune-related genes. Subsequently, a hypoxia-immune-gene risk signature for MM patients was constructed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, which was also verified in the GSE4581 dataset. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of SLC19A1 was determined using qRT-PCR in 19 MM patients, and the correlations between the genetic expression of SLC19A1 and clinical features were further analyzed. A total of 47 genes were identified as hypoxia-immune-related genes for MM. Among these genes, SLC19A1 was screened to construct a risk score model that had better predictive power for MM. The constructed prognostic signature based on SLC19A1 was verified in the GSE4581 dataset. All independent prognostic factors (age, β2-microglobulin, LDH, albumin, MRI, and gene risk score) were used to develop a nomogram that showed a better performance for predicting the survival probability of MM patients for 1-5 years. Furthermore, SLC19A1 was highly expressed in newly diagnosed and relapsed MM patients, and high expression of SLC19A1 is correlated with higher bone marrow aspiration plasma cells and β2-microglobulin levels in MM patients. In conclusion, our results suggest that SLC19A1 is aberrantly expressed in MM and highly expressed SLC19A1 might be a biomarker correlated with inferior prognosis. More importantly, we identified SLC19A1 as a hypoxia-immune-related gene in MM. Future functional and mechanistic studies will further clarify the roles of SLC19A1 in MM.","misc","wim","misc"

Investigation in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) in people living with obesity in which metabolic complications such as insulin resistance are yet to manifest is limited, and the mechanisms by which these processes are dysregulated are not well elucidated. Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFAs) have been shown to modulate the expression of genes associated with lipid accumulation and collagen deposition and reduce the number of inflammatory macrophages in adipose tissue from individuals with insulin resistance. Therefore, these lipids may have positive actions on obesity associated scWAT hypertrophy and inflammation. To evaluate obesity-associated tissue remodelling and responses to LC n-3 PUFAs, abdominal scWAT biopsies were collected from normal weight individuals and those living with obesity prior to and following 12-week intervention with marine LC n-3 PUFAs (1.1 g EPA + 0.8 g DHA daily). RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, and histochemical staining were used to assess remodelling- and inflammatory-associated gene expression, tissue morphology and macrophage infiltration. Obesity was associated with scWAT hypertrophy (P < 0.001), hypoxia, remodelling, and inflammatory macrophage infiltration (P = 0.023). Furthermore, we highlight the novel dysregulation of Wnt signalling in scWAT in non-insulin resistant obesity. LC n-3 PUFAs beneficially modulated the scWAT environment through downregulating the expression of genes associated with inflammatory and remodelling pathways (P <0.001), but there were altered outcomes in individuals living with obesity in comparison to normal weight individuals. Our data identify dysregulation of Wnt signalling, hypoxia, and hypertrophy, and enhanced macrophage infiltration in scWAT in non-insulin resistant obesity. LC n-3 PUFAs modulate some of these processes, especially in normal weight individuals which may be preventative and limit the development of restrictive and inflammatory scWAT in the development of obesity. We conclude that a higher dose or longer duration of LC n-3 PUFA intervention may be needed to reduce obesity-associated scWAT inflammation and promote tissue homeostasis. www.isrctn.com, identifier ISRCTN96712688.","randomized_trial","wim","randomized_trial"

Furthermore, we examined the preventive role of IAP in IR induced by a high-fat diet in mice. We found that an IAP + IAP enhancer significantly ameliorated blood glucose, insulin, low-density lipoprotein, gut barrier function, inflammatory markers, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in serum. IAP could dephosphorylate LPS and nucleoside triphosphate in a pH-dependent manner in vitro. Firstly, LPS is inactivated by IAP and IAP reduces LPS-induced inflammation. Secondly, adenosine, a dephosphorylated product of adenosine triphosphate, elicited anti-inflammatory effects by binding to the A2A receptor, which inhibits NF-κB, TNF, and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways. Hence, IAP can be used as a natural anti-inflammatory agent to reduce intestinal inflammation-induced IR.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Unfortunately, they may impair the patient's ability to mount sufficient humoral and T-cellular responses to vaccination, which is of special relevance in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We present here a case series of six multiple sclerosis patients on treatment with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators who failed to develop SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and T-cells after three doses of vaccination. Due to their ongoing immunotherapy, lacking vaccination response, and additional risk factors, we offered them pre-exposure prophylactic treatment with monoclonal SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. Initially, treatment was conducted with the antibody cocktail casirivimab/imdevimab. When the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant became predominant, we switched treatment to monoclonal antibody sotrovimab due to its sustained neutralizing ability also against the Omicron strain. Since sotrovimab was approved only for the treatment of COVID-19 infection and not for pre-exposure prophylaxis, we switched treatment to tixagevimab/cilgavimab as soon as it was granted marketing authorization in the European Union. This antibody cocktail has retained, albeit reduced, neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant and is approved for pre-exposure prophylaxis. No severe adverse events were recorded for our patients. One patient had a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 under treatment with sotrovimab, but was asymptomatic. The other five patients did not develop symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection or evidence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the time of treatment up until the finalization of this report. SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody treatment should be considered individually for multiple sclerosis patients lacking adequate vaccination responses on account of their immunomodulatory treatment, especially in times of high incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","misc","wim","misc"

However, the modulation of PEDV infection upon the activation of the host's innate immune response has not been fully characterized. In this study, we observed that various IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were upregulated significantly in a time- and dose-dependent manner in LLC-PK1 cells infected with the PEDV G2 strain FJzz1. The transcriptions of IRF9 and STAT1 were increased markedly in the late stage of FJzz1 infection and the promotion of the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1, implicating the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway during FJzz1 infection. In addition, abundant type I/III IFNs were produced after FJzz1 infection. However, type I/III IFNs and ISGs decreased greatly in FJzz1-infected LLC-PK1 cells following the silencing of the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), including RIG-I and MDA5, and the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) adaptors, MyD88 and TRIF. Altogether, FJzz1 infection induces the production of type-I/III IFNs in LLC-PK1 cells, in which RLRs and TLRs signaling pathways are involved, followed by the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, triggering the production of numerous ISGs to exert antiviral effects of innate immunity.","misc","wim","misc"

We also demonstrated a significant correlation between gene modules and clinical phenotypes. Moreover, we integrated phenotypic, immunologic, and genetic data to assess the potential for progression of different molecular subtypes. Furthermore, the efficacy of drugs against various NAFLD molecular subtypes was discussed to aid in individualized therapy. Overall, this study could provide new insights into the underlying pathogenesis of and drug targets for NAFLD.","misc","wim","misc"
"368",35958577,"Occurrence of autoantibodies against skin proteins in patients with hereditary epidermolysis bullosa predisposes to development of autoimmune blistering disease.","Skin blistering disorders are associated with inherited defects in proteins involved in the dermal-epidermal adhesion or autoantibodies targeting those proteins. Although blistering in hereditary epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is pathogenetically linked to genetic deficiency of distinct proteins of the epidermis or the dermal-epidermal junction, circulating autoantibodies against these proteins have also been identified in EB patients. So far, autoantibodies have been considered bystanders in EB and active pathogenicity of them in EB has not been disclosed. In sera of a cohort of 258 EB patients, we found by ELISA in 22% of the patients autoantibodies against the bullous pemphigoid antigen BP180. The titers correlated negatively with collagen VII skin expression and positively with disease severity. Among those patients, we identified six (2.33%) with clinical features of an autoimmune bullous disorder (AIBD) and positive indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) staining. In literature, we found four more cases of EB patients developing disease-aggravating AIBD. Co-existence of these two rare skin disorders suggests that EB patients have a predisposition for the development of AIBD. Our work highlights that EB patients with increased itch or blister formation should be evaluated for additional AIBD and repeated screening for changes in autoantibody titers and skin-binding specificities is advised.","misc","wim","misc"
"369",35958578,"Defining Patient-Level Molecular Heterogeneity in Psoriasis Vulgaris Based on Single-Cell Transcriptomics.","Identifying genetic variation underlying human diseases establishes targets for therapeutic development and helps tailor treatments to individual patients. Large-scale transcriptomic profiling has extended the study of such molecular heterogeneity between patients to somatic tissues. However, the lower resolution of bulk RNA profiling, especially in a complex, composite tissue such as the skin, has limited its success. Here we demonstrate approaches to interrogate patient-level molecular variance in a chronic skin inflammatory disease, psoriasis vulgaris, leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing of CD45+ cells isolated from active lesions. Highly psoriasis-specific transcriptional abnormalities display greater than average inter-individual variance, nominating them as potential sources of clinical heterogeneity. We find that one of these chemokines, CXCL13, demonstrates significant correlation with severity of lesions within our patient series. Our analyses also establish that genes elevated in psoriatic skin-resident memory T cells are enriched for programs orchestrating chromatin and CDC42-dependent cytoskeleton remodeling, specific components of which are distinctly correlated with and against Th17 identity on a single-cell level. Collectively, these analyses describe systematic means to dissect cell type- and patient-level differences in cutaneous psoriasis using high-resolution transcriptional profiles of human inflammatory disease.","misc","wim","misc"

However, these effects in the pediatric population are less studied and there is no standard method to identify those at risk for developing infections. Our goal was to better understand immune dysfunction and identify soluble protein markers following pediatric thermal injury. Further we wanted to determine which early inflammatory, soluble, or immune function markers are most predictive of the development of nosocomial infections (NI) after burn injury. We performed a prospective observational study at a single American Burn Association-verified Pediatric Burn Center. A total of 94 pediatric burn subjects were enrolled and twenty-three of those subjects developed a NI with a median time to diagnosis of 8 days. Whole blood samples, collected within the first 72 hours after injury, were used to compare various markers of inflammation, immune function, and soluble proteins between those who recovered without developing an infection and those who developed a NI after burn injury. Within the first three days of burn injury, innate and adaptive immune function markers (ex vivo lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha production capacity, and ex vivo phytohemagglutinin-induced interleukin-10 production capacity, respectively) were decreased for those subjects who developed a subsequent NI. Further analysis of soluble protein targets associated with these pathways displayed significant increases in soluble CD27, BTLA, and TIM-3 for those who developed a NI. Our findings indicate that suppression of both the innate and adaptive immune function occurs concurrently within the first 72 hours following pediatric thermal injury. At the same time, subjects who developed NI have increased soluble protein biomarkers. Soluble CD27, BTLA, and TIM-3 were highly predictive of the development of subsequent infectious complications. This study identifies early soluble protein makers that are predictive of infection in pediatric burn subjects. These findings should inform future immunomodulatory therapeutic studies.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

In this study, 260 adults: 126 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 sorted into severity groups: severe (n=68) and mild or moderate (n=58), and 134 healthy controls were enrolled. We quantified 39 plasma inflammatory mediators using multiplex ELISA. Spearman rank correlation and Mann-Whitney U test were used to identify mechanistically coupled inflammatory mediators and compare disease severity. Compared to healthy controls, patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of interleukins 1α, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 15, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1), IFN-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10, CXCL10), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1α, CCL3), eotaxin-3 (CCL26), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), placental growth factor (PlGF), and fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1). Patients with severe COVID-19 had higher IL-10 and lower macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC, CCL22) compared to the mild or moderate group (P<0.05). In the receiver operating characteristic curve, SAA, IL-6 and CRP showed strong sensitivity and specificity in predicting the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Greater age and higher CRP had a significant association with disease severity (P<0.05). Our findings reveal that CRP, SAA, VCAM-1, CXCL10, CCL22 and IL-10 levels are promising biomarkers for COVID-19 disease severity, suggesting that plasma inflammatory mediators could be used as warning indicators of COVID-19 severity, aid in COVID-19 prognosis and treatment.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

DNA and recombinant protein-based vaccines were developed and tested following viral isolation and characterization. The viral strain isolated from diseased hybrid red tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) shared high levels of morphological and genomic similarity (95.49-99.52%) with other TiLV isolates in the GenBank database. TiLV segment 9 (Tis9) and segment 10 (Tis10) DNA vaccines (pcDNA-Tis9 and pcDNA-Tis10) and recombinant protein vaccines (Tis9 and Tis10) were prepared and tested for their efficacy in juvenile hybrid red tilapia. Fish were immunized with either single vaccines (pcDNA-Tis9, pcDNA-Tis10, Tis9 and Tis10) or combined vaccines (pcDNA-Tis9 + pcDNA-Tis10 and Tis9 + Tis10) by intramuscular injection and intraperitoneal injection for DNA and protein vaccines, respectively. Negative controls were injected with PBS or a naked pcDNA3.1 vector in the same manner. An experimental challenge with TiLV was carried out at 4 weeks post-vaccination (wpv) by intraperitoneal injection with a dose of 1 × 105 TCID50 per fish. Relative percent survival (RPS) ranged from 16.67 ± 00.00 to 61.11 ± 9.62%. The Tis10 and pcDNA-Tis10 vaccines conferred better protection compared to Tis9 and pcDNA-Tis9. Highest levels of protection were observed in pcDNA-Tis9 + pcDNA-Tis10 (61.11 ± 9.62%) and Tis9 + Tis10 (55.56 ± 9.62%) groups. Specific antibody was detected in all vaccinated groups at 1-4 wpv by Dot Blot method, with the highest integrated density at 2 and 3 wpv. In silico analysis of Tis9 and Tis10 revealed a number of B-cell epitopes in their coil structure, possibly reflecting their immunogenicity.

The Sabin-strain-based inactivated poliovirus vaccine (sIPV) and the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) have been licensed in China for many years. To conduct a clinical study on the safety and immunogenicity of the sIPV when administered concomitantly with the DTaP. The study population was divided into three groups: group 1 was the sIPV+ DTaP concomitant administration group, group 2 was the sIPV inoculation group, and group 3 was the DTaP inoculation group. Blood samples were collected prevaccination and 30 days postvaccination, and serum antibody levels were detected. This study showed that the seropositive and seroconversion rates of type 1, 2 and 3 poliovirus in group 1 were higher than those in group 2, with no statistically significant difference after vaccination (P>0.05). Groups 1 and 3 also showed similar responses for all vaccine antigens except anti-FHA (97.65 (94.09-99.36) vs. 100 (97.89-100)). The geometric mean titers (GMTs) for the DTaP and sIPV among the groups were comparable, and the non-inferiority t test result was P<0.001. The number of local adverse events (AEs) reported in group 1 (29.91%) were larger than those in group 2 (12.39%) and group 3 (21.93%), among which the most common was redness. Similarly, the most common systemic AE was fever. All 5 severe AE (SAE) cases were determined by experts to be unrelated to the vaccines during the study. The evidence of similar seroconversion and safety with co-administered DTaP and sIPV supports the co-administration supports the introduction of a strategy of simultaneous administration of both vaccines into routine infant immunization, and it could increase vaccination coverage and protect more infants from morbidity and mortality from these related diseases. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04054882?term=NCT04054882&cntry=CN&draw=2&rank=1, identifier NCT04054882.","randomized_trial","wim","randomized_trial"
"375",35958598,"Comprehensive FGFR3 alteration-related transcriptomic characterization is involved in immune infiltration and correlated with prognosis and immunotherapy response of bladder cancer.","Bladder cancer (BC) threatens the health of human beings worldwide because of its high recurrence rate and mortality. As an actionable biomarker, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) alterations have been revealed as a vital biomarker and associated with favorable outcomes in BC. However, the comprehensive relationship between the FGFR3 alteration associated gene expression profile and the prognosis of BC remains ambiguous. Genomic alteration profile, gene expression data, and related clinical information of BC patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genomics database (TCGA), as a training cohort. Subsequently, the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to identify the hub modules correlated with FGFR3 alteration. The univariate, multivariate, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analyses were used to obtain an FGFR3 alteration-related gene (FARG) prognostic signature and FARG-based nomogram. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used for evaluation of the ability of prognosis prediction. The FARG signature was validated in four independent datasets, namely, GSE13507, GSE31684, GSE32548, and GSE48075, from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Then, clinical feature association analysis, functional enrichment, genomic alteration enrichment, and tumor environment analysis were conducted to reveal differential clinical and molecular characterizations in different risk groups. Lastly, the treatment response was evaluated in the immunotherapy-related dataset of the IMvigor210 cohort and the frontline chemotherapy dataset of GSE48276, and the chemo-drug sensitivity was estimated via Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC). There were a total of eleven genes (CERCAM, TPST1, OSBPL10, EMP1, CYTH3, NCRNA00201, PCDH10, GAP43, COLQ, DGKB, and SETBP1) identified in the FARG signature, which divided BC patients from the TCGA cohort into high- and low-risk groups. The Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated that BC patients in the low-risk group have superior overall survival (OS) than those in the high-risk group (median OS: 27.06 months vs. 104.65 months, p < 0.0001). Moreover, the FARG signature not only showed a good performance in prognosis prediction, but also could distinguish patients with different neoplasm disease stages, notably whether patients presented with muscle invasive phenotype. Compared to clinicopathological features, the FARG signature was found to be the only independent prognostic factor, and subsequently, a FARG-based prognostic nomogram was constructed with better ability of prognosis prediction, indicated by area under ROC curve (AUC) values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS of 0.69, 0.71, and 0.79, respectively. Underlying the FARG signature, multiple kinds of metabolism- and immune-related signaling pathways were enriched. Genomic alteration enrichment further identified that FGFR3 alterations, especially c.746C>G (p.Ser249Cys), were more prevalent in the low-risk group. Additionally, FARG score was positively correlated with ESTIMATE and TIDE scores, and the low-risk group had abundant enrichment of plasma B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ naive T cells, and helper follicular T cells, implying that patients in the low-risk group were likely to make significant responses to immunotherapy, which was further supported by the analysis in the IMvigor210 cohort as there was a significantly higher response rate among patients with lower FARG scores. The analysis of the GDSC database finally demonstrated that low-risk samples were more sensitive to methotrexate and tipifarnib, whereas those in the high-risk group had higher sensitivities in cisplatin, docetaxel, and paclitaxel, instead. The novel established FARG signature based on a comprehensive FGFR3 alteration-related transcriptomic profile performed well in prognosis prediction and was also correlated with immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatment responses, which had great potential in future clinical applications.","misc","wim","misc"
"376",35958602,"Development of mouse model for oral allergy syndrome to identify IgE cross-reactive pollen and food allergens: ragweed pollen cross-reacts with fennel and black pepper.","Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is an IgE-mediated immediate food allergy that is localized to the oral mucosa. Pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS), a pollinosis-associated OAS, is caused by cross-reactivity between food and pollen allergens. However, we need to more precisely understand the underlying pathogenesis of OAS/PFAS. In the present study, we developed a method to comprehensively identify cross-reactive allergens by using murine model of OAS and protein microarray technology. We focused on lip angioedema, which is one of the most common symptoms of OAS, and confirmed that mast cells reside in the tissues inside the lower lip of the mice. Interestingly, when the food allergen ovalbumin (OVA) was injected inside the lower lip of mice with high levels of OVA-specific IgE followed by an intravenous injection of the Evans blue dye, we found immediate dye extravasation in the skin of the neck in a mast cell-dependent manner. In addition, the degree of mast cell degranulation in the oral cavity, reflecting the severity of oral allergic responses, can be estimated by measuring the amount of extravasated dye in the skin. Therefore, we used this model of OAS to examine IgE cross-reactive allergens in vivo. Protein microarray analysis showed that serum IgE from mice intraperitoneally sensitized with ragweed pollen, one of the major pollens causing pollinosis, bound highly to protein extracts from several edible plants including black peppercorn and fennel. We confirmed that the levels of black pepper-specific IgE and fennel-specific IgE were significantly higher in the serum from ragweed pollen-sensitized mice than in the serum from non-sensitized control mice. Importantly, analysis of murine model of OAS showed that the injection of black pepper or fennel extract induced apparent oral allergic responses in ragweed pollen-sensitized mice. These results indicate IgE cross-reactivity of ragweed pollen with black pepper and fennel. In conclusion, we developed mouse model of OAS to identify IgE cross-reactive pollen and food allergens, which will help understand the pathogenesis of OAS/PFAS.","rodent","wim","rodent"

This study was a retrospective, single-center, case series study. 33 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with clinical stage of T3~4N0~2M0 treated in Yunnan Cancer Hospital from June 2019 to June 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. Among them, 32 patients were dMMR or MSI-H or both dMMR and MSI-H, and one patient was both dMMR and microsatellite stability (MSS) (excluded in the final analysis). All 32 patients received neoadjuvant immunotherapy (nIT) with single-agent PD⁃1 inhibitor. Among the 32 patients, 8 (25%) were locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and 24 (75%) were locally advanced colon cancer (LACC); 4 (12.55%) were stage II and 28 (87.5%) were stage III. The median number of cycles of 32 patients with dMMR/MSI-H LACRC receiving nIT with single-agent PD-1 blockade was 6 (4~10), and the median number of cycles to achieve partial response (PR) was 3 (2~4). Among them, three LARC patients achieved clinical complete response (cCR) and adopted the watch-and-wait (W&W) strategy. The objective response rate (ORR) of the other 29 patients with radical surgery was 100% (29/29), the pathological response rate was 100% (29/29), the rate of major pathological response (MPR) was 86.2% (25/29), and the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) was 75.9% (22/29). The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in 32 patients during nIT was 37.5% (12/32), while the incidence of irAEs in 22 patients with operation during adjuvant immunotherapy was 27.3% (6/22), all of which were grade 1~2. No grade 3 or above irAEs were occured. The median time from the last nIT to surgery was 27 (16~42) days. There were no delayed radical resection due to irAEs in these patients. All 29 patients achieved R0 resection. The incidence of surgical-related adverse events (srAEs) in perioperative period was 10.3% (3/29). Neoadjuvant monoimmunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitor has favorable ORR and pCR rate, and relatively low incidences of irAEs and srAEs for patients with dMMR/MSI-H LACRC, suggesting that this nIT regimen of single-agent PD-1 inhibitor is significantly effective and sufficiently safe.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

However, Notch-derived lncRNAs and their latent clinical significance remain elusive in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we introduced a framework that could screen Notch-derived lncRNAs (named NLncer) and ultimately identified 24 NLncers. To further explore the clinical significance of these NLncers, we performed LASSO and Cox regression in TCGA-CRC cohort (n = 584) and then retained six lncRNAs tightly associated with prognosis. The final model (termed NLncS) was subsequently tested in GSE38832 (n = 122), GSE39582 (n = 573), and an in-house clinical cohort (n = 115). Ultimately, our NLncS model could serve as an independent risk factor and afford a robust performance for assessing the prognosis of CRC patients. Additionally, patients with high NLncS risk scores were characterized by upregulation of immune pathways, strong immunogenicity, abundant CD8 + T-cell infiltration, and potentially higher response rates to CTLA4 blockers, which turned out to be suitable for immunotherapy. Aiming at globally observing the characteristics of high-risk patients, somatic mutation and methylation modification analysis provide us with evidence at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. To facilitate the clinical transformability, we mined deeply into the sensitive compounds targeting high-risk individuals and identified dasatinib as a candidate agent for patients with a high Notch risk score. In conclusion, our NLncS model is a promising biomarker for optimizing the clinical management of CRC patients.","misc","wim","misc"

The newly identified variants were functionally verified. We also conducted a systematic literature review of HA20, and the clinical characteristics and genotype of HA20 between the Chinese population and other populations were compared. Eight HA20 patients from three families comprised six adults and two children. There was one man and seven women. The clinical characteristics included recurrent oral ulcers (8/8, 100%), fever (4/8, 50%), perianal ulcer (3/8, 38%), skin lesions (2/8, 25%), arthritis (1/8, 13%), and uveitis (1/8, 13%). Three TNFAIP3 variants, A547T, c.1906+2T>G, and R271X, were identified. Two novel variants, A547T and c.1906+2T>G, were validated to be pathogenic in our study. In a literature review a total of 126 patients with HA20 reported by 35 articles were included. The clinical phenotype of Chinese HA20 patients was similar to that of patients from other populations except for a lower frequency of genital ulcers (16.7% vs. 54.4%, p < 0.01). Autoantibodies were detectable in approximately one-third of the 126 patients, among which ANA and anti-thyroid antibodies were commonly seen. The rarity and diversity of phenotypes make the diagnosis of HA20 a huge challenge to physicians. HA20 should be considered in child-onset patients with manifestations that resemble Behçet's syndrome, especially those whose family members have similar symptoms.

Published articles including patients with MOG-AD and reporting the efficacy or tolerability of two or more types of treatment in preventing relapses were included. Reported outcomes including incidence of relapse, annualized relapse rate (ARR), and side effects were extracted. Network meta-analysis with a random-effect model within a Bayesian framework was conducted. Between group comparisons were estimated using Odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% credible intervals (CrI). Twelve studies that compared the efficacy of 10 different treatments in preventing MOG-AD relapse, including 735 patients, were analyzed. In terms of incidence of relapse, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), oral corticosteroids (OC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine (AZA), and rituximab (RTX) were all significantly more effective than no treatment (ORs ranged from 0.075 to 0.34). On the contrary, disease-modifying therapy (DMT) (OR=1.3, 95% CrI: 0.31 to 5.0) and tacrolimus (TAC) (OR=5.9, 95% CrI: 0.19 to 310) would increase the incidence of relapse. Compared with DMT, IVIG significantly reduced the ARR (MD=-0.85, 95% CrI: -1.7 to -0.098). AZA, MMF, OC and RTX showed a trend to decrease ARR, but those results did not reach significant differences. The combined results for relapse rate and adverse events, as well as ARR and adverse events showed that IVIG and OC were the most effective and tolerable therapies. Whilst DMT should be avoided, IVIG and OC may be suited as first-line therapies for patients with MOG-AD. RTX, MMF, and AZA present suitable alternatives.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

The occurrence of NAFLD is usually accompanied by a series of chronic metabolic diseases, with a prevalence rate is 25.24% among adults worldwide. Therefore, NAFLD seriously affects the quality of life in patients and causes a large economic burden. It has been reported that puerarin has the function of lowering the serum lipids, but due to the complexity of NAFLD, the specific mechanism of action has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the preventive or ameliorating effects of two doses of puerarin (0.11% and 0.22% in diet) on high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced NAFLD in rats. The rats were fed with HFFD-mixed puerarin for 20 weeks. The results showed that puerarin ameliorated the levels of lipids in the serum and liver. Further exploration of the mechanism found that puerarin ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation in NAFLD rats by reducing the expression of Srebf1, Chrebp, Acaca, Scd1, Fasn, Acacb, Cd36, Fatp5, Degs1, Plin2, and Apob100 and upregulating the expression of Mttp, Cpt1a, and Pnpla2. At the same time, after administration of puerarin, the levels of antioxidant markers (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) were significantly increased in the serum and liver, and the contents of serum and hepatic inflammatory factors (interleukin-18, interleukins-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) were clearly decreased. In addition, puerarin could ameliorate the liver function. Overall, puerarin ameliorated HFFD-induced NAFLD by modulating liver lipid accumulation, liver function, oxidative stress, and inflammation.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Fortunately, the combination of GC and traditional Chinese medical prescriptions can attenuate the adverse effects and improve therapeutic efficiency. Hedyotis diffusa Willd (HDW) is one of the most commonly used herbal compounds for LN treatment, which exhibits heat-clearing and detoxification effects. However, the underlying pharmacological mechanism remains unclear. The present study identified the chemical compounds in HDW extract with UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. A total of 49 components were identified in the HDW extract, and the IL-17 signaling pathway was highly enriched by network pharmacological analysis. MRL/lpr model mice, reflecting the spontaneous development of LN, were used to evaluate the protective activity and investigate the underlying mechanism of the combination treatment. The white blood cell content (WBC), including lymphocytes and neutrophils, cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-a), and various autoantibodies (ANA, ab-dsDNA, ab-snRNP/sm) in the blood of MRL/lpr mice were significantly improved by the intragastric administration of HDW. Additionally, the expression of STAT3, IL-17, Ly6G, and MPO in the kidney and neutrophil NETosis were ameliorated with HDW treatment. The pathological and morphological analysis suggested that HDW application could reduce urinary protein levels and inflammatory cell infiltration and inhibit glomerular interstitial cell proliferation. Hence, HDW might ameliorate lupus nephritis by inhibiting IL-6 secretion and STAT3-induced IL-17 expression. The active compounds in HDW were predictively selected with computational methods. The docking affinity of asiatic acid, neoandrographolide to IL-6, glycyrrhetinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, and wilforlide A to STAT3 are extremely high. In conclusion, the IL-6 and STAT3/IL-17signaling pathways could be critical regulative targets of HDW on LN.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"384",35958623,"The effect of reparixin on survival in patients at high risk for in-hospital mortality: a meta-analysis of randomized trials.","A great number of anti-inflammatory drugs have been suggested in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reparixin, a non-competitive allosteric inhibitor of the CXCL8 (IL-8) receptors C-X-C chemokine receptor type 1 (CXCR1) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2), has already been tried out as a treatment in different critical settings. Due to the contrasting existing literature, we decided to perform the present meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the effect of the use of reparixin on survival in patients at high risk for in-hospital mortality. We created a search strategy to include any human RCTs performed with reparixin utilization in patients at high risk for in-hospital mortality, excluding oncological patients. Two trained, independent authors searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for appropriate studies. Furthermore, references of review articles and included RCTs were screened to identify more studies. No language restrictions were enforced. To assess the risk of bias of included trials, the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) was used. Overall, six studies were included and involved 406 patients (220 received reparixin and 186 received the comparator). The all-cause mortality in the reparixin group was significantly lower than that in the control group [5/220 (2.3%) in the reparixin group vs. 12/186 (6.5%) in the control group, odds ratio = 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.96), p-value for effect 0.04, p for heterogeneity 0.20, I 2 = 36%]. In addition, no difference in the rate of pneumonia, sepsis, or non-serious infections was shown between the two groups. Our meta-analysis of randomized trials suggests that short-term inhibition of CXCL8 activity improved survival in patients at high risk for in-hospital mortality without increasing the risk of infection.

"385",35958624,"Detection of neutrophil extracellular traps in patient plasma: method development and validation in systemic lupus erythematosus and healthy donors that carry IRF5 genetic risk.","Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web-like structures extruded by neutrophils after activation or in response to microorganisms. These extracellular structures are decondensed chromatin fibers loaded with antimicrobial granular proteins, peptides, and enzymes. NETs clear microorganisms, thus keeping a check on infections at an early stage, but if dysregulated, may be self-destructive to the body. Indeed, NETs have been associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), psoriasis, and gout. More recently, increased NETs associate with COVID-19 disease severity. While there are rigorous and reliable methods to quantify NETs from neutrophils via flow cytometry and immunofluorescence, the accurate quantification of NETs in patient plasma or serum remains a challenge. Here, we developed new methodologies for the quantification of NETs in patient plasma using multiplex ELISA and immunofluorescence methodology. Plasma from patients with SLE, non-genotyped healthy controls, and genotyped healthy controls that carry either the homozygous risk or non-risk IRF5-SLE haplotype were used in this study. The multiplex ELISA using antibodies detecting myeloperoxidase (MPO), citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) and DNA provided reliable detection of NETs in plasma samples from SLE patients and healthy donors that carry IRF5 genetic risk. An immunofluorescence smear assay that utilizes only 1 µl of patient plasma provided similar results and data correlate to multiplex ELISA findings. The immunofluorescence smear assay is a relatively simple, inexpensive, and quantifiable method of NET detection for small volumes of patient plasma.","misc","wim","misc"

Because of the relatively high recurrence rate of OC, it is crucial to understand the associated mechanisms of drug resistance and to discover potential target for rational targeted therapy. Cell death is a genetically determined process. Active and orderly cell death is prevalent during the development of living organisms and plays a critical role in regulating life homeostasis. Ferroptosis, a novel type of cell death discovered in recent years, is distinct from apoptosis and necrosis and is mainly caused by the imbalance between the production and degradation of intracellular lipid reactive oxygen species triggered by increased iron content. Necroptosis is a regulated non-cysteine protease-dependent programmed cell necrosis, morphologically exhibiting the same features as necrosis and occurring via a unique mechanism of programmed cell death different from the apoptotic signaling pathway. Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is characterized by the formation of membrane pores and subsequent cell lysis as well as release of pro-inflammatory cell contents mediated by the abscisin family. Studies have shown that ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis are involved in the development and progression of a variety of diseases, including tumors. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in the occurrence, development, and therapeutic potential of OC.","misc","wim","misc"

However, little is known about depressive symptoms in the population with low back pain in China. Our study evaluated the prevalence of depressive symptoms and analyzed the factors associated with this condition in the Chinese population with low back pain. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2018 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. We collected low back pain information for each participant and identified depressive symptoms using the brief version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. A wide range of sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of the subjects were extracted. We measured the prevalence of depressive symptoms comorbid with low back pain and analyzed the associated factors by multiple logistic regression. A total of 5,779 respondents aged 45 and over with low back pain formed the sample, 41.8% of whom reported depressive symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated greater vulnerability to depressive symptoms among females (OR = 1.41, 95% CI, 1.16-1.73), relatively younger persons (60-74 years: OR = 0.72, 95% CI, 0.63-0.83; ≥ 75 years: OR = 0.62, 95% CI, 0.49-0.79, reference: 45-59 years), those from the central and western regions (central: OR = 1.39, 95% CI, 1.18-1.64; western: OR = 1.56, 95% CI, 1.33-1.83), participants with extremely short sleep duration (OR = 2.74, 95% CI, 2.33-3.23), those with poor self-perceived health status (OR = 2.91, 95% CI, 2.34-3.63,), multisite pain (OR = 1.54, 95% CI, 1.20-1.98) and disability in activities of daily living (Basic: OR = 1.70, 95% CI, 1.47-1.98; Instrumental: OR = 1.95, 95% CI, 1.70-2.24).

The concept of digital phenotyping is based on the idea that collecting real-time markers of human behavior allows us to determine the digital signature of a pathology. This strategy assumes that behaviors are quantifiable from data extracted and analyzed through digital sensors, wearable devices, or smartphones. That concept could bring a shift in the diagnosis of mood disorders, introducing for the first time additional examinations on psychiatric routine care. The main objective of this review was to propose a conceptual and critical review of the literature regarding the theoretical and technical principles of the digital phenotypes applied to mood disorders. We conducted a review of the literature by updating a previous article and querying the PubMed database between February 2017 and November 2021 on titles with relevant keywords regarding digital phenotyping, mood disorders and artificial intelligence. Out of 884 articles included for evaluation, 45 articles were taken into account and classified by data source (multimodal, actigraphy, ECG, smartphone use, voice analysis, or body temperature). For depressive episodes, the main finding is a decrease in terms of functional and biological parameters [decrease in activities and walking, decrease in the number of calls and SMS messages, decrease in temperature and heart rate variability (HRV)], while the manic phase produces the reverse phenomenon (increase in activities, number of calls and HRV).

This study was designed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on suicide pre-, during, and post the first wave of COVID-19 in China. It was reported that online public searching was associated with their offline thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the online search for suicide pre-, during, and post-COVID-19 in China. The keywords on suicide, COVID-19, unemployment, and depression were collected in 2019 and 2020 using the Baidu Search Index (BSI). A time-series analysis examined the dynamic correlations between BSI-COVID-19 and BSI-suicide. A generalized estimating equation model was used to calculate the coefficients of variables associated with the BSI-suicide. The BSI-suicide showed a significant increase (15.6%, p = 0.006) from the 5th to 9th week, which was also the point of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. A time-series analysis between BSI-suicide and BSI-COVID-19 showed that the strongest correlation occurred at lag 1+ and lag 2+ week. In the pre-COVID-19 model, only BSI-depression was highly associated with BSI-suicide (β = 1.38, p = 0.008). During the COVID-19 model, BSI-depression (β = 1.77, p = 0.040) and BSI-COVID-19 (β = 0.03, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with BSI-suicide. In the post-COVID-19 model, BSI depression (β = 1.55, p = 0.010) was still highly associated with BSI-suicide. Meanwhile, BSI-unemployment (β = 1.67, p = 0.007) appeared to be linked to BSI-suicide for the first time. There was a surge in suicide-related online searching during the early stage of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Online suicide search volume peaked 1-2 weeks after the COVID-19 peak. The BSI of factors associated with suicide varied at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, few studies have investigated the effects of such a program and predictors of work restoration and maintenance in the participants. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of a rework program as well as to examine whether cognitive function and mental state at the end of the rework program predict the probability of work restoration and maintenance and whether the frequency of rework program participation predicts successful work restoration and maintenance. The rework program included both patients absent from work and unemployed patients. Patients completed assessments including Trail Making Test Type B (TMT-B), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale just before graduating from the rework program. Simultaneously, their depressive state was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating scale. The patients were divided into the job group, comprising 94 patients who were able to restore their work or get a new job, and the non-job group, comprising 34 patients who were not able to do so. We found that the program was more effective in patients absent from work than in unemployed patients, TMT-B could predict work restoration and maintenance, and the frequency of rework program participation could predict work restoration but not work maintenance. Based on the findings, we propose Yamashita's criterion where a TMT-B completion time of 70 s is the cut-off point for work restoration. The present findings may provide useful evidence that could aid in the further development of rework program(s).","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Thus, research is urgently needed to explore the relationship between ACEs pattern and trajectory of depressive symptom levels at multiple time points in order to provides early targeted interventions to those who are most at risk. We aimed to explore patterns of ACEs, including types and timing, associated with depression trajectories in college students. A school-based health survey was used to collect data as part of a longitudinal study in two medical college in Anhui province, China. Questionnaires were issued to 3,662 participants aged 17-22 and recorded details of ACEs (types and timing) and depression. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify patterns of ACEs type and timing. Depressive symptom trajectories employed latent class growth analysis (LCGA). Multiple logistic regressions were employed to evaluate the relationships between ACEs patterns and depressive symptom trajectories. We identified five ACEs patterns: High neglect/emotional abuse/community violence, High neglect/emotional abuse, High neglect/family dysfunction, High neglect, Low ACEs. We traced three depression trajectories: High depressive symptom Moderate depressive symptom, Low depressive symptom. High neglect/emotional abuse/community violence, High neglect/emotional abuse and High neglect/family dysfunction demonstrated a high risk for High depressive symptom and Moderate depressive symptom. High neglect showed a high risk for Moderate depressive symptom but not for High depressive symptom (P < 0.05). The findings address the need for a comprehensive consideration of exposure to childhood adversity associated with the risk of depression in young adults through identifying more problematic ACEs patterns amongst exposed children.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

In a transcultural context, somatic complaints are typically associated with psychological distress. A recent review about somatic symptom disorders in adolescence showed some nosographic heterogeneity and outlined various etiological hypotheses (traumatic, environmental, or neurologic), separate from the cross-cultural considerations. Migrants' children encounter specific problems involving cultural mixing-issues of filiation (familial transmission) and affiliation (belonging to a group). This paper aims to provide a systematic review of somatization in transcultural contexts among teenagers and young adults, aged 13 to 24, over the past decade. This review adheres to the quality criteria set forth by the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Two authors queried three English databases (Medline, PsycInfo, WebOfScience) about somatization in transcultural contexts (migrant or non-Western population) among teenagers (13-18), young adults (19-24), or both. The methodological process comprised articles selection, data extraction, and then the analysis of emerging themes. Setting selection criteria to limit the transcultural field was difficult. The study analyzed 68 articles. We present a descriptive analysis of the results, centered on three main themes. First, the literature highlights a nosographic muddle reflected in the combination of anxious and depressive symptoms together with the highly variable symptomatology. Second, discrimination issues were prevalent among the migrant population. Lastly, the literature review points out possibilities for improving a care pathway and reducing the diagnostic delay induced by migrants' hesitancy about Western care and the recurrent use of inappropriate diagnostic criteria. This review discusses the links between the nosographic muddle described here and the diagnostic delays these patients experience and raises concerns about rigid diagnostic compartmentalization. The work of the psychiatrist Frantz Fanon is here useful to understand externalized symptoms resulting from physical and psychological confinement. Discrimination issues raise questions about the cultural counter-transference health professionals experience in dealing with young migrants. Defining healthcare professionals' representations about somatic complaints in a transcultural context might be a fruitful path to explore in future research. CRD42021294132.

"398",35958665,"Reduced childhood social attention in autism model marmosets predicts impaired social skills and inflexible behavior in adulthood.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social and communication impairments and restricted and repetitive behavior. Although there is currently no established cure for ASD, early interventions for deficits of attention to other individuals are expected to reduce the progression of ASD symptoms in later life. To confirm this hypothesis and improve early therapeutic interventions, it is desirable to develop an animal model of ASD in which social attention is impaired in childhood and ASD-like social behavior is observed in adulthood. However, rodent models of ASD have difficulty in recapitulating the deficit of gaze-based social attention. In this study, we examined the direction of gaze toward other conspecifics during childhood and puberty in a three-chamber test setting using an ASD marmoset model produced by maternal exposure to valproic acid (VPA). We also conducted a reversal learning test in adult VPA-exposed marmosets as an indicator of perseveration, a core symptom of ASD that has not previously been investigated in this model. The results showed that time spent gazing at other conspecifics was reduced in VPA-exposed marmosets in childhood, and that mature animals persisted with previous strategies that required long days for acquisition to pass the test. In a longitudinal study using the same animals, deficits in social attention in childhood correlated well with ASD-like social disturbance (inequity aversion and third-party reciprocity) and inflexible behavior in adulthood. Since VPA-exposed marmosets exhibit these diverse ASD-like behaviors that are consistent from childhood to adulthood, VPA-exposed marmosets will provide a valuable means of elucidating mechanisms for early intervention and contribute to the development of early therapies.","misc","wim","rodent"

For example, baseball pitchers generate various pitching forms, e.g., variable wind-up, cocking, and follow-through forms. However, they commonly rotate their wrists and fingers at increasingly high speeds via shoulder and trunk motions. Despite the universality of common and individually different motion patterns in skilled movements, the abovementioned question remains unanswered. Here, we focus on a motion required to hit a snare drum, including the indirect phase of task achievement (i.e., the early movement and mid-flight phases) and the direct phase of task achievement (i.e., the hit phase). We apply tensor decomposition to collected kinematic data for the drum-hitting motion, enabling us to decompose high-dimensional and time-varying motion data into individually different and common movement patterns. As a result, individually different motion patterns emerge during the indirect phase of task achievement, and common motion patterns are evident in the direct phase of task achievement. Athletes and musicians are thus possibly allowed to perform individually different motion patterns during the indirect phase of task achievement. Additionally, they are required to exhibit common patterns during the direct phase of task achievement.","misc","wim","misc"

Conventional diagnostic tools for assessment of arrhythmias suffer from limited availability and usability challenges, particularly under the demanding training conditions of an elite athlete. Among endurance athletes, there is a need for out-of-hospital monitoring to enhance detection of arrhythmias under conditions that are relevant and potentially provocative of underlying pathology. The Norwegian patch ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor has been developed to simplify the assessment of heart rhythm disorders. The current study aimed to evaluate the ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor function and usability in an elite athlete environment. A total of 13 professional cyclists from the UNO-X Pro Cycling Team were examined with the ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor during training camp in Spain, December 2021. All ECG data were analyzed by cardiologists at Sorlandet Hospital Arendal, Norway. The athletes also completed a brief questionnaire registering their training (from on-bike monitoring units) and provided self-assessment of usability parameters after the test. In 8 of 13 athletes (69% male, age 23 ± 4 years), two test periods were performed with different ECG patches, resulting in a total of 21 tests with continuous ECG monitoring. Average total ECG test duration per athlete was 144 ± 47 h (89 ± 24 h/patch). Athletes performed an average of 15 ± 5 training h during each test. The ECG quality from all tests was considered satisfactory for rhythm analysis-also during exercise. The reported usability of the ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor was high, and no athletes reported trouble sleeping or training with the sensor. The automatic arrhythmia algorithm reported episodes of possible arrhythmias in 5 (24%) tests; 2 atrial flutter, 2 supraventricular tachycardia and 1 bradycardia (heart rate <30/min). Manual assessment by physicians verified the episode of bradycardia but revealed normal sinus rhythm in all other tests. No false negative events were identified in over 1,800 h of ECG collection. The ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor allowed for high quality ECG monitoring with high usability during intensive exercise in athletes.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Thus, the design and synthesis of stable size/morphology-controlled MOF nanocrystals is critical but challenging. In this study, dual-ligand and hard-soft-acid-base strategies were used to fabricate a variety of 3D pillared-layer [Ni(thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate)(4,4'-bipyridine)]n MOF nanocrystals (1D nanofibers, 2D nanosheets and 3D aggregates) with controllable morphology by varying the concentration of 4,4'-bipyridine and thus controlling the crystal growth direction. Owing to the shorter ion diffusion length, enhanced electron/ion transfer and strong interactions between thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate and 4,4'-bipyridine, the 2D nanosheets showed much larger specific capacitance than 1D nanofibers and 3D aggregates. A single device with an output voltage as high as 3.0 V and exceptional cycling performance (95% of retention after 5000 cycles at 3 mA cm-2) was realized by configuring two aqueous asymmetric supercapacitive devices in series.

Exposure of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice to pulmonary artery banding disclosed a tight relation of structural remodeling with afterload, but a dissociation from RV systolic function. Reduced release of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in C57BL/6J mice prevented the development of RHF. In patients with left heart failure, increased oxidative damage in RV sections was associated with severely impaired RV function. In conclusion, reactive oxygen species are involved in the transition of maladaptive RV remodeling to RHF.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Here, we evaluated the role of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibition in CAVD. Up-regulation of PTP1B was critically involved in calcified human aortic valve, and PTP1B inhibition had beneficial effects in preventing fibrocalcific response in valvular interstitial cells and LDLR-/- mice. In addition, we reported a novel function of PTP1B in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis by interacting with the OPA1 isoform transition in valvular interstitial cell osteogenesis. Thus, these findings have identified PTP1B as a potential target for preventing aortic valve calcification in patients with CAVD.","misc","wim","rodent"

However, increasing, yet controversial, evidence suggests that extremely trained athletes may not be protected from cardiovascular events as much as moderately trained individuals. In our rodent model, intensive but not moderate training promoted aorta and carotid stiffening and elastic lamina ruptures, tunica media thickening of intramyocardial arteries, and an imbalance between vasoconstrictor and relaxation agents. An up-regulation of angiotensin-converter enzyme, miR-212, miR-132, and miR-146b might account for this deleterious remodeling. Most changes remained after a 4-week detraining. In conclusion, our results suggest that intensive training blunts the benefits of moderate exercise.","misc","wim","rodent"
"405",35958733,"Sex Differences in Hypothalamic Changes and the Metabolic Response of TgAPP Mice to a High Fat Diet.","The propensity to develop neurodegenerative diseases is influenced by diverse factors including genetic background, sex, lifestyle, including dietary habits and being overweight, and age. Indeed, with aging, there is an increased incidence of obesity and neurodegenerative processes, both of which are associated with inflammatory responses, in a sex-specific manner. High fat diet (HFD) commonly leads to obesity and markedly affects metabolism, both peripherally and centrally. Here we analyzed the metabolic and inflammatory responses of middle-aged (11-12 months old) transgenic amyloid precursor protein (TgAPP) mice of both sexes to HFD for 18 weeks (starting at 7-8 months of age). We found clear sex differences with females gaining significantly more weight and fat mass than males, with a larger increase in circulating leptin levels and expression of inflammatory markers in visceral adipose tissue. Glycemia and insulin levels increased in HFD fed mice of both sexes, with TgAPP mice being more affected than wild type (WT) mice. In the hypothalamus, murine amyloid β (Aβ) levels were increased by HFD intake exclusively in males, reaching statistical significance in TgAPP males. On a low fat diet (LFD), TgAPP males had significantly lower mRNA levels of the anorexigenic neuropeptide proopiomelanocortin (POMC) than WT males, with HFD intake decreasing the expression of the orexigenic neuropeptides Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), especially in TgAPP mice. In females, HFD increased POMC mRNA levels but had no effect on AgRP or NPY mRNA levels, and with no effect on genotype. There was no effect of diet or genotype on the hypothalamic inflammatory markers analyzed or the astrogliosis marker glial acidic protein (GFAP); however, levels of the microglial marker Iba-1 increased selectively in male TgAPP mice. In summary, the response to HFD intake was significantly affected by sex, with fewer effects due to genotype. Hypothalamic inflammatory cytokine expression and astrogliosis were little affected by HFD in middle-aged mice, although in TgAPP males, which showed increased Aβ, there was microglial activation. Thus, excess intake of diets high in fat should be avoided because of its possible detrimental consequences.","rodent","wim","rodent"

An encoding-decoding mechanism is designed to reconstruct the feature information of each node in the graph. A stack of multiple graph convolutional layers is considered as an encoder that encodes the node feature information into the potential vector space, while the decoder employs a simple two-layer perceptron to reconstruct the initial node features from the encoded vector information. The encoding-decoding mechanism achieves a re-evaluation of the initial node features. Subsequently, an additional local feature reconstruction loss is added after the decoder to aid the goal of graph classification. Further, stochastic gradient descent is applied to solve the problem in the loss function. Finally, the proposed model is experimentally validated based on the Karate Club and Football datasets.

Different methods and procedures are adopted to detect and diagnose heart abnormalities. Data scientists are working on finding the different methods with the required accuracy (Strodthoff et al., 2021). Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the procedure to find the heart condition in the waveform. For ages, the machine learning techniques, which are feature based, played a vital role in the medical sciences and centralized the data in cloud computing and having access throughout the world. Furthermore, deep learning or transfer learning widens the vision and introduces different transfer learning methods to ensure accuracy and time management to detect the ECG in a better way in comparison to the previous and machine learning methods. Hence, it is said that transfer learning has turned world research into more appropriate and innovative research. Here, the proposed comparison and accuracy analysis of different transfer learning methods by using ECG classification for detecting ECG Arrhythmia (CAA-TL). The CAA-TL model has the multiclassification of the ECG dataset, which has been taken from Kaggle. Some of the healthy and unhealthy datasets have been taken in real-time, augmented, and fused with the Kaggle dataset, i.e., Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH dataset). The CAA-TL worked on the accuracy of heart problem detection by using different methods like ResNet50, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet.

The same equipment Root-Subtree processes are sorted and loaded into the corresponding equipment queue through the vertical and horizontal prescheduling method in a single-workshop environment, and it combines with the schedulable process set to dequeue the first process of the queue. To enhance the flexibility of process scheduling, it proposes a process conflict adjustment strategy for the vertical process tree constraints in the two workshops to determine the processing workshop of the processes and the actual start time, which narrows the search comparison for schedulable processes.

We optimized the DWR and PD simultaneously by using the multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm (MOGA). In the following performance optimization of WSN, we simultaneously optimized the transmission success rate and information dimension with the number of nodes and transmission failure rate of the sensor node as variables by the same algorithm. By calculating the information dimension and the transmission success rate of each Pareto optimal solution, we obtained the number of nodes and transmission failure probability of the node available for practical deployment of WSN.

The state of surface water requires special consideration in light of the water crisis caused by nitrogen pollution. In this study, the natural abundance of the nitrogen stable isotope (δ 15N) is measured and sampled in sediments and compared with the total dissolved nitrogen (DN) in four main Chinese tributaries of Hun River upper reach, including the Dasuhe, Beisanjia, Beikouqian, and Nanzamu tributaries. Results show that for the Dasuhe and Nankouqian tributaries, the δ 15N values of sediment samples in 2016 are all significantly higher than previous values in 2011. In the Dasuhe tributary, this change is attributed to the promotion of organic agricultural production under which chemical fertilizers are replaced by organic fertilizers. For the δ 15N values of the sediment in the Nankouqian tributary, the construction of the municipal sewer system and wastewater treatment facilities are the causes of this rising trend. The δ 15N values of nitrate released by facilities could be raised by microbial denitrification that is employed in the tertiary treatment process. Most of the δ 15N values of the sediments are distributed between soil and manure, indicating that nitrogen in the river water mainly comes from agriculture. All the surveyed tributaries except Dasuhe show a significant increase in DN. In addition, a significant positive correlation between the change ratio of the farmland area and DN in river water is observed, suggesting that the increase in nitrogen in river water from 2011 to 2016 is due to agriculture.

"424",35958812,"Health Information Prediction System of Infant Sports Based on Deep Learning Network.","The sensed data from infant sports and training programs are useful in analyzing their health conditions and forecasting any disorders or abnormalities. The sensed information is processed for providing errorless predictions for infant diseases/disorders, coupled with artificial intelligence and sophisticated healthcare technologies. The problem of noncongruent sensed data impacting the forecast occurs due to errors between consecutive training iterations. This problem is addressed using the deep learning (PEST-DL) proposed perceptible error segregation technique. The training process is halted between two consecutive iterations generating errors until a similarity verification based on infant history is performed. The similarity output determines the errors due to mismatching data observations, and therefore, the data augmentation is performed. The first perceptible error is mitigated by training the learning paradigm with all possible infant history data in the learning process. This prevents prediction lag and data omissions due to discrete availability. The learning is trained from the identified error with the precise detected disorder/abnormality data previously detected. Therefore, the first and consecutive training data segregate error instances from the actual training iterations. This improves the prediction accuracy and precision with controlled error and time complexity.","misc","wim","misc"

"426",35958825,"The Microenvironment That Regulates Vascular Wall Stem/Progenitor Cells in Vascular Injury and Repair.","Vascular repair upon injury is a frequently encountered pathology in cardiovascular diseases, which is crucial for the maintenance of arterial homeostasis and function. Stem/progenitor cells located on vascular walls have multidirectional differentiation potential and regenerative ability. It has been demonstrated that stem/progenitor cells play an essential role in the basic medical research and disease treatment. The dynamic microenvironment around the vascular wall stem/progenitor cells (VW-S/PCs) possesses many stem cell niche-like characteristics to support and regulate cells' activities, maintaining the properties of stem cells. Under physiological conditions, vascular homeostasis is a cautiously balanced and efficient interaction between stem cells and the microenvironment. These interactions contribute to the vascular repair and remodeling upon vessel injury. However, the signaling mechanisms involved in the regulation of microenvironment on stem cells remain to be further elucidated. Understanding the functional characteristics and potential mechanisms of VW-S/PCs is of great significance for both basic and translational research. This review underscores the microenvironment-derived signals that regulate VW-S/PCs and aims at providing new targets for the treatment of related cardiovascular diseases.","misc","wim","misc"

Health follow-up management services can encourage patients with hypertension to improve their health behavior and outcomes. However, a lack of studies on the relationship between specific factors of follow-up management and both subjective and objective health outcome among hypertensive patients exists. The current study investigated the relationship between service content, frequency, mode, and institutions of follow-up management and health outcomes among Chinese hypertensives. Data were obtained from the sixth National Health Service Survey (NHSS) of Jiangsu Province, which was conducted in 2018. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the sample characteristics and the utilization of follow-up management services. Both multiple linear regression and logistic regression were used to estimate the association of follow-up management service and other factors with hypertensives' subjective and objective health outcomes. Some respondents (19.30%) reported hypertension, and 75.36% of these patients obtained follow-up management services. Hypertensive patients' subjective health outcome self-reported health status and objective health outcome blood pressure (BP) control were found to be significantly associated with follow-up management services. The outcomes were both significantly improved by a high frequency of management services, a high level of follow-up providers, the mode of visiting healthcare facilities and/or calling, and receiving instructions on medication use. However, inquiring about patients' symptoms was negatively associated with self-reported health status and BP control. In addition, BP measurement was significantly and positively associated with hypertensive patients' self-reported health status; the patients receiving lifestyle guidance were more likely to have their BP levels under control. Hypertension management strategies should further focus on the frequency of healthcare follow-up management via categorization of the follow-up services and appropriate adjustment of service delivery modes to optimize health follow-up management for hypertensives further improve their outcomes. Meanwhile, complementary policies are also needed to address other socioeconomic factors that can promote good health conditions for hypertension patients.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

In the first workshop, 20 participants who teach in the Schools of Nursing, Medicine, Pharmacy, and Pharmaceutical Science, or the Program in Public Health convened to explore concepts of sustainability, theoretical models of curriculum integration, challenges to adding new competencies into professional training, and strategies for integrating climate change modules and case studies into the curricula. The second half-day workshop was held a year after the first workshop to review how faculty members have modified their syllabus to integrate climate change information with varying degrees of success. A case study is presented regarding an asynchronous fully online course Introduction to Global Health, which is open to enrollment by students from all campuses of the University of California. The outcomes revealed preferential adoption of models of curriculum integration which minimized disruption of the sequence of topics in pre-existing courses. These include, for example, the use of longitudinal climate datasets for quantitative analysis of disease outcomes, and description of episodic events involving extreme weather conditions to explore differences in social determinants of vulnerability to climate change impacts in different populations. Integration of climate change as a distinct topic seems easier in elective courses in comparison with required courses designed to cover pre-established professional knowledge, competencies, and skills. The emergent requirement for interprofessional training in the health sciences provides an opportunity for the development of a cross-cutting competency domain including climate change as a unifying theme in a stand-alone course or set of courses in a sequenced model of curriculum integration.","misc","wim","misc"

Human eosinophils can exhibit unique multi-leaf nuclear morphology, which are filled with cytoplasmic granules that contain cytotoxicity and immune regulatory proteins. In recent years, many studies focused on the origin, differentiation and development process of eosinophils. It has been discovered that the eosinophils have the regulatory functions of innate and adaptive immunity, and can also function in several diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, acute respiratory distress syndrome, malignant tumors and so on. Hence, the role and effects of eosinophils in various diseases are emphasized. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the development and differentiation process of eosinophils, the research progress of their related cytokines, diseases and current clinical treatment options, and discussed the potential drug target, aiming to provide a theoretical and practical basis for the clinical prevention and treatment of eosinophil-related diseases, especially respiratory diseases.

By the end of 2021, China achieved a full vaccination rate higher than 85%. The Chinese Plan provides an important model for the global fight against COVID-19. Internet search reflects the public's attention toward and potential demand for a particular thing. Research on the spatiotemporal characteristics of online attention to vaccines can determine the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccine demand in China and provides a basis for global public health policy making. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal characteristics of online attention to vaccines and their influencing factors in 31 provinces/municipalities in mainland China with Baidu Index as the data source by using geographic concentration index, coefficient of variation, GeoDetector, and other methods. The following findings are presented. First, online attention to vaccines showed an overall upward trend in China since 2011, especially after 2016. Significant seasonal differences and an unbalanced monthly distribution were observed. Second, there was an obvious geographical imbalance in online attention to vaccines among the provinces/municipalities, generally exhibiting a spatial pattern of high in the east and low in the west. Low aggregation and obvious spatial dispersion among the provinces/municipalities were also observed. The geographic distribution of hot and cold spots of online attention to vaccines has clear boundaries. The hot spots are mainly distributed in the central-eastern provinces and the cold spots are in the western provinces. Third, the spatiotemporal differences in online attention to vaccines are the combined result of socioeconomic level, socio-demographic characteristics, and disease control level.","misc","wim","misc"

We believe that before effective health literacy intervention strategies, it is preferable to understand the features of health literacy among ethnic minorities. The present study firstly updated insights on health literacy among ethnic minorities by investigating the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) profile of common chronic diseases in ethnic minority areas, and secondly discussed the KAP profiles in detail to inspire future health education interventions. A cross-sectional, health-literacy-sensitive study was conducted in China's typical ethnic minority area. Participants included 801 adult residents who lived in the ethnic minority area. The primary outcome was participant scores on the KAP questionnaire of common chronic diseases, followed by latent profile analysis to identify participants with similar KAP score patterns and determine whether membership in specific groups was associated with demographic or clinical characteristics. The participants included 496 ethnic minorities (61.9%) and 305 Han Chinese (38.1%). Three-profile solution was determined after the latent profile analysis: incomplete transfer [I.T.] (n = 215), better practice [B.P.] (n = 301), and average [A.V.] (n = 285). IT group (26.84%) was characterized by the highest level of knowledge and attitude toward common chronic diseases and below average level for practice. Participants in B.P. group performed poorly in both knowledge and attitude toward common chronic diseases but had the highest level of practice. A.V. group reflected average knowledge, attitude, and practice toward common chronic diseases among three subgroups. Ethnic minorities were the dominant population in A.V. group (68.8%). Compared with other groups, the A.V. group contained the largest proportions of married participants (84.2%), participants with no formal education (46.7%), and high annual out-of-pocket medical expense (33.3%). A more specific and nuanced understanding of minority health literacy can enable service providers to provide more effective health education to their recipients, thereby improving health inequities.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Menstruating women and girls are forced into isolation, prevented from movement, dietary restrictions, and can be prevented from participating in daily routine activities. Furthermore, the way almost all previous studies conducted in Ethiopia measured the practice of MHM did not meet standard definition of safe MHM. This study aimed to assess safe management of menstrual hygiene practice and associated factors among female adolescent students in public high schools in central Ethiopia. A mixed-methods approach was employed in this study. Systematic random sampling technique was used to select 846 study participants. The collected data were entered through EPI INFO version 7 and exported to SPSS version 23 for cleaning and analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to identify the association between MHM and independent variables. Finally, AOR, 95% CI, and p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The qualitative data was analyzed by ATLAS.ti in order to extract the main themes and categories. Direct quotations were presented with a thick description of the findings. The safe management of menstrual hygiene was 28.20%. Living with parents (AOR = 2.51, 95% CI:1.11-5.68), living with relatives (AOR = 7.41, 95% CI:2.55-21.54), having a merchant mother (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI:1.14-2.9), having a mother who has private work (AOR = 4.56, 95% CI:1.31-5.90), having a farmer father (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI:1.1-2.31), rural resident (AOR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.17-2.21) and realizing the absence of container for storing sanitary napkins in the toilet of the school latrine (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.1-0.94) were factors associated with MHM. Findings from a qualitative study were discussed under four themes to explore barriers to menstrual hygiene management, and three themes emerged as enablers to menstrual hygiene management. The safe management of menstrual hygiene was low among adolescent girls. People with whom adolescent girls live, the occupational status of mother and father, residence, the availability of a container to dispose of sanitary napkins in school toilets were factors associated with menstrual hygiene management.

This practice is also thought to be provoked by some nutritional needs, but in modern society its etiology is obscure. The mineralogical and chemical compositions of clay may vary from one region to another and even in all form of rocks clay constitutes. Published articles in geophagy indicate lack of adequate investigations into the toxicity of geophagy, though it is globally practiced and more prevalent in Africa (as a continent) or in Africans migrants. Some studies have helped to identify some minerals that are toxic to human if ingested. In most cases, the potential toxicity emphasized by these studies is based on the detection of the presence of these nuisance elements in the geophagic materials. Scientifically, a lot has been done in the light of detection of toxic matter, but more investigations on metabolic studies are still necessary. The variability of clay content with respect to source motivated this review on geophagy and its potential toxicity to human.

This study was a large scale school-based cross-sectional study among children and adolescents aged 5-20 years old. Participants were selected by the school-based registration system in 2020. All the subjects underwent spherical equivalent (SE) error with non-cycloplegic autorefraction measurement. Myopia was defined as an SE refraction of ≤-0.75 diopters (D) and graded into low myopia (-0.75 to -3.00 D), moderate myopia (-3.01 to -5.99 D), and high myopia (≤-6.00 D). A total of 1,059,838 participants were eligible for this survey and 1,013,206 (95.6% participation rate) were selected through data quality control, which comprised 17 districts/counties and 1,254 schools, including 861 elementary schools, 313 middle schools, and 80 high schools. The mean age of participants was 11.57 ± 3.36 years (5-20 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 1.11. The whole city-level prevalence of total myopia was 75.35%. The prevalence of total myopia among the students in the Hanting District was 45.47%, but ≈82.37% of students living in Changyi have myopia. The overall prevalence of low myopia in elementary, middle, and high school students was 48.56, 47.30, and 31.62%, respectively, while high myopia (SE ≤ -6.00 D) prevalence was 1.12, 8.89, and 20.12%, respectively. The overall prevalence of myopia increased fastest in children aged 7-9 years old. The prevalence of high myopia was 7.59% for girls and 6.43% for boys, respectively (p < 0.001). The prevalence of myopia increased with increasing age and grade, but SE decreased with increasing age and grade. The current investigation demonstrated a high proportion of myopia among school students in the city of Weifang, and gradually increased with age, and the prevalence of myopia was the highest in Changyi areas.

Taking the area within the Sixth Ring Road of Beijing as an example, based on Landsat remote sensing images, meteorological stations, and questionnaires, this study established a relational model between temperature and hostility and then analyzed the changes in the emotional health risk (hostility) in the study area and the mechanism of how outdoor activity duration influences hostility. Results show that: (1) the area within the Sixth Ring Road of Beijing had a higher and higher temperature from 1991 to 2020. Low-temperature areas gradually shrank, and medium- and high-temperature areas extended outwards from the center. (2) The threat of high temperature to residents' hostility gradually intensified-the sphere of influence expanded, low-risk areas quickly turned into medium-high-risk areas, and the level of hostility risk increased. Level 1 risk areas of hostility had the most obvious reduction-a 74.33% reduction in area proportion; meanwhile, Level 3 risk areas had the most significant growth-a 50.41% increase in area proportion. (3) In the first 120 min of outdoor activities under high temperature, residents' hostility was negatively correlated with outdoor activity duration; after more than 120 min, hostility became positively correlated with duration. Therefore, figuring out how temperature changes influence human emotions is of great significance to improving the living environment and health level of residents. This study attempts to (1) explore the impact of temperature changes and outdoor activity duration on hostility, (2) evaluate residents' emotional health risk levels affected by high temperature, and (3) provide a theoretical basis for the early warning mechanism of emotional health risk and the planning of healthy cities.","misc","wim","misc"

In the present paper, the results of studying ML techniques in a tuberculosis diagnosis loop in a scenario of limited resources are presented. Data are analyzed using a tuberculosis (TB) therapy program at a health institution in a main city of a developing country using five ML models. Logistic regression, classification trees, random forest, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks are trained under physician supervision following physicians' typical daily work. The models are trained on seven main variables collected when patients arrive at the facility. Additionally, the variables applied to train the models are analyzed, and the models' advantages and limitations are discussed in the context of the automated ML techniques. The results show that artificial neural networks obtain the best results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the receiver operating curve. These results represent an improvement over smear microscopy, which is commonly used techniques to detect TB for special cases. Findings demonstrate that ML in the TB diagnosis loop can be reinforced with available data to serve as an alternative diagnosis tool based on data processing in places where the health infrastructure is limited.","misc","wim","misc"

Fragile settings both exacerbate the risk of NCDs and undermine systems capacity. Lebanon is a setting where strategies to address rising NCDs burden have faced particularly acute contextual challenges. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with patients accessing non-communicable disease across 11 primary care centers within the Greater Beirut and Beqaa areas. Response were received from 1,700 patients. We generated a Clinical Management Index Score as a measure of quality of care, and scores related to a range of socio-demographic characteristics and other context specific variables. Significantly higher clinical management index scores (better quality of care) were associated with patients living in the semi-urban/rural context of Beqaa (compared to Greater Beirut), having health insurance coverage, aged above 60, having high levels of educational attainment, and making partial or full payment for their treatment. Relatively lower index scores (poorer quality of care) were associated with Syrian nationality (compared to Lebanese) and with patients suffering from diabetes or hypertension (compared to comorbid patients). The study identified a wide margin for improving quality of NCDs care in fragile contexts with particular gaps identified in referral to ophthalmology, accessing all prescribed medication and receiving counseling for smoking cessation. Additionally, findings indicate a number of predictors of comparatively poor quality of care that warrant attention, notably with regard to Syrian nationality/legal status, lack of health coverage, seeking free health provision and lower educational attachment. Although these are all relevant risk factors, the findings call on donor agencies, NGOs and provider institutions to design targeted programs and activities that especially ensure equitable delivery of services to diabetic and hypertensive patients with compounded vulnerability as a result of a number of these factors.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

However, it neither provides information about the functional status of spermatozoa nor addresses disorders such as idiopathic or unexplained infertility (UI). Recently, assessment of sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) has been proposed as an extended sperm test that may help overcome these inherent limitations of basic SA. In this review, we aim to: (I) discuss the pathophysiological aspects of SDF, including natural repair mechanisms, causes, and impact on reproductive outcomes; (II) explain different assessment tools of SDF, and describe potential therapeutic options to manage infertile men with high SDF; and (III) analyse the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of current research on the topic. This review was constructed from original studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses that were published over the years up until August 2021, related to the various aspects of SDF. Different mechanisms lead to high SDF, including defective chromatin packaging, apoptosis, and seminal oxidative stress. The relevance of sperm DNA integrity to male fertility/infertility has been supported by the frequent observation of high levels of SDF in infertile men, and in association with risk factors for infertility. Additionally, high SDF levels have been inversely correlated with the outcomes of natural pregnancy and assisted reproduction. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling, sperm chromatin structure assay, sperm chromatin dispersion, and Comet assay are four commonly used assays for measurement of SDF. Addressing lifestyle risks and underlying conditions, antioxidants, hormonal therapy, and advanced sperm selection techniques have all been proposed as potential therapeutic options to lower SDF. The sum of literature provides evidence of detrimental effects of high SDF on both natural and assisted fertility outcomes. Standardization of the techniques used for assessment of SDF and their incorporation into the work up of infertile couples may have significant implications on the future management of a selected category of infertile men with high SDF.","misc","wim","systematic_review"

This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide (GLP) on DMED. DMED was induced in the experimental rats [male 12-week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats] by treatment with streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) and apomorphine (APO). Next, rats in the GLP low dose (GLP-L)/GLP high dose (GLP-H) groups were treated with GLP (100 or 400 mg/kg/d, respectively) for 8 weeks. Subsequently, erectile function was assessed by APO and electrostimulation of the cavernous nerve (CN). Serum or penile testosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) contents were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of oxidative stress indicators in the corpus cavernosum (CC) were measured by corresponding kits, and histological changes in the CC were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson staining. Additionally, the apoptosis index, caspase-3, caspase-9, and eNOS expression, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were also detected. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot assays were conducted to determine the NOS, TGF-β1 mRNA expression, ERK1/2, eNOS, JNK phosphorylation, and arginase II protein expression. The erectile function test revealed that erectile dysfunction (ED) was alleviated in the DMED rats following treatment with GLP. Moreover, GLP upregulated the T and cGMP content, improved the oxidative stress and histological injuries of CC, and also inhibited the apoptosis and MMP loss of penile tissues in DMED rats. Furthermore, GLP treatment enhanced the mRNA expression of NOS and TGF-β1 and suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, eNOS, and JNK, as well as the protein expression of arginase II in DMED rats. GLP ameliorated DMED by repairing the CC pathological damage and upregulating NOS expression and ERK/JNK phosphorylation, indicating that GLP may be a candidate drug for DMED therapy.","rodent","wim","rodent"

The body weights of the AD rats were observed to assess the effect of JDYZF. The 16S rRNA sequencing technique was used to study the regulation of the gut microbiota by JDYZF in AD rats. Immunohistochemical staining was used to observe the expression levels of Caspase-1 and Caspase-11 in the hippocampus. JDYZF reduced body weight in AD rats, and this effect may be related to JDYZF regulating body-weight-related gut microbes. The 16S rRNA analysis showed that JDYZF increased the diversity of the gut microbiota in AD rats. At the phylum level, JDYZF increased the abundances of Bacteroidota and Actinobacteriota and decreased the abundances of Firmicutes, Campilobacterota, and Desulfobacterota. At the genus level, the abundances of Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, and Blautia were increased and the abundances of Lachnospiraceae-NK4A136-group, Anaerobiospirillum, Turicibacter, Oscillibacter, Desulfovibrio, Helicobacter, and Intestinimonas were decreased. At the species level, the abundances of Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus faecis were increased and the abundances of Helicobacter rodentium and Ruminococcus_sp_N15.MGS-57 were decreased. Immunohistochemistry showed that JDYZF reduced the levels of Caspase-1- and Caspase-11-positive staining. JDYZF has a regulatory effect on the gut microbiota of AD rats, which may represent the basis for the anti-inflammatory effect of JDYZF.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"445",35958911,"Exploration of Potential Biomarkers and Immune Landscape for Hepatoblastoma: Evidence from Machine Learning Algorithm.","This study aimed to investigate the immune landscape in hepatoblastoma (HB) based on deconvolution methods and identify a biomarkers panel for diagnosis based on a machine learning algorithm. Firstly, we identified 277 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentiated and functionally identified the modules in DEGs. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis and GO (gene ontology) were used to annotate these DEGs, and the results suggested that the occurrence of HB was related to DNA adducts, bile secretion, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. We selected the top 10 genes for our final diagnostic panel based on the random forest tree method. Interestingly, TNFRSF19 and TOP2A were significantly down-regulated in normal samples, while other genes (TRIB1, MAT1A, SAA2-SAA4, NAT2, HABP2, CYP2CB, APOF, and CFHR3) were significantly down-regulated in HB samples. Finally, we constructed a neural network model based on the above hub genes for diagnosis. After cross-validation, the area under the ROC curve was close to 1 (AUC = 0.972), and the AUC of the validation set was 0.870. In addition, the results of single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and deconvolution methods revealed a more active immune responses in the HB tissue. In conclusion, we have developed a robust biomarkers panel for HB patients.","misc","wim","misc"

We searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, CNKI, and VIP databases according to specific search strategies. The data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3 software. Thirteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comprising 882 patients with OSAHS were selected. Compared to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the phlegm-resolving method of TCM combined with CPAP significantly more effectively improved the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and lowest oxygen saturation (LSaO2). While the treatment effect was better for a treatment duration of >6 weeks compared to that at ≤6 weeks, the difference was not statistically significant. Compared to health guidance alone, the combination of the phlegm-resolving method in TCM with health guidance showed significantly better efficacy in improving AHI, ESS, and LSaO2. In terms of reducing ESS and increasing LSaO2, the effect was better for treatment courses >6 weeks. When the AHI was reduced, a duration of ≤6 weeks showed more advantages; however, the difference was not significant. Only one study reported mild nausea in one participant in the treatment group at the initial stage of treatment; the remaining studies did not mention any side effects. Both the resolving phlegm method of TCM combined with CPAP and the resolving phlegm method of TCM combined with health guidance were more effective in improving AHI, LSaO2, and ESS compared to the control group.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

A total of 75 patients suffering from EFIF receiving intramedullary fixation were retrospectively collected. According to intramedullary fixation methods, the patients were separated into InterTanIN group and PFNA group. Parameters including the surgery time, blood loss, number of X-ray fluoroscopy, hospital stays, bone-healing time, postoperative Harris hip score (HIS) (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months), and complications were collected and analyzed. The results showed surgery time, blood loss, and number of X-ray fluoroscopy in InterTanIN group were higher than those in PFNA group (P < 0.05). The mean hospital stay in the InterTanIN group was comparable to that in the PFNA group (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in bone-healing time between the InterTanIN group and PFNA group (P > 0.05). The postoperative HIS of InterTanIN group was statistically better than PFNA group at the 3rd month and the 6th month (P < 0.05). With the extension of recovery time, the gap between the two groups gradually narrowed. The postoperative implant displacement happened more often in the PFNA group than in the InterTanIN group. EFIF treated with InterTanIN or PFNA could achieve good long-term efficacy. Although InterTanIN has the disadvantages of increased operative time, blood loss, and radiation exposure compared to PFNA, the postoperative hip function recovery of InterTanIN seems to be more reliable and stable than PFNA.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Huoxiang Zhengqi Dropping Pills (HZPD) is a modern preparation of Huoxiang Zhengqi and widely used to prevent HS. The present study aims to explore the protective effect of HZDP on intestinal injury during heatstroke and analyze its potential pharmacodynamic basis. Male rats in the control and HS groups were given normal saline, and those in the HZDP groups were given HZDP (0.23, 0.46, and 0.92 g/kg) before induction of HS. Serum contents of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (iFABP), and diamine oxidase (DAO) were determined using ELISA. Histopathology of intestinal injury was observed following H&E staining. The expression of claudin-3 was determined using western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence techniques. Moreover, network pharmacological tools were used to analyze the potential pharmacodynamic basis and the mechanism of HZDP. Treatment with HZDP significantly prolonged the time to reach Tc. Compared with the control group, the contents of TNF-α, IL-6, iFABP, and DAO in HS rats increased markedly. HZDP treatments reduced these levels significantly, and the effects in the middle dose group (0.46 g/kg) were most obvious. HZDP also attenuated intestinal injury and significantly reversed the decrease in claudin-3 expression. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that 35 active ingredients and 128 target genes of HZDP were screened from TCMSP and 93 target genes intersected with heatstroke target genes, which were considered potential therapeutic targets. TNF-α and IL-6 were the main inflammatory target genes of HZDP correlated with HS. These results indicated that HZDP effectively protected intestinal barrier function and prevented acute intestinal injury by increasing the expression of claudin-3 in rats, eventually improving heat resistance.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Totally 100 patients who were clinically diagnosed with lung cancer from January 2018 to December 2020 were enrolled in our study. They were assigned into two groups according to the presence of lymph node metastasis. The VASP levels were measured by flow cytometry. The correlation between the expression of VASP in tumor tissue and the clinical characteristics and prognosis in patients was analyzed. The diagnostic efficacy of plasma VASP with squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA21-1), prosecretin-releasing peptide (proGRP), and lung cancer was analyzed. The results were compared with APACHE III score to evaluate the accuracy of VASP in determining the severity of patients. This paper finds that the value of VASP in the non-lymph node metastasis group was significantly higher than that in the healthy control group, and the VASP level in the lymph node metastasis group was significantly higher than that in the non-lymph node metastasis group and the healthy control group (all p values <0.05). The APACHE III score of the lymph node metastasis group was higher than that of the non-lymph node metastasis group (p value <0.05). The diagnostic efficacy of VASP is similar to that of SCC, NSE, CYFRA21-1, and proGRP. The plasma VASP value was statistically different in the survival group and the death group, with higher level observed in the death group compared to survival group (all p values <0.05). The value of plasma VASP alone and acute physiology and chronic health evaluations III (APACHE III) score for lung cancer mortality was similar (47.06% vs. 52.94%, p value >0.05). Similar accuracy was observed in VASP and APACHE III score in predicting mortality of lung cancer (84.37% vs. 85.77%, p value>0.05). This paper concludes that the level of VASP correlates to the severity of the lung cancer and survival of the patients.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Platinum resistance was identified by chemotherapy regimen or provider definition. Data was extracted evaluating treatment regimens, time to progression, PC and hospice referrals, and survival. Descriptive statistics and survival analyses were performed. We identified 258 patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Median survival from diagnosis of platinum resistance was 15 months (range 0-161). Most (71 %) patients were referred to PC, with 43 % of referrals within 3 months of death. Fourteen percent of patients were referred directly to hospice without PC involvement. Of 46 patients living with platinum resistant disease, 93 % meet criteria for early PC referral, but less than half have seen PC. Median time from platinum resistance to PC referral was 9 months (range 0-157) and from PC referral to death was 3 months (range 0-110). Median time from platinum resistance to hospice referral was 7 months (range 1-57) and from hospice referral to death was < 1 month (range 0-12). While rates of PC referral in our cohort are high compared with other single institution cohorts, timing of PC referral suggests referral patterns that are reactive to clinical decline rather than proactive as per national recommendations. A significant percentage of patients are directly referred to hospice for end-of-life care, reflecting missed opportunity for concurrent PC and oncology care earlier in the disease course.

To investigate the possible effect of misoprostol on the elimination of endometrial polyps. In this clinical trial we examined 30 infertile women whose endometrial polyps were confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound with saline injection. All women were administered 400 mg of misoprostol: 200 mg orally and 200 vaginally. 8 hr later, sonography with saline injection was performed again and all women were examined for the presence or absence of endometrial polyps. Finally, the diagnosis was confirmed for all women using hysteroscopy. The main outcome of this study was the elimination of endometrial polyps after misoprostol administration. The average size of the endometrial polyps was 14.33 ± 4.26 mm, with a range of 7-22 mm. After misoprostol administration, in 12 out of the 30 women who had shown endometrial polyps in the initial examination, no polyp was found. At follow-up it was found that the smallest endometrial polyp that had been eliminated was 8 mm and the largest was 22 mm. The findings of our study revealed that misoprostol can remove up to 40% of endometrial polyps.

Revision rates were highest in the femur replacement treatment group with 9 (32.1%) patients needing at least one reoperation surgery for any reason. Overall, hardware failure and non-unions were the most reported complications in treatment of IFFs. Postoperative functional outcome scores were available for 242 patients. Harris Hip Scores for the plate, revision, replacement, nail/rod, and plate + revision groups were 76.84, 77.14, 69.9, 77, and 78.4, respectively. Each treatment method should be carefully considered by the surgeon depending on the patient. Locking plate was the most common method for the treatment of the patients with IFFs. Half of them combined with cerclage wires/cables. Around two thirds' patients could achieve union with the fastest mean healing time around 4.69 months. Other less common methods included prosthetic revision, femur replacement, nail/rod, external fixator, etc. A small number of patients treated with Ilizarov external fixator, and it has proven to be a viable option with few complications and high union rates.","systematic_review","wim","systematic_review"

In a conventional dFNC pipeline, a clustering stage to summarize the connectivity patterns that are transiently but reliably realized over the course of a scanning session. However, identifying the right number of clusters (or states) through a conventional clustering criterion computed by running the algorithm repeatedly over a large range of cluster numbers is time-consuming and requires substantial computational power even for typical dFNC datasets, and the computational demands become prohibitive as datasets become larger and scans longer. Here we developed a new dFNC pipeline based on a two-step clustering approach to analyze large dFNC data without having access to huge computational power. In the proposed dFNC pipeline, we implement two-step clustering. In the first step, we randomly use a sub-sample dFNC data and identify several sets of states at different model orders. In the second step, we aggregate all dFNC states estimated from all iterations in the first step and use this to identify the optimum number of clusters using the elbow criteria. Additionally, we use this new reduced dataset and estimate a final set of states by performing a second kmeans clustering on the aggregated dFNC states from the first k-means clustering. To validate the reproducibility of results in the new pipeline, we analyzed four dFNC datasets from the human connectome project (HCP). We found that both conventional and proposed dFNC pipelines generate similar brain dFNC states across all four sessions with more than 99% similarity. We found that the conventional dFNC pipeline evaluates the clustering order and finds the final dFNC state in 275 min, while this process takes only 11 min for the proposed dFNC pipeline. In other words, the new pipeline is 25 times faster than the traditional method in finding the optimum number of clusters and finding the final dFNC states. We also found that the new method results in better clustering quality than the conventional approach (p < 0.001). We show that the results are replicated across four different datasets from HCP. We developed a new analytic pipeline that facilitates the analysis of large dFNC datasets without having access to a huge computational power source. We validated the reproducibility of the result across multiple datasets.","misc","wim","misc"
"464",35958984,"The neurobiology of misophonia and implications for novel, neuroscience-driven interventions.","Decreased tolerance in response to specific every-day sounds (misophonia) is a serious, debilitating disorder that is gaining rapid recognition within the mental health community. Emerging research findings suggest that misophonia may have a unique neural signature. Specifically, when examining responses to misophonic trigger sounds, differences emerge at a physiological and neural level from potentially overlapping psychopathologies. While these findings are preliminary and in need of replication, they support the hypothesis that misophonia is a unique disorder. In this theoretical paper, we begin by reviewing the candidate networks that may be at play in this complex disorder (e.g., regulatory, sensory, and auditory). We then summarize current neuroimaging findings in misophonia and present areas of overlap and divergence from other mental health disorders that are hypothesized to co-occur with misophonia (e.g., obsessive compulsive disorder). Future studies needed to further our understanding of the neuroscience of misophonia will also be discussed. Next, we introduce the potential of neurostimulation as a tool to treat neural dysfunction in misophonia. We describe how neurostimulation research has led to novel interventions in psychiatric disorders, targeting regions that may also be relevant to misophonia. The paper is concluded by presenting several options for how neurostimulation interventions for misophonia could be crafted.","misc","wim","misc"

The precise and simplistic approach such as the correlation of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) parameters, Resting Motor Threshold (RMT) and Motor Evoked Potential (MEP), in patients with stroke might play a critical role, given the prognostic value of MEP, a measure of cortical excitability, and might be the key point in prescribing appropriate therapeutic strategies. The study aimed to determine the correlation of FMA-based impairment in the upper extremity function specifically of the wrist and hand with respect to the neurophysiological parameters of corticospinal tract integrity. The Institutional Review Board approved the study and 67 (n) patients with stroke were enrolled in the Department of Neurology, AIIMS, New Delhi, India. The motor assessment was performed on patients by the upper extremity subset of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and the clinical history was obtained. RMT and MEP of Extensor Digitorum Communis (EDC) muscle were measured via TMS. A significant positive correlation was observed between Fugl-Meyer Assessment Wrist/Hand (FMA W/H) and MEP scores (r = 0.560, <0.001). Also, Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA UE) scores demonstrated a moderate positive association with MEP responsiveness (r = 0.421, <0.001). MEP of the EDC muscle was found to be associated with sensorimotor control as measured by FMA. Moreover, FMA W/H score values might be a better prognostic indicator of EDC MEP responsiveness. Interestingly, a novel element comprising the range of FMA UE and FMA W/H components was observed to be a potential indicator of MEP responsiveness and could also indicate establishing FMA as a surrogate for TMS in resource-limited settings for prognostification.","misc","wim","human_intervention"
"466",35958988,"Temporal Cortex Microarray Analysis Revealed Impaired Ribosomal Biogenesis and Hyperactivity of the Glutamatergic System: An Early Signature of Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease.","Pathogenic aging is regarded as asymptomatic AD when there is no cognitive deficit except for neuropathology consistent with Alzheimer's disease. These individuals are highly susceptible to developing AD. Braak and Braak's theory specific to tau pathology illustrates that the brain's temporal cortex region is an initiation site for early AD progression. So, the hub gene analysis of this region may reveal early altered biological cascades that may be helpful to alleviate AD in an early stage. Meanwhile, cognitive processing also drags its attention because cognitive impairment is the ultimate result of AD. Therefore, this study aimed to explore changes in gene expression of aged control, asymptomatic AD (AsymAD), and symptomatic AD (symAD) in the temporal cortex region. We used microarray data sets to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the help of the R programming interface. Further, we constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by performing the STRING plugin in Cytoscape and determined the hub genes via the CytoHubba plugin. Furthermore, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis via Bioconductor's cluster profile package. Resultant, the AsymAD transcriptome revealed the early-stage changes of glutamatergic hyperexcitability. Whereas the connectivity of major hub genes in this network indicates a shift from initially reduced rRNA biosynthesis in the AsymAD group to impaired protein synthesis in the symAD group. Both share the phenomenon of breaking tight junctions and others. In conclusion, this study offers new understandings of the early biological vicissitudes that occur in the brain before the manifestation of symAD and gives new promising therapeutic targets for early AD intervention.","misc","wim","misc"

A local processing bias has been assumed to underlie such superior performance patterns. The aim of the current study is to investigate whether processing preferences can be modified by procedural priming. The current study used a procedural priming task (Navon figures) to induce more local or global processing in 25 autistic and 21 typically developing (TD) control participants, using hierarchical figures preceding the figure-disembedding task. Participants with ASD outperformed non-autistic individuals in the unprimed baseline task version. The performance was not modulated by priming in either direction (toward a local or global processing style) in both groups. However, the performance of TD control participants was improved by training to the same level as that observed in the ASD group. Figure-disembedding performance in ASD is superior to that in TD control participants and robust against procedural priming or training. In contrast, performance in the TD control group can be improved up to the level of the ASD group. Any studies reporting superiority in individuals with ASD in figure-disembedding should consider training effects when evaluating group differences.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Game designers and researchers suggest that games whose challenges match player skills afford engaging experiences of achievement, competence, or effectance-of doing well. Yet, current models struggle to explain why such balanced challenges best afford these experiences and do not straightforwardly account for the appeal of high- and low-challenge game genres like Idle and Soulslike games. In this article, we show that Predictive Processing (PP) provides a coherent formal cognitive framework which can explain the fun in tackling game challenges with uncertain success as the dynamic process of reducing uncertainty surprisingly efficiently. In gameplay as elsewhere, people enjoy doing better than expected, which can track learning progress. In different forms, balanced, Idle, and Soulslike games alike afford regular accelerations of uncertainty reduction. We argue that this model also aligns with a popular practitioner model, Raph Koster's Theory of Fun for Game Design, and can unify currently differentially modelled gameplay motives around competence and curiosity.","misc","wim","misc"

Banks' sales of financial products have become a new economic profit growth point for major banks. Based on consumers' psychological perception, the influencing factors of consumers' behavior in purchasing bank financial products are studied. The influencing factor model path of consumer purchase behavior is constructed to find out the factors affecting consumers' purchase of bank financial products and formulate appropriate promotion strategies according to the influencing factors. Through the research methods of literature analysis, small-scale in-depth interview, questionnaire surveys, and statistical analysis, this exploration selects four variables: independent variable, mediator, control variable, and dependent variable. They are influencing factors of purchasing bank financial products (perceived convenience, risk value of bank financial products, satisfaction of purchasing communication process), consumers' willingness to buy bank financial products, consumers' personal characteristics and consumers' behavior of purchasing bank financial products. Meanwhile, based on 196 valid questionnaires, regression analysis is carried out through a regression model. The results show that the three influencing factors of consumers' purchase of bank financial products-perceived convenience, risk value of bank financial products, and satisfaction with the purchase communication process significantly impact consumers' purchase of bank financial products. They can put forward specific promotion suggestions for banks. This exploration aims to study the optimization of bank financial product promotion strategy from the perspective of consumer psychological perception to provide a reference for subsequent related research.","misc","wim","misc"

This qualitative study attempts to categorize students' effort in rubric use and identify personal differences and contextual factors influencing the effort in the EFL classroom assessment environment. A total of 79 students at a Chinese university participated in the study. The data collected included their classroom oral presentation results and nine case study informants' retrospective interviews on their processes of rubric use. Focuses were drawn upon students' perceptions and practices of rubric use throughout the task process. Totally, three types of effort patterns emerged in light of students' self-ratings and descriptions of the use. The intense kind held firm trust in rubric utility and thus utilized the rubric to develop the targeted competence throughout the whole process. The medium type either selectively followed the rubric in optional phases of the process due to their judgments of the rubric and the task. The loose type was least responsive to the rubric since their actions seemed largely affected by their self-efficacy and prior experience. Results showed that students' effort in rubric use in classroom assessment was the outcome of cognitive appraisals of a rubric, students themselves, and a task. The study highlights trait motivation and task motivation in the effectiveness of rubric use in assessment practices. Implications on rubric employment and task design are drawn to tap students' motivation for rubric use to achieve assessment for learning.","misc","wim","misc"

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between independent observers' ratings and practitioners' self-reported treatment integrity ratings of Motivational interviewing (MI). Practitioners (N = 134) were randomized to two types of supervision [i.e., regular institutional group supervision, or individual telephone supervision based on the MI Treatment Integrity (MITI) code]. The mean age was 43.2 years (SD = 10.2), and 62.7 percent were females. All sessions were recorded and evaluated with the MITI, and the MI skills were self-assessed with a questionnaire over a period of 12 months. The associations between self-reported and objectively assessed MI skills were overall weak, but increased slightly from baseline to the 12-months assessment. However, the self-ratings from the group that received monthly objective feedback were not more accurate than those participating in regular group supervision. These results expand findings from previous studies and have important implications for assessment of practitioners' treatment fidelity: Practitioners may learn to improve the accuracy of self-assessment of competence, but to ensure that patients receive intended care, adherence and competence should be assessed objectively.","misc","wim","randomized_trial"

Face-to-face meetings are so rich because many ways of communicating (spoken language and nonverbal cues) are available to support mutual understanding. With the progress of digitization and driven by the need to reduce personal contact during the global pandemic, many face-to-face work meetings have been shifted to videoconferences. With webcams turned on, video calls come closest to the richness of face-to-face meetings. However, webcam use often remains voluntary, and some participants choose not to turn their cameras on. In order to find ways to support webcam use-when desired-we analyzed how social norms in groups affect the decision to activate a webcam in a specific meeting. Based on an online survey with N = 333 participants, we found that social norms are related to an individual's decision to turn on the webcam, even when controlling for group size. If the number of participants with activated webcams in a university meeting increased by 25%, it was 5.92 times more likely that an individual decided to turn their webcam on, too. Furthermore, 81.84% of respondents indicated they would turn on their webcam if participants in a meeting were explicitly asked to do so. The results demonstrate a strong relation between social norms and the decision to activate a webcam in online meetings. They build a basis for enhancing webcam use and enable a greater richness of communication in online meetings.","misc","wim","misc"

Although research is increasing in misophonia, a cross-cultural validation of a psychometric tool for measuring misophonia has not been evaluated. This study investigated the validity of the S-Five multidimensional model of the misophonic experience in a sample of Chinese participants. The S-Five was translated in a forward-backward method to Mandarin to establish a satisfactory translation. The translation was also independently back translated to English, with no significant differences when compared to the original S-Five. Through exploratory factor analysis, using responses from 256 Chinese individuals, the five dimensions (internalising appraisals, externalising appraisals, perceived threat and avoidance behaviour, outbursts, and impact on functioning) were replicated, indicating the cross-cultural uniformity of the experience of misophonia as captured by the S-Five. That is, current results point to the stability of the manifestation of misophonia across cultures, seen here for the first time in the literature. By design, the S-Five items were developed to reflect sound sensitivities in a manner that is not specific or matching to individuals of a certain age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, socio-economic status, and educational level. Testimonial to this fact is not only the replication of the five factors, but also the replication of the evidence towards satisfactory psychometric properties (reliability and validity) of the scale. Based on the results of this study, the S-Five is a psychometrically robust tool to be used within the Chinese population.","misc","wim","misc"
"475",35959034,"The Analysis of Teachers' Perceptions of Moral Education Curriculum.","With the development of teachers' psychological cognition, the moral education curriculum develops as per the changes in times. Currently, a resurgence of interest on studying teachers' perceptions of the moral education curriculum has observed. This is because moral education curriculum of each country plays a unique role in the overall design of the country's education curriculum. However, studies on teachers' perceptions of the moral education curriculum are scarce, and no framework has been developed to guide the teaching and learning of teachers for the moral education curriculum for schools. The moral education curriculum serves as one of the main vehicles for value education, with teachers as direct executors. It can influence the overall development of the school system and long-term development of a country. Thus, in this paper, we reviewed current literature related to teachers' perceptions of the moral education curriculum and developed future trends considering teachers' perceptions of the moral education curriculum in improving existing moral education programs in a country. We identified a list of keywords related to moral education curriculum and teacher perceptions and relevant to the scope of this study. These keywords were used to search the articles from the Scopus and WoS studies. Overall, 32 papers meeting the search criteria were retrieved. Further, we conducted thematic studies, and four themes were successfully identified: the model of teacher perceptions of moral and national education, the dimensions of the teacher ethics model (framework), teaching strategies, and the role of teachers. The results of this study suggested a new framework for research trends in teachers' perception models, particularly toward the moral education curriculum. This study contributed to the knowledge regarding teaching and learning approaches of moral education considering teachers' perceptions of the moral education curriculum.

An organizational context of the immigration officer is explored by using the data collected from a survey of 453 immigration officers from 26 immigration officer teams in Taiwan. This study has verified the transformational leadership and organizational commitment that they have positive effect on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) of the immigration officers. Moreover, it showed that the organizational climate has a context effect on organizational commitment and OCB. Furthermore, the results of this study have shown that an aggregated transformational leadership has cross-level interactions on OCB. This study also found that the transformational leadership has strong effect on organizational commitment and OCB. This study adopts a cross-level study taking organizational environmental factors and cross-level interactions as research considerations. Because of the focus on group-level impact, the research methodology can apply the supervisor's leadership style and the organizational climate to measure whether the immigration officers have a high degree of organizational commitment and influence their OCB performance across levels. The organizational commitment of the immigration officers and their individual OCB performance could be improved by converging the organizational context effect of aggregated transformational leadership and organizational climate.

Questions about its value remain understudied, however. The inclusive approach is rooted in positive psychology and focuses on recognizing each employee's individual talents and assessing whether they fit the long-term needs of the organization, since a fit is assumed to be associated with employees' wellbeing. In the present study, we test this assumption focusing specifically on a key talent management practice, talent identification, and the social dimension of employee wellbeing. Data were collected through an employee survey conducted within the Finnish units of four international manufacturing organizations and analyzed using logistic regression (n = 618). We found that the recognition of individual talents for long-term deployment by the organization is positively associated with social wellbeing in terms of supervisor support and social climate in the work unit, as perceived by the employees. Our results tentatively suggest that inclusive talent management creates value through the identification of employees' individual talents as this practice can be associated with their enhanced wellbeing.","misc","wim","misc"

While participants with little knowledge of Jyutping showed a previously reported left-ear advantage (LEA), those with a good level of Jyutping expertise exhibited either a right-ear advantage or bilateral processing during lexical tone identification and contour tone discrimination, respectively. As for the effect of linguistic-processing demand, while an LEA was found in acoustic/phonetic perception situations, this advantage disappeared and was replaced by a bilateral pattern in conditions that involved a greater extent of linguistic processing, suggesting an increased involvement of the left hemisphere. Regarding the effect of tone type, both groups showed an LEA in level tone discrimination, but only the Jyutping group demonstrated a bilateral pattern in contour tone discrimination. Overall, knowledge of written codes of tones, greater degree of linguistic processing and contour tone processing seem to influence the brain lateralization of lexical tone processing in native listeners of Cantonese by increasing the recruitment of the left-hemisphere language network.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

This study retrospectively analyzed 92 patients who underwent FOB, which was divided into the SPT group and usual-care group based on whether patients were given SPT interventions or not. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were used to determine the severity of depression and anxiety, as well as the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36) to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Moreover, the patients' satisfaction was assessed based on the Likert 5-Point Scale. The baseline status of anxiety, depression, and HRQoL in patients was similar in the SPT group and the usual-care group with no significant difference. Both PHQ-9 score and HADS-D score in the SPT group after intervention were lower than that in the usual-care group, accompanied by the deceased HADS-A subscale. Moreover, the improved HRQoL was found in the patients undergoing FOB after SPT interventions as compared to those receiving conventional nursing care using the SF-36 score. Additionally, the patient satisfaction in the SPT group was higher than in the usual-care group.

Transdiagnostic factors such as personality functioning are thought to be involved in determining mental health outcomes. The present study focused on two constructs of personality functioning, Criterion A of the Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD, DSM-5) and mentalization, as predictors of depressive symptoms and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. A second focus of the study was to examine whether this relationship was mediated by resilience. Linear regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between personality functioning measured by Criterion A (AMPD, DSM-5) and mentalizing abilities as predictors, and depression and life satisfaction as mental health outcomes. To assess the hypothesis that this relationship is mediated by resilience a structural equation modeling approach was conducted. Data from N = 316 individuals from the general population were collected. Linear regression models revealed highly significant associations between Criterion A/mentalization and both outcome measures. Structural equation models showed a significant partial mediation by resilience of these relationships. Our results support the hypothesis that mentalizing serves as a protective function by promoting resilience to the impact of stress and threats. Criterion A and mentalization performed similarly as predictors of mental health outcomes, providing empirically overlapping operationalizations of personality functioning. This finding emphasizes the importance of personality functioning in positive and negative mental health outcomes. Furthermore, our results are consistent with a mediating role of resilience.","misc","wim","misc"

In particular, Kazakh clothing in Northwestern China has become the focus of today's traditional national culture. Kazakh, located at the intersection of the Silk Road, has an important position. The traditional clothing made by various social factors reflects the style and identity integration throughout history in cultures along the Silk Road, taking women's clothing as an example. Kazakh women are good at crafts, which is reflected in their strong grit. They gradually changed their role and traditional values, which has guided their social role.

A series of empirical literatures have also examined a significant positive correlation between the two. But these results only demonstrate the relationship between the input of 'diversity' and the output of 'firm performance'. Such research is more of a black box because board diversity must act on certain strategies or decisions to affect firm performance. Some scholars try theoretical analysis with the purpose of opening the black box. In order to verify the relevant theoretical analysis results, this study uses the mediating effect analysis model in the field of psychology, through multiple regression, impulse analysis, variance decomposition and other methods, to thus empirically test the mediating effect of technological innovation in the process of board diversification promoting corporate performance. We found that board diversity can improve firm performance by enhancing the level of technological innovation. Among them, technological innovation has played a complete mediating role in the diversity of board members' functional and occupational background, and played a partial mediating role in the diversification of directors' part-time jobs. Technological innovation is a key indicator bridging board diversity and firm performance. This study can explore and explain the inner workings of the significant relationship between board diversity and firm performance, and link research findings on similar phenomena. The research results may make the existing board governance theories more systematic, expand the extension of theoretical research, and provide some empirical research references for academics and practitioners.","misc","wim","misc"

In this study, the research model was analyzed through multilevel analysis to contribute to the literature on the mechanism by which CSR affects employees' job attitudes and perceptions of CSR authenticity. First, hypothesis testing confirmed that external CSR is positively associated with employees' perceptions of CSR authenticity. Second, CSR authenticity mediates a positive relationship between external CSR and emotional commitment. As the direct effect of external CSR on emotional commitment was not statistically significant, it could be confirmed that the full mediation relationship was significant through CSR authenticity. This study makes three theoretical contributions to the literature on employees' perceptions of CSR. First, it examines the mechanism of the impact of CSR on employees. By examining the mechanism by which employees recognize and interpret CSR, this study attempts to uncover the black box that CSR affects employees. Second, this study contributes to the literature on CSR authenticity by explaining the mediating role of CSR authenticity in the relationship between CSR and employee job attitudes through construal level theory. Finally, this study contributes to the employee-based CSR literature by analyzing the effect of CSR as an organizational-level variable on emotional commitment as an individual-level variable through multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM).","misc","wim","misc"
"486",35959077,"Logometro®: The psychometric properties of a norm-referenced digital battery for language assessment of Greek-speaking 4-7 years old children.","In educational and clinical settings, few norm-referenced tests have been utilized until now usually focusing on a single or a few language subcomponents, along with very few language rating scales for parents and educators. The need for a comprehensive language assessment tool for preschool and early school years children which could form the basis for valid and reliable screening and diagnostic decisions, led to the development of a new norm-referenced digital tool called Logometro®. The aim of the present study is to describe Logometro® as well as its psychometric characteristics. Logometro® evaluates an array of oral language skills across the different language domains such as phonological awareness, listening comprehension, vocabulary knowledge (receptive and expressive), narrative speech, morphological awareness, pragmatics, as well emergent literacy skills (letter sound knowledge and invented writing) in Greek-speaking 4-7 years old children. More specifically, Logometro® has been designed in order to: (a) map individual language development paths as well as difficulties, (b) provide a descriptive profile of children's oral language and emergent literacy skills, and (c) assist in the identification of children who are at risk for Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) or Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD). The sample consisted of 926 children aged from 4 to 7 years, which were recruited from diverse geographical provinces and represented a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds in Greece. Eight hundred participants were typically developing children (N boys = 384 and N girls = 416), 126 children (N SLI = 44 and N SLD = 82) represented children with Special Educational Needs, and 126 children were typically developing peers matched for gender and age with the clinical groups. The administration lasted 90 min, depending on the participant's age and competence. Validity (construct, criterion, convergent, discriminant, and predictive) as well as internal consistency and test-retest reliability were assessed. Results indicated that Logometro® is characterized by good psychometric properties and can constitute a norm-referenced battery of oral language and emergent literacy skills. It could be used to inform the professionals as well as the researchers about a child's language strengths and weaknesses and form the basis on which they can design an appropriate individualized intervention if needed.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Collective narratives in this context contribute to coping with challenges societies face, but also fuel conflict continuation. We introduce the Informative Process Model (IPM), proposing that informing individuals about the socio-psychological processes through which conflict-supporting narratives develop, and suggesting that they can change via comparison to similar conflicts resolved peacefully, can facilitate unfreezing and change in attitudes. Study 1 established associations between awareness of conflict costs and conflict-supporting narratives, belief in the possibility of resolving the conflict peacefully and support for pursuing peace among Israeli-Jews and Palestinians. Studies 2 and 3 found that exposure to IPM-based original videos (vs. control) led Israeli-Jews to deliberation of the information presented, predicting acceptance of the IPM-based message, which, in turn, predicted support for negotiations. Study 3 also found similar effects across IPM-based messages focusing on different conflict-supporting themes. We discuss the implications to attitude change in intractable conflicts.","misc","wim","misc"

We present a unique case of this gas-forming infection in a man with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with empagliflozin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of EC associated with the use of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i). A 62-year-old man with T2DM treated with an SGLT2i developed EC. His moderately controlled T2DM was treated for over 20 years with metformin, saxagliptin/metformin, and pioglitazone to which empagliflozin was added due to his consistently elevated hemoglobin A1c level, slightly reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria. Four months after initiation of the SGLT2i, he reported lower urinary tract symptoms and was found to have EC radiographically. His urine cultures were positive for Klebsiella pneumonia and was found to have asymptomatic urinary retention. He was treated conservatively, and his outcome was favorable. EC is commonly seen in patients with diabetes mellitus, and symptoms range from asymptomatic to severe sepsis. Most urine cultures grow Escherichia coli and K. pneumonia. The association of increased UTIs in susceptible patients with T2DM with the use of SGLT2i is yet to be determined. Most cases of EC are diagnosed radiographically and treated conservatively, although some cases require surgical intervention. Initially, our patient was considered a good candidate for treatment with an SGLT2i. The subsequent development of EC precluded its further use. The role of SGLT2i in patients with T2DM susceptible to UTI is controversial.","misc","wim","misc"

This report aimed to describe a patient with a sparsely granulated corticotroph tumor (SGCT) presenting with apoplexy and remission of hypercortisolism. A 33-year-old male patient presented via ambulance with sudden onset of severe headache and nausea/vomiting. Physical examination revealed bitemporal hemianopsia, diplopia from right-sided third cranial nerve palsy, abdominal striae, facial plethora, and dorsal and supraclavicular fat pads. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a 3.2-cm mass arising from the sella turcica with hemorrhage compressing the optic chiasm, extension into the sphenoid sinus and cavernous sinus. Initial investigations revealed a plasma cortisol level of 64.08 (reference range [RR], 2.36-17.05) mcg/dL. He underwent emergent transsphenoidal surgery. Pathology was diagnostic of SGCT. Postoperatively, the following laboratory findings were found: (1) cortisol level, <1.8 ug/dL (RR, 2.4-17); (2) adrenocorticotropic hormone level, 36 pg/mL (RR, 0-81); (3) thyroid-stimulating hormone level, 0.07 uIU/mL (RR, 0.36-3.74); (4) free thyroxine level, 1 ng/dL (RR, 0.8-1.5); (5) luteinizing hormone level, <1 mIU/mL (RR, 1-12); (6) follicle-stimulating hormone level, 1 mIU/mL (RR, 1-12); and (7) testosterone level, 28.8 ng/dL (RR, 219.2-905.6), with ongoing requirement for hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, testosterone replacement, and continued follow-up. Corticotroph adenomas are divided into densely granulated, sparsely granulated, and Crooke cell tumors. Sparsely granulated pattern is associated with a larger tumor size and decreased remission rate after surgery. This report illustrates a rare case of hypercortisolism remission due to apoplexy of an SGCT with subsequent central adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism.","misc","wim","misc"
"490",35959106,"LncRNA-84277 is involved in chronic pain-related depressive behaviors through miR-128-3p/SIRT1 axis in central amygdala.","Long-term chronic pain can lead to depression. However, the mechanism underlying chronic pain-related depression remains unclear. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC). Our previous studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is involved in the development of chronic pain-related depression. In addition, increasing studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a vital role in the pathogenesis of pain or depression. However, whether lncRNAs are involved in SIRT1-mediated chronic pain-related depression remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified that a novel lncRNA-84277 in CeA was the upstream molecule to regulate SIRT1 expression. Functionally, lncRNA-84277 overexpression in CeA significantly alleviated the depression-like behaviors in spared nerve injury (SNI)-induced chronic pain rats, whereas lncRNA-84277 knockdown in CeA induced the depression-like behaviors in naïve rats. Mechanically, lncRNA-84277 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to upregulate SIRT1 expression by competitively sponging miR-128-3p, and therefore improved chronic pain-related depression-like behaviors. Our findings reveal the critical role of lncRNA-84277 in CeA specifically in guarding against chronic pain-related depression via a ceRNA mechanism and provide a potential therapeutic target for chronic pain-related depression.","misc","wim","rodent"

Many researchers used planarians as a model system for the study of drug abuse because they display high similarities with the nervous system of vertebrates at cellular and molecular levels (e.g., neuronal morphology, neurotransmitter ligands, and receptor function). This research field recently led to the discovery of causal relationships between the expression of Transient Receptor Potential ion channels in planarians and their behavioral responses to noxious stimuli such as heat, cold or pharmacological analogs such as TRP agonists, among others. It has also been shown that some antinociceptive drugs modulate these behaviors. However, among the few authors that tried to implement a full behavior analysis, none reached a consensual use of the terms used to describe planarian gaits yet, nor did they establish a comprehensive description of a potential planarian nociceptive system. The aim of this review is therefore to aggregate the ancient and the most recent evidence for a true nociceptive behavior in planarians. It also highlights the convenience and relevance of this invertebrate model for nociceptive tests and suggests further lines of research. In regards to past pharmacological studies, this review finally discusses the opportunities given by the model to extensively screen for novel antinociceptive drugs.","misc","wim","misc"

Several approaches exist which enable gene manipulation in preclinical models, and some of these have been approved to treat human diseases. For the last couple of decades, RNA interference (RNAi) has been a leading technique to knockdown (i.e., suppress) specific RNA expression. This has been partly due to the technology's simplicity, which has promoted its adoption throughout biomedical science. However, accumulating evidence indicates that this technology can possess significant shortcomings. This review highlights the overwhelming evidence that RNAi can be prone to off-target effects and is capable of inducing cytotoxicity in some cases. With this in mind, we consider alternative CRISPR/Cas-based approaches, which may be safer and more reliable for gene knockdown.

MiRNAs have been reported to play significant roles in prognosis prediction for patients with malignant tumors. The survival-related miRNAs (sDMIRs) were identified by Cox regression analysis. A risk score model (RSM) was established based on three sDMIRs. The expression levels of sDMIRs in cell lines and clinical samples were detected via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The correlations between sDMIRs and clinicopathological characteristics of PCa patients were evaluated using the chi-square test and Fisher's exact probability method. Four sDMIRs were remarkably related to the prognosis of PCa patients based on univariate Cox analysis, of which miR-10a-5p, miR-20a-5p, and miR-508-3p were used to establish the RSM. The OS in the low-risk group was better than that in the high-risk group. In the verification of various prostate cell lines and clinical samples from 162 PCa patients, the prominently higher expression of miR-10a-5p and miR-20a-5p and lower expression of miR-508-3p were detected in PCa cell lines and tumor tissues, especially the more advanced T-stage. Besides, the higher expression of miR-20a-5p and miR-10a-5p was significantly correlated to the higher level of PSA, Gleason score, more advanced T-stage, and distant metastasis status. We identify and validate the clinical significance of three sDMIRs and establish a verified RSM to evaluate the prognosis for PCa patients. The findings not only provide a reliable tool for clinical decision-makers to evaluate patients' prognosis but also offer a novel perspective into the field of biomarker identification.","misc","wim","misc"

These 16 studies enrolled 1,488 patients: 653 patients in the UBE group, 570 in the microendoscopic discectomy group, 153 in the percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy group, and 70 in the posterior lumbar interbody fusion group. UBE was superior to microendoscopic discectomy regarding 1-day Visual Analog Scale(VAS) back pain scores (P < 0.00001). No difference was found between UBE and microendoscopic discectomy regarding 1-day Visual Analog Scale leg pain scores (P = 0.25), long-term VAS back pain scores (P = 0.06), long-term VAS leg pain scores (P = 0.05), Oswestry Disability Index scores (P = 0.09) or complications (P = 0.19). Pooled analysis indicated that UBE was similar to percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy regarding 1-day VAS back pain scores (P = 0.71), 1-day VAS leg pain scores (P = 0.37), long-term VAS back pain scores (P = 0.75), long-term VAS leg pain scores (P = 0.41), Oswestry Disability Index scores (P = 0.07) and complications (P = 0.88). One study reported no difference between UBE and posterior lumbar interbody fusion regarding long-term VAS back pain, long-term VAS leg pain, or Oswestry Disability Index scores. UBE is superior to microendoscopic discectomy to relieve back pain 1 day postoperatively. However, these two procedures are similar regarding 1-day leg pain relief, long-term effects, and safety. UBE and percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy are similar regarding 1-day pain relief, long-term effects and safety.

Rarely, PTA can be complicated by several other cerebrovascular disease, including arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), intracranial aneurysms, moyamoya disease, and carotid-cavernous malformations. Herein, we reported a rare case of PTA combined with an AVM in a male patient. The patient was a 28-year-old male with epileptic seizures at the onset of symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal signal foci and localized softening foci formation with gliosis in the right parietal temporal lobe. Furthermore, using a digital subtraction angiogram (DSA), it was found that an abnormal carotid-basilar anastomosis had developed through a PTA originating from the cavernous portion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and a large AVM on the surface of the right carotid artery. The lesion of AVM tightly developed and draining into superior sagittal sinus. A hybrid operating room was used for the surgery. The main feeding arteries of the AVM originating from three major arteries, including the right middle cerebral artery, the right anterior cerebral artery, and the right posterior cerebral artery, were clipped and subsequently, then the AVM was thoroughly removed. The intraoperative DSA showed that the AVM had been resected completely. Postoperative pathological examination of the resected specimen indicated the presence of an AVM. The patient recovered well after surgery and has been symptom-free for more than 3 months. In summary, the pathogenesis of the coexistence of PTA and AVM remains unknown. As highlighted in this case report, hybrid surgery can be used to remove AVMs and can improve the patients' prognosis. To our best knowledge, this is the first case in the literature of successful AVM treatment using hybrid surgery.","misc","wim","misc"

However, the POD guidelines issued by the European Society of Anesthesiology (ESA) suggest that the effect of regional anesthesia on POD is controversial. This meta-analysis aims to investigate whether perioperative regional anesthesia reduced the incidence of POD. Standard Published randomized controlled trails (RCTs) were searched from bibliographic databases to identify all evidence that reported regional anesthesia assessing incident delirium following diverse surgeries. The primary outcome was the incidence of POD, and the secondary outcomes were POD scores, pain scores, and emergence time. The relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the weighted or standardized mean difference (WMD, SMD) for continuous outcomes were estimated using a random-effects model. Twenty RCTs with 2110 randomized participants undergoing different surgeries were included. Meta-analysis showed that regional anesthesia was associated with less POD incidence compared to general anesthesia (total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) or inhalation anesthesia) (relative risk (RR) = 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-0.85)). Subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in POD incidence was associated with a nerve block (0.46, 95% CI = 0.32-0.67) and regional-combined-general anesthesia (0.42, 95% CI = 0.29-0.60). Regional anesthesia significantly reduced POD incidence in the recovery room after pediatric surgeries (0.41, 95% CI = 0.29-0.56). Regional anesthesia also reduced the POD score (SMD -0.93, 95% CI = -1.55 to -0.31) and pain score (SMD -0.95, 95% CI = -1.72 to -0.81). There was no significant difference in emergence time between regional anesthesia and general anesthesia (WMD -1.40, 95% CI = -3.83 to 6.63).

Indocyanine Green (ICG) is one of the most commonly used dyes that assists surgeons identify small lung cancers intra-operatively. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ICG in lung cancer detection. We performed a systematic review of the literature by screening the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and Scopus until 30th April 2022 and the first 300 articles of Google Scholar for any suitable grey literature. We included any study that investigated the effectiveness of ICG in lung cancer detection. We excluded studies that explored the use of ICG only in identification of intersegmental planes, lymph node mapping, case reports and non-English articles. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis on test accuracy studies using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) and the bivariate random-effects models. In cases where the data for a localization technique was not sufficient for that analysis, it was presented with tables with narrative purposes. Each study was assessed for Risk of Bias (RoB) and Applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. We found 30 eligible studies that included a total of 1,776 patients who underwent ICG localization of pulmonary nodules. We identified three ICG localization techniques: CT-guided, endobronchial and intravenous. From the 30 studies, 13 investigated CT-guided localization, 12 explored an endobronchial method while 8 studies administered ICG intravenously the median reported success rate was 94.3% (IQR: 91.4%-100%) and 98.3% (IQR: 94%-100%) for the first two techniques respectively. Intravenous ICG lung cancer localization showed Sensitivity of 88% (95% CI: 59%-0.97%) and Specificity of 25% (95% CI: 0.04%-0.74%).

Surgical resection is the only potential curative treatment, and radiation therapy and chemotherapy for leiomyosarcoma are not definite. There is few literature reporting the leiomyosarcoma of the IVC. A previously healthy 64-year-old female was admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University with the complaint of right lower quadrant abdominal pain for almost three years and worsening with a radiating ache in the waist recently. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography(CT) scans revealed a large (7.8 cm*5.5 cm*5.0 cm) irregular hypodense retroperitoneal mass with heterogeneous enhancement and invasion of the IVC, and the right ureter was compressed with proximal ureteral dilatation and hydrops. Three-dimensional CT of the IVC revealed that the IVC was encircled by the tumor with moderate invasion. During the operation, the tumor was resected en bloc with the IVC (from the suprarenal to infrarenal segment), the right kidney with ureter, and the duodenum seromuscular layer. As the left renal vein was involved, it was also partly resected. IVC reconstruction was performed with the interposition of a 20 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) prosthesis, and the right renal vein was anastomosed between the left renal vein and the reconstructed IVC to guarantee the left renal vein reflux. The patient had an uneventful recovery process with normal renal function after the operation. However, follow-up CT indicated that the left renal vein was blocked two weeks after the surgery. The patient was discharged two weeks after the operation. She continues well and has no evidence of disease fourteen months after the surgery. Wide excision of the tumor en bloc with the IVC is the main treatment for leiomyosarcoma of the IVC. IVC reconstruction with prosthetic PTFE grafts is recommended. When the left renal vein is partly resected due to involvement of the tumor, reconstruction of left renal vein should also be performed to avoid renal impairment. If the right renal vein does not show tumor involvement, the resected right renal vein can be used to reconstruct the left renal vein.","misc","wim","misc"

Given the poor efficacy of interventions after AKI development, it is important to predict AKI before its diagnosis. Therefore, this study aimed to develop models using machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of AKI in patients with femoral neck fractures. We developed machine-learning models using the Medical Information Mart from Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. AKI was predicted using 10 predictive models in three-time windows, 24, 48, and 72 h. Three optimal models were selected according to the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and the hyperparameters were adjusted using a random search algorithm. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis was used to determine the impact and importance of each feature on the prediction. Compact models were developed using important features chosen based on their SHAP values and clinical availability. Finally, we evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, AUROC, recall, F1 scores, and kappa values on the test set after hyperparameter tuning. A total of 1,596 patients in MIMIC-IV were included in the final cohort, and 402 (25%) patients developed AKI after surgery. The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) model showed the best overall performance for predicting AKI before 24, 48, and 72 h. AUROCs were 0.929, 0.862, and 0.904. The SHAP value was used to interpret the prediction models. Renal function markers and perioperative blood transfusions are the most critical features for predicting AKI. In compact models, LightGBM still performs the best. AUROCs were 0.930, 0.859, and 0.901. In our analysis, we discovered that LightGBM had the best metrics among all algorithms used. Our study identified the LightGBM as a solid first-choice algorithm for early AKI prediction in patients after femoral neck fracture surgery.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The Starbase database and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay were used to analyze the interaction between lncRNA WT1 antisense RNA (lncRNA WT1-AS) and microRNA-186-5p (miR-186-5p). Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis was performed to determine lncRNA WT1-AS and miR-186-5p levels. An oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury model was established. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and flow cytometric assays, respectively. Caspase 3 activity was evaluated using a caspase 3 activity detection kit. The results showed that miR-186-5p is a direct target of the lncRNA WT1-AS. In addition, lncRNA WT1-AS levels were downregulated and miR-186-5p levels were upregulated in the blood samples of patients with ischemic stroke and OGD-induced SH-SY5Y cells. WT1-AS overexpression promoted OGD-induced cell viability and reduced the cell apoptosis and caspase 3 activity. However, these effects were reversed by miR-186-5p overexpression. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) was directly targeted by miR-186-5p. Similarly, transfection with the miR-186-5p inhibitor reduced OGD-induced neuronal damage by upregulating XIAP expression. In conclusion, lncRNA WT1-AS attenuates hypoxia/ischemia-induced neuronal injury in cerebral ischemic stroke through the miR-186-5p/XIAP axis.","misc","wim","rodent"
"504",35959170,"Bone Mineral Density, Serum Calcium, and Vitamin D Levels in Adult Thalassemia Major Patients: Experience From a Single Center in Eastern India.","Background and objective Patients suffering from thalassemia major are at higher risk of osteoporosis. Due to their decreased life expectancy, the number of adult patients is low. However, their bone health is rarely checked in developing countries like India. There is no data available in the literature on the bone mineral density (BMD) of adult (aged ≥18 years) thalassemia major patients in eastern India. In this study, we aimed to measure the BMD and serum calcium and vitamin D levels in adult thalassemia major patients and to compare them with healthy controls. Materials and methods We conducted this cross-sectional observational study at a tertiary care hospital in eastern India. We recruited adult thalassemia major patients who were not on calcium or vitamin D supplements. Their BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) on the lumbar spine (L1-L4). Venous blood was tested for serum calcium and vitamin D levels. We compared the parameters between the cases and controls by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results A total of 31 (male = 19, female = 12) patients with a median age of 28 years comprised the case group. Age- and sex-matched controls showed similar height but higher weight and BMI. The serum calcium level was similar (p = 0.43) in the case and control groups but T-score (p = 0.0003) and vitamin D levels (p: <0.0001) were significantly lower in thalassemia major patients. Conclusion Based on our findings, adult thalassemia major patients have lower BMD and vitamin D levels. Although the serum calcium may be normal in these patients, they should still be screened both for BMD and vitamin D for prompt and early detection of risks and complications so that a proper management strategy can be implemented.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Its role in transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia major yet needs to be clearly established. This study has been carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea as adjuvant therapy in pediatric cases of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia major disease. Materials and methods This quasi-experimental study was carried out at District Headquarter Hospital (DHQ), Zhob, from February 2021 to January 2022. One hundred ten cases fulfilling the inclusion-exclusion criteria were selected and divided into groups of 55 each. Group A cases received hydroxyurea (10-20 mg/kg/day) in addition to blood transfusion and chelation therapy. Group B received a blood transfusion and chelation therapy only. Both groups were compared in terms of blood transfusion requirement, mean hemoglobin, and mean serum ferritin levels. All the data were analyzed with SPSS 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Of Group A cases, three were dropped because of side effects of hydroxyurea, and two were lost to follow-up. Similarly, three cases of Group B lost to follow-up, one patient withdrew consent, and one child died at home; thus both groups were left with 50 cases each. The mean age of participants was 11.98 + 3.74 years. There were 51 males and 49 females. Both the groups were comparable in terms of age and gender. Similarly, mean hemoglobin levels and serum ferritin levels were comparable at the start of the study. After one year, there was a significant improvement in mean hemoglobin level (p<0.001) and a significant reduction in serum ferritin levels (p=0.014) in the group taking adjuvant hydroxyurea. The requirement of packed red blood cells (RBCs) significantly decreased in cases taking hydroxyurea (p<0.001). Conclusion Hydroxyurea is a safe and effective treatment that significantly decreases the packed RBC transfusion requirement in transfusion-dependent thalassemia children, improves hemoglobin levels, and reduces serum ferritin levels compared to the children on blood transfusions alone.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The occurrence of this tumor in the intradural extramedullary spinal region is infrequent. This systematic review examines primary extraosseous intradural extramedullary ES in the cervical region to provide specific outcomes and evaluate the role of adjuvant chemoradiation in overall prognosis. A systematic review was conducted to identify all cervical primary extraosseous intradural extramedullary ES reported in the literature. The search included the databases of PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, Embase, and Scopus from inception to June 2021. Inclusion criteria include a reported death outcome or a minimum one-year follow-up. Our search retrieved 21 articles that involved the cervical spine, but only 11 cases met the inclusion criteria. Of the nine patients who demonstrated disease progression, six experienced local failure, two had distant craniospinal axis failure, and one had systemic metastases. Five patients died of the disease at a median of 11 months after diagnosis. Our analysis showed a one-, two-, and five-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 36.4%, 36.4%, and 12.1%, respectively. The one-, two-, and five-year overall survival rates were 72.7%, 62.3%, and 46.8%, respectively. Three of the five (60%) patients who died received craniospinal radiotherapy.

This was a single-center retrospective study including all adult patients with at least 1 positive blood culture for Candida species from 2014 to 2021. A total of 222 episodes of candidemia were included. Most candidemias were of unknown origin (36%) or vascular catheter related (29%). Septic shock developed in 29% episodes. Overall, 14-day mortality rate was 23%. In univariate analyses, septic shock was associated with higher 14-day mortality, whereas catheter-related candidemia and early (<72 hours) interventions, such as appropriate antifungal therapy, source control, and infectious diseases consultation, were associated with improved survival. In a Cox multivariate regression model, septic shock (odds ratio [OR], 3.62 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.05-6.38]) was associated with higher mortality. While the impact of early antifungal therapy did not reach statistical significance, early (<72 hours) infectious diseases consultation (OR, 0.46 [95% CI, .23-.91]) and early source control (OR, 0.15 [95% CI, .08-.31]) were associated with better survival. Subanalyses showed that the benefits of early source control, specifically catheter removal, were significant among patients with sepsis or septic shock, but not among those without sepsis. These associations remained significant after exclusion of patients who died prematurely or were in palliative care. Early source control, in particular catheter removal, was a key determinant of outcome among candidemic patients with sepsis or septic shock.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

One hundred and eight patients with severe IUA admitted to our hospital from May 2019 to October 2021 were selected for the study. Patients were divided according to their treatment regimen into group A (n = 54) treated with hysteroscopic cold broad sword play + drospirenone and ethinylestradiol tablets and group B (n = 54) treated with hysteroscopic cold broad sword play + estrogen and progestin sequential therapy. The two groups were compared in terms of perioperative indicators, recovery of uterine cavity status, inflammatory factor (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8)] levels), World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Scale (WHOQOL-BREF) score, and clinical outcome at 3 months postoperatively. After surgery, the duration of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding was shorter in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). After surgery, the time of menstruation return was shorter in group A than in group B, and the menstrual flow score was higher than in group B (P < 0.05). At 3 months after the surgery, the uterine blood flow index, endometrial thickness, and uterine cavity volume were higher in group A than in group B, and the number of uterine readhesion was lower than in group B (P < 0.05). 3 months after the surgery, the CRP, IL-6, and IL-8 levels decreased in both groups and were lower in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). At 3 months after the surgery, the WHOQOL-BREF scores for each indicator were higher in both groups than before surgery and were higher in group A than in group B (P < 0.05).

Moreover, decidualized ovarian endometrioma may rupture and cause acute abdominal pain during pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is reportedly useful in differentiating decidualized ovarian endometriomas from malignancies. However, to our knowledge, serial MRI of decidualized ovarian endometrioma before and after rupture has not been reported. Herein, we report the case of a 39-year-old woman with a ruptured decidualized ovarian endometrioma in which serial MRI was useful for adequate management. She had a history of right ovarian endometrioma. Transvaginal ultrasonography at 20 weeks of gestation showed the known right ovarian endometrioma with mural nodules that were not evident before pregnancy. MRI for further evaluation showed ovarian endometrioma with mural nodules with signals similar to those of the placenta. Based on the MRI findings, we diagnosed a decidualized ovarian endometrioma. At 27 weeks of gestation, she complained of sudden abdominal pain, for which MRI was performed. MRI showed disappearance of the ovarian endometrioma and bloody ascites, based on which we diagnosed a ruptured ovarian endometrioma. The abdominal pain subsided immediately, and a conservative observational treatment approach was taken. At 37 weeks of gestation, right ovarian cystectomy was performed simultaneously with an elective cesarean section, which revealed a ruptured decidualized ovarian endometrioma. Our findings demonstrate that the accurate diagnosis of a ruptured decidualized ovarian endometrioma on serial MRI can contribute to its management.","misc","wim","misc"

Activated carbon is the earliest and most economical method that also adsorbs copper to a certain extent. This paper proposes the methods of involving the activated carbon in the multiwalled carbon nanotube to improve the adsorption capability of the copper. Here, activated carbon is impregnated on the multiwalled carbon nanotube's defect and imperfect surface areas. It makes more adsorption sites on the surface, increasing the adsorption amount.

In this study we focus on the LPAR5-antagonist compound 3 (cpd3) and its ability to affect pain and itch signaling, both in vitro and in vivo. Nociceptive behavior in wild type mice was induced by formalin, carrageenan or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) injection in the hind paw, and the effect of oral cpd3 administration was measured. Scratch activity was measured after oral administration of cpd3, in mice overexpressing phospholipase A2 ( sPLA2tg ), in wild type mice (WT) and in TRPA1-deficient mice (Trpa1 KO). In vitro effects of cpd3 were assessed by measuring intracellular calcium release in HMC-1 and HEK-TRPA1 cells. As expected, nociceptive behavior (induced by formalin, carrageenan or PGE2) was reduced after treatment with cpd3. Unexpectedly, cpd3 induced scratch activity in mice. In vitro addition of cpd3 to HEK-TRPA1 cells induced an intracellular calcium wave that could be inhibited by the TRPA1-antagonist A-967079. In Trpa1 KO mice, however, the increase in scratch activity after cpd3 administration was not reduced. Cpd3 has in vivo antinociceptive effects but induces scratch activity in mice, probably by activation of multiple pruriceptors, including TRPA1.

Participants (N = 31) in this pilot study were recruited from one primary care practice in New York City and randomized to an intervention [app + up to 12 health coaching sessions (scheduled approximately once weekly) + usual care] or a control (app + usual care) arm. Feasibility measures included recruitment (proportion of eligible persons who enrolled) and retention rates (proportion of subjects completing a follow-up assessment) as well as adherence with the weekly coaching sessions and logging daily data on the app. Efficacy outcomes (e.g., pain intensity, self-efficacy, disability, anxiety) were assessed at baseline and follow-up (~16 weeks after baseline). Descriptive statistics were obtained and general linear mixed models used for primary analyses. Participants had a mean (standard deviation) age of 67.32 (9.17) and were mostly female (61%).

The course of initial specialization of ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOTC) sensitivity to visual number processing is crucial for the acquisition of numeric and arithmetic skills. We examined the visual N1, the electrophysiological correlate of vOTC activation across five time points in kindergarten (T1, mean age 6.60 years), middle and end of first grade (T2, 7.38 years; T3, 7.68 years), second grade (T4, 8.28 years), and fifth grade (T5, 11.40 years). A combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal EEG data of a total of 62 children (35 female) at varying familial risk for dyslexia were available to form groups of 23, 22, 27, 27, and 42 participants for each of the five time points. The children performed a target detection task which included visual presentation of single digits (DIG), false fonts (FF), and letters (LET) to derive measures for coarse (DIG vs. FF) and fine (DIG vs. LET) digit sensitive processing across development. The N1 amplitude analyses indicated coarse and fine sensitivity characterized by a stronger N1 to digits than false fonts across all five time points, and stronger N1 to digits than letters at all but the second (T2) time point. In addition, lower arithmetic skills were associated with stronger coarse N1 digit sensitivity over the left hemisphere in second grade (T4), possibly reflecting allocation of more attentional resources or stronger reliance on the verbal system in children with poorer arithmetic skills. To summarize, our results show persistent visual N1 sensitivity to digits that is already present early on in pre-school and remains stable until fifth grade. This pattern of digit sensitivity development clearly differs from the relatively sharp rise and fall of the visual N1 sensitivity to words or letters between kindergarten and middle of elementary school and suggests unique developmental trajectories for visual processing of written characters that are relevant to numeracy and literacy.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

At present, there are about 10 million patients with PD in the world, and its comorbidities and complications are numerous and incurable. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the pathogenesis of PD and find possible therapeutic targets. Because the etiology of PD is complex, involving genes, environment, and aging, finding common factors is the key to identifying intervention targets. Hypoxia is ubiquitous in the natural environment and disease states, and it is considered to be closely related to the etiology of PD. Despite research showing that hypoxia increases the expression and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn), the most important pathogenic protein, there is still a lack of systematic studies on the role of hypoxia in α-syn pathology and PD pathogenesis. Considering that hypoxia is inextricably linked with various causes of PD, hypoxia may be a co-participant in many aspects of the PD pathologic process. In this review, we describe the risk factors for PD, and we discuss the possible role of hypoxia in inducing PD pathology by these risk factors. Furthermore, we attribute the pathological changes caused by PD etiology to oxygen uptake disorder and oxygen utilization disorder, thus emphasizing the possibility of hypoxia as a critical link in initiating or promoting α-syn pathology and PD pathogenesis. Our study provides novel insight for exploring the pathogenesis and therapeutic targets of PD.","misc","wim","misc"

However, it remains a challenge to define reliable biomarkers for rapid and accurate diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Our study aimed to evaluate the association of serum metabolites with MCI, attempting to find new biomarkers and combination models that are distinct for MCI. A total of 380 participants were recruited (mean age: 72.5 ± 5.19 years). We performed an untargeted metabolomics analysis on older adults who underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and physical performance tests such as hand grip, Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT), and walking speed. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and heat map were utilized to distinguish the metabolites that differ between groups. Among all the subjects, 47 subjects were diagnosed with MCI, and methods based on the propensity score are used to match the MCI group with the normal control (NC) group (n = 47). The final analytic sample comprised 94 participants (mean age: 75.2 years). The data process from the metabolic profiles identified 1,008 metabolites. A cluster and pathway enrichment analysis showed that sphingolipid metabolism is involved in the development of MCI. Combination of metabolite panel and physical performance were significantly increased discriminating abilities on MCI than a single physical performance test [model 1: the area under the curve (AUC) = 0.863; model 2: AUC = 0.886; and model 3: AUC = 0.870, P < 0.001]. In our study, untargeted metabolomics was used to detect the disturbance of metabolism that occurs in MCI. Physical performance tests combined with phosphatidylcholines (PCs) showed good utility in discriminating between NC and MCI, which is meaningful for the early diagnosis of MCI.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Currently, new high-sensitivity assays made it a reality. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to test the accuracy of plasma tau protein in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Embase and Web of Science databases, and conducted correlation subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis using R Programming Language. A total of 56 studies were included. Blood t-tau and p-tau levels increased from controls to MCI to AD patients, and showed significant changes in pairwise comparisons of AD, MCI and normal cognition. P-tau217 was more sensitive than p-tau181 and p-tau231 in different cognition periods. In addition, ultrasensitive analytical platforms, immunomagnetic reduction (IMR), increased the diagnostic value of tau proteins, especially the diagnostic value of t-tau. Both t-tau and p-tau are suitable AD blood biomarkers, and p-tau217 is more sensitive than other tau biomarkers to differentiate MCI and AD. Detection techniques also have an impact on biomarkers' results.

Considering that the deterioration of musculoskeletal conditions is of serious concern in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, it is worthwhile to clarify the effect of wearable sensor-based exercise on musculoskeletal disorders in such patients compared with traditional exercise. Five health science-related databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and Ebsco Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, were systematically searched. The protocol number of the study is PROSPERO CRD42022319763. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published up to March 2022 and written in English were included. Balance was the primary outcome measure, comprising questionnaires on postural stability and computerized dynamic posturography. The secondary outcome measures are motor symptoms, mobility ability, functional gait abilities, fall-associated self-efficacy, and adverse events. Stata version 16.0 was used for statistical analysis, and the weighted mean difference (WMD) was selected as the effect size with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Fifteen RCTs involving 488 participants with mean ages ranging from 58.6 to 81.6 years were included in this review, with 14 of them being pooled in a quantitative meta-analysis. Only five included studies showed a low risk of bias. The Berg balance scale (BBS) was used in nine studies, and the pooled data showed a significant improvement in the wearable sensor-based exercise group compared with the traditional exercise group after 3-12-week intervention (WMD = 1.43; 95% CI, 0.50 to 2.36, P = 0.003). A significant change in visual score was found both post-assessment and at 1-month follow-up assessment (WMD = 4.38; 95% CI, 1.69 to 7.07, P = 0.001; I2 = 0.0%). However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in the secondary outcome measures (all p > 0.05). No major adverse events were reported. The wearable sensor-based exercise had advantages in improving balance in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, while there was a lack of evidence in motor symptoms, mobility, and functional gait ability enhancement.

One of the most predominant MMPs is MMP-9. Association between chronic periodontitis (CP) and MMP-9 gene polymorphism (GP) in some ethnic populations has been already established. The aim of the current study was to assess the association of single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of MMP-9 gene with CP in Kolkata population, if any. Forty eligible individuals were recruited for the study and grouped as A and B: Group A (twenty periodontally healthy individuals) and Group B (twenty CP patients). Venous blood samples collected from all the forty individuals were used to isolate the genomic DNA. GP for MMP-9 gene was detected using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing method. The data obtained were then analyzed statistically. A significantly different genotypic and allelic variation was observed in the control and test groups, with C/T genotype and T allele present in only CP group. Within the limitations of this study, we can conclude that there was no significant association between patients with periodontitis and MMP-9-1562 C/T promoter GP.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

This study aimed to assess the presence of anterior loop of mandibular canal and its approximation to the alveolar crest using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). CBCT scans of the patients scheduled for implant therapy in the region of mental foramen were retrospectively analyzed for the presence of anterior loop of mandibular canal. Findings were compared based upon gender and side of the mandible. Distance between the most prominent part of anterior loop of mandibular canal and the alveolar crest was measured. Anterior loop of the mandibular canal was identified 66.8% of hemimandibles analyzed with the highest prevalence in the fourth decade of life. Males and females exhibited predilection toward the right and left side, respectively. The presence of anterior loop of mandibular canal is associated with reduced distance between the neurovascular bundle and alveolar crest jeopardizing the placement of standard length dental implant. The current study emphasizes an increased need for precise identification and preservation of anterior loop of mandibular canal in the third and fourth decades of life, especially in females.","misc","wim","misc"

A split-mouth randomized clinical trial was carried out in 46 chronic periodontitis patients with probing pocket depth (PPD) ≥4 mm or clinical attachment loss greater than 3 mm on both quadrants of the same arch. Full-mouth scaling and root planing (SRP) was performed for all the patients followed by application of 0.25% satranidazole-loaded nanoparticles in gel form on one site (Group 1) and commercially available 1% metronidazole gel on another site (Group 2). Clinical parameters (gingival index, plaque index, PPD, clinical attachment level gain, and bleeding on probing) and microbiological analysis of the subgingival plaque samples were performed and assessed at baseline, after SRP, 21st day, and 90th day post treatment. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA tests were used for intergroup and intragroup comparison of recorded parameters. The results showed that the satranidazole-loaded nanoparticle group as an adjunct to SRP in chronic periodontitis showed a statistically significant improvement in all the clinical parameters and a fewer relapse of microbial flora in comparison with the metronidazole group as an LDD agent. The present study depicted that both the LDD agents showed an effective improvement of clinical as well as microbiological parameters, but the satranidazole group consistently produced better results than the metronidazole group and hence has a promising future as an LDD agent in treating periodontal pockets.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Nonsubmerged grafts such as free gingival grafts and gingival unit grafts (GUGs) rely primarily on plasmatic circulation from the recipient area during the initial stages of healing for its survival. Nineteen isolated RT2 recession defects, in the mandibular anterior region, were treated using GUG. The clinical parameters of recession depth (RD), recession width (RW), interdental clinical attachment levels (iCAL) were measured at baseline. Percentage of mean root coverage (MRC) was calculated at 3 months and 6 months. The percentage of mean root coverage (MRC) achieved at the end of 6 months was 81.79% ± 6.16%. Further, Simple linear regression analysis to predict MRC at 6 months using baseline RW revealed, for every 1 mm decrease in RW, the percentage of root coverage significantly increased by 5.25% (P = 0.04).

Indian Society of Periodontology conducted a nationwide survey, involving 3000 dentists in December 2020, which revealed significant knowledge gaps regarding DH, viz., under-diagnosis, incorrect differential diagnosis, and treatment strategies/recommendations for the management of DH patients in daily clinical practice. The current paper has been envisioned and conceptualized to update the practicing Indian dentists regarding the so-called enigma of dentistry Dentin Hypersensitivity, based on the best available contemporary evidence. An expert panel was constituted comprising 30 subject experts from across the country, which after extensive literature review and group discussions formulated these recommendations. The panel advocated routine screening of all dentate patients for exposed dentin areas and DH to avoid under-diagnosis of the condition and suggested an early preventive management. Consensus guidelines/recommendations for the use of desensitizing agents (DAs) at home, including the use of herbal agents, are also provided within the backdrop of the Indian context. The guidelines recommend that active management of DH shall be accomplished by a combination of at home and in-office therapies, starting with the simplest and cost-effective home use of desensitizing toothpastes. A diagnostic decision tree and a flowchart for application in daily practice are designed to manage the patients suffering from DH or presenting with exposed dentin areas in dentition. Various treatment methods to manage DH have been discussed in the paper, including the insights from previously published treatment guidelines. Further, a novel system of classification of DH patients based on specific case definitions has been developed for the first time. Explicit charts regarding the available treatment options and the chronology of institution of the agent, for the management in different case categories of DH, have been provided for quick reference. The management strategy takes into account a decision algorithm based on hierarchy of complexity of treatment options and intends to improve the quality of life of the patient by long-term maintenance with an innovatively defined triple C's or 3Cs approach.","misc","wim","misc"

A total of 180 patients with gynecological malignant tumor treated by surgery in our hospital from September 2018 to October 2021 were randomly divided into three groups: group A, group B, and group C, with 60 patients in each group. Group C was given conventional nursing intervention, group B was given FTS intervention, and group A was given FTS intervention combined with empathic care. Psychological stress state (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate), postoperative recovery indicators (time of first anal exhaust, time of first defecation, time of getting out of bed, and length of postoperative hospital stay), postoperative complications, and psychological state (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS)) levels of patients in the three groups were compared. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate in group A were lower than those in group B, and those in group B were lower than those in group C (all P < 0.05). The time of first anal exhaust, time of first defecation, time of getting out of bed, and postoperative hospital stay in groups A and B were shorter than those in group C (all P < 0.05).The incidence of postoperative complications in groups A and B was 8.33% and 8.33%, respectively, lower than 23.33% in group C (both P < 0.05).

"537",35959350,"Research on Optimization Scheme for Blocking Artifacts after Patch-Based Medical Image Reconstruction.","Due to limitations of computer resources, when utilizing a neural network to process an image with a high resolution, the typical processing approach is to slice the original image. However, because of the influence of zero-padding in the edge component during the convolution process, the central part of the patch often has more accurate feature information than the edge part, resulting in image blocking artifacts after patch stitching. We studied this problem in this paper and proposed a fusion method that assigns a weight to each pixel in a patch using a truncated Gaussian function as the weighting function. In this method, we used the weighting function to transform the Euclidean-distance between a point in the overlapping part and the central point of the patch where the point was located into a weight coefficient. With increasing distance, the value of the weight coefficient decreased. Finally, the reconstructed image was obtained by weighting. We employed the bias correction model to evaluate our method on the simulated database BrainWeb and the real dataset HCP (Human Connectome Project). The results show that the proposed method is capable of effectively removing blocking artifacts and obtaining a smoother bias field. To verify the effectiveness of our algorithm, we employed a denoising model to test it on the IXI-Guys human dataset. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of both models show that the fusion method proposed in this paper can effectively remove blocking artifacts and demonstrates superior performance compared to five commonly available and state-of-the-art fusion methods.","misc","wim","misc"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of long-term physical therapy on improving motor symptoms or daily activities in Parkinson's patients with drug use or discontinuation, as well as its impact on drug treatment dose. A subgroup analysis was conducted on different treatment methods to determine the most effective treatment method. The researchers independently searched databases, including PubMed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of science. The search deadline was June 2022. A randomized controlled trial was conducted on Parkinson's disease patients with HY stages 1-3 who received continuous physical therapy for 6 months or more. Systematic evaluation and meta-analysis were carried out by using common clinical evaluation indicators, namely, MDS-UPDRS exercise score, daily activity (ADL) score, or LED dose. The quality of the literature was assessed using the modified Jadad scale of Cochrane's bias risk tool. A total of 523 Parkinson's disease patients with HY stages of 1-3 were included in the study. The results showed that long-term physical therapy could improve patients' motor symptoms with combined antiparkinsonian drugs (Z = 2.61 and P = 0.009) and had a significant positive effect on the motor symptoms of patients with discontinued antiparkinsonian drugs (Z = 2.73 and P = 0.006).

The study of high-genetic-risk patients or those already with CD limits our knowledge of dysbiosis that may occur early in life in a generalized population. To explore early gut microbial imbalances correlated with future celiac disease (fCD), we analyzed the stool of 1478 infants aged one year, 26 of whom later acquired CD, with a mean age of diagnosis of 10.96 ± 5.6 years. With a novel iterative control-matching algorithm using the prospective general population cohort, All Babies In Southeast Sweden, we found nine core microbes with prevalence differences and seven differentially abundant bacteria between fCD infants and controls. The differences were validated using 100 separate, iterative permutations of matched controls, which suggests the bacterial signatures are significant in fCD even when accounting for the inherent variability in a general population. This work is the first to our knowledge to demonstrate that gut microbial differences in prevalence and abundance exist in infants aged one year up to 19 years before a diagnosis of CD in a general population.","misc","wim","misc"

Although SINE ncRNAs are generally transcriptionally repressed, they can be induced in response to viral infections and can stimulate immune signaling pathways. Indeed, mutations in RNA Pol III have been associated with poor antiviral interferon response following infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV). In this study, we probed the role of Pol III transcripts in the detection and initial immune response to VZV by characterizing the transcriptional response following VZV infection of wild type A549 lung epithelial cells as well as A549 cells lacking specific RNA sensors MAVS and TLR3, or interferon-stimulated genes RNase L and PKR in presence or absence of functional RNA Pol III. Multiple components of the antiviral sensing and interferon signaling pathways were involved in restricting VZV replication in lung epithelial cells thus suggesting an innate defense system with built-in redundancy. In addition, RNA Pol III silencing altered the antiviral transcriptional program indicating that it plays an essential role in the sensing of VZV infection.","misc","wim","misc"

Evaluate the effect of culture-directed topical antibiotics on sinonasal outcomes in AERD patients with a positive perioperative sinonasal bacterial culture who have undergone ESS. A retrospective cohort study of AERD patients with positive sinonasal culture, who underwent ESS from 2016 to 2021 was performed. Forty-four patients were identified and stratified based on their postoperative medical treatment. Twenty-six underwent postoperative intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) alone, while eighteen underwent INCS plus a 4-weeks treatment with topical antibiotics. SNOT-22 and Lund-Kennedy score (LKS) were assessed preoperatively and at 4-weeks and 4-6 months after ESS.

However, only a statistically significant difference was found in the 4-weeks postoperative LKS when comparing between treatment groups (p=0.01). Our linear regression model demonstrated a relationship between the use of combined therapy with INCS and topical antibiotics and the LKS 4-weeks post ESS (p=0.015). In AERD patients with a confirmed sinus infection, the combination of culture-directed topical antibiotics and intranasal corticosteroid irrigations in the postoperative period can provide a short-term improvement in endoscopic scores.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Appropriate biofilm models are important to develop and improve to make progress in future biofilm research. Here, we investigated the ability of PF hydrogel material to facilitate the development and study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in vitro and in vivo. Wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 bacteria were embedded in PF hydrogel situated in vitro or in vivo, and the following aspects were investigated: 1) biofilm development; 2) host immune response and its effect on the bacteria; and 3) efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Microscopy demonstrated that P. aeruginosa developed typical biofilms inside the PF hydrogels in vitro and in mouse peritoneal cavities where the PF hydrogels were infiltrated excessively by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). The bacteria remained at a level of ~106 colony-forming unit (CFU)/hydrogel for 7 days, indicating that the PMNs could not eradicate the biofilm bacteria. β-Lactam or aminoglycoside mono treatment at 64× minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) killed all bacteria in day 0 in vitro biofilms, but not in day 1 and older biofilms, even at a concentration of 256× MIC. Combination treatment with the antibiotics at 256× MIC completely killed the bacteria in day 1 in vitro biofilms, and combination treatment in most of the cases showed significantly better bactericidal effects than monotherapies. However, in the case of the established in vivo biofilms, the mono and combination antibiotic treatments did not efficiently kill the bacteria. Our results indicate that the bacteria formed typical biofilms in PF hydrogel in vitro and in vivo and that the biofilm bacteria were tolerant against antibiotics and host immunity. The PF hydrogel biofilm model is simple and easy to fabricate and highly reproducible with various application possibilities. We conclude that the PF hydrogel biofilm model is a new platform that will facilitate progress in future biofilm investigations, as well as studies of the efficacy of new potential medicine against biofilm infections.","misc","wim","rodent"

Orf virus (ORFV), a DNA parapoxvirus, can infect its natural ungulate hosts and transmit into humans. Moreover, the ORFV has advantages of low toxicity, high targeted, self-amplification and can induce potent Th1-like immunity. This study explored the therapeutic potential of ORFV infection for human lung cancer therapy and investigated the molecular mechanisms. We used a previously described ORFV NA1/11 strain and tested the oncolysis of ORFV NA1/11 in two lines of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of both cell lines with ORFV NA1/11 resulted in a decrease in cell viability by inducing cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, suppressing cyclin B1 expression and increasing their apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. The ORFV NA1/11-infected lung cancer cells were highly immunogenic. Evidently, ORFV NA1/11 infection of lung cancer cells induced oncolysis of tumor cells to release danger-associated molecular patterns, and promoted dendritic cell maturation, and CD8 T cell infiltration in the tumors by enhancing CXCL16 secretion. These findings may help to understand the molecular mechanisms of ORFV oncolysis and aid in the development of novel therapies for lung cancer.","misc","wim","misc"

Once ABCD3 was selected, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) data were used to analyze the relationship between ABCD3 expression and clinical characteristics in glioma. We also evaluated the influence of ABCD3 on the survival of glioma patients. CIBERSORT and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) were also used to investigate the correlation between ABCD3 and cancer immune infiltrates. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to functionally annotate the potential functions or signaling pathways related to ABCD3 expression. ABCD3 was among the top 5 downregulated genes in glioma cells after oncolytic virus EV-A71 infection and was significantly enriched in several GO categories. Both the mRNA and protein expression levels of ABCD3 were upregulated in glioma samples and associated with the prognosis and grades of glioma patients. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve analysis revealed that patients with high ABCD3 expression had shorter disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) than those with low ABCD3 expression. Moreover, ABCD3 expression could affect the immune infiltration levels and diverse immune marker sets in glioma. A positive correlation was found between ABCD3 and macrophages and active dendritic cells in the microenvironment of both the GBM and LGG. Gene sets including the plk1 pathway, tyrobp causal network, ir-damage and cellular response, and interleukin-10 signaling showed significant differential enrichment in the high ABCD3 expression phenotype. Our results suggested that ABCD3 could be a potential biomarker for glioma prognosis and immunotherapy response and also further enriched the theoretical and molecular mechanisms of oncolytic virus treatment for malignant gliomas.","misc","wim","misc"
"547",35959374,"Streptococcus Mutans Membrane Vesicles Enhance Candida albicans Pathogenicity and Carbohydrate Metabolism.","Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans, as the most common bacterium and fungus in the oral cavity respectively, are considered microbiological risk markers of early childhood caries. S. mutans membrane vesicles (MVs) contain virulence proteins, which play roles in biofilm formation and disease progression. Our previous research found that S. mutans MVs harboring glucosyltransferases augment C. albicans biofilm formation by increasing exopolysaccharide production, but the specific impact of S. mutans MVs on C. albicans virulence and pathogenicity is still unknown. In the present study, we developed C. albicans biofilms on the surface of cover glass, hydroxyapatite discs and bovine dentin specimens. The results showed that C. albicans can better adhere to the tooth surface with the effect of S. mutans MVs. Meanwhile, we employed C. albicans biofilm-bovine dentin model to evaluate the influence of S. mutans MVs on C. albicans biofilm cariogenicity. In the S. mutans MV-treated group, the bovine dentin surface hardness loss was significantly increased and the surface morphology showed more dentin tubule exposure and broken dentin tubules. Subsequently, integrative proteomic and metabolomic approaches were used to identify the differentially expressed proteins and metabolites of C. albicans when cocultured with S. mutans MVs. The combination of proteomics and metabolomics analysis indicated that significantly regulated proteins and metabolites were involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. In summary, the results of the present study proved that S. mutans MVs increase bovine dentin demineralization provoked by C. albicans biofilms and enhance the protein and metabolite expression of C. albicans related to carbohydrate metabolism.","misc","wim","misc"

In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to investigate the diversity and composition of the ocular microbiota in patients with TAO. Patients with TAO did not receive treatment for the disease and did not have exposed keratitis. Patients with TAO (TAO group) and healthy individuals (control group) were compared. All samples were swabbed at the conjunctival vault of the lower eyelid. The V3 to V4 region of the 16S rDNA was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 Sequencing Platform. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze the differences between the groups and the correlation between ocular surface microbiota and the disease. The ocular surface microbiota of patients and healthy individuals were cultured. The ocular surface microbiota structure of TAO patients changed significantly. The average relative abundance of Bacillus and Brevundimonas increased significantly in the TAO group. Corynebacterium had a significantly decreased relative abundance (P<0.05). Paracoccus, Haemophilus, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium were positively correlated with the severity of clinical manifestations or disease activity (P<0.05). Bacillus cereus and other opportunistic pathogens were obtained by culture from TAO patients. This study found that the composition of ocular microbiota in patients with TAO was significantly different from that in healthy individuals. The ocular surface opportunistic pathogens, such as Bacillus, Brevundimonas, Paracoccus, and Haemophilus in TAO patients, increase the potential risk of ocular surface infection. The findings of this study provide a new avenue of research into the mechanism of ocular surface in TAO patients.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

We enrolled 148 patients with migraine and 150 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The serum levels of ALB, TBIL, CRE, and UA were measured in patients with migraine of different subtypes. The risk of migraine was assessed by multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis. The serum levels of ALB, total BIL (TBIL), CRE, and UA were significantly lower in the migraine group than in the HC group (p < 0.05). The ALB and UA levels were lower during migraine attack periods (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences observed in serum ALB, TBIL, CRE, and UA levels between aura/without aura and episodic/chronic migraine subtypes (p > 0.05). The multiple stepwise logistic regression revealed that ALB [odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.89, p < 0.001], TBIL (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.5-0.75, p < 0.001), and UA (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99, p = 0.014) were independently associated with migraine. In addition, the serum levels of ALB, TBIL, and UA were significantly lower in the migraine group when compared by sex. The serum levels of UA, TBIL, ALB, and CRE were lower in the patients with migraine, indicating a lower antioxidant status. In addition, ALB, TBIL, and UA were independently related to migraine. These results could provide insights into the possible role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of migraine.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Few reports have been published on RCD. The present study aimed to characterize the target muscles involved in RCD and the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injection. Patients with consecutive cervical dystonia with RCD as the most problematic feature were retrospectively analyzed over a 10-year period. Target muscles were screened and confirmed based on clinical evaluation, single-photon emission computed tomography, and electromyography. In addition, efficacy and adverse events following BTX-A injection in patients with RCD were evaluated. A total of 34 patients with RCD were included, 18 of whom presented with retrocaput and 16 with retrocollis. The most frequently injected muscles in RCD were splenius capitis (SPCa, 97.1%) and semispinalis capitis (SSCa, 97.1%), followed by levator scapulae (LS, 50.0%), rectus capitis posterior major (RCPM, 47.1%), trapezius (TPZ, 41.2%), and sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM, 41.2%). Besides cervical muscles, the erector spinae was also injected in 17.6% of patients. Most muscles were predominantly bilaterally injected. The injection schemes of retrocaput and retrocollis were similar, possibly because in patients with retrocollis, retrocaput was often combined. BTX-A injection achieved a satisfactory therapeutic effect in RCD, with an average symptom relief rate of 69.0 ± 16.7%. Mild dysphagia (17.6%) and posterior cervical muscle weakness (17.6%) were the most common adverse events. SPCa, SSCa, LS, RCPM, LS, and SCM were commonly and often bilaterally injected in RCD.

Whether and how cerebral gray matter structural damage inherent to the disorder affects cognitive function in patients is still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the changes in cerebral gray matter volume and whether these alterations contribute to cognitive impairment and mood disorders. Forty patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and forty healthy controls (HCs) matched for gender, age, and education were recruited. All participants underwent attention network tests (ANT), neuropsychological tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Voxel-based morphological analysis (VBM) and correlation analysis was performed on all participants. Finally, according to the course of disease, patients were divided into two groups: NMDARE_SD (short duration; course ≤ 2 years since diagnosis) and NMDARE_LD (long duration; course >2 years since diagnosis), to evaluate gray matter volume changes that differ as a function of disease course. Compared to HCs, patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis showed decreased executive control ability and lower MoCA score, while increased anxiety and depression as reflected by HAMA and HAMD24 scores (all P < 0.05). In VBM analysis, patients showed decreased gray matter volume in bilateral thalamus, left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC_L), left superior temporal gyrus (STG_L), and left rectus gyrus. In the analysis stratified by disease course, the NMDARE_LD group exhibited decreased gray matter volume in the left precuneus and right posterior cerebellar lobe compared to the NMDARE_SD group. Patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis have cognitive, executive, and emotional dysfunction, and the sites of gray matter atrophy are concentrated in the thalamus, frontal lobe, and temporal lobe. These abnormalities may be involved in the process of cognitive and affective dysfunction.Patients with different courses of anti-NMDAR encephalitis have different brain atrophy sites. These results may help to clarify the contradiction between clinical and imaging manifestations of anti NMDAR encephalitis, which is worthy of further longitudinal studies.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The symptoms affect the quality of patients' life by impeding normal sleep cycles and causing excessive daytime sleepiness. Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) is a therapy often used for ischemic stroke patients to minimize infarct size and maximize post-stroke neurological function. Animal experiments have shown that RIC plays a protective role for retinal ganglion cells and other critical areas of the brain of Parkinson's disease. However, whether RIC improves excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) for patients with Parkinson's disease remains to be determined. This is a single-center, double-blind, and randomized controlled trial, which includes patients with Parkinson's disease with EDS. All recruited patients will be randomly assigned either to the RIC or the control group (i.e., sham-RIC) with 20 patients in each group. Both groups receive RIC or sham-RIC treatment once a day for 28 days within 24 h of enrollment. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale-2 (PDSS-2), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire39 (PDQ39) score scales, and adverse events, such as inability to tolerate the treatment leading to suspension of the study or objective signs of tissue or neurovascular injury caused by RIC and/or sham-RIC are evaluated at 7, 14, 28, and 90 days after enrollment. The primary goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of the treatments in patients with Parkinson's disease by measuring serious RIC-related adverse events and any reduced incidence of adverse events during the trial and to study potential efficacy, improvement of patients' excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life-based on ESS, PSQI, PDSS-2, and PDQ39 scores. The secondary goal is to confirm the safety of the treatments.

Vestibular migraine patients (n = 20, mean age 45.4 years) who were resistant to conventional prophylactic therapies had BTX-A injection and rs-fMRI before and 2 months after the injection. We also measured the changes in the frequency of vertigo and migraine attacks, symptomatic functional disability scores, and neuropsychiatric inventories. After BTX-A injection, the mean monthly frequencies of migraine and vertigo episodes decreased significantly compared with the baseline (p < 0.01, paired t-test). The Headache Impact Test-6 score and the Migraine Disability Assessment, and the vertigo parameters, measured by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and the Vertigo Symptom Scale, showed an improvement, as did the anxiety and depression scores 2 months after BTX-A treatment. The low-frequency fluctuation analysis of the rs-fMRI data found significant changes in the functional connectivity of the right superior temporal gyrus. Adoption of this cluster as the seed region increased the functional connectivity with the left post-central gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus after BTX-A treatment. This prospective study suggests that BTX-A treatment is effective at ameliorating migraine and vertigo symptoms in VM patients who were resistant to conventional therapies. Along with symptomatic improvements, changes in the functional connectivity within the multisensory vestibular and pain networks suggest a dysmodulation of multimodal sensory integration and abnormal cortical processing of the vestibular and pain signals in VM patients.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Binary logistic regression analysis was used to explore the risk factors for sleep disturbance in MHD patients, including demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters, and that a prediction model was developed on the basis of risk factors by two-way stepwise regression. The final prediction model is displayed by nomogram and verified internally by bootstrap resampling procedure. The prevalence of sleep disturbance and severe sleep disturbance in MHD patients was 63.73 and 26.42%, respectively. Independent risk factors for sleep disturbance in MHD patients included higher 0.1*age (OR = 1.476, 95% CI: 1.103-1.975, P = 0.009), lower albumin (OR = 0.863, 95% CI: 0.771-0.965, P = 0.010), and lower 10*calcium levels (OR = 0.747, 95% CI: 0.615-0.907, P = 0.003). In addition, higher 0.1*age, lower albumin levels, and anxiety were independently associated with severe sleep disturbance in MHD patients. A risk prediction model of sleep disturbance in MHD patients showed that the concordance index after calibration is 0.736, and the calibration curve is approximately distributed along the reference line. Older age, lower albumin and calcium levels are higher risk factors of sleep disturbance in MHD, and the prediction model for the assessment of sleep disturbance in MHD patients has excellent discrimination and calibration.","misc","wim","human_intervention"
"556",35959402,"Chronic anemia: The effects on the connectivity of white matter.","Chronic anemia is commonly observed in patients with hemoglobinopathies, mainly represented by disorders of altered hemoglobin (Hb) structure (sickle cell disease, SCD) and impaired Hb synthesis (e.g. thalassemia syndromes, non-SCD anemia). Both hemoglobinopathies have been associated with white matter (WM) alterations. Novel structural MRI research in our laboratory demonstrated that WM volume was diffusely lower in deep, watershed areas proportional to anemia severity. Furthermore, diffusion tensor imaging analysis has provided evidence that WM microstructure is disrupted proportionally to Hb level and oxygen saturation. SCD patients have been widely studied and demonstrate lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the corticospinal tract and cerebellum across the internal capsule and corpus callosum. In the present study, we compared 19 SCD and 15 non-SCD anemia patients with a wide range of Hb values allowing the characterization of the effects of chronic anemia in isolation of sickle Hb. We performed a tensor analysis to quantify FA changes in WM connectivity in chronic anemic patients. We calculated the volumetric mean of FA along the pathway of tracks connecting two regions of interest defined by BrainSuite's BCI-DNI atlas. In general, we found lower FA values in anemic patients; indicating the loss of coherence in the main diffusion direction that potentially indicates WM injury. We saw a positive correlation between FA and hemoglobin in these same regions, suggesting that decreased WM microstructural integrity FA is highly driven by chronic hypoxia. The only connection that did not follow this pattern was the connectivity within the left middle-inferior temporal gyrus. Interestingly, more reductions in FA were observed in non-SCD patients (mainly along with intrahemispheric WM bundles and watershed areas) than the SCD patients (mainly interhemispheric).","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The 1995 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) guidelines requires histopathological confirmation of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) for a diagnosis of certain MD. Symptoms such as dizziness and ear fullness are important diagnostic features; however, the descriptions provided by patients are frequently vague and non-specific. A recently developed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol to document EH is, therefore, useful for the evaluation of inner ear status in patients with MD. In this study, patients with MD were assessed using MRI and the HYDROPS (HYbriD of Reversed image Of Positive endolymph signal and native image of positive perilymph Signal) protocol to investigate the effectiveness of MRI for visualization of the endolymphatic space in the diagnosis of MD by correlating clinical laboratory parameters with the grade of EH. Of the 123 patients with MD recruited in this study, 80 had definite MD, 11 had probable MD, and 32 had possible MD based on the 1995 AAO-HNS guidelines. The EH grade based on HYDROPS MRI was determined independently by two otorhinolaryngologists and compared with several clinical parameters, including the diagnostic scale of MD (1995 AAO-HNS guidelines), pure tone average (PTA), low tone average (LTA), canal paresis (CP) on the caloric test, and disease duration. Cochlear hydrops and vestibular hydrops were detected in 58 and 80% of 80 definite MD ears, in 33 and 58% of 12 probable MD ears, and in 5 and 27% of 37 possible MD ears, respectively. The proportion of higher hydrops grades increased significantly with grade according to the MD diagnostic scale (p < 0.0001). Both PTA and LTA were significantly higher in patients with hydrops grade 2 than hydrops grade 0 in both the cochlea and the vestibule. CP was significantly higher in patients with grade 2 than grade 0 vestibular hydrops. Disease duration was not associated with hydrops grade. Radiological evaluation of MD using the HYDROPS protocol is useful for evaluation of the extent and severity of EH in the diagnosis of MD based on its pathophysiological mechanism.","misc","wim","protocol"

In this study, mice were randomly allocated into three groups, namely, CCI group, CCI+DC group, and Sham group. The mice in the CCI and CCI+DC groups received CCI after opening a bone window, and after brain injury, immediately returned the bone window to simulate skull condition after a TBI. The CCI+DC group underwent DC and contused tissue removal 6 h after CCI. The mice in the CCI group underwent the same anesthesia process; however, no further treatment of the bone window and trauma was performed. The mice in the Sham group underwent anesthesia and the process of opening the skin and bone window, but not in the CCI group. Changes in Modified Neurological Severity Score, rotarod performance, Morris water maze, intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB), inflammatory factors, neuronal apoptosis, and glial cell expression were evaluated. Compared with the CCI group, the CCI+DC group had significantly lower ICP, superior neurological and motor function at 24 h after injury, and less severe BBB damage after injury. Most inflammatory cytokine expressions and the number of apoptotic cells in the brain tissue of mice in the CCI+DC group were lower than in the CCI group at 3 days after injury, with markedly reduced astrocyte and microglia expression. However, the degree of brain edema in the CCI+DC group was greater than in the CCI group, and neurological and motor functions, as well as spatial cognitive and learning ability, were significantly poorer at 14 days after injury.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Mangiferin is a polyphenolic compound abundant in the leaves of Mangifera indica L. that has robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential candidate for preventive or co-adjuvant therapy in schizophrenia. Hence, this study set-out to evaluate the effect of mango leaf extract (MLE) in a model of schizophrenia based on maternal immune activation, in which Poly I:C (4 mg/kg) is administered intravenously to pregnant rats. Young adult (postnatal day 60-70) or adolescent (postnatal day 35-49) male offspring received MLE (50 mg/kg of mangiferin) daily, and the effects of MLE in adolescence were compared to those of risperidone, assessing behavior, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and oxidative/inflammatory and antioxidant mediators in the adult offspring. MLE treatment in adulthood reversed the deficit in prepulse inhibition (PPI) but it failed to attenuate the sensitivity to amphetamine and the deficit in novel object recognition (NOR) induced. By contrast, adolescent MLE treatment prevented the sensorimotor gating deficit in the PPI test, producing an effect similar to that of risperidone. This MLE treatment also produced a reduction in grooming behavior, but it had no effect on anxiety or novel object recognition memory. MRI studies revealed that adolescent MLE administration partially counteracted the cortical shrinkage, and cerebellum and ventricle enlargement. In addition, MLE administration in adolescence reduced iNOS mediated inflammatory activation and it promoted the expression of biomarkers of compensatory antioxidant activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as witnessed through the reduction of Keap1 and the accumulation of NRF2 and HO1. Together, these findings suggest that MLE might be an alternative therapeutic or preventive add-on strategy to improve the clinical expression of schizophrenia in adulthood, while also modifying the time course of this disease at earlier stages in populations at high-risk.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"562",35959429,"Isochlorogenic Acid C Alleviates High-Fat Diet-Induced Hyperlipemia by Promoting Cholesterol Reverse Transport.","Background: Promoting cholesterol reverse transport (RCT) has been proven to be a promising hyperlipidemia therapy since it is more effective for the treatment of atherosclerosis (AS) caused by hyperlipidemia. Liver X receptor (LXR) agonists can accelerate RCT, but most of them trigger undesirable liver steatosis due to the activation of liver LXRα. Aim: We aim to figure out whether isochlorogenic acid C (ICAC) facilitates RCT without causing hepatic steatosis. Methods: In vitro study, we established foam macrophages and macrophages with loaded NBD-cholesterol models to investigate the competence of RCT promoting ICAC. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to verify ICAC's regulation of RCT and NF-κB inflammatory pathways. In this in vivo study, male 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to investigate ICAC's anti-hyperlipidemic effect and its functions in regulating RCT. The anti-hyperlipidemic effect of ICAC was evaluated by blood and liver lipid levels, liver hematoxylin, oil red o staining, and liver coefficient. Finally, mRNA levels of genes involved in RCT and inflammation pathways in the liver and intestine were detected by RT-qPCR. Results: ICAC prevented macrophages from foaming by up-regulating the LXRα mediated RCT pathway and down-regulating expression of the cholesterol absorption genes LDLR and CD36, as well as suppressing iNOS, COX2, and IL-1β inflammatory factors. In HFD-fed mice, ICAC significantly lowered the lipid level both in the serum and the liver. Mechanistic studies showed that ICAC strengthened the RCT pathway in the liver and intestine but didn't affect liver LXRα. Furthermore, ICAC impeded both adipogenesis and the inflammatory response in the liver. Conclusion: ICAC accelerated RCT without affecting liver LXRα, thus resulting in a lipid-lowering effect without increasing liver adipogenesis. Our results indicated that ICAC could be a new RCT promoter for hyperlipidemia treatment without causing liver steatosis.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of immunosuppressants do not have final conclusion. Thus, a pairwise and network meta-analysis (NMA) was carried out to seek the most recommended therapeutic schedule for patients with IMN. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including cyclophosphamide (CTX), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus-combined mycophenolate mofetil (TAC + MMF), cyclosporine (CsA), tacrolimus (TAC), leflunomide (LEF), chlorambucil (CH), azathioprine (AZA), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), non-immunosuppressive therapies (CON), steroids (STE), mizoribine (MZB), and rituximab (RIT) for patients with IMN were checked. Risk ratios (RRs) and standard mean difference (SMD) were reckoned to assess dichotomous variable quantities and continuous variable quantities, respectively. Total remission (TR) and 24-h urine total protein (24-h UTP) were compared using pairwise and NMA. Then interventions were ranked on the basis of the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Results: Our study finally included 51 RCTs and 12 different immunosuppressants. Compared with the CON group, most regimens demonstrated better therapeutic effect in TR, with RR of 2.1 (95% CI) (1.5-2.9) for TAC, 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for RIT, 2.5 (1.2-5.2) for TAC + MMF, 1.9 (1.4-2.7) for CH, 1.8 (1.4-2.4) for CTX, 2.2 (1.0-4.7) for ACTH, 1.6 (1.2-2.1) for CsA, 1.6 (1.0-2.5) for LEF, and 1.6 (1.1-2.2) for MMF. In terms of 24-h UTP, TAC (SMD, -2.3 (95% CI -3.5 to -1.1)), CTX (SMD, -1.7 (95% CI -2.8 to -0.59)), RIT (SMD, -1.8 (95% CI -3.5 to -0.11)), CH (SMD, -2.4 (95% CI -4.3 to -0.49)), AZA (SMD, --4.2 (95% CI -7.7 to -0.68)), and CsA (SMD, -1.7 (95% CI -3 to -0.49)) were significantly superior than the CON group. As for adverse effects (AEs), infections, nausea, emesia, myelosuppression, and glucose intolerance were the collective adverse events for most immunosuppressants. Conclusion: This study indicates that TAC + MMF performed the best in terms of TR, and TAC shows the best effectiveness on 24-h UTP compared with other regimens. On the contrary, there seems to be little advantage on STE alone, LEF, AZA, and MZB in treating patients with IMN compared with CON.

However, those monoamine-based antidepressants used in clinical practice have been found to have various limitations. Therefore, currently it is very necessary to explore novel antidepressant targets and medications. As a main active component extracted from Scutellariae radix, oroxylin A possesses many pharmacological functions such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammation and neuroprotection. Here, the present study aims to investigate whether oroxylin A possess antidepressant-like actions using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and chronic restraint stress (CRS) models of depression, forced swim test, tail suspension test, open field test, sucrose preference test, western blotting, immunofluorescence and viral-mediated gene interference. Our results revealed that treatment of oroxylin A fully prevented both the CUMS-induced and CRS-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice. Moreover, the protecting effects of oroxylin A against CUMS and CRS on mice behaviors were accompanied with a significant enhancement on the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated tyrosine kinase B (pTrkB), phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (pCREB) and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Furthermore, genetic knockdown of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus remarkably abolished the antidepressant-like efficacy of oroxylin A in both the CUMS and CRS models of depression, proving that the hippocampal BDNF-TrkB system participates in the antidepressant mechanism of oroxylin A. In summary, our findings are the first evidence showing that oroxylin A possesses potential of being an antidepressant candidate.","rodent","wim","rodent"

In the present study, a mouse NAFLD model was established by administering a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD). The protective effects of the aqueous extract of PE (AEPE) on the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites in NAFLD mice were detected by performing 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. The administration of middle- and high-dose AEPE decreased the levels of ALT, AST, LDL-C, TG, and Hyp and increased HDL-C levels in CDAHFD-fed mice. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), Oil Red O, and Masson's trichrome staining indicated that AEPE treatment attenuated hepatic steatosis and fibrotic lesions. Moreover, the disordered intestinal microflora was remodeled by AEPE, including decreases in the abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae, Faecalibaculum, and Romboutsia. The untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that AEPE restored the disturbed glutathione metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis of the gut bacterial community in NAFLD mice, which strongly correlated with hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Collectively, AEPE potentially ameliorates NAFLD induced by a CDAHFD through a mechanism associated with its modulatory effects on the gut microbiota and microbial metabolism.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"566",35959435,"An Overview of Systematic Reviews of Chinese Herbal Medicine in the Treatment of Migraines.","Background: In the past, systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) have been used to assess the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in the treatment of migraines. However, robust conclusions have not yet been determined because of variations in the methodological and evidence quality of these SRs/MAs. Objectives: We aimed to assess the methodological and reporting quality of SRs/MAs and evaluate the available evidence of the efficacy of CHM treatment of migraines. Methods: We searched eight electronic databases from inception until 10 January 2022, without language restrictions. Two researchers were independently responsible for study screening and data extraction. The methodological and reporting quality of SRs/MAs were assessed using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). The evidence quality of included SRs/MAs was evaluated by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). In addition, a descriptive analysis of the included SRs/MAs was included. Results: Sixteen SRs/MAs, including 69 outcomes, were finally included in this overview. Data synthesis of the included SRs/MAs outcomes showed that CHM plus Western medicine (WM) was beneficial in the improvement of migraines. In comparison, there was conflicting evidence for the effectiveness of CHM used alone. CHM was better than WM in improving responder rate and acute medication usage and was superior to placebo in improving migraine days, responder rate, and migraine duration. However, there was insufficient evidence to verify the effectiveness of CHM for migraine treatment regarding pain severity and migraine frequency. All the included SRs/MAs showed extremely low methodological and reporting quality. The results of the GRADE system indicated that the quality of most of the pooled evidence was very low. Conclusions: CHM may be beneficial in improving migraines and can be used as a complementary therapy. However, we should treat the conclusions of the evaluated SRs/MAs cautiously because of the low quality of evidence. Future SRs/MAs should focus on improving methodological and reporting quality. High-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to provide strong evidence for the efficacy of CHM treatment of migraines.","systematic_review","wim","systematic_review"

In this study, C57BL/6J male mice were fed with HFD combined with PPH gavage (50 mg/kg/d) for 16 weeks, and body weight was measured once a week. After that, serum, adipose, and liver tissues were collected for physiological and biochemical analyses. Our research indicated that PPH treatment alleviated obesity in HFD-fed mice. PPH alleviated fat accumulation in serum, liver, and adipose tissues. In addition, PPH activated the AMPK-HSL/ACC pathway in epididymal adipose tissue to reduce lipid accumulation. Moreover, PPH turned white adipose into brown and activated the PGC 1α-UCP 1-mitochondrial pathway in scapular adipose tissue to generate more heat. Interestingly, PPH regulated colonic microbiota homeostasis in obese mice, including significant elevation of Roseburia and Eubacterium and marked reduction of Helicobacter. Moreover, Spearman's correlation analysis demonstrated that regulation of gut microbiota can decrease lipid accumulation. In summary, our study illustrated that PPH possesses the potential to be developed as an anti-obesity agent.","rodent","wim","rodent"

DC. and Deverra. triradiata Hochst. ex Bioss are perennial desert shrubs widely used traditionally for many purposes and they are characteristic for their essential oil. The objective of the present study was to investigate the in vivo wound healing activity of the essential oil (EO) of D. tortuosa and D. triradiata through their encapsulation into nanoemulsion. EO nanoemulsion was prepared using an aqueous phase titration method, and nanoemulsion zones were identified through the construction of phase diagrams. The EO was prepared by hydrodistillation (HD), microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD), and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and analyzed using GC/MS. D. tortuosa oil is rich in the non-oxygenated compound, representing 74.54, 73.02, and 41.19% in HD, MADH, and SFE, respectively, and sabinene represents the major monoterpene hydrocarbons. Moreover, D. triradiata is rich in oxygenated compounds being 69.77, 52.87, and 61.69% in HD, MADH, and SFE, respectively, with elemicin and myristicin as major phenylpropanoids. Topical application of the nanoemulsion of D. tortuosa and D. triradiata (1% or 2%) exhibited nearly 100% wound contraction and complete healing at day 16. Moreover, they exhibit significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and a significant increase in growth factors and hydroxyproline levels. Histopathological examination exhibited complete re-epithelialization accompanied by activated hair follicles and abundant collagen fibers, especially at a concentration of 2%. Therefore, the incorporation of the two Deverra species into nanoemulsion could professionally endorse different stages of wound healing.","misc","wim","misc"

Previous studies have shown that senescent cells, such as fibroblasts and type II airway epithelial cells, are strongly implicated in the development of pulmonary fibrosis pathology. However, the role of senescent macrophages during silicosis remains unclear. We investigated the effects of quercetin on macrophage senescence and pulmonary fibrosis, and explored underlying mechanisms. Mice were randomized to six model groups. Vitro model was also established by culturing RAW264.7 macrophages with silica (SiO2). We examined the effects of quercetin on fibrosis, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity, and senescence-specific genes (p16, p21, and p53). We showed that quercetin reduced pulmonary fibrosis and inhibited extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. Quercetin also attenuated macrophage senescence induced by SiO2 both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, quercetin significantly decreased the expressions of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), including proinflammatory factors (interleukin-1α (Il-1α), Il-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2, MMP9, and MMP12). In conclusion, quercetin mediated its anti-fibrotic effects by inhibiting macrophage senescence, possibly via SASP.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Oligodendrocyte (OL) dysfunction is associated with the pathogenesis of depression and the promotion of hippocampal oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination could be a novel therapeutic strategy for ameliorating depressive behaviors. Recent studies have shown that activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) by GW3965 improves depressive phenotypes, but the effects of GW3965 on OL function and myelination in the hippocampus of depression remain relatively unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of GW3965 on mature OL in the hippocampus and on the myelin sheaths of mice subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Behavioral tests were performed to assess depressive behaviors. Then, the number of mature OLs (CC1+) in each hippocampal subregion was precisely quantified with immunohistochemical and stereological methods, and the density of newborn mature OLs (BrdU+/Olig2+/CC1+ cells) in each hippocampal subregion was quantified with immunofluorescence. In addition, myelin basic protein (MBP) staining intensity in the cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) region was assessed by using immunofluorescence. We found that both the number of CC1+ OLs and the density of BrdU+/Olig2+/CC1+ cells were obviously decreased in each hippocampal subregion of mice subjected to CUS, and 4 weeks of GW3965 treatment reversed these effects only in the CA3 region. Furthermore, the decreased MBP expression in the CA3 region of mice subjected to CUS was ameliorated by GW3965 treatment. Collectively, these results suggested that improvement of OL maturation and enhancement of myelination may be structural mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of LXR agonists.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Individual heterogeneity is evident, and the prevalence rate ranges between 6 and 15% globally. The prevalence rate of PCOS in Chinese women of childbearing age is 5.6%. The main manifestations are infertility, sparse menstruation, irregular vaginal bleeding, long-term endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer. PCOS is often associated with hyperandrogenemia, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and intestinal flora disorder. Although there have been many studies in the past, the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of the disease is still unclear. Studies have shown that PCOS diseases and related complications are closely related to local oxidative stress imbalance in the endometrium, leading to poor endometrial receptivity and effects on pregnancy. Previous reviews have mainly focused on the abnormal mechanism of ovarian oxidative stress in women with PCOS, while reviews on endometrial receptivity and oxidative stress are relatively insufficient. This study reviews the abnormal cellular and molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress due to comorbidities in women with PCOS, leading to a downregulation of endometrial receptivity.","misc","wim","misc"
"572",35959447,"Binding Domain Characterization of Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor.","Activation of ghrelin receptor growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) by endogenous or synthetic ligands amplifies pulsatile release of growth hormone (GH) and enhances food intake, very relevant to development and growth. GHS-R is a G-protein coupled receptor that has great druggable potential. Understanding the precise ligand and receptor interactions is crucial to advance the application of GHS-R. We used radiolabeled ligand-binding assay and growth hormone release assay to assess the binding and functional characteristics of GHS-R to synthetic agonists MK-0677 and GHS-25, as well as to endogenous peptide ligand ghrelin. We analyzed the ligand-dependent activity of GHS-R by measuring aequorin-based [Ca++]i responses. To define a ligand-binding pocket of GHS-R, we generated a series of human/puffer fish GHS-R chimeras by domain swapping, as well as a series of mutants by site-directed mutagenesis. We found that the synthetic ligands have high binding affinity to GHS-R in the in vitro competitive binding assay. Remarkably, the in vivo GH secretagogue activity is higher with the synthetic agonists MK-0677 and GHS-25 than that of ghrelin. Importantly, the activity was completely abolished in GHS-R knockout mice. In GHS-R chimera analysis, we identified the C-terminal region, particularly the transmembrane domain 6 (TM6), to be critical for the ligand-dependent activity. Our site-directed mutagenesis study further revealed that amino acid residues D99 and W276 in GHS-R are essential for ligand binding. Interestingly, critical residues distinctively interact with different ligands, MK-0677 activation depends on E124, while ghrelin and GHS-25 preferentially interact with F279. The ligand-binding pocket of human GHS-R is mainly defined by interactive residues in TM6 and the adjacent region of the receptor. This novel finding in GHS-R binding domains advances the structural/ functional understanding of GHS-R, which will help to select/design better GHS-R agonists/ antagonists for future therapeutic applications.","misc","wim","misc"
"573",35959451,"Right Ventricle Remodeling in Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension.","Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is an underdiagnosed, but potentially curable pulmonary vascular disease. The increased pulmonary vascular resistance in CTEPH is caused by unresolved proximal thrombus and secondary microvasculopathy in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to adaptive and maladaptive remodeling of the right ventricle (RV), eventual right heart failure, and death. Knowledge on the RV remodeling process in CTEPH is limited. The progression to RV failure in CTEPH is a markedly slower process. A detailed understanding of the pathophysiology and underlying mechanisms of RV remodeling may facilitate early diagnosis and the development of targeted therapy. While ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, right heart catheterization, and serum biomarkers have been used to assess cardiac function, the current treatment strategies reduce the afterload of the right heart, but are less effective in improving the maladaptive remodeling of the right heart. This review systematically summarizes the current knowledge on adaptive and maladaptive remodeling of the right heart in CTEPH from molecular mechanisms to clinical practice.","misc","wim","misc"

Data were collected from the National Survey of Thyroid Disorders and Diabetes (the Thyroid Disease, Iodine Status, and Diabetes National Epidemiological survey [TIDE]), a cross-sectional investigation conducted during 2015-2017. Using a random, multistage, and stratified sampling strategy, a representative sample (78,130 participants aged 18 years and above) was selected from the general population in 31 provinces of mainland China. The weighted prevalence rates of HUA and gout were calculated, and the related risk factors were analyzed. The weighted prevalence rates of HUA and gout in Chinese adults were 17.7% and 3.2%, respectively. The prevalence of HUA in males linearly decreased with age, while the prevalence in females showed the opposite trend (both P for trend < 0.01). The prevalence rate of gout exhibited a rising tendency with age in both genders (both P for trend < 0.05). The HUA and gout prevalence rates in males were the highest in Han and Tibetan nationalities, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that the morbidities of HUA and gout were differentially associated with age, residence location, nationality, smoking, and other complicating metabolic diseases in the two genders. There are relatively high prevalence rates of gout and HUA in China, which is currently a developing country.

"576",35959487,"Miro proteins and their role in mitochondrial transfer in cancer and beyond.","Mitochondria are organelles essential for tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Although their main cellular function, generation of energy in the form of ATP is dispensable for cancer cells, their capability to drive their adaptation to stress originating from tumor microenvironment makes them a plausible therapeutic target. Recent research has revealed that cancer cells with damaged oxidative phosphorylation import healthy (functional) mitochondria from surrounding stromal cells to drive pyrimidine synthesis and cell proliferation. Furthermore, it has been shown that energetically competent mitochondria are fundamental for tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis. The spatial positioning and transport of mitochondria involves Miro proteins from a subfamily of small GTPases, localized in outer mitochondrial membrane. Miro proteins are involved in the structure of the MICOS complex, connecting outer and inner-mitochondrial membrane; in mitochondria-ER communication; Ca2+ metabolism; and in the recycling of damaged organelles via mitophagy. The most important role of Miro is regulation of mitochondrial movement and distribution within (and between) cells, acting as an adaptor linking organelles to cytoskeleton-associated motor proteins. In this review, we discuss the function of Miro proteins in various modes of intercellular mitochondrial transfer, emphasizing the structure and dynamics of tunneling nanotubes, the most common transfer modality. We summarize the evidence for and propose possible roles of Miro proteins in nanotube-mediated transfer as well as in cancer cell migration and metastasis, both processes being tightly connected to cytoskeleton-driven mitochondrial movement and positioning.","misc","wim","misc"
"577",35959489,"Exosomes in osteoarthritis: Updated insights on pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.","Osteoarthritis (OA) has remained a prevalent public health problem worldwide over the past decades. OA is a global challenge because its specific pathogenesis is unclear, and no effective disease-modifying drugs are currently available. Exosomes are small and single-membrane vesicles secreted via the formation of endocytic vesicles and multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are eventually released when MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane. Exosomes contain various integral surface proteins derived from cells, intercellular proteins, DNAs, RNAs, amino acids, and metabolites. By transferring complex constituents and promoting macrophages to generate chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines, exosomes function in pathophysiological processes in OA, including local inflammation, cartilage calcification and degradation of osteoarthritic joints. Exosomes are also detected in synovial fluid and plasma, and their levels continuously change with OA progression. Thus, exosomes, specifically exosomal miRNAs and lncRNAs, potentially represent multicomponent diagnostic biomarkers for OA. Exosomes derived from various types of mesenchymal stem cells and other cell or tissue types affect angiogenesis, inflammation, and bone remodeling. These exosomes exhibit promising capabilities to restore OA cartilage, attenuate inflammation, and balance cartilage matrix formation and degradation, thus demonstrating therapeutic potential in OA. In combination with biocompatible and highly adhesive materials, such as hydrogels and cryogels, exosomes may facilitate cartilage tissue engineering therapies for OA. Based on numerous recent studies, we summarized the latent mechanisms and clinical value of exosomes in OA in this review.","misc","wim","misc"

However, despite the presence of enteric ganglia in the small intestine, both human patients and Ednrb-/- mice suffer from dysmotility and altered gastrointestinal function, thus raising the possibility of enteric nervous system (ENS) abnormalities proximal to the aganglionic region. We undertook the present study to determine whether abnormalities with the ENS in ganglionated regions may account for abnormal gastrointestinal function. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on ENS cells from the small intestine of Ednrb-/- mice and compared the results to a published single-cell dataset. Our results identified a missing population of neurons marked by the enzyme Gad2, which catalyzes the production of γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the small intestine of Ednrb-/- animals. This result was confirmed by immunostaining enteric ganglia from Ednrb-/- mice and their wild-type littermates. These data show for the first time that ganglionated regions of the Hirschsprung gut lack a neuronal subpopulation, which may explain the persistent gastrointestinal dysfunction after surgical correction of Hirschsprung disease.","misc","wim","rodent"

Piezobrush® PZ2, a handheld CAP unit based on the piezoelectric direct discharge technology, was used to generate and deliver non-thermal plasma. Firstly, CAPPZ2 treatment inhibited the proliferation of HT29 colorectal cancer cells and A549 lung cancer cells using CCK8 assay, caused morphological changes at the cellular and subcellular levels using transmission electron microscopy, and suppressed both types of tumor cell migration and invasion using the Transwell migration and Matrigel invasion assay. Secondly, we confirmed plasma-induced apoptosis in the HT29 and A549 cells using the AO/EB staining coupled with flow cytometry, and verified the production of apoptosis-related proteins, such as cytochrome c, PARP, cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9, Bcl-2 and Bax, using western blotting. Finally, the aforementioned in vitro results were tested in vivo using cell-derived xenograft mouse models, and the anticancer effect was confirmed and attributed to CAP-mediated apoptosis. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expression of cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP and Bax were upregulated whereas that of Bcl-2 downregulated after CAP treatment.

This study is sub-analysis of a previous cost-effectiveness study with a target population of unscreened women without cervical cancer aged ≥ 25 years. A recursive decision-tree with one-year cycles was used to model the life-long natural HPV history. Markov cohort simulations were used to assess the expected outcomes from the model. The outcomes of three strategies were compared with the absence of screening: HPV-testing on self-collected vaginal samples (Self-HPV) followed by colposcopy (Self-HPV/colpo), Self-HPV and triage with cytology (Self-HPV/PAP), cytology and triage with HPV (PAP/HPV). All screening strategies resulted in reductions in cancer cases and deaths. Self-HPV strategies were associated with a lower cancer incidence and mortality life-long, not only when performed every 3 years but also when Self-HPV was performed every 5 years vs cytology every 3 years. The gain in life expectancy obtained was 82 days with Self-HPV/colpo, 81 days with Self-HPV/PAP and 75 days with PAP/HPV compared to no screening. The number of lifetime total visits was greater with PAP/HPV compared with the Self-HPV strategies (13.13 vs < 3). The number of conizations remained relatively stable with the change of screening frequency and strategy. Self-HPV may represent a reasonable balance of harms and benefits when performed every 5 years compared to cytology every 3 years. Self-HPV/PAP yielded the most efficient harm to benefit ratio when using colposcopy as a proxy for harms.","misc","wim","misc"

Next, a co-expression network was constructed by the weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and the key co-expressed immune related genes were identified on the basis of existing human immune related genes. Afterwards, we utilized bioinformatics algorithms including GSVA, CIBERSORT and ssGSEA to clarify the relationship between hub genes and immune infiltration pattern. Finally, these hub genes were used to evaluate the sensitivity to immunotherapy by the subclass mapping algorithm, which were further validated by digital pathology through the Hover-Net algorithm. Sixteen immune-related genes with robust expression characteristics were identified and used to build gene signature. The expression of gene signature was significantly related to the immune infiltration pattern and immunotherapy sensitivity prediction in patients with esophageal cancer. Consistent with previous studies, genetic changes at the level of somatic mutations such as NFE2L2 were revealed. . A total of 16 immune-related genes with the total expression gene signature can be used as biomarkers for immunotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

In recent years, the Polio Eradication Initiative has been making steady progress with good campaign coverage and low numbers of polio cases. However, in 2019 Pakistan reported 146 cases compared to 12 in 2018. A major factor cited for this regression was a surge in vaccine refusals by parents and caretakers. To assess the reasons for the refusal of polio vaccination in Quetta Block, Balochistan. The study was conducted using data acquired from 2 polio vaccination campaigns over 3 months in 2019. The data were collected in Quetta Block, a highly endemic zone having continuous transmission of the polio virus over several years. The data were analysed using the statistical software, SPSS, version 20. We used descriptive statistics to demonstrate the characteristics of the study population. Categorical variables were measured as frequencies and percentages. Refusal rates were almost 8.6% for the polio campaign of April and 8.1% for June 2019. Misconceptions about vaccines made up 56.4% of reasons for refusals, followed by religion 16%. Misconceptions about the vaccine are the main driving force behind vaccine refusals in the study setting. Efficient strategies are required to address misconceptions in this red zone of poliovirus transmission in Balochistan. فهم الأسباب الكامنة وراء رفض الأسر للقاح شلل الأطفال في مقاطعة كويتا، باكستان. محمد سمسور زراق، حمايال سانا، زارا أرشاد، أنوم سليم، مزهجان شاه، هلماند طارين، سامي الله، سابا بالوش، صالحة كاكار، كلسوم كاكار. إن استئصال شلل الأطفال هدف عالمي لم يتحقق بعدُ في بلدان مثل باكستان. وعلى مدى السنوات الأخيرة، أحرزت مبادرة استئصال شلل الأطفال تقدمًا مطردًا بفضل التغطية الجيدة بالحملات وانخفاض عدد حالات الإصابة بشلل الأطفال. ومع ذلك، أبلغت باكستان عن 146 حالة في عام 2019 في مقابل 12 حالة في عام 2018. ومن العوامل الرئيسية التي أشير إليها في هذا التراجع الزيادة الكبيرة في حالات رفض الوالدين ومقدمي الرعاية للقاحات. هدفت هذه الدراسة الى تقييم الأسباب وراء رفض التطعيم ضد شلل الأطفال في مقاطعة كويتا بلوك، في بلوشستان. أجريت الدراسة على بيانات جرى الحصول عليها من حملتين للتطعيم ضد شلل الأطفال على مدى 3 أشهر في عام 2019. وجُُمعت البيانات في منطقة كويتا بلوك، وهي منطقة شديدة التوطن تعاني من استمرار انتقال فيروس شلل الأطفال على مدى السنوات العديدة الماضية. وجرى تحليل البيانات على منصة برمجيات إحصائية. واستخدمنا الإحصاءات الوصفية لتوضيح خصائص مجموعة الدراسة. وقيست المتغيرات الفئوية مثل التواتر والنسبة المئوية. بلغت معدلات الرفض 8.6٪ تقريبًا لحملة شلل الأطفال في أبريل / نيسان و8.1٪ في يونيو / حزيران 2019. وشكلت المفاهيم الخاطئة عن اللقاحات 56.4٪ من إجمالي حالات الرفض، تلتها 16٪ من حالات الرفض لأسباب دينية. تُعَدُّ المفاهيم الخاطئة عن اللقاح القوة الدافعة الرئيسية وراء رفض أخذ اللقاح. ولا بد من وضع استراتيجيات فعالة للتصدي لهذه المفاهيم الخاطئة لإزالة التحفظات على اللقاحات في المنطقة الحمراء لانتقال فيروس شلل الأطفال في بلوشستان.

"586",35959667,"Emerging challenges to realizing global polio eradication and their solutions.","The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) promised to eradicate polio by 2000, yet the disease remains endemic in 2 countries. The current threat of resurgence in countries with low vaccine coverage and circulating vaccinederived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks due to oral polio vaccine warrants a strategy review. To review the performance of the GPEI from a context based in Pakistan, identifying threats to success and suggesting strategy modifications to help achieve eradication. This was a desk review of the effectiveness of GPEI that was launched in 1988 to eradicate polio by 2000. Subsequent failure to eradicate led to multiple iterations in strategy and planning documents. These documents were reviewed alongside relevant literature to explore the reasons for failure and emergence of cVDPV. GPEI has been effective in reducing the global polio disease burden by > 99%, but it remains endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan. cVDPV has caused multiple outbreaks since 2000, and caused 7 times more cases than wild poliovirus (WPV) globally in 2020. The Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018 aimed to eradicate WPV and cVDPV simultaneously. In 2019, Pakistan saw an upsurge in WPV amid an outbreak of cVDPV infection that continued throughout 2020. Wild polio eradication was not realized and the country was unable to transition to inactivated polio vaccine as predicted in the strategic plan. Over 20 countries now report cVDPV outbreaks and many others are at risk. A country-specific modified strategy is required to eradicate WPV and cVDPV simultaneously, more so in endemic countries. التحديات الناشئة أمام تحقيق استئصال شلل الأطفال عالميًّا وحلولها. محمد سلطان. وعدت «المبادرة العالمية لاستئصال شلل الأطفال» باستئصاله بحلول عام 2000، ومع ذلك ما يزال المرض متوطنًا في بلدين. ويستدعي التهديد الحالي بعودة ظهور الفيروس في البلدان ذات التغطية المنخفضة باللقاحات وفاشيات فيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات بسبب اللقاح الفموي لشلل الأطفال استعراضًا للمبادرة. هدفت هذه الدراسة الىى استعراض أداء المبادرة العالمية لاستئصال شلل الأطفال في سياق باكستان، وتحديد التهديدات التي تواجه النجاح، واقتراح تعديلات على الاستراتيجية للمساعدة على تحقيق الاستئصال. كان هذا استعراضًا مكتبيًّا لفعالية «المبادرة العالمية لاستئصال شلل الأطفال» التي أُطلقت في عام 1988، لاستئصاله بحلول عام 2000. وقد أدى الفشل اللاحق في القضاء على المرض إلى تكرارات متعددة في وثائق الاستراتيجية والتخطيط. وكذلك روجعت هذه الوثائق إلى جانب المؤلفات ذات الصلة لاستكشاف أسباب الفشل وظهور فيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات. كانت «المبادرة العالمية لاستئصال شلل الأطفال» فعالة في خفض العبء العالمي للمرض بنسبة تزيد على 99٪، لكنه ما يزال متوطنًا في باكستان وأفغانستان. وقد تسببت فيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات في فاشيات متعددة منذ عام 2000، وتسببت في حالات إصابة أكثر 7 مرات من الحالات بسبب فيروس شلل الأطفال البري على الصعيد العالمي في عام 2020. واستهدفت «الخطة الاستراتيجية لاستئصال شلل الأطفال» والشوط الأخير من استئصاله 2013–2018 استئصال فيروس شلل الأطفال البََرِّي وفيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات في الوقت نفسه. وفي عام 2019، شهدت باكستان ارتفاعًا مفاجئًا في فيروس شلل الأطفال البري وسط فاشية لعدوى فيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات استمرت طوال عام 2020. ولم يتحقق استئصال شلل الأطفال البري، ولم يتمكن البلد من التحول إلى لقاح شلل الأطفال المعطَّل على النحو المتوقع في الخطة الاستراتيجية. أبلغ الآن أكثر من 20 بلدًا عن فاشيات فيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات، أيضًا هناك بلدان كثيرة أخرى معرضة للخطر. ويلزم وضع استراتيجية مُعدَّلة خاصة بكل بلد لاستئصال فيروس شلل الأطفال البََرِّي وفيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات في الوقت نفسه، وينطبق ذلك أكثر على البلدان التي يتوطن بها هذا المرض. Nouveaux obstacles à l'éradication mondiale de la poliomyélite et solutions pour y remédier. L'Initiative mondiale pour l'éradication de la poliomyélite (IMEP) s'est engagée à éradiquer la maladie à l'horizon 2000, mais celle-ci reste endémique dans deux pays. La menace actuelle de résurgence dans les pays ayant une faible couverture vaccinale et des flambées épidémiques de poliovirus circulants dérivés d'une souche vaccinale (PVDVc) imputables au vaccin antipoliomyélitique oral justifie un examen de la stratégie. Examiner les performances de l'IMEP dans le contexte pakistanais, en identifiant les obstacles à la réussite et en suggérant des modifications de la stratégie pour parvenir à l'éradication. Le présent article constitue un examen documentaire de l'efficacité de l'IMEP, qui a été lancée en 1988 pour éradiquer la poliomyélite à l'horizon 2000. Par la suite, l'échec de l'éradication de la maladie a conduit à plusieurs itérations dans la stratégie et la planification. Ces documents de stratégie et de planification ont été examinés parallèlement à la littérature pertinente afin d'explorer les raisons de l'échec et de l'émergence de PVDVc. L'IMEP a réussi à réduire la charge mondiale de morbidité due à la poliomyélite de plus de 99 %, mais la maladie reste endémique en Afghanistan et au Pakistan. De multiples flambées de PVDVc ont eu lieu depuis 2000 et le nombre de cas enregistrés de PVDVc dans le monde en 2020 était sept fois supérieur à celui des cas de poliovirus sauvages (PVS). Le Plan stratégique pour l'éradication de la poliomyélite et la phase finale 2013-2018 visait à éradiquer simultanément le PVS et le PVDVc. En 2019, le Pakistan a connu une recrudescence du poliovirus sauvage dans un contexte de flambée de PVDVc qui s'est poursuivie tout au long de 2020. L'éradication du poliovirus sauvage n'a pas été réalisée et le pays n'a pas été en mesure de mener la transition vers le vaccin antipoliomyélitique inactivé comme le prévoyait le Plan stratégique. Aujourd'hui, plus de 20 pays signalent des flambées épidémiques dues à des PVDVc et de nombreux autres sont à risque. Une stratégie modifiée spécifique au pays est nécessaire pour éradiquer simultanément le PVS et le PVDVc, en particulier dans les pays d'endémie.","misc","wim","misc"

We aimed to group and organize the clinicopathological and epidemiological features of GC in the Arab World and compare with data from Western countries. To obtain the highest number of topic-related articles, an extensive electronic search was conducted in the PubMed MEDLINE and Cochrane databases up to March 2022 using Boolean operators with a combination of keywords and MeSH terms. A total of 42 articles were retained after screening in accordance with the objectives of the study. The estimated age-standardized incidence rates in the Arab World were collected from the GLOBOCAN 2020 database. A total of 46 articles were retrieved from 11 countries in the Arab World. Epidemiological elements were collected, especially tumour attributes, risk factors and population characteristics, in addition to some therapeutic strategies. Results were regrouped by theme and then organized in tables and charts, allowing a global and regional approach to the subject. This review shows that the Arab World is considered a low-rate GC incidence region, presenting almost the same tumour characteristics as the Western countries. The lack of GC data in the Arab World should trigger a rise in research on this type of malignancy to better understand the subject. سرطان المعدة في العالم العربي: استعراض منهجي. مارك عودة، مارك مسلم، مجد عبده، براين يوسف، هامبيك رفايل كوريه، حميد عبيد الشامسي. يُعدُّ سرطان المعدة رابع أكثر أنواع السرطانات شيوعًا في العالم، ويتميز بأنه ينشأ عن عوامل متعددة، وله توزيع جغرافي غير متجانس. وقد تطور تعقيد هذا الورم الخبيث، مع خضوع العوامل البيئية والجينية واستراتيجيات العلاج لمزيد من الدراسة. هدفت هذه الدراسة الى تجميع وتنظيم السمات السريرية الباثولوجية والوبائية لسرطان المعدة في العالم العربي ومقارنتها ببيانات من بلدان غربية. للحصول على أكبر عدد من المقالات المتعلقة بالموضوع، أُجريَ بحث إلكتروني موسع في قاعدتََي بيانات PubMed MEDLINE وCochrane حتى مارس 2022 باستخدام عوامل منطقية (Boolean) مع مزيج من الكلمات المفتاحية ومصطلحات العناوين الرئيسية للموضوعات الطبية (MeSH). وجرى الاحتفاظ بما مجموعه 42 مقالًًا بعد الفرز وفقًا لأهداف الدراسة. وجُُمعت معدلات الإصابة المقدَّرة المُوحَّدة حسب السن في العالم العربي من قاعدة بيانات GLOBOCAN 2020. جرى الحصول على ما مجموعه 46 مقالًًا من 11 بلدًا في العالم العربي. وجرى جمع العناصر الوبائية، ولا سيما خصائص الأورام، وعوامل الخطر، وخصائص السكان، بالإضافة إلى بعض الاستراتيجيات العلاجية. وأُعيد تجميع النتائج حسب الموضوع، ثم نُظِّمت في جداول ومخططات، الأمر الذي أتاح اتباعَ نهجٍ عالمي وإقليمي إزاء الموضوع. يُبيِِّّن هذا الاستعراض أن العالم العربي يُعدُّ منطقة ذات معدل منخفض للإصابة بسرطان المعدة، إذ تُظهِر خصائصَ الأورام نفسها تقريبًا التي تظهر في الدول الغربية. وينبغي أن يؤدي نقص بيانات سرطان المعدة في العالم العربي إلى زيادة الأبحاث المتعلقة بهذا النوع من الأورام الخبيثة، من أجل التوصل إلى فهم أفضل للموضوع.

"588",35959789,"H151, a small molecule inhibitor of STING as a novel therapeutic in intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury.","Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a severe disease associated with high mortality. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an intracellular protein that is activated by cytosolic DNA and is implicated in I/R injury, resulting in transcription of type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) and other pro-inflammatory molecules. H151 is a small molecule inhibitor of STING that has not yet been studied as a potential therapeutic. We hypothesize that H151 reduces inflammation, tissue injury and mortality after intestinal I/R. In vitro, RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with H151 then stimulated with recombinant murine (rm) CIRP, and IFN-β levels in the culture supernatant were measured at 24 hours after stimulation. In vivo, male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 60-min intestinal ischemia via superior mesenteric artery occlusion. At the time of reperfusion, mice were intraperitoneally instilled with H151 (10 mg/kg BW) or 10% Tween-80 in PBS (vehicle). Four hours after reperfusion, the small intestines, lungs and serum were collected for analysis. Mice were monitored for 24 hours after intestinal I/R to assess survival. In vitro, H151 reduced rmCIRP-induced IFN-β levels in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, intestinal levels of pIRF3 were increased after intestinal I/R and decreased after H151 treatment. There was an increase in serum levels of tissue injury markers (LDH, AST) and cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-6) after intestinal I/R, and these levels were decreased after H151 treatment. I/R-induced intestinal and lung injury and inflammation were significantly reduced after H151 treatment, as evaluated by histopathologic assessment, measurement of cell death, chemokine expression, neutrophil infiltration, and myeloperoxidase activity. Finally, H151 improved the survival rate from 41% to 81% after intestinal I/R. H151, a novel STING inhibitor, attenuates the inflammatory response and reduces tissue injury and mortality in a murine model of intestinal I/R. H151 shows promise as a potential therapeutic in the treatment of this disease.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Using mixed methods, the pilot sought to determine the feasibility of the virtually delivered CSA prevention program. One school district that had previously received Safe Touches in-person participated. A total of 176 second grade students participated in the virtual workshop. Post-workshop survey responses from virtual (N = 37) and in-person workshops (N = 60) were compared descriptively. Mean item scores and response patterns from students who received the virtual workshop were nominally comparable to the student scores from the in-person workshop. Following the virtual workshop, one teacher notified the research team of a disclosure of CSA. Qualitative input from the facilitator and school staff was positive, indicating high student engagement. Results suggest the viability and feasibility of virtual school-based CSA preventive programs. Investment in virtual modes of delivery would ensure all students have access to CSA prevention programming in the future.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

"594",35959834,"Spinal versus conventional fine needle for ultrasound-guided thyroid nodule biopsy: a protocol for a randomised clinical trial.","Thyroid nodules are very common and constitute an increasing clinical challenge since improved imaging capabilities and utilisation have led to a higher number of incidental findings. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the standard diagnostic tool in the work-up of thyroid nodules suspected of malignancy. Non-diagnostic results remain common and require repeated FNAB, leading to increased costs and delayed treatment of thyroid diseases, including treatment of thyroid cancer. If cytological diagnoses cannot be achieved, surgery may be warranted, which may potentially lead to overtreatment. Optimisation of the FNAB procedure is therefore essential. Spinal needles with a stylet have been found to lead to fewer non-diagnostic results, but studies on the subject are few. This is a multicentre, two-arm, randomised clinical trial. Adults with thyroid nodules suspected of malignancy will be included consecutively. A total of 350 patients will be assigned randomly 1:1 to have a FNAB with either a spinal (25G) or a conventional (25G) needle. The primary outcome is the rate of diagnostic cytological samples according to the Bethesda system. Secondary outcomes are patient-experienced pain, complication rate and sensitivity and specificity. This trial will explore whether FNAB from thyroid nodules employing spinal needles compared with conventional fine needles improves diagnostic results, thereby providing evidence-based recommendations for a future choice of the FNAB needle. Secondary outcomes are patient-experienced pain, complication rate and sensitivity and specificity. This trial received funding from Erik and Susanna Olesens Fond.

In this study, we discuss the role of miR-505-5p in acute rejection after liver transplantation and its putative regulating mechanism. We construct an allogeneic rat liver transplantation model, observe the morphological and pathological changes in liver tissue, detect the expression levels of Myd88, miR-505-5p, IL-10 and TNF-α, and confirm that Myd88 is one of the direct targets of miR-505. The effects of miR-505-5p on the Myd88/TRAF6/NF-κB and MAPK pathways are detected both in vitro and in vivo, and the standard markers of Kupffer cell M1/M2 polarization are also detected. The results of qRT-PCR experiments show that miR-505-5p has a downward trend in rats with acute rejection. Western blot analysis reveals that over-expression of miR-505-5p induces the reduction of NF-κB and MAPK pathways both in vitro and in vivo. The role of miR-505-5p in alleviating acute rejection after transplantation may be accomplished by inducing M2-type polarization of Kupffer cells. In conclusion, we find that miR-505-5p alleviates acute rejection of liver transplantation by inducing M2 polarization of macrophages via the Myd88/TRAF6 axis, which suggests a potential strategy based on miRNAs in the follow-up treatment of liver transplantation.","misc","wim","rodent"

Since the broth microdilution method which is recommended as a reference method in colistin susceptibility tests, is laborious and expensive and other susceptibility tests do not give reliable results, all these cause laboratories to search for new methods for the determination of colistin susceptibility testing. In this study, it was aimed to compare the broth microdilution method which is the reference method with the colistin broth disc elution and rapid resapolymyxin NP tests for the determination of the susceptibility of colistin in Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Enterobacterales species which are common healthcare-associated infection agents.Colistin susceptibility of a total of 157 isolates isolated from patients hospitalized in Ankara City Hospital [Klebsiella pneumoniae (n= 74), Acinetobacter spp. (n= 33), Escherichia coli (n= 26), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 24)] were tested by broth microdilution, colistin broth disc elution and rapid resapolymixin NP methods. The categorical and basic agreement was evaluated by comparing the broth microdilution results with the rapid resapolymyxin NP results and the colistin broth disc elution. When compared with broth microdilution, the categorical agreement of colistin broth disc elution test for Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas species was found to be 93%, 48%, 100%, respectively. When the essential agreement was evaluated the values of 95%, 45%, 100% were found, respectively. Very major error rates were found to be 10%, 70% and 0%, respectively. The categorical agreement of the rapid resapolymyxin test for Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas species was 85%, 36%, 100%, while very major error rates were found to be 10%, 88% and 0%, respectively. When compared with the reference method, both tests showed high categorical and essential agreements for P.aeruginosa. Accepted level of categorical and essential agreement was found in colistin broth disc elution method for Enterobacterales species, and low categorical agreement was found in rapid resapolymyxin NP test. For Acinetobacter species, both tests detected low categorical agreement and high rate of very major error. In addition, compared to the broth microdilution method, both colistin broth disc elution and rapid resapolymyxin NP tests were found to be cost-effective and easy to prepare. It was considered to be an additional advantage to have the results in rapid polymyxin NP test in four hours. In conclusion, in our study, it was shown that both colistin broth disc elution and rapid resapolymyxin NP test methods can be used in determining the susceptibility of colistin for P.aeruginosa and Enterobacterales species but both methods were found to be unsuccessful for Acinetobacter species.","misc","wim","misc"
"597",35960237,"[miRNA Expression Profile in Ileocecal Adenocarcinoma Cells Infected with Cryptosporidium].","Cryptosporidium spp. is an opportunistic protozoan transmitted by fecal-oral route via oocysts. The agent may cause severe infection especially in individuals with suppressed immune system, due to its intracellular location and ability to cause auto-infection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-translated endogenous RNA molecules with an average of 22 nucleotides in length that regulate the expression of genes involved in important biological functions such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and immune response. Recent studies have focused on the role of miRNAs in pathogenesis of infectious diseases and their potential to be used as biomarkers. The aim of this study was to determine the miRNA profile of human ileocecal adenocarcinoma (HCT-8) cells at 24 hours of infection with Cryptosporidium spp. In the study, the HCT-8 cell line was infected with Cryptosporidium spp. that were isolated from infected human stool samples and RNA was isolated from the cells 24 hours after infection. After this process, cDNA synthesis was performed and the expression of 95 human miRNA profiles were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Fold changes of expression were determined by comparison with Cryptosporidium spp. uninfected cell lines. Sequence information of miRNAs and their target genes were performed via TargetScanHuman7.1 and miRDB websites, while gene ontology (GO) pathways of target genes were analyzed with the mirPath v.3 program. It was detected that the expression of 10 miRNAs were upregulated and 11 of them were downregulated compared with the control group. It was observed that, this 21 differentially expressed miRNAs were mainly associated with apoptosis, mitotic cell cycle, and immune response. Hsa-miR-612, hsa-miR-6763-5p, hsa-miR-188-5p, hsa-miR-664b-3p, hsa-miR-210-3p, hsa-let-7e-5p hsa-let-7b-3p, hsa-miR-4787-3p, hsa-miR-548ab, hsa-miR-3714 and hsamiR-4803 were found to be associated with apoptosis; and hsa-miR-612, hsa-miR-664b-3p, hsa-miR210-3p, hsa-let-7e-5p, hsa-let-7b-3p, hsa-miR-548ab, and hsa-miR4803 were found to be associated with mitotic cell cycle. The balance of proliferation and apoptosis is very significant in the development of infection and cancer. It is thought that determination of the effect of miRNAs on proliferation-apoptosis balance could provide information related to the etiopathogenesis and prognosis of infections, and on the role of microorganisms in carcinogenesis. In this study, 12 differentially expressed miRNAs were found to be associated with immune response. This may emphasize the role of miRNAs in the prevention and treatment of infections. It was concluded that, miRNAs could be used in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of infections with the determination of miRNA's role in the infection mechanism as a result of the increasing number of studies.","misc","wim","misc"
"598",35960241,"[Investigation of Biofilm Formation Properties of Coagulase Negative Staphylococci Isolated from Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections].","In view of the significant negative impact of biofilm-mediated infection on patient health and the necessity of a reliable phenotypic method to detect biofilm producers, this study aimed to demonstrate phenotypic and molecular biofilm formation in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolated from catheter related infections and to compare the methods used with each other. The study was also aimed to determine the biofilm eradication effect of vancomycin in order to guide for the treatment. For the detection of biofilm formation, a total of 154 CoNS clinical isolates of which 30 being causative agents of catheter related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) (isolated from both the catheter tip and blood cultures of 15 patients), 89 being isolated from peripheral blood cultures of patients without a central venous catheter (CVC) (13 of them were bloodstream infection agents, 76 of them were contaminant), and 35 being isolated as catheter colonizer, were screened by tissue culture plate (TCP), Congo red agar (CRA) method and polymerase chain reaction (icaA, icaD and IS256). Vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradicating concentration (MBEC) values were determined. The pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method was used to show the clonal relationship between CoNS isolated from the catheter tips and peripheral blood of patients with CRBSI. Of the 154 CoNS isolates included in the study, 38.9% were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n= 60), 34.4% were Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n= 53), 20.7% were Staphylococcus hominis (n= 32), and 3.8% were detected as Staphylococcus capitis (n= 6). In our study, biofilm formation was shown in 31.8% with the CRA method and in 68.1% with the TCP method. By TCP method, 22% (n= 34) were determined as weak, 31.2% (n= 48) medium and 14.9% (n= 23) strong biofilm producers. While the sensitivity of the CRA method was found to be low for isolates that were determined as weak positive in the microplate method, the high sensitivity of the CRA method for isolates with medium and strong positivity was found remarkable. The positivity rates of icaA, icaD and IS256 genes in a total of 154 CoNS isolates were found to be 40 (25.9%), 57 (37%) and 77 (50%), respectively. In total, at least one gene positivity was detected in 107 (69.5%) isolates. Single gene positivity was detected in 55 (35.7%), two gene positivity in 35 (22.7%) and three gene positivity was detected in 17 (11%) of the included CoNS. Biofilm formation (four weak, four medium, two strong) was detected by microplate method in 10 of 47 CoNS isolates (five S.epidermidis, three S.hominis, one S.haemolyticus and one S.capitis) in which no genes were detected. Vancomycin MBEC/ MIC values were found to be high and it was observed that as the biofilm forming power of the isolates increased, the MBEC/MIC ratio also increased. The CoNS isolated from the catheter samples and blood of patients diagnosed with CRBSI had a 100% similar profile with PFGE except for one unevaluable isolate. The tissue culture plate (TCP) method was found to be most sensitive, accurate and reproducible screening method for detection of biofilm formation by staphylococci and has the advantage of being a quantitative model to study the adherence of staphylococci. The presence of the icaAD and IS256 gene is not always associated with in vitro biofilm formation. For this reason, it is more appropriate to use more than one method together for the evaluation of biofilm formation. It was thought that the use of reliable methods to specifically detect biofilms could be helpful in diseases that are difficult to treat. Considering the high rates of biofilm and antimicrobial resistance of biofilm-forming isolates in biomedical device associated infections, it was determined that it would not be sufficient to evaluate only the MIC results for susceptibility results.","misc","wim","misc"

Spread of 16S rRNA methylases which can cause high-level resistance to AG antibiotics, limits this treatment choice. Although there are some studies showing that errors in determining AG susceptibility in automated systems may be related to the armA gene, one of the 16S rRNA methylase genes, the exact reason for these errors is not yet known. In our study, we aimed to investigate the relevance of 16S rRNA methylases to the discrepancies between VITEK 2.0 and disc diffusion test results for amikacin (AK) and gentamicin (GEN) susceptibility of Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. All K.pneumoniae and A.baumannii isolates from 1st January-10th February 2018 were collected prospectively and included in the study. Additionally, two initial isolates from July 2017 (one K.pneumoniae and one A.baumannii isolate) for which first discrepant susceptibility results were determined, were also included. Amikacin and gentamicin susceptibility results of 37 isolates [A. baumannii (n= 20) and K.pneumoniae (n= 17)] were evaluated together with VITEK 2.0 system, disc diffusion and gold standard broth microdilution methods and minor error (mE), major error (ME) and very major error (VME) rates were calculated. The rmtB, rmtC and armA genes in isolates were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the relationship between the presence of 16S rRNA methylases and false susceptibility results were examined. In addition, disc diffusion test results were evaluated at the end of four, six, eight hours and one night incubation periods to examine the effect of the double zone phenotype observed in 13 of the study isolates on rapid susceptibility tests. All disc diffusion test results were found to be compatible with broth microdilution test results. When the VITEK 2.0 system and the broth microdilution test were compared, 10.3% and 12.1% VME and 8.1% and 5.4% mE were detected for AK and GEN susceptibility results, respectively. While rmtB and rmtC genes were not detected in the study isolates, armA gene was positive in eight (47.1%) of 17 K.pneumoniae isolates and in 15 (75%) of 20 A.baumannii isolates. All three VMEs in A.baumannii isolates were detected in AK susceptibility results. Two of those were armA gene positive and one was armA gene negative isolates. All four VMEs in K. pneumoniae isolates were detected in GEN susceptibility results only, and all of these isolates were armA gene positive. No direct correlation was found between the errors detected in the VITEK 2.0 system susceptibility results and the double zone phenotype. When the isolates were evaluated in the 4-16 hours incubation time interval, it was observed that resistant colonies could be detected after a minimum of six hours of incubation period in the inhibition zone surrounding the aminoglycoside discs. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of armA producing A.baumannii from Turkey. The high rate of armA gene positivity detected in our isolates suggested that the prevalence of armA gene increased in our country or at least in our region, in recent years. In the AG susceptibility results of the VITEK 2.0 system, the rate of VME above the acceptance criterion has shown that the errors occurred were not directly related to armA gene positivity or double zone phenotype. Finally, our study results indicated that AG susceptibility results should be evaluated minimum six hours later of incubation while implementing rapid susceptibility tests.","misc","wim","misc"

Viral shedding through the respiratory tract is the main risk factor for the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus from sick individuals to healthy individuals. In this study, we aimed to investigate the viral clearance (VC) time in PCR tests of COVID-19 patients and the possible factors affecting this time. Seventy patients older than 18 years of age whose presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus was proven by real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) in nasopharyngeal swab samples were included in the study. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was investigated by RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swab samples at 48-72 hour intervals, five days after the initial diagnosis. Demographic , physical examination, laboratory test, computed tomography (CT) results, concomitant diseases, and duration of VC were recorded. Of the cases, 41 were female and 29 were male. The mean age was 45.8 ± 19.2 years. According to the CT results, in the group with no involvement, local involvement and widespread involvement, the duration of VC was 9.66 ± 5.91 days, 9.99 ± 4.68 days, and 10.94 ± 5.34 days, respectively (p> 0.05). While the duration of VC was determined as 8.93 ± 4.33 days in the group without comorbidity, this period was found to be 12.26 ± 5.69 days (p= 0.025) in the group with the comorbidity. It was determined that the duration of VC was 9.55 ± 6.37 days in women and 9.20 ± 7.22 days in men (p= 0.040). The duration of VC was found to be 10.18 ± 7.1 days in patients over 50 years of age and 8.87 ± 5.15 days under 50 years of age (p= 0.03). A significant correlation was found between the laboratory test lactate dehydrogenase level and VC duration (p= 0.007). However, a significant relationship could not be established between other laboratory test results and the duration of VC. In this retrospective observational study, the relationship between viral clearance duration in Rt-PCR and gender, age, CT results, comorbidities and laboratory results in nasopharyngeal swab samples was investigated and it was determined that the duration of VC was significantly prolonged in case of female gender, being over 50 years old and having a comorbid disease. The results obtained may contribute to predict the isolation times of the patients and to reveal the factors that may affect viral shedding.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Understanding how long the humoral immune response induced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) inactivated vaccine lasts is important to create an effective immunization scheme. This study aimed to detect the first, third, sixth month concentrations and seroconversion rates of the antibodies induced by the inactivated vaccine. The study included 282 healthcare workers who were vaccinated at days 0 and 28 by the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 μg/0.5ml). Anti-S-RBD-IgG (receptor binding domain) antibody concentrations and seroconversion rates were examined in vaccinated healthcare workers at the first, third and sixth months after the vaccination. MAGLUMI SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG (CLIA) (Snibe Diagnostics, Chinese) kit was used for the detection of antibodies. The mean age of the healthcare workers was 38.93 ± 10.59 (min= 21-max= 64). After the administration of the second vaccine dose, the participants were found to be reactive for anti-SRBD-IgG antibodies by 98.2% and 97.8% at the first and third months, respectively,. The decrease in the mean plasma concentrations of anti-S-RBD IgG was observed as 56.7% in the cohort with only two doses of the vaccine (first month: 42.4 AU/ml versus third month: 18.2 AU/ml). In the cohort with a history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prior to the vaccination, the decrease was observed as 25.1% (first month: 58.29 versus third month: 43.64 AU/ml) and at a mean of 57.4 (0-90) days prior to vaccination, the decrease rate was 43.1% (first month: 55.05 AU/ml versus third month: 31.28 AU/ml), keeping more stable in participants infected at a mean of 183.1 (91-330) days prior to vaccination(a decrease of 5.2%; with 62.34 AU/ml at first and 59.08 AU/ml at third months). At the end of the sixth month, antibodies could not be detected in 16.7% of people who (n= 42) received two doses of the inactivated vaccine, and the amount of anti-S-RDB IgG decreased by an average of 52.5% compared to the third month, and by 74.8% compared to the first month. Antibody concentrations at the first, third, and sixth months after the vaccination with two doses of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were found to be decreased and at the sixth month, the rate of non-reactive people was 16.7%. As participants who had COVID-19 at a mean of 181 (90-330) days before the vaccination presented with a more stable antibody level, it can be concluded that a booster at months 6-12, resulting in a schedule of 0-1-6 months, is recommended for the inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for effective herd immunity.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Over the past decades, prevalence of information technologies in world modern society occurs with such intensity that detailed study of influence of this factor on health is significantly lagged behind. In the last decade, a number of pathological conditions associated with application of modern information technologies, in particular psychological and psychiatric profile, was described. The new concepts of Internet addiction, gambling, problematic use of technologies, etc., describing individual response of patients, are introduced. At that, lack of fundamental understanding of both etiology and pathogenesis of described conditions due to multiform specifics, high comorbidity and active evolution of digital society. The article attempts to fill this gap and to approach issue on population scale, namely to evaluate from perspective of epidemiological method characteristics of occurrence, spread and termination of pathogenic effects. The analysis of existing studies suggests that causation of emerging disorders is related not only to addictive behavior and prolonged exposure to information flow, but also to different pathogenicity of its particular components, causing various clinical forms of health disorders in individual with different levels of susceptibility. The pattern of new unique pathogen with specific propagation in human population is described - indirectly through digital environment - and capable of replication within specific ecological niche, i.e. digital pathogen tropic to bio-substrates of higher nervous activity. At that, the duration of contact with digital environment is considered as necessary but insufficient cause of development of pathological process that corresponds to empirical data. The most important property of digital pathogen propagation is its ability to replicate in anthropogenic abiotic digital environment, which is conditioned by its nature, mechanisms of accumulation and distribution. It is also noteworthy that basic principles of dissemination of information flows in social networks largely repeat principles of propagation of infectious pathogens in nature and are characterized by unique mechanism and ways of its transmission. It is concluded that in modern conditions there is a need to study problem of pathology associated with digital environment at population level from position of epidemiological method.

Methodologically, the article is based on interdisciplinary scientific approach that allows to study medical, social and economic components of public health, considering observed trends: digitalization of health care and epidemic of new coronavirus infection. Based on statistical analysis of open data on morbidity and mortality of population in the Russian Federation over past few years, results were obtained indicating that collection of medical statistics is not built consistently that medical care in health care is not organized sequentially as cycle or process, but is presented in fragments. This leads to the fact that rural population has very limited access to multidisciplinary and high-tech medical services, and in structure of mortality there is high gender bias (males die more often than females in same classes of causes). Based on identified problems, two organizing solutions are proposed. The first solution is to create, on the basis of the Ministry of Health Care of Russia, special portal for complete, reliable and up-to-date medical statistics, which will be generated and processed using Big Data technologies. The second solution consists in transition from fragmentation to systematic organization of medical care in the education and prevention-treatment-rehabilitation continuum, while for each stage special set of key performance indices is established that allows to solve the tasks of improving public health, but also to develop harmonized social and economic public policy.","misc","wim","misc"

On the basis of archive materials, the investigation was applied to the most important components of organization of medical care of patients with syphilis: the organization of syphilitic hospitals, history of correspondence and decision-making on funding sources, building of yurts, choice of buildings for hospitals, delivery of medications, invitation and appointment of physicians, medical assistants and healers to assist population with medical care. The role of the Irkutsk Prikaz of Public Charity and the Irkutsk Medical Board in this process is noted. The establishment of syphilitic hospitals in outlying territories of Yakutia, Kamchatka and Primorye was the most important onset of struggle with syphilis epidemic in population.","misc","wim","misc"

"614",35960554,"Benchmarking Information Scrambling.","Information scrambling refers to the rapid spreading of initially localized information over an entire system, via the generation of global entanglement. This effect is usually detected by measuring a temporal decay of the out-of-time order correlators. However, in experiments, decays of these correlators suffer from fake positive signals from various sources, e.g., decoherence due to inevitable couplings to the environment, or errors that cause mismatches between the purported forward and backward evolutions. In this Letter, we provide a simple and robust approach to single out the effect of genuine scrambling. This allows us to benchmark the scrambling process by quantifying the degree of the scrambling from the noisy backgrounds. We also demonstrate our protocol with simulations on IBM cloud-based quantum computers.","misc","wim","protocol"

The historical success of improved lattice actions in classical simulations strongly suggests that Hamiltonians with improved discretization errors will reduce quantum resources, i.e., require ≳2^{d} fewer qubits in quantum simulations for lattices with d-spatial dimensions. In this work, we consider O(a^{2})-improved Hamiltonians for pure gauge theories and design the corresponding quantum circuits for its real-time evolution in terms of primitive gates. An explicit demonstration for Z_{2} gauge theory is presented including exploratory tests using the ibm_perth device.","misc","wim","misc"

"617",35960571,"Quantifying Nonlocality: How Outperforming Local Quantum Codes Is Expensive.","Quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a promising avenue to reduce the cost of constructing scalable quantum circuits. However, it is unclear how to implement these codes in practice. Seminal results of Bravyi et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 050503 (2010)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.104.050503] have shown that quantum LDPC codes implemented through local interactions obey restrictions on their dimension k and distance d. Here we address the complementary question of how many long-range interactions are required to implement a quantum LDPC code with parameters k and d. In particular, in 2D we show that a quantum LDPC code with distance d∝n^{1/2+ϵ} requires Ω(n^{1/2+ϵ}) interactions of length Ω[over ˜](n^{ϵ}). Further, a code satisfying k∝n with distance d∝n^{α} requires Ω[over ˜](n) interactions of length Ω[over ˜](n^{α/2}). As an application of these results, we consider a model called a stacked architecture, which has previously been considered as a potential way to implement quantum LDPC codes. In this model, although most interactions are local, a few of them are allowed to be very long. We prove that limited long-range connectivity implies quantitative bounds on the distance and code dimension.","misc","wim","misc"

The coupling to the bath preserves the global SO(3) spin symmetry. Using large-scale, approximation-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that any finite coupling to the bath suffices to stabilize long-range antiferromagnetic order. This is in stark contrast to the isolated Heisenberg chain where spontaneous breaking of the SO(3) symmetry is forbidden by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. A linear spin-wave theory analysis confirms that the memory of the bath and the concomitant retarded interaction stabilize the order. For the Heisenberg chain, the ohmic bath is a marginal perturbation so that exponentially large system sizes are required to observe long-range order at small couplings. Below this length scale, our numerics is dominated by a crossover regime where spin correlations show different power-law behaviors in space and time. We discuss the experimental relevance of this crossover phenomena.","misc","wim","misc"

In this paper, we realize a room temperature ultrafast polaritonic switch where the Bose-Einstein condensate population can be depleted at the hundred femtosecond timescale with high extinction ratios. This is achieved by applying an ultrashort optical control pulse, inducing parametric scattering within the photon part of the polariton condensate via a four-wave mixing process. Using a femtosecond angle-resolved spectroscopic imaging technique, the erasure and revival of the polariton condensates can be visualized. The condensate depletion and revival are well modeled by an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation including parametric scattering process. This pushes the speed frontier of all-optical controlled polaritonic switches at room temperature towards the THz regime.","misc","wim","misc"

Usually, the rotation follows the same direction as the SAM due to momentum conservation. It is counterintuitive to observe the reversal of optical torque acting on an ordinary dielectric nanoparticle illuminated by an elliptically or circularly polarized light wave. Here, we demonstrate that negative optical torques, which are opposite to the direction of SAM, can ubiquitously emerge when elliptically polarized light waves are impinged on dielectric nanoparticles obliquely. Intriguingly, the rotation can be switched between clockwise and counterclockwise directions by controlling the incident angle of light. Our study suggests a new playground to harness polarization-dependent optical force and torque for advancing optical manipulations.","misc","wim","misc"

Here, we develop a low-energy effective model underlying HOTI states in 2D quasicrystals for all possible rotational symmetries. By implementing a novel Fourier transform developed recently for quasicrystals and approximating the long-wavelength behavior by their large-scale average, we construct an effective k·p Hamiltonian to capture the band inversion at the center of a pseudo-Brillouin zone. We show that an in-plane Zeeman field can induce mass kinks at the intersection of adjacent edges of a 2D quasicrystal topological insulators and generate corner modes (CMs) with fractional charge, protected by rotational symmetries. Our model predictions are confirmed by numerical tight-binding calculations. Furthermore, when the quasicrystal is proximitized by an s-wave superconductor, Majorana CMs can also be created by tuning the field strength and chemical potential. Our work affords a generic approach to studying the low-energy physics of quasicrystals, in association with topological excitations and fractional statistics.","misc","wim","misc"
"622",35960585,"Toward a Photonic Demonstration of Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution.","The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) usually relies on that the users' devices are well characterized according to the security models made in the security proofs. In contrast, device-independent QKD-an entanglement-based protocol-permits the security even without any knowledge of the underlying quantum devices. Despite its beauty in theory, device-independent QKD is elusive to realize with current technologies. Especially in photonic implementations, the requirements for detection efficiency are far beyond the performance of any reported device-independent experiments. In this Letter, we report a proof-of-principle experiment of device-independent QKD based on a photonic setup in the asymptotic limit. On the theoretical side, we enhance the loss tolerance for real device imperfections by combining different approaches, namely, random postselection, noisy preprocessing, and developed numerical methods to estimate the key rate via the von Neumann entropy. On the experimental side, we develop a high-quality polarization-entangled photon source achieving a state-of-the-art (heralded) detection efficiency about 87.5%. Although our experiment does not include random basis switching, the achieved efficiency outperforms previous photonic experiments involving loophole-free Bell tests. Together, we show that the measured quantum correlations are strong enough to ensure a positive key rate under the fiber length up to 220 m. Our photonic platform can generate entangled photons at a high rate and in the telecom wavelength, which is desirable for high-speed generation over long distances. The results present an important step toward a full demonstration of photonic device-independent QKD.","misc","wim","misc"

In solid-state materials, fractional quantum Hall phases continue to attract attention as hosts of emergent geometrical excitations analogous to gravitons, resulting from the nonperturbative interactions between the electrons. However, the direct observation of such excitations remains a challenge. Here, we identify a quasi-one-dimensional model that captures the geometric properties and graviton dynamics of fractional quantum Hall states. We then simulate geometric quench and the subsequent graviton dynamics on the IBM quantum computer using an optimally compiled Trotter circuit with bespoke error mitigation. Moreover, we develop an efficient, optimal-control-based variational quantum algorithm that can efficiently simulate graviton dynamics in larger systems. Our results open a new avenue for studying the emergence of gravitons in a new class of tractable models on the existing quantum hardware.","misc","wim","misc"

Patients with mild or moderate asthma, even those with intermittent symptoms, are at risk for severe or fatal exacerbations. Use of short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA)-only rescue therapy is associated with an increased risk of exacerbations, beginning at about the second fill annually. Systemic corticosteroids have shortterm and long-term adverse effects, and long-term adverse effects are driven by cumulative lifetime doses starting at 0.5 to 1.0 g. Expert opinion on the use of SABA only for rescue therapy differs, but recent evidence suggests that a fast-acting bronchodilator combined with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is more effective at reducing the risk of exacerbations than SABA alone. There is a window of opportunity just prior to an asthma exacerbation during which use of fast-acting bronchodilator + ICS may play a significant role in mitigating the risk of exacerbation. Patients may respond better to a combination inhaler of a fast-acting bronchodilator and an ICS as needed for rescue therapy or as part of a maintenance and rescue therapy paradigm, rather than attempting to use separate inhalers. However, there is currently no fixed-dose, fast-acting bronchodilator + ICS approved in the United States for as-needed use.","misc","wim","misc"

Chemotherapy-induced upregulation of stem cell markers imparts invasiveness and metastatic property to the resident tumor. The efficacy of Kaempferol in attenuating epithelial to mesenchymal transition has earlier been established in the breast cancer cell. In our study population, progression-free survival was observed to be statistically more significant in post-NACT low-grade tumors than the high-grade tumors. Further, in post-NACT TNBCs, high-grade tumors showed a preponderance of strong nuclear p53 expression and very low expression of Caspase 3, indicating that, altered p53 expression predisposes these tumors to apoptosis escape and up-regulation of stemness markers. Herein, we report the robust efficacy of Kaempferol on ex-vivo grown breast tumors, derived from post-NACT TNBC patients, through downregulation of nuclear p53, CD44, ALDH1, NANOG, MDR1, Ki67, BCL2 and upregulation of Caspase 3. Such tumors also showed concurrent deregulated RNA and protein expression of CD44, NANOG, ALDH1 and MDR1 with upregulation of Caspase 3 and cleaved Caspase 3, upon Kaempferol treatment. Validation of efficacy of the treatment dosage of Kaempferol through immunophenotyping on MDA-MB-231, suggested that Kaempferol at its IC-50 dosage was effective against CD44 and CD326 positive breast cancer through deregulating their expression. Protein-protein interaction network through STRING pathway analysis and co-expression study of candidate proteins showed the highest degree of co-expression of p53 and KI-67, CD44, NF- kappaB, ALDH1, NANOG, MDR1, and BCL2.

Cytokines are key components of the inflammatory processes and their crucial roles in the inflammatory aspect of MS are undeniable. Several studies have pointed to the apparent change in Cytokines in MS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IM253 treatment on inflammation and antioxidant defense in the cerebral corpus callosum of the C57BL/6 mouse, an Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and as a most commonly used experimental model of MS. During the course of study, clinical evaluation was performed and eventually histological and molecular analysis on brain samples was carried out. Gene expression analyses demonstrated that treatment with IM253 causes a significant reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine coding genes including IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17 as well as a significant increase in the expression of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant enzyme coding genes including TGF-β, GPX-1, and Cat. Histological studies also show that treatment with IM253 can reduce demyelination and inflammation (p<0.001). In addition, the GPX-1 enzyme activity evaluation also demonstrated that total antioxidant capacity was significantly higher in IM253 treated mice (p<0.001). Overall, our results suggest that IM253 could ameliorate the severity of EAE, probably because of its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, and support the preclinical effects of IM253 as a potential therapeutic intervention.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Objective assessment of patients' motor symptoms is crucial for accurate electrode targeting and treatment. Existing approaches suffer from subjective variability or interference with voluntary motion. This work is aimed to establish an objective assessment system to quantify bradykinesia in DBS surgery. Based on the analysis of the requirements for intraoperative assessment, we developed a system with non-contact measurement, online movement feature extraction, and interactive data analysis and visualization. An optical sensor, Leap Motion Controller (LMC), was taken to detect hand movement in three clinical tasks. A graphic user interface was designed to process, compare and visualize the collected data and assessment results online. Quantified movement features include amplitude, frequency, velocity, their decrement and variability, etc. Technical validation of the system was performed with a motion capture system (Mocap), with respect to data-level and feature-level accuracy and reliability. Clinical validation was conducted with 20 PD patients for intraoperative assessments in DBS surgery. Treatment responses with respect to the bradykinesia movement features were analyzed. Single case analysis and group statistical analysis were performed to examine the differences between preoperative and intraoperative performance, and the correlation between the clinical ratings and the quantified assessment was analyzed. For the movements measured by LMC and Mocap, the average Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.986, and the mean amplitude difference was 2.11 mm. No significant difference was found for all movement features quantified by LMC and Mocap. For the clinical tests, key movement features showed significant differences between the preoperative baseline and intraoperative performance when the brain stimulation was ON. The assessment results were significantly correlated with the MDS-UPDRS clinical ratings. The proposed non-contact system has established itself as an objective intraoperative assessment, analysis, and visualization tool for DBS treatment of Parkinson's disease.","misc","wim","misc"

However, a certain number of micro/nano-scale particles are inevitably present in the fresh or aged biochar, which may facilitate the downward transport of contaminants along the soil profile, posing a detrimental impact on the groundwater. Herein, the effects of biochar colloids derived from wood chip and wheat straw at two temperatures (350 °C and 500 °C) on the transport and transformation of Cr(VI) in soil were investigated. All biochar colloids facilitated the transport of Cr(VI) in a loam clay Ultisol, which was attributed to the competition between biochar colloids and Cr(VI) for the available sorption sites on the soil surface. Wheat straw biochar colloids caused more transport of Cr(VI) than wood chip ones due to the more negative charge and higher polarity, which resulted in stronger electrostatic repulsion and competition with Cr(VI). It is soluble Cr(VI) that dominated the transport of Cr in the effluent solution, however, the particulate Cr(VI) could be reduced into Cr(III) before being carried by biochar colloids for co-transport. The 350 °C biochar colloids had higher electron donating capacities than 500 °C ones, resulting in more reduction of Cr(VI) and more co-transport as biochar colloids-associated Cr(III) in the effluent. Moreover, the more negatively charged 350 °C biochar colloids could also attach more soil Fe oxides, further facilitating the cotransport of Cr via the formation of a binary or ternary complex. Modeling showed the experimental-consistently results that biochar colloids caused 0.5-7.0 times faster transport of Cr(VI) than no biochar colloids in the long-term period. Our findings demonstrate that biochar colloids can enhance transport and transformation of Cr(VI) in soils, which arouse migration risk concern about in-situ remediation of Cr(VI)-contaminated soils by biochar.","misc","wim","misc"

However, this effect on hBMSC differentiation toward retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-like cells has not been explored. Herein, a family of cell culture substrates called binary colloidal crystals (BCCs) was used to stimulate hBMSCs into RPE-like cells without induction factors. Two BCCs, named SiPS (silica (Si)/polystyrene (PS)) and SiPSC (Si/carboxylated PS), having similar surface topographies but different surface chemistry was used for cell culture. The result showed that cell proliferation was no difference between the two BCCs and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) control. However, the cell attachment, spreading area, and aspect ratio between surfaces were significantly changed. For example, cells displayed more elongated on SiPS (aspect ratio ~7.0) than those on SiPSC and TCPS (~2.0). The size of focal adhesions on SiPSC (~1.6 µm2) was smaller than that on the TCPS (~2.5 µm2). qPCR results showed that hBMSCs expressed higher RPE progenitor genes (i.e., MITF and PAX6) on day 15, and mature RPE genes (i.e., CRALBP and RPE65) on day 30 on SiPS than TCPS. On the other hand, the expression of optical vesicle or neuroretina genes (i.e., MITF and VSX2) was upregulated on day 15 on SiPSC compared to the TCPS. This study reveals that hBMSCs could be modulated into different cell subtypes depending on the BCC combinations. This study shows the potential of BCCs in controlling stem cell differentiation.","misc","wim","misc"

In this regard, we produced random and aligned polycaprolactone (PCL) micron/submicron fibers by the electrospinning method. Simultaneously, the surface structure of the fibers was altered by applying phase separation processes including non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) and vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) mechanisms. As a result, PCL fibers with porous, wrinkled, grooved, and crater-like morphology were obtained. Human dermal fibroblasts (BJ cells) and human keratinocytes (HS2) were cultured onto the fiber surfaces and the data were evaluated in terms of cell-material interactions. Results showed that not only the orientation of fibers but also fiber topography affected both cell-fiber and cell-cell interactions in different manners. It was observed that the wrinkled topography is the most suitable for both dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes in terms of cell attachment and proliferation. We also concluded that cellular behavior was varied according to the morphology of the cells used. Morphological observations showed that HS2 cells proliferated more intensively on all surfaces compared to BJ cells.

However, the overall performance of various DLMs for detecting IAs has not been evaluated. We aimed at exploring the performance of DLMs in the detection of IAs and measuring the effect of DLMs in assisting clinicians. A diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis using a mixed-effect binary regression model was performed to estimate accuracy in patient-level and lesion-level. Moreover, the effect in assisting clinicians was measured by a random-effect meta-analysis. Twenty cohort studies including a total of 17 DLMs were assessed eligible in the present study. We summarized that DLMs had both high sensitivity (0.92, 95 % CI: 0.85 to 0.96) and specificity (0.96, 95 % CI: 0.94 to 0.97) in the detection of IAs in patient-level. In lesion-level, we also found a high summary sensitivity of 0.92 (95 % CI: 0.87 to 0.95). Moreover, assisted by DLMs, the sensitivity of clinicians became higher (Risk ratio: 1.09, P-value: 0.0006), with no effect on the specificity in diagnosis (Risk ratio: 0.99, P-value: 0.53). The reading time was reduced by the assistance of the deep learning model. (Mean difference: -7.37, P-value: 0.0077) CONCLUSIONS: DLMs have the competence of detecting IAs accurately. Moreover, DLMs can improve clinicians' sensitivity and reduce the reading time without affecting the specificity in diagnosing IAs.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

Theoretical models suggest that solitary drinking and coping motives are highly related. However, the direction of effects between solitary drinking and coping motives is unclear. It also remains unclear if relations are present solely at the between-person level, or if there are also dynamic, within-person relations. Therefore, the current study tested dynamic, reciprocal relations among solitary drinking, coping motives, and alcohol problems using Random Intercept Cross Lagged Panel Modeling (RI-CLPM). Data came from a large alcohol administration study with longitudinal follow-ups over 2 years (N = 448). Participants completed a baseline session and then were followed up 6, 12, 18, and 24 months later. Participants reported their solitary drinking frequency, coping motives, drinking behavior, and alcohol problems at all assessments. Person-level solitary drinking was related to person-level coping motives and alcohol problems, and person-level coping motives were related to person-level alcohol problems. There were also contemporaneous within-person effects, such that a within-person increase in solitary drinking was associated with a concurrent within-person increase in coping motives, and a within-person increase in coping motives was associated with a concurrent within-person increase in alcohol problems. There were no within-person prospective relations among any variables. Findings suggest strong between-person associations among solitary drinking, coping motives, and alcohol problems. Within-person associations were concurrent but not prospective. Targeting solitary and coping-motivated drinkers, as well within-person increases in both, may be effective at reducing risk for alcohol problems.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

High ratio of 7S to C3G (1:100) led to a more ordered secondary structure of 7S. Thermal treatment promoted the formation of 7S-C3G complexes via hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds but did not induce the formation of 7S-C3G covalent products. Thermal treatment at 65 °C and 121 °C enhanced the binding affinity of 7S-C3G complexes by 46.19 % and 1203 % compared with 25 °C. The 7S-C3G interaction decreased C3G bioaccessibility by 4.37 %, 8.74 %, and 46.37 % at 25 °C, 65 °C, and 121 °C. Diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ABTS antioxidant capacity assay indicated an antagonistic effect between 7S and C3G. The increased binding affinity of C3G to 7S limited the bioaccessibility of C3G and promoted the antagonism of antioxidant capacity between 7S and C3G. 7S addition was detrimental to the antioxidant capacity and bioaccessibility of C3G in vitro after thermal processing.","misc","wim","misc"
"640",35961191,"Social connection and gene regulation during the COVID-19 pandemic: Divergent patterns for online and in-person interaction.","Social connection has been linked to reduced disease risk and enhanced antiviral immunity, but it is unclear whether online social connections have similar effects to those previously documented for in-person/offline social relationships, or whether online connections can substitute for in-person social relations when the latter are restricted. We examined this question in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing specifically on an immune system gene regulation profile known as the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), which is characterized by up-regulation of proinflammatory genes and down-regulation of genes linked to innate antiviral responses and antibody production. We analyzed CTRA RNA profiles in blood samples from 142 healthy young adults (69% female, 87% white) during the social distancing period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mixed effect linear models quantified the relation of CTRA gene expression to measures of in-person social connection (number of friends, social eudaimonia, loneliness) and online psychosocial connection (online loneliness, perceived social value in online leisure and educational contexts, and internet use) while controlling for demographic and health factors. Multiple indicators of in-person and generalized social connection were associated with lower CTRA gene expression, whereas no measure of online social connection showed any significant association with CTRA gene expression. Experiences of in-person social connection are associated with reduced CTRA gene expression during a period of restricted social interaction. In contrast, online social relationships show no such association. Digitally mediated social relations do not appear to substantially offset the absence of in-person/offline social connection in the context of immune cell gene regulation.","misc","wim","misc"
"641",35961197,"Multifunctional porous β-cyclodextrin polymer for water purification.","Keeping water clean is of vital significance for human health and environmental protection. In order to remove organic micro-pollutants and natural organic substances in water bodies and kill pathogenic microorganisms simultaneously, this study synthesized a multifunctional porous β-cyclodextrin polymer with a high specific surface area by introducing quaternary ammonium groups and rigid benzene rings, respectively, which was then polymerized with crosslinking agent-4,4'-bis (chloromethyl)-1,1'-biphenyl (BCMBP) in an ionic liquid system. The grafting of quaternary ammonium groups was beneficial for the removal of negative-charged humic acid (HA) and sterilization. The introduction of numerous rigid structures during benzylation and Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction could significantly improve the porosity and specific surface area of the polymer, conducive to the exposure of cyclodextrin binding sites and contaminant adsorption. By changing the proportions of quaternization and benzylation, the structure and surface properties of the polymer could be adjusted, thus further regulating the adsorption performance. Compared with activated carbon, the polymer named BQCD-BP with a huge surface area of 1133 m2 g-1 prepared under optimized conditions showed outstanding adsorption performance and sterilization ability. The pseudo-second-order kinetic constant of BQCD-BP reached 1.2058 g·mg-1·min-1, which was approximately 50 times greater than that of activated carbon (0.0256 g·mg-1·min-1) under the same experimental condition. The adsorption capacity of BQCD-BP to HA was twice as high as that to AC, and the antibacterial ability of BQCD-BP was significant, achieving 90% at the dosage of 1g L-1. Moreover, the adsorption process was hardly affected by the hydrochemical conditions, and the polymer was easy to regenerate. In addition, the excellent adsorption and antibacterial performance of the polymer were also identified by natural water treatment. COD was almost completely removed, and the removal efficiency of TP reached 92% after contact with BQCD-BP. The sterilization rate of BQCD-BP to viable bacteria in complex water bodies reached 82%. Undoubtedly, BQCD-BP is a potential multifunctional water treatment material with reasonable design in the actual water purification.","misc","wim","misc"
"642",35961209,"Mitochondria-targeted esculetin mitigates atherosclerosis in the setting of aging via the modulation of SIRT1-mediated vascular cell senescence and mitochondrial function in Apoe-/- mice.","Age is a dominant and independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis, a major cardiovascular disease, and if left untreated leads to myocardial infarction and death. Mitochondria-targeted anti-oxidants are evolving as a new class of compounds that can alter the pathophysiology of age-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in disease progression. We recently synthesized an alkyl TPP + -tagged esculetin (mitochondria-targeted esculetin or Mito-Esc). Apoe-/- mice were chronically (14 months) administered with Mito-Esc to investigate its efficacy in the mitigation of atherosclerosis in the setting of aging. We monitored BP, and performed various biochemical assays, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, inflammatory factors, qPCR, and Western blotting. Simultaneously, human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were used as a model system to study the mechanistic aspects. A chronic low-dose administration of Mito-Esc to Apoe-/- mice greatly prevented alterations in lipid profile, blood pressure, and atherosclerotic plaque formation in the setting of aging. Mito-Esc administration significantly reduced vascular senescence and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and prevented dysregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis markers in aortic tissue. Further, Mito-Esc treatment prevented replicative and stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) in HAEC. Importantly, Mito-Esc treatment delayed endothelial cell senescence by increasing human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) levels via SIRT1 activation. Moreover, Mito-Esc treatment by altering miR-19b and miR-30c via a SIRT1 activation significantly inhibited the increase in PAI-1 levels in HAEC as well as in the serum of Apoe-/- mice. In addition, Mito-Esc treatment improved mitochondrial function in late passage (aged) HAECs by enhancing the oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Furthermore, Mito-Esc administration counteracted the decline in GSH and nitrite levels in Apoe-/- mice and in HAECs. Overall, Mito-Esc alleviates atherosclerosis in the setting of aging by delaying vascular senescence and pro-inflammatory processes, and by improving mitochondrial biogenesis and function.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"643",35961214,"Application of prediction intervals to the interpretation of the robustness study of a UHPLC method for the separation of cannabinoids.","Design of Experiments (DoE) is a well-established tool used for analytical methods robustness studies, because of its ability to assess the effect of a great number of factors in a minimal number of experiments. However, when assessing the robustness of an analytical method the analysis of the individual effect of each factor is not sufficient on its own. Some factors may not influence the robustness of the method, but their effect combined with the effects of other factors may have a significant contribution on the robustness of the method, which is not given by conventional analysis of DoE results. The aim of this work is to propose, in addition to the analysis of the individual effects of the factors, to estimate the joint effect of the factors by means of the matrix experimental results prediction interval. This prediction interval is the interval in which, with a given probability, should fall the next results, therefore it is an interesting tool to estimate the variation limits of the method results during routine use. We also propose the use of two other prediction intervals which can help to analyze the DoE results and give a conclusion on the method robustness. The first one is based on the DoE experimental error information, and it gives an estimation of the experimental error component impact on the factors joint effect. The second one is based on the factors non-significance limits, and it provides the information regarding the factors impact on the responses in the case where the conditions are, by definition, robust. We applied these proposals to the robustness study of a UHPLC method for the separation of phytocannabinoids and we could demonstrate that, in addition to the calculated effects values and robustness information, the use of the prediction intervals information provided additional information that allowed a better interpretation of the method performance parameters.","misc","wim","misc"

The effect of melatonin application on enhancing plant stress tolerance has been widely reported, but the ameliorative effect of exogenous melatonin treatment on plants exposed to ionization stress is still unknown. This study investigated the ameliorative effects of two types of melatonin treatment, pre-sowing priming (prMel) and application during growth (ptMel), in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings exposed to different radiation doses (100, 200, 300 and 400 Gy) of radioactive cobalt (60Co) gamma rays as dry seeds. The growth parameters, photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll fluorescence, osmotic potential with soluble sugars, fructans and proline contents were then examined. The results indicated that high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) led to decreases in plant growth, pigment contents, chlorophyll fluorescence ratios and osmotic potential. However, soluble sugar, fructan and proline contents increased under IR stress conditions. Both melatonin applications, but particularly prMel, enhanced the morphological parameters, preserved the photosynthetic machinery and regulated the osmotic adjustment of IR-stressed wheat seedlings. Taken together, the findings show that exogenously applied melatonin, particularly prMel, play a significant role in alleviating IR stress in wheat seedlings.","misc","wim","misc"

A refined look at the process of disrupted autoregulation and the limitations of cerebral perfusion pressure in preventing secondary injury after traumatic brain injury.","The cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and its relationship between intracranial pressure and mean arterial pressure is a concept ubiquitous in caring for the critically ill patient. CPP is often used as a surrogate measure for cerebral blood flow (CBF); however, this view fails to account for changes in cerebral vascular resistance (CVR). Changes in CVR occur due to cerebral autoregulation, which has classically been taught on a sigma shaped curve with a decline and increase at either end of a plateau. Historically, the conceptualized regulation maintains careful homeostatic levels despite external or internal dynamic changes; however, moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been postulated to bring about cerebral autoregulation dysfunction. We review the current application of CPP is limited by the dynamic changes in cerebral autoregulation after TBI. This review highlights CPP's role as a surrogate measure for CBF and the inherent limitations of current clinical management, due to the lack of monitoring capable of capture continuous variables to assist real-time decision making. This review evaluates the known literature and introduces topics for discussion that warrant further investigation via pre-clinical and clinical experimentation.","misc","wim","misc"

There were 18 patients of which 14 (77.8%) treated with cefiderocol in combination and 4 (22.2%) with monotherapy. Median age was 54.5 (IQR 35.25-65.75) vs 70.5 (IQR 57.5-78.25) years old, respectively and ward of admission was the ICU in the 78.57% vs 100% of cases. In the 50% vs 100% of cases infections were VAP with concomitant bloodstream infections. Median SOFA score was 10 (IQR 4.5-12.5) vs 5 (IQR 4-6) and APACHE II score was 13.5 (IQR 7.5-18) vs 16 (IQR 8.5-23.5), respectively.

The amorphous PEDOT granules as the catalyst supports provide plenty of attachment sites for PdCu and PdNi nanoparticles. The optimized Pd1Cu3/PEDOT and Pd7Ni3/PEDOT catalysts both perform superior mass-based activity, area-based activity and intrinsic activity for EG oxidation as compared to other control samples. Moreover, chronoamperometry and long-term cyclic voltammetry tests demonstrate that the Pd1Cu3/PEDOT catalyst performs optimal anti-poisoning capability and catalytic durability. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the favourable dispersion of Pd1Cu3 and Pd7Ni3 nanoparticles on the PEDOT granules and the synergistic effects between Pd, Cu/Ni atoms and the electron-rich conjugated structure of PEDOT. In summary, this work synthesized two Pd/PEDOT-based electrocatalysts with promising catalytic application prospect in direct ethylene glycol fuel cell (DEGFC), which may provide some theoretical support for the design and synthesis of competent electrocatalysts for DEGFC.","misc","wim","misc"

Eleven hens, approximately 104 weeks old, were randomly assigned to BDL (n = 4) and sham surgery (SHAM; n = 7) groups. In BDL hens, histopathology revealed marked bile duct proliferation and liver fibrosis. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of myofibers from both the pectoralis (PCT) muscles significantly decreased in the BDL group compared with the SHAM group (P < 0.01). In contrast, the CSA of myofibers from the femorotibialis lateralis (FTL) muscle did not decrease in the BDL group. Type I fibers were large, round, and hypertrophic. Elongated type IIA and IIB fibers were also present. For IGF-1 immunostaining, the immunoreaction intensity was higher in the PCT in the BDL group than the SHAM group. Within the BDL group, type I fibers from FTL had a stronger immunoreaction intensity than the type II fibers. For IGF-1R immunostaining, the intensity of the immunoreactions was similar within the PCT in the BDL group compared with the SHAM group. For FTL, type I fibers had stronger reactions to IGF-1R than type II fibers in the BDL group. These results suggest that type I fibers express both IGF-1 and IGF-1R and become hypertrophic in chickens with hepatic fibrosis.","misc","wim","rodent"

This study aimed to explore how the addition of RhoA recombinant protein affected the viability and subcellular structure of rooster sperm after freeze-thawing and elucidated the molecular mechanisms of sperm cryopreservation. Semen quality and acrosome integrity testing revealed that the addition of 0.5 μg/mL RhoA recombinant protein to the cryoprotectant fluid significantly increased sperm motility, survival rate, linearity, straight-line velocity, and acrosome integrity after freeze-thawing (P < 0.05). Ultrastructure analysis of cryopreserved sperm showed structural damage to the sperm plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, and tail. However, compared to the control, these structural changes were reduced upon the addition of RhoA recombinant protein to the cryoprotective fluid (P < 0.05). Western blotting revealed that the expression of Rho/RhoA-associated kinase and p-cofilin was increased, and cofilin expression was decreased after sperm cryopreservation with recombinant RhoA protein. Treatment with Y-27632, a ROCK antagonist, suppressed ROCK and p-cofilin expression and decreased semen quality, acrosome integrity, and ultrastructure integrity. In summary, we have demonstrated a cryoprotective effect in spermatozoa involving the Rho/ROCK pathway during freeze-thawing. Furthermore, the addition of 0.5 μg/mL RhoA recombinant protein to the cryoprotective fluid improved rooster semen quality and subcellular structural homeostasis after freeze-thawing via the Rho/ROCK pathway. This pathway may regulate the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by regulating the cofilin phosphorylation.","misc","wim","misc"

Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (BNT162b2) vaccine and Oxford-Astra Zenecaa chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine have been approved to be used in Kuwait since December 2021. PWMS registered in Kuwait national registry were contacted by phone, WhatsApp, or through face-to-face interviews and were invited to complete our questionnaire. Demographic, clinical data, symptoms following the vaccine, worsening of pre-existing MS symptoms, and occurrence of relapse were recorded. Of the 820 PWMS, 647 completed the questionnaire. Between January 2021 and 31 August 2021, 383 (59.28%) PWMS received at least one dose of the approved vaccinations versus 63.4% of the general population on the same date. Their mean age was 36.82 + 8.80, and most of them, 247 (64.3%), were females. A total of 356 vaccinated cohorts (92.6%) were treated with disease-modifying therapies. Adverse events were reported by 261 (68.15%) subjects. One case of COVID-19 infection was encountered after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.

Knowledge is limited on the relationship between circadian genes, chronotype, sleeping patterns, chronutrition and obesity. The aim was to explore these associations within the EPIC-Spain cohort study. There were 3183 subjects with information on twelve genetic variants of six genes (PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1, NR1D1, CLOCK). Their association was evaluated with: chronotype and sleeping duration/quality (assessed by questionnaires), chrononutrition (number of meals and timing of intake assessed by a diet history), and also anthropometric measures of obesity at early and late adulthood (in two points in time), such as weight and waist circumference (assessed by physical measurements). Multivariable logistic and linear regression as well as additive genetic models were applied. Odds ratios (ORs), β coefficients, and p-values corrected for multiple comparisons were estimated. Genetic risk scores (GRS) were built to test gene-outcome associations further. At nominal significance level, the variant rs2735611 (PER1 gene) was associated with a 11.6% decrease in long-term weight gain (per-allele β = -0.12), whereas three CLOCK gene variants (rs12649507, rs3749474 and rs4864548), were associated with a ∼20% decrease in waist circumference gain (per-allele β ∼ -0.19). These and other associations with body measures did not hold after multiple testing correction, except waist-to-hip ratio and rs1801260, rs2070062 and rs4580704 (CLOCK gene). Associations with chrononutrition variables, chronotype and sleep duration/quality failed to reach statistical significance. Conversely, a weighted GRS was associated with the evening/late chronotype and with all other outcomes (p < 0.05). The chronotype-GRS was associated with an increased overweight/obesity risk (vs normal weight) in both early and late adulthood (OR = 2.2; p = 0.004, and OR = 2.1; p = 0.02, respectively).

MRSA isolates were obtained from pigs in slaughterhouses, diseased pigs on farms, imported breeding pigs, and farm dust. We conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and analyzed the molecular epidemiological relationship between these MRSA isolates using core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). The prevalence rates of MRSA among pigs in slaughterhouses, diseased pigs on farms, imported breeding pigs, and farm dust were 5.2 %, 3.4 %, 28.8 %, and 0.06 %, respectively. ST 398 isolates that classified as ST398/t034 were isolated from pigs from all sources. The results of cgMLST showed that ST398/t034 isolates originating from domestic pigs clustered into the same cluster as the isolates from imported breeding pigs. However, some clusters only included isolates of domestic pig origin. Most MRSA isolates in this study carried resistance genes for aminoglycosides, β-lactams, macrolides, tetracyclines, and zinc. None of the MRSA isolates in this study harbored Panton-Valentine leukocidin toxin genes. Molecular epidemiological analysis suggested a relationship between isolates from slaughter pigs and imported breeding pigs and the presence of MRSA isolates of domestic origin.

In this study, we identified and examined 52 hypercellular LM with sclerotic collagen, herein defined as cellular leiomyoma with sclerosis (CLM-S). CLM-S shows large tumour size (average 12.2 cm) and characteristic histology of tumour cells, arranged in cellular fascicles, sheets and trabeculae with abundant dense, pink sclerotic extracellular matrix in bands and nodules and increased vascularity. Tumour cells are uniform with small, round-oval nuclei and scant, pale-eosinophilic to vacuolated cytoplasm reminiscent of pericytes. The differential diagnosis of CLM-S includes conventional CLM, endometrial stromal tumours and perivascular epithelioid cell tumour. Immunohistochemical profile [HMGA2, fumarate hydratase, smooth muscle markers, Melan A and HMB-45] and molecular alterations [by HMGA2 mRNA reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), HMGA2 fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and MED12 sequencing] were analysed in comparison to matched myometrium and CLM controls. Remarkably, 96% (50 of 52) of CLM-S demonstrated diffuse positive immunoreactivity for HMGA2 and up to an 80-fold increase in HMGA2 mRNA, determined by RT-PCR. FISH analysis with break-part probes at intron 3 and the 5' UTR detected HMGA2 rearrangements in 47% (18 of 38) of CLM-S. All CLM-S retained expression of fumarate hydratase.

Hospital records were reviewed to identify modes of hemiarthroplasty failure, comorbidities and reoperations. Data were analyzed using χ2 test and Poisson and γ regression models. During our study period, 155 hips (154 patients [3%]) underwent 230 reoperations. Of these, 131 hips (85%) initially had an uncemented unipolar modular implant. Indications for first-time reoperation included periprosthetic femur fracture (49 hips [32%]), dislocation (45 hips [29%]), acetabular wear (28 hips [18%]) and infection (26 hips [17%]). There were 46 hips (30%) that had 2 or more reoperations. Reoperation for dislocation was associated with presence of dementia; acetabular wear was associated with absence of dementia. Time from hemiarthroplasty to reoperation was associated inversely with age at hemiarthroplasty, dislocation and dementia and was directly associated with acetabular wear. The risk of having 2 or more reoperations was associated independently with dislocation, infection, and alcohol abuse.

This study was a parallel, dual-arm, double-blind randomized controlled trial involving adult patients undergoing complex abdominal wall reconstruction with a biologic mesh at a quaternary care institution (2017-2020). Patients were randomly assigned to receive Permacol (cross-linked) compared with Strattice (not crosslinked). The main outcome measure was hernia recurrence at 1 or more years following the index repair. We included 94 patients randomized to undergo reconstruction with 1 of 2 commonly used biologic mesh products (mean age 59.4 yr, standard deviation [SD] 9.9; 51% female; body mass index 32.9, SD 6.8). We found no significant differences between the groups (patient comorbidities, hernia recurrence risk factors, hernia size or infection profiles). Hernia recurrence rates (15%) were similar between groups (median 783 days of follow up, interquartile range 119). We found there was significantly less of a need for a component separation technique in the Strattice group (69% v. 87%). All other secondary outcome measures were equivalent between study arms.

Little has been published regarding the management and surgical outcomes of patients with cervical NTs based on pathology category. This study compared and identified the preoperative characteristics of cervical NTs in different pathology categories and evaluated the outcomes of patients undergoing surgical resection. Upon the institutional review board's approval, a retrospective chart review was performed at Beijing Children's Hospital from April 2013 to August 2020. Demographics of patients, imaging data, lab test results, operation details and outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Of 32 cervical NTs, 24(80%) were classified as neuroblastoma (NB) /ganglioneuroblastoma-nodular (GNBn) and 8(20%) as ganglioneuroblastoma-intermixed (GNBi)/ ganglioneuroma (GN). Patients with GNBi/GN were older than those with NB/GNBn (44.5 months (IQR 16-81) vs 9 months (IQR 1-47); P = 0.001). GNBi/GN patients presented more frequently with stage 1 disease compared with NB/GNBn patients (100% vs. 29.2%, P = 0.001), less frequently with tumor-related symptoms (0% vs. 70.8%, P = 0.001), artery encased tumor (0% vs. 41.7%, P = 0.035), and surgical complications (25% vs. 70.8%, P = 0.038). GNBi/GN patients were also less likely to show elevated neuron specific enolase (NSE) (12.5% vs. 79.2%, P = 0.002). Cervical NB/GNBn and GNBi/GN patients had distinct characteristic clinical presentations and surgical outcomes. For children with features suggestive of benign disease (older age, asymptomatic, normal serum tumor markers) and no artery image-defined risk factors (IDRFs), upfront resection can be considered.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Second, the child's statements were recorded and the investigation started before the possible identification of the previous personality was made. Third, in a number of ways, it is comparable to the case of James Leininger, one of the best-known American cases: The child claimed to have fought in the Second World War and have been killed in a battle; had unusual knowledge about a battleship with which he claimed to have been affiliated; and repeated in a play the crucial scene of the battle in which he claimed to have died.","misc","wim","misc"

A prognostic index estimating the MpBC survival would be attractive in clinical practice. We retrospectively analyzed MpBC patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Prognostic factors were identified and the final nomogram was developed to predict the 1-, 3-, or 5-year overall survival (OS). Calibration curves were provided to internally validate the performance of the nomogram and discriminative ability was appraised by concordance index (C-index). A total of 1017 MpBC patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 were assigned into 3:1 as training set (n = 763) and SEER validation set (n = 254). An external validation was performed by an individual set of 94 MpBC patients from National Cancer Center in China from 2010 to 2018. The nomogram finally consisted of 7 independent prognostic factors and presented a good accuracy for predicting the OS with the C-index of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.751-0.786). Interestingly, the nomogram based on the western (including 92.5% non-Asian) SEER validation population (C-index of nomogram: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.737-0.796) also has an optimal discrimination in Asian population (C-index of nomogram: 0.70). The calibration plots of the nomogram predictions were also accurate and corresponded closely with the actual survival rates. This novel nomogram was accurate enough to predict the OS by using readily available clinicopathologic factors in MpBC general population, which could provide individualized recommendations for patients and clinical decisions for physicians.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The study included 19 patients with frontal sinus fungal osteomyelitis. The main line of treatment was surgical debridement (sequestrectomy). Approaches included combined external and endoscopic approaches (n = 15) and pure endoscopic approaches (n = 4) according to the extent and accessibility of the sequestrum. Postoperative healing was satisfactory in all patients. All patients returned to their normal daily activity within 4-6 weeks, without residual or recurrent frontal sinus infection, osteomyelitis or need for revision procedures. Within the limitation of this case series, it seems that there is no need to adopt a new therapy regimen for treatment of frontal sinus fungal osteomyelitis because the conventional and well-known treatment approach combining surgery and antifungal drugs seems to work well. However, early, and adequate debridement and sequestrectomy is crucial. Furthermore, an open approach may be required according to the extent of osteomyelitis.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Our study updates the comprehensive studies of Felix (1912), van Wagenen and Simpson (1965), and Juric-Lekic et al. (2013), which were published in books and thus are unsearchable via PubMed. Human gonads develop from the germinal ridge, a thickening of coelomic epithelium on the medial side of the urogenital ridge. The bilateral urogenital ridges contain elements of the mesonephric kidney, namely the mesonephric duct, mesonephric tubules, and mesonephric glomeruli. The germinal ridge, into which primordial germ cells migrate, is initially recognized as a thickening of coelomic epithelium on the urogenital ridge late in the 4th week of gestation. Subsequently, in the 5th week of gestation, a dense mesenchyme develops sub-adjacent to the epithelium of the germinal ridge, and together these elements bulge into the coelomic cavity forming bilateral longitudinal ridges attached to the urogenital ridges. During development, primordial cells migrate into the germinal ridge and subsequently into testicular cords that form within the featureless dense mesenchyme of the germinal ridge at 6-8 weeks of gestation. The initial low density of testicular cords seen at 8 weeks remodels into a dense array of testicular cords surrounded by α-actin-positive myoid cells during the second trimester. Human testicular development shares many features with that of mice being derived from 4 elements: coelomic epithelium, sub-adjacent mesenchyme, primordial germ cells, and the mesonephros.","misc","wim","misc"

A randomized, blinded, experimental study design. A total of 120 male Japanese quail, aged 7 weeks. A formalin solution (0.3%, 0.6% and 0.9%; total volume of 40 μL) was injected subcutaneously (SC) into the medial aspect of the right metatarsus (shank). Foot lift and preening activities were recorded for 45 minutes following injection of formalin and scored by an investigator blinded to the treatment. An open field test was used to evaluate motor activity. Treatments included SC saline, SC morphine (1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg kg-1) and oral ibuprofen (5 and 10 mg kg-1). The treatment effect was analyzed by one-way anova and the time course effect analyzed using repeated measures anova, both followed by Dunnett's post hoc test (p < 0.05). All formalin concentrations induced significant foot lifting activity in the first phase (0-5 minutes), whereas only 0.6% and 0.9% formalin elicited responses in both the first and second (25-45 minutes) phases. Neither morphine nor ibuprofen affected phase 1 of the formalin test. Morphine (2.5 and 5 mg kg-1) and ibuprofen (5 and 10 mg kg-1) significantly reduced foot lift responses. Preening activity was significantly decreased following injection of 0.6% and 0.9% formalin. Preening was normalized with ibuprofen, but not with morphine. Morphine, but not ibuprofen, reduced quail activity. These results suggest that the formalin test was a reliable method for assessing tonic pain behavior in quail. The acute phase of the formalin test was not affected by morphine or ibuprofen. Although ibuprofen reduced the pain response in phase 2, the analgesic effects of morphine were not conclusive because morphine appeared to induce sedation.","misc","wim","randomized_trial"

We determined the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles based on the total annual HPB volume. We then identified patients with non-resected PDAC. We utilized inverse probability (IP)-weighted Cox regression to estimate the effect of facility volume on overall survival (OS). We identified 710,988 patients with HPB malignancies.

Video of laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed at Christchurch Hospital, NZ and North Shore Private Hospital, Sydney Australia were prospectively recorded. Using a framework derived from a previously published standard process video was annotated using a standardized template and stratified by operative grade to evaluate the impact of grade on operative process. 317 patients had their laparoscopic cholecystectomy operations prospectively recorded. Seventy one percent of these videos (n = 225) were annotated. Single ICC of operative grade was 0.760 (0.663-0.842 p < 0.010). Median operative time, rate of operative errors significantly increased and rate of CVS decreased with increasing operative grade. Significant differences in operative anatomy, operative process and instrumentation were seen with increasing grade. Operative technical difficulty is accurately predicted by operative grade and this impacts on operative process with significant implications for both surgeons and patients. Consequently operative grade should be documented routinely as part of a culture of safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

We hypothesize that oncogene overlap and MET amplicon size decline with increase in MET plasma copy number (pCN), thus enriching for MET-dependent states. We interrogated cell-free DNA NGS results of 16,782 patients with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC to identify those with MET amplification as reported using Guardant360. Co-occurring genomic mutations and copy number alterations within each sample were evaluated. An exploratory method of adjusting for tumor fraction was also performed and amplicon size for MET was analyzed when available. MET amplification was detected in 207 (1.2%) of samples. pCN ranged from 2.1 to 52.9. Of these, 43 (20.8%) had an overlapping oncogenic driver, including 23 (11.1%) METex14 skipping or other MET mutations. The degree of (non-MET) oncogene overlap decreased with increases in pCN. Patients with MET pCN ≥ 2.7 had lower rates of overlapping drivers compared to those with MET pCN < 2.7 (6.1% vs. 16.3%, P = .033). None of the 7 patients with pCN > 6.7 had an overlapping driver. After adjusting for tumor fraction, adjusted pCN (ApCN) was also lower for those with overlapping drivers than those without (median ApCN 4.9 vs. 7.3, P =.024). There was an inverse relationship between amplicon size and pCN. We propose that a high MET pCN and/or ApCN, together with the absence of overlapping oncogenic drivers and small MET amplicon size, will enrich for patients most likely to derive benefit from MET targeted therapy.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Despite the availability of PrEP, HIV infections continue to occur. Access and adherence are major limitations to PrEP. Long-acting injectable antiretroviral agents are now being added to the HIV armamentarium. Long-acting agents offer the advantage of less frequent dosing with intramuscular administration versus oral dosing. Cost, injection site pain, and needle hesitancy may be detriments to the use of these agents in certain patients. More studies are needed to completely discern the role of various products and future long-acting agents as options for PrEP. Even when we consider their limitations, long-acting agents may provide an eventual opportunity to transform the delivery of PrEP. Pharmacists should be aware of the potential impact of PrEP and the advantages and disadvantages of these new long-acting agents.

On the contrary, moderate low doses of UVB irradiation are shown to be essential and beneficial to human health, including a tumor-suppressive effect. However, the mechanism by which low levels of UVB suppress tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, using tumor-bearing mouse models, we show that moderate low repetitive UVB irradiation increases the percentage of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CD103+ conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s), while it decreases the number of immunosuppressive, M2-like macrophages in the tumors. Finally, in mice, deletion of Batf3, a transcription factor critical for the development of conventional dendritic cells, including the CD103+ cDC1s, showed increased tumor growth in both sham- and UVB-irradiated mice. Our findings demonstrate that moderate low UVB irradiation inhibits M2-like tumor-associated macrophages, increases CD103+ cDC1s and promotes antitumor immunity in mice with an established tumor.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 3 µg/kg of intranasal desmopressin acetate or 1 mL/kg of intranasal sodium chloride 0.65%, one hour before ultrasound-guided, percutaneous native kidney biopsy. The primary outcome was the post-biopsy bleeding complications, and secondary outcomes were the volume of perirenal hematoma, and changes of post-biopsy hemoglobin and hematocrit level, plasma sodium and blood pressure (Clinical Trial Registration ID: IRCT20090701002112N3). A total of 120 patients (58 men and 62 women), 60 patients in each group, were analyzed. The mean age and eGFR of the patients were 45.29 ± 15.95 years and 51.77 ± 18.02 ml/min/ 1.73m², respectively. Desmopressin administration significantly decreased post-biopsy perirenal hematoma compared to placebo (7/60 [11.6%]) vs. 33/60 [40%]; P < .05), and the hematoma volume was significantly smaller in the desmopressin group, in case of hematoma formation (2.31 ± 1.17 vs. 7.72 ± 5.45 mm³, P < .05). Desmopressin administration before kidney biopsy is a safe and effective strategy to prevent bleeding complications.

Successful bony integration and functional elbow range of motion were achieved. A paucity of literature exists to guide the treatment of pediatric distal humerus fractures with significant bone loss. Despite complications associated with osteochondral allografts, they provide a reasonable treatment option to preserve elbow motion in children with unreconstructible intra-articular distal humerus fractures to avoid arthrodesis.","misc","wim","misc"
"679",35963017,"Oxidative degradation in pharmaceuticals: Mechanism and stabilization of a spray-dried amorphous drug - A case study.","Drug formulations such as spray drying are often required to improve the physicochemical properties and bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs. However, excipients often carry contaminants/ impurities and may also increase moisture levels in solid formulations, which can have detrimental effects on the drugs, including drug degradation and stability. Hence, achieving adequate shelf life of drug products has been among the most challenging issues for pharmaceuticals. Here we report a case study where we systematically studied the oxidative degradation of a pharmaceutical compound GENE-A, spray-dried and dispersed in hydroxypropyl methylcellulose-acetate succinate polymer matrix. Three different oxidative degradation products were observed, and their mechanisms of formation were investigated via forced degradation studies. Finally, we used several antioxidants based on their mechanisms of action to reduce/ prevent the drug degradation process. Propyl gallate alone and in combination with Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid completely prevented the formation of two degradation products, whereas there was no significant impact observed on the third one. The results showed that both metal chelators and free radical terminators most effectively prevented drug degradation. This study may address some of the key issues that pharmaceutical companies encounter and offer appropriate solutions to counter the oxidative degradation process of pharmaceuticals.","misc","wim","misc"

A generic synthetic route has been explored to apply the current investigation to the majority of the market available synthetic routes for the carvedilol process. Five significant GTIs were identified, and their toxicity was examined using in-silico model. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the impurities were compared with the drug molecule to evince the associated risk of impurities during therapeutic action. Furthermore, a quantitative comparison has been made for each impurity with the drug molecule for their ADMET properties, and the potential nature of the impurities has been thoroughly assessed. The developed method encompasses simple derivatization cum extraction-oriented GC-MS method for the reported GTIs, which was also validated as per current ICH guidelines. The obtained LOD and LOQ for the method were between 0.06 ~ 0.61 µg/g and 0.17 ~ 1.8 µg/g, respectively, and the r2 values (0.994 ~ 0.997) show that the method is very sensitive and linear over a wide range (LOQ to 120 % of the target concentration). The percentage recoveries and relative standard deviation obtained were between 85.3 and 109.5 and 0.1-4.7, respectively, showing fit for purpose. Moreover, method precision, intermediate precision, and robustness of the method have also been successfully demonstrated. Thus, this method could be directly engaged as the quality forecasting tool for the marketed drug samples aimed at the estimation of the reported GTIs at trace level.","misc","wim","misc"

However, DSMES has been underutilized because of many barriers. We aimed to develop a patient-centered educational aid, SEE-Diabetes (Support-Engage-Empower-Diabetes), that facilitates shared decision-making about DSMES between patient and provider during the follow-up visit. We investigated the information needs to inform the design of the SEE-Diabetes from the providers' perspective. We conducted an online survey (N = 42) and three focus groups (N = 13) involving providers who have experience managing diabetes in older patients. Survey collected demographics and assessed knowledge of DSMES. During the subsequent focus groups, participants evaluated the Assessment and Plan section of three clinic notes of older people with diabetes. We also demonstrated the potential workflow of DSMES documentation using SEE-Diabetes during clinical practice. The survey showed 60% of providers were familiar with DSMES. Focus group findings showed clinic notes should convey concise information at an appropriate reading level, numbered problems, and less medical jargon to improve the readability of clinic notes. Application of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals was suggested to deliver effective diabetes self-care information. Providers should consider adopting validated DSMES guidelines along with goal-setting strategies to provide patient-centered care. The research team will integrate the provider recommendations when we develop SEE-Diabetes.","misc","wim","misc"

We conduct exploratory analyses of social patterns that uphold vaccination success for COVID-19 and measles. We use publicly available data on COVID vaccination rates and other country-level indicators from Our World in Data, Human Development Report, Corruption Perception Index, and the World Bank to devise bivariate correlations and multiple regression models. About 70% of the variability in COVID-19 vaccination rates in February 2022 can be explained by differences in the Human Development Index (HDI) and, specifically, in life expectancy at birth. Trust in doctors and nurses adds predictive value beyond HDI, clarifying controversial discrepancies between vaccination rates in countries with similar levels of HDI and vaccine availability. Cardiovascular disease deaths, an indicator of general health system effectiveness, and infant measles immunization coverage, an indicator of country-level immunization effectiveness, are also significant, though weaker, predictors of COVID-19 vaccination success. Measles vaccination in 2019 is similarly predicted by HDI and trust in doctors and nurses. The remaining variability in COVID-19 vaccination success that cannot be pinned down through these sets of metrics points to a considerable scope for collective and individual agency in a time of crisis. The mobilization and coordination in the vaccination campaigns of citizens, medical professionals, scientists, journalists, and politicians, among others, account for at least some of this variability in overcoming vaccine hesitancy and inequity.","misc","wim","misc"
"683",35963043,"Campylobacter biofilms.","Campylobacter infection is one of the most widespread foodborne gastroenteritis worldwide. As a commensal microbe in the intestinal tracts of food-producing animals, Campylobacter easily enters the food chain and eventually transmits to human hosts through the consumption of contaminated food products. The survival of Campylobacter in food chain remains as a paradox considering its fastidious growth requirement in laboratory settings and ubiquitous presence in unfavorable environment. Biofilm is suggested as a key persistence mechanism used by Campylobacter during its transmission from animals to humans. This review summarizes Campylobacter biofilm characteristics, identifies biological and non-biological factors that influence biofilm formation, and discusses the control strategies. Overall, biofilm formation ability shows strain-to-strain variation in Campylobacter and is affected by the presence of other co-cultivated bacteria. Carbohydrates and eDNA are recognized as significant portions of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in Campylobacter biofilm. Advanced techniques such as super resolution microscopy and chemical imaging platforms can demonstrate the structure and EPS biochemical compositions. Biofilm formation relies on various biological factors (e.g., flagella, cell surface hydrophobicity, and quorum sensing) and environmental factors (e.g., substrate properties, hydrodynamic condition, and nutrients). Different biological and inorganic compounds can inactivate Campylobacter biofilm along with the feasibility of discovering specific chemicals to quench quorum sensing of this microbe so as to indirectly reduce its biofilm. Taken together, Campylobacter biofilm research is still in its infancy and future research can focus on investigating dormancy state and antimicrobial resistance evolution in biofilms as well as in vivo characterization.","misc","wim","misc"

Whether DNA can be adopted to estimate bloodstain formation time is still controversial, and there is no study to confirm the potential of mtDNA markers. To address these issues, a triple quantification method based on the ratio of mtDNA fragments of different lengths of COⅠ (mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase Ⅰ) for estimating bloodstain formation time was established. A total of 152 samples (140 old samples, 12 fresh samples) were collected and tested, and the absolute copies of different-sized fragments of COⅠ (304 bp, 120 bp, 41 bp) in all samples were quantified by SYBR Green real-time qPCR. The natural logarithms of two copy number ratios (304 bp/41 bp, 120 bp/41 bp) of COⅠ in old samples were calculated, which were used as degradation indexes to evaluate the degradation degree of mtDNA. The 140 old human blood samples from 1 to 14 years of storage were accumulated from casework of forensic practice to establish the method of estimating bloodstain formation time and used to analyze the impact of gender factors on the two degradation indexes, and 10 animal samples and 2 fresh human samples were collected to verify the human specificity of the method. There was a high correlation between degradation indexes and bloodstain formation time (the absolute values of correlation coefficients of these two degradation indexes were 0.901 and 0.758 respectively). A method with triple quantification and dual indexes estimating bloodstain formation timewas successfully established, which was highly human-specific. There was no statistically significant difference in degradation indexes between different gender samples (P > 0.05). This study confirmed that mtDNA can be utilized to estimate bloodstain formation time, which provides a new solution to the forensic problem of estimating the time of bloodstain formation.","misc","wim","misc"

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the effects of selenium supplementation on these lipid profile and BP. In order to identify interrelated clinical trials, we performed a comprehensive literature search in the online databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and ISI web of science, up to December 2021. The analysis of the data established that selenium supplementation did not significantly affect TG level (WMD: -0.84 mg/dL; 95 % CI: -4.74, 3.05, p = 0.671), LDL-C (WMD: 0.86 mg/dL; 95 % CI: -1.21, 2.95, p = 0.416), and HDL-C (WMD: 0.3 mg/dL; 95 % CI: -0.66, 1.27, p = 0.535). however, there was a significant reduction in TC levels following selenium supplementation (WMD: -2.11 mg/dL; 95 % CI: -4.09, -0.13, p = 0.037). After subgroup analysis, when the baseline levels of LDL-C were < 130 mg/dL, selenium supplementation elicited a significant increase in LDL-C levels (WMD: 2.89 mg/dL; 95 % CI: 0.26, 5.51, p = 0.031). For BP, selenium supplementation significantly increased SBP (WMD: 2.02 mmHg; 95 % CI: 0.50, 3.55, p = 0.009), while it had no significant effect on DBP (WMD: 0.39 mmHg; 95 % CI: (-0.89, 1.68, p = 0.551)). Although our findings suggest selenium may have possible therapeutic effects in improving TC and VLDL, because of its negative effects on LDL and BP, selenium supplementation for cardiovascular protection should be recommended with caution.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

A two-arm parallel, single-blind randomised controlled trial. A teaching hospital in Northern Taiwan. Pregnant women ≥ 20 years of age with a singleton pregnancy (12-24 weeks gestation) and their support partners were recruited. All women included in the study had a score of ≥ 7 points on a fear of childbirth visual analogue scale. The intervention group (n = 53) received an 8-week course in a childbirth education programme, which included (1) childbirth education using simulation-based learning that highlighted coping with labour pain and (2) instruction in mindfulness breathing, body scans, stretching, sitting meditation, and mindfulness walking. Support partners were invited to participate. The control group (n = 53) received the usual standard prenatal care. The primary outcome of fear of childbirth was assessed using the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire. The secondary outcomes of anxiety, depression, and dispositional mindfulness were assessed with the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale, and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, respectively. Repeated data were collected at baseline, 36 weeks gestation, and 1 week postpartum. Ninety-one mothers completed the study, with a mean age of 33.9 years (SD = 4.4), and most were primipara (n = 83). The baseline measurements did not differ between the groups. Compared with the control group, there were significant differences in all measures from baseline for the intervention group: the scores were significantly lower for fear of childbirth (mean difference (MD) =-14.8 ∼ -23.7, p < .01), symptoms of anxiety (MD =-7.4 ∼ -6.4, p < .01), and depression (MD =-3.7 ∼ -3.5, p < .01); the levels of dispositional mindfulness were significantly higher (MD =4.9 ∼ 5.7, p < .01) at 36 weeks gestation, and 1 week postpartum. The 8-week integrated childbirth education intervention was effective in reducing the fear of childbirth in pregnant women. The mindfulness techniques were easily learnt and applied by the participants. Using these techniques during pregnancy and labour enhanced participants' mental health and coping. The integrated childbirth education which includes pregnant women and their support partners could be easily taught by midwives in other contexts.","randomized_trial","wim","randomized_trial"

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in adults demonstrates almost universally reversible parietal-occipital disease. We aimed to demonstrate in a cohort of children that atypical distribution is expected, acutely and on follow-up. A retrospective review of children diagnosed with PRES from 2010 to 2018 at our children's hospital was performed. All had MRI at diagnoses, with over half having follow-up MRIs. Images were reviewed by a neuroradiology-trained pediatric radiologist for confirmation of findings consistent with PRES/identification of involved regions. Nineteen patients (aged zero to 18 years, 53% female) were included. Notably, two were infants. Nearly all had seizures; all had altered mental status and hypertension. Fifteen (84%) had MRI described as atypical. Distribution of MRI findings was anatomically widespread, including nine with frontal findings. Twelve (63%) had follow-up imaging, of which approximately half remained abnormal. Pediatric PRES MRI findings were more often atypical at time of diagnosis. Vasogenic edema related to the acute phases of PRES typically resolved; however, follow-up imaging identified new volume loss in the areas affected. Two of our subjects were younger than 13 months, younger than typically described. Our series demonstrates that imaging distribution in children with PRES does not mirror the classical posterior, reversible distribution described in adults and continues the recent trend of identifying PRES in infants.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

This study was designed to reveal the toxic effects of polystyrene nanoplastic (PS NP) exposure on the freshwater macrophyte Lemna minor. In addition, elucidating the interaction of this aquatic plant, which is used extensively in the phytoremediation of water contaminants and wastewater treatment facilities, with nanoplastics will guide the development of remediation techniques. For this purpose, we examined nanoplastic accumulation, oxidative stress markers, photosynthetic efficiency, antioxidant system activity and phytohormonal changes in L. minor leaves subjected to PS NP stress (P-1, 100 mg L-1; P-2, 200 mg L-1 PS NP). Our results showed no evidence of PS NP-induced oxidative damage in P-1 group plants, although PS NP accumulation reached 56 µg g-1 in the leaves. Also, no significant changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were observed in this group, indicating unaffected photosynthetic efficiency. PS NP exposure triggered the antioxidant system in L. minor plants and resulted in a 3- and 4.6-fold increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the P-1 and P-2 groups. On the other hand, high-dose PS NP treatment resulted in insufficient antioxidant activity in the P-2 group and increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and lipid peroxidation (TBARS contents) by 25 % and 17 % compared to the control plants. Furthermore, PS NP exposure triggered abscisic acid biosynthesis (two-fold in the P-1 and three-fold in the P-2 group), which is also involved in regulating the stress response. In conclusion, L. minor plants tolerated NP accumulation without growth suppression, oxidative stress damage and limitations in photosynthetic capacity and have the potential to be used in remediation studies of NP-contaminated waters.","misc","wim","misc"

Shewanella oneidensis (S. oneidensis) has diverse electron transfer pathways and can use a variety of contaminants as electron acceptors or electron donors. This paper reviews S. oneidensis's function in removing environmental pollutants, including heavy metals, inorganic non-metallic ions (INMIs), and toxic organic pollutants. S. oneidensis can mineralize o-xylene (OX), phenanthrene (PHE), and pyridine (Py) as electron donors, and also reduce azo dyes, nitro aromatic compounds (NACs), heavy metals, and iodate by extracellular electron transfer (EET). For azo dyes, NACs, Cr(VI), nitrite, nitrate, thiosulfate, and sulfite that can cross the membrane, S. oneidensis transfers electrons to intracellular reductases to catalyze their reduction. However, most organic pollutants cannot be directly degraded by S. oneidensis, but S. oneidensis can remove these pollutants by self-synthesizing catalysts or photocatalysts, constructing bio-photocatalytic systems, driving Fenton reactions, forming microbial consortia, and genetic engineering. However, the industrial-scale application of S. oneidensis is insufficient. Future research on the metabolism of S. oneidensis and interfacial reactions with other materials needs to be deepened, and large-scale reactors should be developed that can be used for practical engineering applications.","misc","wim","misc"

Therefore, the development of a portable gas-sensing technology for high-efficiency detection of TEA is of great worth for human health and environmental monitoring. In this work, a mixed potential type TEA sensor was initially developed based on pyrochlore Gd2Zr2O7 solid state electrolyte and BiVO4 sensing electrode. The sensor generates high response values of - 62.2 mV and - 134.4 mV to 5 ppm and 100 ppm TEA at 500 °C, respectively. The response value of the sensor displays a logarithmic linear relationship with the concentration of TEA in the range of 1-100 ppm with the sensitivity of - 50.8 mV/decade. Besides, the sensor shows good response and recovery characteristics, and the response and recovery time to 10 ppm TEA is 10 s and 89 s, respectively. Moreover, the sensor possesses good humidity resistance, reproducibility and stability. The sensing behavior of the sensor is explained by the mixed potential sensing mechanism, which is confirmed by the measurement of the polarization curves. This work provides a good supplement for TEA gas sensor, which holds important application value for the sensitive detection of TEA in the environment.","misc","wim","misc"

Standard annuloplasty procedures lead to an average of 55% annular area reduction of the end diastolic pre-operative annular area in Barlow's diseased valves. Following annular reduction, mitral valvuloplasty may be needed, usually with special focus on the posterior leaflet. An in silico pipeline to perform annuloplasty by utilizing the pre- and -postoperative 3D echocardiographic recordings was developed. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that annuloplasty ring sizes based on a percentage (10%-25%) decrease of the pre-operative annular area at end diastole can result in sufficient coaptation area for the selected Barlow's diseased patient. The patient specific mitral valve geometry and finite element model were created from echocardiography recordings. The post-operative echocardiography was used to obtain the artificial ring geometry and displacements, and the motion of the papillary muscles after surgery. These were used as boundary conditions in our annuloplasty finite element analyses. Then, the segmented annuloplasty ring was scaled up to represent a 10%, 20% and 25% reduction of the pre-operative end diastolic annular area and implanted to the end diastolic pre-operative finite element model. The pre-operative contact area decrease was shown to be dependent on the annular dilation at late systole. Constraining the mitral valve from dilating excessively can be sufficient to achieve proper coaptation throughout systole. The finite element analyses show that the selected Barlow's diseased patient may benefit from an annuloplasty ring with moderate annular reduction alone.","misc","wim","misc"

However, the clinical outcome after STN-DBS is variable. The aim of this study was to explore the coherence of antagonistic muscles measured with electromyography (EMG) as novel biomarker of STN-DBS efficacy in PD. EMG of bilateral wrist and upper arm antagonistic muscles of 21 PD patients was recorded during three standardized motor tasks. Patients were measured one day prior to DBS surgery (pre-DBS) and 6 months afterwards (post-DBS). Coherence analyses were performed on the antagonistic muscle pairs. Pearson correlations between intermuscular coherence and clinical performance were calculated. Intermuscular coherence during each of the different co-contraction tasks significantly correlated to UPDRS-III bradykinesia scores (p < 0.01). In other words, higher intermuscular coherence is associated with more severe PD symptoms. Moreover, coherence changes (pre-DBS - post-DBS coherence) correlated to clinical score changes after DBS (p < 0.01) and pre-DBS coherence correlated to this clinical score change as well (p < 0.01). Higher pre-DBS coherence of antagonistic arm muscles is correlated to worsening of clinical PD state and higher intermuscular coherence predicts enhanced clinical improvement. We propose that pre-DBS intermuscular coherence could be developed into a predictor of STN-DBS clinical outcome. It could aid patient selection and adaptive stimulation algorithms for DBS.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

"699",35963623,"Lipid and Lipoprotein Metabolism.","The exogenous lipoprotein pathway starts with the incorporation of dietary lipids into chylomicrons in the intestine. Chylomicron triglycerides are metabolized in muscle and adipose tissue and chylomicron remnants are formed, which are removed by the liver. The endogenous lipoprotein pathway begins in the liver with the formation of very low-density lipoprotein particles (VLDL). VLDL triglycerides are metabolized in muscle and adipose tissue forming intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), which may be taken up by the liver or further metabolized to low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Reverse cholesterol transport begins with the formation of nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by the liver and intestine that acquire cholesterol from cells resulting in mature HDL. The HDL then transports the cholesterol to the liver either directly or indirectly by transferring the cholesterol to VLDL or LDL.","misc","wim","misc"

Hypertriglyceridemia is a critical component of the metabolic syndrome but can also occur secondary to several other conditions or drugs. Hypertriglyceridemia frequently is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins are the mainstay of CVD prevention in hypertriglyceridemia, but eicosapentaenoic ethyl esters should be added in very-high-risk individuals.

To determine the impact of a strategy based on strict control and close follow-up for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) through the use of post-ACS virtual lipid visits on lipid-lowering therapy, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and outcomes. Prospective study that consecutively included patients with ACS during 2020. All patients were discharged with high-intensity statins, and the lipid profile was determined after 1 month. At this time, patients were contacted by phone, and treatment was adjusted following the therapeutic algorithm of the Spanish Society of Cardiology. These visits were repeated every month until LDL-c reached <55 mg/dL. Patients were then transferred to scheduled conventional outpatient visits. A total of 346 patients (67.3±2.3 years; 68.2% men) were included. Follow-up was 12-24 months (mean, 17.7±3.8; median, 17.3). Definitive lipid-lowering therapy (mean uptitration time, 3.2±2.1 months) consisted of high-intensity statins alone (32.4%), high-intensity statins plus ezetimibe (56.9%), and PCSK9 inhibitors (10.7%). LDL-c decreased from 108.4±40.6 to 48.7±14.4 mg/dL. At baseline, LDL-c was <100 mg/dL, 70 mg/dL, and 55 mg/dL in 44.5%, 17.6%, and 7.2% of patients, respectively. At study end, these percentages were 100%, 95.4%, and 81.5%, respectively.

The above indicators were analyzed and compared between the two groups. Binary multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to explore the association between BRT parameters and risk of bone loss in the subjects Mediation Effect was conducted to test endocrine variables as mediators in the correlation of BRT parameters with the bone loss for the possible mechanisms. There were 669 cases in the at least osteopenia group and 329 in the normal group. RBC, Hb, HCT and MCHC were all positively correlated with BMD of lumbar spine(L1-4), left femoral neck and left femur, along with lymph positively correlated with BMD of left femoral neck and left femur, respectively. Eosinophils(Eo) was positively correlated with BMD of L1-L4 and RDW-SD together with RDW-CV were both negatively correlated with BMD of left femoral neck and left femur. By binary multivariate logistic regression, only Hb was associated with bone loss and the OR value was 0.478 as protective factor for BMD. Estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) had partial mediating effect on the association of BRT parameters with the risk of bone loss.

In addition, to our knowledge, no study has yet scientifically evaluated a brief universal suicide prevention programme in Switzerland. This study investigated the efficacy and acceptability of a brief universal suicide prevention programme for school-aged youths. Primary outcomes included knowledge on suicide, perceived suicide awareness and knowledge of help-seeking resources. Secondary outcomes included acceptability coping skills, suicide-related behaviours and psychological distress. This non-randomised cluster-controlled trial was conducted in Swiss schools. A 90-minute workshop for universal suicide prevention was delivered to the intervention group (n = 209), and the control group had no intervention (n = 96). Measures were assessed at baseline and after one month. Acceptability was assessed at follow-up in the intervention group only. Data were analysed using three-level mixed effect models with an interaction term between group and time. There were interaction effects between group and time for most outcomes: perceived suicide awareness (p <0.010), knowledge of help-seeking resources (p <0.001), coping planning (p = 0.039), suicidal ideation (p = 0.019) and psychological distress (p = 0.012).

Finally, third-generation sequencing technologies allowed the determination of single-molecule sequences up to a million nucleotides in length, which is key for high-quality genome assemblies. An important task is to obtain a pan-genome, which includes an entire set of nucleotide sequences presented in various genotypes of the same species. The sequencing of plant genomes made it possible to assess intraspecific polymorphism, identify key genes influencing the formation of significant features, and develop molecular markers of economically valuable traits and this has become the basis for the development of marker-assisted and genomic selection.

Proteome profiling reveals dozens of Rab proteins associated with lipid droplets (LDs), but few of them have been functionally validated. Cell death activator CIDE-3 protein mediates LD fusion and growth. It is highly enriched at LD-LD contact sites. Here, we investigated the role of Rab3D in lipid storage in adipocyte. We verified that the adipose levels of Rab3D transcript were higher than that of other Rab3 family members; the differences were most pronounced in white adipose tissue. Moreover, we showed that Rab3D promotes LD growth in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in a dose dependent manner, independently of the process of CIDE-3-mediated LD fusion. Finally, we confirmed that the GTP-bound form of Rab3D is its LD promoting form; it translocates from other vesicles to LDs during adipocyte differentiation. By contrast, the Rab3D-GDP form is retained in the cytoplasm and has no effect on LD sizes. Presented results provide evidence for the role of Rab3D in controlling formation of large LDs in adipocytes. We conclude that Rab3D is a novel LD regulator with characteristics differing from these of previously identified LD associated Rab proteins, such as Rab18 and Rab8a.","misc","wim","misc"

Overexpression of the A isoform of the STOX1 transcription factor (STOX1A) recapitulates PE in mice, and STOX1A overexpressing trophoblasts recapitulate PE patients hallmarks in terms of gene expression and pathophysiology. STOX1 overexpression induces nitroso-redox imbalance and mitochondrial hyper-activation. Here, by a thorough analysis on cell models, we show that STOX1 overexpression in trophoblasts alters inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO) content, the nitroso-redox balance, the antioxidant defense, and mitochondrial function. This is accompanied by specific alterations of the Krebs cycle leading to reduced l-malate content. By increasing NOS coupling using the metabolite tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) we restore this multi-step pathway in vitro. Moving in vivo on two different rodent models (STOX1 mice and RUPP rats, alike early onset and late onset preeclampsia, respectively), we show by transcriptomics that BH4 directly reverts STOX1-deregulated gene expression including glutathione metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, lipoprotein metabolism and platelet activation, successfully treating placental hypotrophy, gestational hypertension, proteinuria and heart hypertrophy. In the RUPP rats we show that the major fetal issue of preeclampsia, Intra Uterine Growth Restriction (IUGR), is efficiently corrected.

A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients admitted to the hospital with AD (n = 71) as the main diagnosis from April to October 2021. Meanwhile, patients with TNs with no AD (NAD-TN group, n = 20) and healthy subjects (HS group, n = 37) with matched age, sex, and education were randomly collected as controls. Patients with AD were sub-grouped into the AD with TNs (AD-TN group, n = 41) and the AD with no TNs (AD-NTN group, n = 30). The thyroid ultrasound reports, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores, and the expression of NMDARs and their subunits (NR1, NR2A, and NR2B) and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis-related hormones were analyzed in all subjects. Some patients with TNs underwent surgery and postoperative pathological examination. Patients with AD showed a lower level of free triiodothyronine (FT3) and higher levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and NMDARs and their subunits compared to the healthy controls. The expression of the NR2A subunit was higher in the AD-TN group than that in other three groups (AD-NTN, NAD-TN, and HS groups, F = 13.650, p < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the level of NMDARs was positively correlated with the HAMA scores (B = 1.622, p = 0.029) and the maximum diameter of TNs (B = 3.836, p = 0.005). Immunohistochemical results showed that the NR2A subunit was widely expressed in multinodular goiter (MNG) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tissues, while the expression of the NR2B subunit was lower in PTC adjacent and MNG tissues and almost absent in PTC tissues. In a sample of mostly women hospitalized with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or panic disorder, abnormal expression of NMDARs is closely related to AD with thyroid lesions, NMDAR subunits may have various activities and exert diverse effects in TNs, and the NR2A subunit may be an important regulator in AD with TNs.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The measure is widely used by researchers to explore the relationship between feeding style and child weight status but has not been evaluated comprehensively in a review or meta-analysis. The aims of this study were to 1) compare established median cutoffs for responsiveness and demandingness in parent feeding (k = 5; see Hughes et al., 2012) to current median splits along these two dimensions for a larger sample of articles (k = 19) and 2) evaluate the relation between children's BMI, demandingness and responsiveness, and parent feeding style categories. Results indicated that the cutoffs for responsiveness and demandingness initially established based on five studies of low-income families did not differ significantly with the addition of 19 studies. Child BMI z-scores (k = 8) were above average for all four parent feeding style categories and highest for indulgent parents, which was consistent with the literature outlining low-income children at higher risk for obesity and children of indulgent parents being particularly at risk. While heterogeneity of samples should be considered, study results suggested that the CFSQ distribution for responsiveness and demandingness was relatively generalizable across low-income samples, though heterogeneity was higher among caregiver's feeding style categories.

An assessor blind to group allocation will measure the 6-min walk distance, peripheral muscular strength, health-related quality of life, dyspnoea, anxiety and depression, fatigue, activities of daily living, upper limb and lower limb endurance at baseline, at program completion one month, and three months after the intervention. If home-based PR programs are proven to be beneficial over time, they will address a critical gap by giving a readily accessible and viable choice of rehabilitation to people with ILD, enabling more people to participate in an exercise program.","protocol","wim","protocol"

In recent years, the incidence of DHAV-3 subtype has been increasing in China, leading to great economic losses to the duck-breeding industry. We investigated the incidence and mortality rates of DHAV in ducks and analysed the seroprevalence of DHAV in mainland China, by meta-analysis. Twenty-six studies published between 2009 and 2021 were retrieved, with a total of 689,549 cases from 14 provinces. Using the DerSimonian-Laird model, DHAV prevalence was estimated with the variance-stabilizing double arcsine transformation. The incidence of DHAV in mainland China was 12 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3-20 %), and the mortality rate was 11 % (95 % CI: 2-19 %), suggesting that the virus was highly virulent and mortality was high. Time analysis showed that DHAV incidence decreased over time. The typing survey showed that strains of DHAV-1 serotype accounted for 38 % (95 % CI: 21-56 %) and strains of DHAV-3 serotype accounted for 49 % (95 % CI: 31-68%) of the tested samples. The decline in the detection rate of DHAV-1 may be due to the widespread use of the DHAV-1 vaccine, which has effectively controlled the DHAV-1 serotype virus. The DHAV-3 vaccine has been on the market for a short time and has no cross protection with DHAV-1, so DHAV-3 accounted for a high proportion of the tested samples. Subgroup analysis of the detection methods showed little difference between PCR and other detection methods.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

However, whether SES across the life course impacts smoking cessation in late-life is not known. Assess how life course SES impacts smoking cessation among older smokers. We identified 5,124 smokers, 50 years and older, from the 1998 to 2018 waves of the Health and Retirement Study. The outcome was self-reported smoking cessation. The main exposure was life course SES, defined as: low child and low adult SES (persistent low); low child, high adult SES (upward mobility); high child, low adult SES (downward mobility); and high child, high adult SES (persistent high). A multilevel mixed-effect logistic model was used to examine how life course SES predicts smoking cessation at age 65 and over time, adjusted for covariates. Compared to those with persistent high SES, those with persistent low SES, upward and downward SES were more likely to be Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black. The adjusted results showed that at age 65, compared to those with persistent high SES, those with persistent low SES (OR= 0.69, 95 % CI = [0.51-0.92]), upward SES (OR= 0.49, [0.32-0.75]), and downward SES (OR= 0.55, [0.40-0.76]) were less likely to quit. However, as age increased, only those with downward or persistent low SES were significantly less likely to quit compared to those with persistent high SES. Social mobility of SES from childhood to adulthood significantly impacts smoking cessation. Both stages of the life course should be considered to understand smoking behaviors.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

From the perspective of security and economy, the effective control of COVID-19 has a profound impact on the entire society. An effective strategy is to diagnose earlier to prevent the spread of the disease and prompt treatment of severe cases to improve the chance of survival. The method of this paper is as follows: Firstly, the collected data set is processed by chest film image processing, and the bone removal process is carried out in the rib subtraction module. Then, the set preprocessing method performed histogram equalization, sharpening, and other preprocessing operations on the chest film. Finally, shallow and high-level feature mapping through the backbone network extracts the processed chest radiographs. We implement the self-attention mechanism in Inception-Resnet, perform the standard classification, and identify chest radiograph diseases through the classifier to realize the auxiliary COVID-19 diagnosis process at the medical level, all in an effort to further enhance the classification performance of the convolutional neural network. Numerous computer simulations demonstrate that the Inception-Resnet convolutional neural network performs CT image categorization and enhancement with greater efficiency and flexibility than conventional segmentation techniques. The experimental COVID-19 CT dataset obtained in this paper is the new data for CT scans and medical imaging of normal, early COVID-19 patients and severe COVID-19 patients from Jinyintan hospital. The experiment plots the relationship between model accuracy, model loss and epoch, using ACC, TPR, SPE, F1 score and G-mean to measure the image maps of patients with and without the disease. Statistical measurement values are obtained by Inception-Resnet are 88.23%, 83.45%, 89.72%, 95.53% and 88.74%. The experimental results show that Inception-Resnet plays a more effective role than other image classification methods in evaluation indicators, and the method has higher robustness, accuracy and intuitiveness. With CT images in the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 images being widely used and the number of applied samples continuously increasing, the method in this paper is expected to become an additional diagnostic tool that can effectively improve the diagnostic accuracy of clinical COVID-19 images.","misc","wim","misc"

Thus, knowledge of predictors of dietary quality and dietary inflammatory potential in European countries may contribute to developing maternal diet-related public health policies that target specific at-risk populations in Europe. We used harmonised data from >26,000 pregnant women enrolled in the ALSPAC, EDEN, Generation R, Lifeways, REPRO_PL, ROLO and SWS cohorts, as part of the ALPHABET consortium. Maternal dietary quality and inflammatory potential were assessed using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and the energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII). We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis to investigate the maternal sociodemographic, health and behavioural predictors of maternal diet before and during pregnancy. DASH and E-DII scores were moderately correlated: from -0.63 (95% CI: -0.66, -0.59) to -0.48 (95% CI: -0.49, -0.47) across cohorts. Higher maternal age, education, household income, and physical activity during pregnancy were associated with a better dietary quality and a more anti-inflammatory diet. Conversely, multiparity and smoking during pregnancy were associated with a poorer dietary quality and a more proinflammatory diet. Women with obesity had a poorer pregnancy dietary quality than women with a normal body mass index range. The results will help identify population subgroups who may benefit from targeted public health strategies and interventions aimed at improving women's dietary quality during pregnancy.","misc","wim","meta_analysis"

Refeeding syndrome is a severe complication of refeeding in people with malnutrition, it includes a series of electrolyte disorders and clinical symptoms. Further research is warranted to determine whether refeeding syndrome prolongs the length of stay, and to verify the effect of different energy intakes during refeeding on the length of stay in people with malnutrition. Our review aimed to explore the effects of refeeding syndrome and initial calorie intake on the length of stay in patients with malnutrition. This study aids the understanding of clinical nutrition strategies to prevent and treat refeeding syndrome. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge, and two Chinese databases were systematically searched until October 2021. Controlled studies of patients' refeeding process with the outcome of length of stay were included. Effect sizes were expressed as 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and calculated using random-effects models. Eighteen studies involving 3868 participants were included in our review. The pooled length of stay of 2965 patients with refeeding syndrome in 11 studies was 25.55 (95% CI, 20.20-30.90) days. The pooled impact of refeeding syndrome on length of stay of 2634 patients in 10 studies was weighted mean difference (WMD) = 2.91 (95% CI, -0.18 - 6.00; P = 0.065) days. The pooled effect of higher calorie intake of 1234 patients in 8 studies was WMD = -3.04 (95% CI, -5.10 to -0.99, P = 0.003) days. The average length of stay in patients with refeeding syndrome was 25.55 days with a very high heterogeneity between studies. Refeeding syndrome affects the length of stay in part of, but not all, patients. In the present review, we concluded that higher initial calorie intake may help shorten the length of stay in patients with malnutrition. More well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to explore the effect of calorie intake during refeeding.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

A previously adapted version of the questionnaire was administered. The results were weighted to ensure representativeness of this community population using weighted coefficients. The results showed that most of the participants purchased food on campus (91.6%), especially for lunch (67.4% of foods and 37.4% of drinks) and snack (65.4% of foods and 45.4% of drinks). Hot drinks (i.e., coffee, tea, hot chocolate etc.; 60.5%), bottled water (49.2%), and hot foods (i.e., small servings [38.2%] and sandwiches/hamburgers [31.7%]) were the most purchased items.

The relations between structure, dynamics and hydrogen bonds of interfacial water can be investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Contact angles at the alumina (0001) and (112‾0) surfaces are studied using both classical molecular dynamics simulations and experiments. To test the superhydrophilicity, the free energy cost of removing waters near the interfaces are calculated using the density fluctuations method. The strength of hydrogen bonds is determined by their lifetime and geometry. Both surfaces are superhydrophilic and the (0001) surface is more hydrophilic. Interactions between surfaces and interfacial waters promote a templating effect whereby the latter are aligned in a pattern that follows the underlying lattice of the surfaces. Translational and rotational dynamics of interfacial water molecules are slower than in bulk water. Hydrogen bonds between water and both surfaces are asymmetric, water-to-aluminol ones are stronger than aluminol-to-water ones. Molecular dynamics simulations eliminate the impacts of surface contamination when measuring contact angles and the results reveal the microscopic origin of the macroscopic superhydrophilicity of alumina surfaces: strong water-to-aluminol hydrogen bonds.","misc","wim","misc"
"730",35964453,"Adaptation of stimulation duration to enhance auditory response in fNIRS block design.","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular method in hearing research. However, few studies have considered efficient stimulation parameters for the auditory experimental design of fNIRS. The objectives of our study are (1) to identify the most effective paradigm for the stimulation blocks with increasing duration (8s, 10s, 15s, 20s) in terms of response amplitude, i.e., the most-efficient stimulation duration; (2) to assess the linearity/nonlinearity of the hemodynamic responses with respect to increasing block durations; and (3) to generalize results to more ecological environmental stimuli. We found that cortical activity is augmented following the increments in stimulation durations and reaches a plateau after about 15s of stimulation. The linearity analysis showed that this augmentation due to stimulation duration is not linear in the auditory cortex, non-linearity being more pronounced for shorter durations (15s and 20s). The 15s block duration that we propose as the most suitable precludes signal saturation and is associated with a high response amplitude and a relatively short total experimental duration. Moreover, the distribution of stimuli among the 15s blocks, which is the most effective for white noise stimulation, also provides a comparably strong response for environmental sounds. The sum of these findings suggests that 15s stimulation duration used in the appropriate experimental setup allows researchers to acquire optimal fNIRS signal quality.","misc","wim","misc"

There are two pharmacological treatments for BPH. However, these synthetic materials have various risks, many studies are being conducted to develop new drugs from natural sources. In this study, we proposed a beneficial effect of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fischer on the development and progression of BPH, focusing on the androgen receptor (AR) and 5α-reductase 2 (5AR2) signaling axis. To explain the therapeutic efficacy of a water extract of G. uralensis (GUWE) for BPH, we used testosterone propionate (TP)-induced BPH rat models and TP-treated RWPE-1 human prostate epithelial cells. In the TP-induced BPH rat models, GUWE reduced the enlarged prostate weight, prostate index, prostate epithelial thickness, and serum DHT levels. In addition, the protein levels of AR and 5AR2 in prostate tissues were significantly decreased by GUWE treatment. Furthermore, GUWE induced apoptosis signaling through an increase of Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), caspase 3, and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and a decrease of B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) in prostate tissues of TP-induced BPH rats. These findings were also confirmed in TP-treated RWPE-1 cells. Fi treatment markedly decreased the sperm count in the epididymis of BPH rats, but GUWE treatment did not affect the sperm count, suggesting less toxicity. These findings suggested that GUWE reduces the development of BPH by inhibiting AR-5AR2 and activating the apoptosis signaling pathway. Furthermore, unlike finasteride, GUWE did not affect sperm count. Therefore, we suggest that GUWE has a potential as a safer alternative option for BPH treatment.","misc","wim","rodent"
"732",35964457,"A discovery of clinically approved Panlongqi Tablet for repositioning to treat osteoarthritis by inhibiting PI3K/AKT activation.","Panlongqi Tablet (PLQT) is a Chinese patent drug composed of 29 kinds of traditional Chinese medicines. Clinical practice has shown that PLQT can relieve osteoarthritis-caused joint pain, but its effects and mechanisms in other pathological links of osteoarthritis have not been characterized. The purpose of this study is to reposition the pharmacodynamic effects of PLQT through network pharmacology analysis combined with experimental validation, and also to preliminarily explore its possible mechanism. On the basis of integrating the relevant targets of PLQT in multiple drug databases and osteoarthritis-related targets in the disease database, an interaction network of related genes was constructed. The hub candidate targets of PLQT in the treatment of osteoarthritis were determined by calculating the main network topological characteristics, The specific functions and pathways of these targets acting on osteoarthritis were modularly analyzed. In addition, the modified Hulth-induced rat model of osteoarthritis and IL-1β-induced in vitro model of osteoarthritis were established to further validate the potential efficacy and possible mechanism of PLQT. A total of 138 key targets related to osteoarthritis were selected based on topological parameters, and their biological functions were mainly enriched in four over-expressed modules of cartilage degeneration, inflammatory response, immune response, and subchondral bone metabolism. The hub candidate targets had the highest enrichment degree in the TLR4-RAC1-PIK3CA-Akt-NFκB signaling axis of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In vivo results showed that PLQT treatment significantly inhibited the degeneration of proteoglycan and collagen in the cartilage of osteoarthritis rats, suppressed chondrocyte apoptosis, and reduced the Mankin score of joints. Moreover, PLQT alleviated synovial inflammation, reduced the Krenn score of synovium, inhibited the formation of osteophytes in osteoarthritis rats, reduced the bone mineral density (BMD), fractional bone volume (BV/TV), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.), as well as increased the trabecular separation (Tb.Sp.) of subchondral bone and the thickness of the subchondral bone plate (SBP.Th.). PLQT suppressed the expressions of TLR4, RAC1, PIK3CA, p-Akt, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5 in the cartilage, and inhibited the expression of NFκB p65 in the chondrogenic nucleus. Meanwhile, as downstream effector factors of the predictive pathways, the levels of serum interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were decreased after PLQT treatment. In vitro results also showed that PLQT could inhibit the expression of key proteins and downstream effector factors of the signaling axis, and this inhibition disappeared when pathway agonists were added. PLQT exerted pharmacological effects on the key pathological links of osteoarthritis including chondrocyte apoptosis, extracellular matrix degradation, inflammation, and subchondral bone metabolism by inhibiting the TLR4-RAC1-PIK3CA-Akt-NFκB axis-related proteins.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Memories that integrate negative interpretations (interpretation-memory) may also contribute to worry, but this remains unexplored. We aimed to investigate how these cognitive processes are associated with worry and anxiety cross-sectionally (Phase 1), and then explore which cognitive processes from Phase 1 would predict worry and anxiety during times of high stress, namely prior to examinations (Phase 2), and after the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (Phase 3). Worry, anxiety, and cognitive processes were assessed in an undergraduate sample (N = 64). We found that whilst greater benign interpretation bias and benign interpretation-memory bias were associated with lower levels of concurrent worry and anxiety, only interpretation bias explained unique variance in worry and anxiety. No cognitive predictor significantly explained unique variance in prospective worry and anxiety prior to examinations. In relation to anxiety and worry during the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, both benign attention bias and benign interpretation-memory bias predicted decreased worry; only benign attention bias predicted decreased anxiety. Findings suggest that cognitive processes can predict changes in worry and anxiety during future stressful contexts.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

For the analysis of the chemical-composition distribution (CCD) gradient liquid chromatography may be used. The CCD obtained using this method is often convoluted with an underlying molecular-weight distribution (MWD). In this paper we demonstrate that the influence of the MWD can be reduced using very steep gradients and that such gradients are best realized utilizing recycling gradient liquid chromatography (LC↻LC). This method allows for a more-accurate determination of the CCD and the assessment of (approximate) critical conditions (if these exist), even when high-molecular-weight standards of narrow dispersity are not readily available. The performance and usefulness of the approach is demonstrated for several polystyrene standards, and for the separation of statistical copolymers consisting of styrene/methyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate/butyl methacrylate. For the latter case, approximate critical compositions of the copolymers were calculated from the critical compositions of two homopolymers and one copolymer of known chemical composition, allowing for a determination of the CCD of unknown samples. Using this approach it is shown that the copolymers elute significantly closer to the predicted critical compositions after recycling of the gradient. This is most clear for the lowest-molecular-weight copolymer (Mw = 4.2 kDa), for which the difference between measured and predicted elution composition decreases from 7.9% without recycling to 1.4% after recycling.","misc","wim","misc"

The rising demand of AAT poses a defined need for new processes of AAT manufacturing from recombinant sources. Commercial affinity adsorbents for AAT purification present the intrinsic limitations of protein ligands - chiefly, the high cost and the lability towards the proteases in the feedstocks and the cleaning-in-place utilized in biomanufacturing - which limit their application despite their high capacity and selectivity. This work presents the development of small peptide affinity ligands for the purification of AAT from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture harvests. An ensemble of ligand candidates identified via library screening were conjugated on Toyopearl resin and evaluated via experimental and in silico AAT-binding studies. Initial ranking based on equilibrium binding capacity indicated WHAKKSKFG- (12.9 mg of AAT per mL of resin), WHAKKSHFG- (16.3 mg/mL), and KWKHSHKWG- (15.8 mg/mL) Toyopearl resins as top performing adsorbents. Notably, the fitting of adsorption data to Langmuir isotherms concurred with molecular docking and dynamics in returning values of dissociation constant (KD) between 1 - 10 µM. These peptide-based adsorbents were thus selected for AAT purification from CHO fluids, affording values of AAT binding capacity up to 13 gram per liter of resin, and product yield and purity up to 77% and 97%. WHAKKSHFG-Toyopearl resin maintained its purification activity upon 20 consecutive uses, demonstrating its potential for AAT manufacturing from recombinant sources.","misc","wim","misc"

We recently reported a transcription-independent function of RXRα in cancer cells in which RXRα is phosphorylated by Cdk1 at the onset of mitosis, resulting in its translocation to the centrosome, where the phosphorylated RXRα (p-RXRα) interacts with polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) to promote centrosome maturation and mitotic progression. Significantly, we also identified that a small molecule XS-060 binds to RXRα and selectively inhibits the p-RXRα/PLK1 interaction to induce mitotic arrest and catastrophe in cancer cells. Here, we report our design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of XS-060 analogs as RXRα-targeted anti-mitotic agents. Our results identified B10 as an improved anti-mitotic agent. B10 bound to RXRα (Kd = 3.04 ± 0.58 μM) and inhibited the growth of cervical cancer cells (HeLa, IC50 = 1.46 ± 0.10 μM) and hepatoma cells (HepG2, IC50 = 3.89 ± 0.45 μM and SK-hep-1, IC50 = 5.74 ± 0.50 μM) with low cytotoxicity to nonmalignant cells(LO2, IC50 > 50 μM).

The method uses thermal desorption from a PM on a filter sample as means of sample introduction to a column and obviates the need for complex extraction procedures, which are time-consuming and require environmentally unfriendly solvents. Moreover, the possibility of systematic errors is minimized and a significantly smaller amount of sample is required compared to traditional techniques requiring a pre-extraction step (approx. 10-times). Thirteen PAHs and three nitro-PAHs were used during method development. Although Tenax cartridges are typically used to capture volatile pollutants from the air, we found that glass-wool liner is the most suitable trap for the examined analytes after desorption from a quartz filter. Among the various instrument parameters which were tested and optimized, TD desorption flow and hold time, and temperature of the cooled injection system (CIS) proved to be most critical. We also found out that the matrix effect is especially pronounced in the case of high PM loadings, which should be kept in mind when planning the analysis. After the optimization, standard reference materials (ERM-CZ100 and NIST 1648a) were used for partial method validation and finally, real PM10 and PM2.5 samples from two Slovenian cities were successfully analyzed.","misc","wim","misc"

We proved that protein fibrillization would highly improve both emulsifying and antioxidant abilities of protein dispersion. In addition, further processed RGFs with rich β-sheet structures exhibited a similar functional performance to GFs dispersion. By contrast, FGFs dispersion with less β- sheet content, lower molecular weight, interestingly re-assembled into spherical aggregates with weaker interaction, exhibiting better antioxidant and emulsifying properties.","misc","wim","misc"

We used mixed models and generalized estimating equation analyses to explore differences in changes in mood, withdrawal and aggressive behavior, loneliness and conflict, and cognition and delirium. We also explored whether the effect of the lockdown differed for different subgroups. In 2 online focus groups, LTCF care professionals, ranging from care staff to physicians, reflected on their experiences of the effect of the lockdown and the cohort study results. The lockdown group of 298 residents was compared to the control group of 625 residents. Self-reported mood symptoms showed a slightly greater increase during the lockdown. During the first half of the lockdown, the level of conflict with other residents decreased whereas it increased in the control group. The subgroup with moderate-severe cognitive impairment showed a decrease in withdrawal during the lockdown, whereas the group with no-mild cognitive impairment showed a statistically nonsignificant relative increase. Professionals described great individual variation in the effects of the lockdown on residents. Facilities attempted to preserve the experienced positive effects, for example, by promoting tranquility in shared rooms and continuing to organize individualized ward-based activities.

It is treated with palliative therapies, consisting of repeated drainages and sometimes instillation of chemotherapy. Since the nineties, surgery has been combined with more effective systemic chemotherapy, intraperitoneal chemotherapy and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for the treatment of PC. This combination therapy significantly increases the overall survival of selected PC patients. The understanding of how intraperitoneal chemotherapy and HIPEC can cure patients is still unclear. Experts hypothesized that the efficacy is obtained by the ability of high peritoneal drug exposure and hyperthermia to directly kill cancer cells. Several studies indicate that cancer cells death directly influences the response of the immune system. For this reason, the protective effect of intraperitoneal chemotherapy and HIPEC could be mediated by its ability to kill cancer cells in an immuno-genic way, causing an efficient anticancer immune response. In this review, we investigate the role of the innate peritoneal or locoregional therapy-induced immune response in PC therapy.","misc","wim","misc"

Small, short-term cohort studies of similar systems have been published, but to detect low rates of complications requires a large study sample and longer-term follow-up. This study details the outcomes of all patients with injuries suitable for a direct discharge protocol over a four-year period, reviewed at a minimum of three years after attendance. All TTC records between February 2014 and December 2017 were collated from a prospective database. Fractures of the radial head, little finger metacarpal, fifth metatarsal, toe phalanges and mallet finger injuries were included. TTC outcome, including any deviations from a well-established direct discharge protocol, were noted. All records were re-assessed at a minimum of 36 months after TTC triage (mean 54 months) to ascertain which injuries attended the trauma clinic after initial discharge. Reasons for attendance, the source of referral and any subsequent surgical procedures were identified. There were 6688 patients with fractures of the radial head (1861), little finger metacarpal (1621), fifth metatarsal (1916), toe phalanges (920) and mallet finger injuries (370). 298 (6%) patients were re-referred after direct discharge and attended trauma clinic at a mean time after injury of 11.9 weeks, of whom 11 (0.2%) underwent a surgical intervention. Serious adverse events, defined as those in which a patient may not have come to harm if early clinical review had been undertaken, occurred in 1 patient (0.01%). Intervention after direct discharge of simple pre-defined injuries of the elbow, hand and foot is low. Within a TTC system, patients with these injuries can be safely discharged without routine follow-up.","misc","wim","protocol"

Patients with lung adenocarcinoma who underwent resection between December 2007 and December 2012 were reviewed. Patients with pathological adenocarcinoma in situ or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma were enrolled. Postoperative survival and risk of developing second primary lung cancer were analyzed. After reevaluating the histological findings of 1696 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, we enrolled 53 with adenocarcinoma in situ and 72 with minimally invasive adenocarcinoma for analyses. Of all 125 patients with adenocarcinoma in situ/minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, 86 (68.8%) were female, 114 (91.2%) were nonsmokers, and most of them (78, 62.4%) underwent wedge resection. The median follow-up period after surgery was 111 months. The 10-year recurrence-free survivals of adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma were all 100%, and the 10-year overall survivals of adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma were 98.1% and 97.2%, respectively. There was no difference in 10-year recurrence-free survival between patients who underwent lobectomy and wedge resection. EGFR mutations were detected in 63.1% (41/65) of patients who underwent mutational analysis. The risks of developing second primary lung cancer for adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma 10 years after resection were 8.4% and 4.3% (P = .298), respectively, and were not correlated with EGFR mutation status (P = .525). Pathological adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma have no recurrence during 10-year follow-up after resection, regardless of surgical procedure types. Surgery is curative for these patients, and wedge resection is the preferred surgical procedure for nodules in the proper location.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Fabrication of the composite structure of Aloe vera and biopolymeric hydrogels has been demonstrated to promote the wound-healing process through protection against a wide spectrum of microbes, and enhanced cell adhesion and differentiation. Therefore, the present study investigates to development of improved CHO/Aloe hydrogel for improving the wound-healing process in an animal model. CHO hydrogel with Aloe was prepared, and its properties were evaluated in terms of viscosity, antibacterial activity, and ints In-vivo wound-healing efficiency in full-thickness wounds of rat models. Physical examination of wound-healing efficiency of CHO/Aleo hydrogel was evaluated by analyzing total wound closure, recovery percentage, and the epiderm thickness of wounds. Histological evaluation was performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining to evaluate the re-epithelialization, inflammatory response, granulation tissue formation, and fibrotic tissue formation. The results showed a significantly higher wound-healing rate of the CHO/Aleo group compared to other groups at 3,7,14 days (p < 0.05). After 14 days of treatment, the best healing effect was observed in the CHO/Aleo gel with the highest tissue tension compared with other groups (p < 0.05). Histological findings indicated a significant difference in inflammatory response between control and treatment groups after three days of treatment (p < 0.05). Epidermal thickness was also significantly thicker in the CHO/Aleo gel group than others (p < 0.05).

"746",35965225,"Urodynamic evaluation of the efficacy of vibegron, a new β3-adrenergic receptor agonist, on lower urinary tract function in children and adolescents with overactive bladder.","Idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as an urgency symptom with or without urge incontinence, which is not due to known neurological abnormalities. Since children present with variable symptoms, pediatric nonneurogenic idiopathic OAB is a condition that is difficult to diagnose and treat. Although there are few reports on bladder function in pediatric patients compared to adult patients, it can be useful for diagnosis. Antimuscarinic therapy is the pharmacological mainstay of OAB management. However, antimuscarinic use is limited by side effects and Insufficient effects. Vibegron, a new drug with a different mechanism of action (β3-adrenoreceptor agonist), was recently introduced for treating OAB in adults but has not been studied in the pediatric population. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and tolerability of vibegron in children and adolescents with idiopathic OAB. We conducted a retrospective study enrolling pediatric patients with OAB whose symptoms did not improve with behavioral therapy or pharmaceutical therapy. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed via a question, and patients underwent video-urodynamic testing before and during treatment with once-daily 50 mg vibegron. Statistical differences were evaluated using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. Out of the 17 patients that were recruited, full study with two urodynamic studies were confirmed by 11 patients. OAB symptoms improved in 14 (82.4%) patients, and 3 patients discontinued treatment because of ineffectiveness. No patients discontinued treatment because of intolerance to vibegron. The median (IQR) first desire to void (133 [82-185]-161 [123-227] mL), bladder capacity (158 [136-238]-204 [150-257] mL), and bladder compliance (18.1 [9.1-76.7]-34.0 [30.0-82.3] mL/cm H2O) improved significantly post treatment compared to before treatment. Detrusor overactivity disappeared in one of the eight patients with this condition. The parameters of voiding function did not change significantly after the administration of vibegron. Treatment with vibegron significantly improved clinical and urodynamic parameters of pediatric OAB with no adverse effects. Little information is available regarding the feasibility of switching drugs when patients discontinue prior pharmacological therapy because of insufficient efficacy or poor tolerability in children. Vibegron may be a promising OAB treatment option with a better balance of efficacy and tolerability. Vibegron is an alternative agent for pediatric patients with idiopathic OAB for improving both subjective symptoms and lower urinary tract function. Future prospective randomized studies with larger sample sizes must be conducted to validate the results of the present study.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

To quantify population access to community pharmacies across the United States. We obtained addresses for pharmacy locations in the United States from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs and geocoded each. For a 1% sample of a U.S. synthetic population, we calculated the driving distance to the closest pharmacy using ArcGIS. We estimated the proportion of population living within 1, 2, 5, and 10 miles of a community pharmacy. We quantified the role of chain vs regional franchises or independently owned pharmacies in providing access across degrees of urbanicity. We identified 61,715 pharmacies, including 37,954 (61.5%) chains, 23,521 (38.1%) regional franchises or independently owned pharmacies, and 240 (0.4%) government pharmacies. In large metropolitan areas, 62.8% of the pharmacies were chains; however, in rural areas, 76.5% of pharmacies were franchises or independent pharmacies. Across the overall U.S. population, 48.1% lived within 1 mile of any pharmacy, 73.1% within 2 miles, 88.9% within 5 miles, and 96.5% within 10 miles. Across the United States, 8.3% of counties had at least 50% of residents with a distance greater than 10 miles. These low-access counties were concentrated in Alaska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana. Community pharmacies may serve as accessible locations for patient-centered, medication management services that enhance the health and wellness of communities. Although chain pharmacies represent the majority of pharmacy locations across the country, access to community pharmacies in rural areas predominantly relies on regional franchises and independently owned pharmacies.","misc","wim","misc"

This large-scale observational study comprised a cross-sectional population sample and a prospective cohort of 44,294 healthy subjects. This study examined the association between LAP and the risk of hyperuricaemia in the total sample and subgroups using multiple logistic regression analysis and multivariate cox proportional hazards model analysis. As a result, there was a dose-response relationship between LAP and the risk of hyperuricaemia. The prevalence of hyperuricaemia was 13.4% in the cross-sectional study. During 9 years of follow-up, hyperuricaemia occurred in 928 (19.8%) participants. The corresponding hazard ratios after multiple adjustments of hyperuricaemia in the second, third and fourth quartile were 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.72), 2.01 (95% CI, 1.54-2.63), and 2.44 (95% CI, 1.80-3.30)-fold higher vs. the first quartile, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the association between LAP and the risk of hyperuricaemia was more pronounced in females, individuals≤49 years old and subjects with eGFR ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2. LAP was positively related to the risk of hyperuricaemia in the Central Chinese population, particularly in women, individuals≤49 years old and adults with relatively normal renal function.

"749",35965497,"Identification of molecular subtypes, risk signature, and immune landscape mediated by necroptosis-related genes in non-small cell lung cancer.","Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with an extremely high mortality rate. Necroptosis is a programmed cell death mode mediated by three major mediators, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, and has been shown to play a role in various cancers. To date, the effect of necroptosis on NSCLC remains unclear. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, we downloaded transcriptomes of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and their corresponding clinicopathological parameters. We performed multi-omics analysis using consensus clustering based on the expression levels of 40 necroptosis-related genes. We constructed prognostic risk models and used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, nomograms, and survival analysis to evaluate prognostic models. With the use of consensus clustering analysis, two distinct subtypes of necroptosis were identified based on different mRNA expression levels, and cluster B was found to have a better survival advantage. Correlation results showed that necroptosis was significantly linked with clinical features, overall survival (OS) rate, and immune infiltration. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis confirmed that these differential genes were valuable in various cellular and biological functions and were significantly enriched in various pathways such as the P53 signaling pathway and cell cycle. We further identified three genomic subtypes and found that gene cluster B patients had better prognostic value. Multivariate Cox analysis identified the 14 best prognostic genes for constructing prognostic risk models. The high-risk group was found to have a poor prognosis. The construction of nomograms and ROC curves showed stable validity in prognostic prediction. There were also significant differences in tumor immune microenvironment, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and drug sensitivity between the two risk groups. The results demonstrate that the 14 genes constructed in this prognostic risk model were used as tumor prognostic biomarkers to guide immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Finally, we used qRT-PCR to validate the genes involved in the signature. This study promotes our new understanding of necroptosis in the tumor microenvironment of NSCLC, mines prognostic biomarkers, and provides a potential value for guiding immunotherapy and chemotherapy.","misc","wim","misc"

The expression level of PDSS1 was analyzed using the TCGA and GEO databases. The relationships between PDSS1 and patient clinicopathological characteristics were verified based on TCGA clinical data. Additionally, the co-expressed genes of PDSS1were investigated and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was conducted using LinkedOmics. Next, the association between PDSS1 and immune infiltration was determined using version 1.34.0 of the GSVA package. EdU assay, colony-formation assay, transwell assay, wound-healing assay, and flow cytometry analysis were used to assess the effect of PDSS1 on the cell phenotype. PDSS1 was upregulated in HCC compared with adjacent tissues. High PDSS1 in HCC was associated with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progress-free interval. Results suggested that PDSS1 may activate multiple oncogenic pathways in HCC, especially those involved in the cell cycle. The expression of PDSS1 was significantly related to Th2 cells, TFH, T helper cells, NK CD56bright cells, cytotoxic cells, DC, CD8 T cells, and neutrophils. PDSS1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasion. Furthermore, PDSS1 acted as an oncogene through the STAT3 signaling pathway. Our study reveals that a high level of PDSS1 is significantly correlated with poor patient prognosis and immune cell infiltration in HCC. PDSS1 may be a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for HCC.","misc","wim","misc"
"751",35965501,"Ubiquitin ligase RNF125 targets PD-L1 for ubiquitination and degradation.","As a critical immune checkpoint molecule, PD-L1 is expressed at significantly higher levels in multiple neoplastic tissues compared to normal ones. PD-L1/PD-1 axis is a critical target for tumor immunotherapy, blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 axis is recognized and has achieved unprecedented success in clinical applications. However, the clinical efficacy of therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway remains limited, emphasizing the need for the mechanistic elucidation of PD-1/PD-L1 expression. In this study, we found that RNF125 interacted with PD-L1 and regulated PD-L1 protein expression. Mechanistically, RNF125 promoted K48-linked polyubiquitination of PD-L1 and mediated its degradation. Notably, MC-38 and H22 cell lines with RNF125 knockout, transplanted in C57BL/6 mice, exhibited a higher PD-L1 level and faster tumor growth than their parental cell lines. In contrast, overexpression of RNF125 in MC-38 and H22 cells had the opposite effect, resulting in lower PD-L1 levels and delayed tumor growth compared with parental cell lines. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of MC-38 tumors with RNF125 overexpression showed significantly increased infiltration of CD4+, CD8+ T cells and macrophages. Consistent with these findings, analyses using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) public database revealed a positive correlation of RNF125 expression with CD4+, CD8+ T cell and macrophage tumor infiltration. Moreover, RNF125 expression was significantly downregulated in several human cancer tissues, and was negatively correlated with the clinical stage of these tumors, and patients with higher RNF125 expression had better clinical outcomes. Our findings identify a novel mechanism for regulating PD-L1 expression and may provide a new strategy to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy.","misc","wim","rodent"

The dosimetric parameters of the intensity-modulated proton plans were evaluated and compared with the corresponding TMI plans generated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) using photon beams. Intensity-modulated proton plans for TMI were created using the Monte Carlo dose-calculation algorithm in the Raystation 11A treatment planning system with spot-scanning proton beams from the MEVION S250i Hyperscan system. Treatment plans were generated with four isocenters placed along the longitudinal direction, each with a set of five beams for a total of 20 beams. VMAT-TMI plans were generated with the Eclipse-V15 analytical anisotropic algorithm (AAA) using a Varian Trilogy machine. Three planning target volumes (PTVs) for the bones, ribs, and spleen were covered by 12 Gy. The dose conformity index, D80, D50, and D10, for PTVs and organs at risk (OARs) for the IMPT plans were quantified and compared with the corresponding VMAT plans. The mean dose for most of the OARs was reduced substantially (5% and more) in the IMPT plans for TMI in comparison with VMAT plans except for the esophagus and thyroid, which experienced an increase in dose. This dose reduction is due to the fast dose falloff of the distal Bragg peak in the proton plans. The conformity index was found to be similar (0.78 vs 0.75) for the photon and proton plans. IMPT plans provided superior superficial dose coverage for the skull and ribs in comparison with VMAT because of increased entrance dose deposition by the proton beams. Treatment plans for TMI generated with IMPT were superior to VMAT plans mainly due to a large reduction in the OAR dose. Although the current IMPT-TMI technique is not clinically practical due to the long overall treatment time, this study presents an enticing alternative to conventional TMI with photons by providing superior dose coverage of the targets, increased sparing of the OARs, and enhanced radiobiological effects associated with proton therapy.","misc","wim","misc"

Quantitative radiomic features from the intratumoral and peritumoral regions were extracted for model training. The performance of the model was evaluated using data (n = 50) from the third clinical center. When combining the intratumoral and peritumoral features, the Adaboost model achieved the best area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 and accuracy of 76.9% in the test cohort. Based on the optimal features and classifier, the model in the binary classification diagnosis achieves AUC of 0.98 (glioblastoma and lymphoma), 0.86 (lymphoma and metastases), and 0.70 (glioblastoma and metastases) in the test cohort, respectively. In conclusion, quantitative features from non-enhanced peritumoral regions (especially features from the 10-mm margin around the tumor) can provide additional information for the characterization of regional tumoral heterogeneity, which may offer potential value for future individualized assessment of patients with CNS tumors.","misc","wim","misc"

We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the relationship between baseline SUA level and PFS, DCR, and incidence of serious adverse events of 736 postoperative CRC patients treated with FOLFOX, FOLFIRI or XELOX at our center. Data from our center suggested that high baseline SUA level is linked to poor PFS in non-metastatic CRC patients using FOLFOX (HR=2.59, 95%CI: 1.29-11.31, p=0.018) and in male patients using FOLFIRI (HR=3.77, 95%CI: 1.57-39.49, p=0.012). In patients treated by FOLFIRI, a high SUA is also linked to a low DCR (p=0.035). In patients using FOLFOX, high baseline SUA level is also linked to a high incidence of neutropenia (p=0.0037). For patients using XELOX, there is no significant correlation between SUA level and PFS, effectiveness, or safety.

Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect DYNLT3 protein expression in cervical cancer tissues. Cell proliferation and apoptosis rates and invasiveness and migratory capacities were determined by CCK-8 assays, BrdU staining assays and colony formation assays, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), wound healing assays, and Transwell invasion assays of cervical cancer cells after DYNLT3 modulation. The expression levels of Wnt signaling pathway- and EMT-related proteins were examined by Western blotting. Furthermore, the effects of DYNLT3 on the tumorigenicity and metastasis of cervical cancer in nude mice were analyzed by performing immunohistochemistry, and we found that the expression level of the DYNLT3 protein was higher in human normal cervical tissues than in cervical cancer tissues. Overexpression of DYNLT3 obviously attenuated the proliferation, migration and invasion of CaSki and SiHa cells, and promoted cell apoptosis. Upregulation of DYNLT3 expression markedly decreased the expression of Wnt signaling pathway-related proteins (Dvl2, Dvl3, p-LRP6, Wnt3a, Wnt5a/b, Naked1, Naked2, β-catenin and C-Myc) and EMT-related proteins (N-cadherin, SOX2, OCT4, vimentin and Snail), and increased the expression of E-cadherin and Axin1. However, the opposite results were observed after down-regulation of DYNLT3 expression. Up-regulation of DYNLT3 expression significantly inhibited tumor growth in a nude mouse model, while downregulation of DYNLT3 showed the opposite results. In addition, the major metastatic site of cervical cancer cells in mice was the lung, and downregulation of DYNLT3 expression increased cancer metastasis in vivo. DYNLT3 exerted inhibitory effects on cervical cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration and invasion, promoting cell apoptosis in vitro, and inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, possibly by suppressing the Wnt signaling pathway and the EMT.","rodent","wim","rodent"

The incidence, death rate, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), the age-standardized rates (ASR) of FBC in 204 countries, and a variety of classifications, were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease Study. Data on tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and drug use were collected. The incidence, mortality, and burden of FBC were registered and compared between regions. Associations between age-standardized incidence rates and age-standardized mortality rates of FBC with smoking, drinking, and drug use were determined. The highest incidence of FBC was observed in countries with a high socioeconomic status such as those of the European continent. Despite the lower incidence of FBC in countries with a low socio-demographic index (SDI), mortality rates secondary to FBC are higher in these countries than in high-income countries. The highest age-standardized mortality rate has been reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO), followed by the African Region (AFRO). The highest age-standardized rates of DALY and YLL per 100,000 population in 2019 were observed in lower-income countries, while the highest ASR of YLD per 100,000 population was reported in high-income countries. The present GBD-based study provides a comprehensive review of the incidence, mortality, and burden of FBC in 2019. The incidence of FBC is higher in regions with a higher socioeconomic status, whereas mortality rates and DALYs are higher in poorly developed regions. We suggest better screening measures and early detection programs for the latter regions.","misc","wim","misc"

Subsequently, the DAVID database analyzed gene ontology (GO). Meanwhile, the protein-protein interaction network was constructed by STRING; By online analysis of DEGs, prognostic genes, and CCDB data that are associated with cervical cancer formation through the OncoLnc database, we aim to search for the key DEGs associated with CC, Finally, the key gene(s) was further validated by immunohistochemistry. 298 differentially expressed genes, 712 genes associated with prognosis, and 509 genes related to cervical cancer formation were found. The results of gene function analysis showed that DEGs were mainly significant in functional pathways such as variable shear and energy metabolism. By further verification, two genes, ASPH and NKAPP1 were identified through validation as genes that affect both sensitivities to radiotherapy and survival finally. Then, immunohistochemical results showed that the ASPH gene was highly expressed in the radiotherapy-resistant group and had lower Overall survival (OS) and Progression-free survival (PFS).

GC patients can be separated into two subtypes based on the expression of 18 methylation core molecules. Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed that patients with different subtypes had a different OS, PFS, stage, grade, and TMB. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that immune-related pathways were enriched among subtype A. The ESTIMATE analysis suggested that the extent of infiltration of immune cells was different in two subtypes of GC patients. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) and The Cancer Immunome Atlas (TCIA) database also showed that there were significant differences in the efficacy of immunotherapy among different types of GC patients. Altogether, our results reveal that METTL3-mediated m6A methylation modification is associated with the immune microenvironment and the effects of immunotherapy in GC patients. Our findings provide novel insights for clinicians in the diagnosis and optimal treatment of GC patients.","misc","wim","misc"

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate preliminary outcomes of MWA + ITC for large NSCLC. From November 2015 to April 2020, a total of 44 NSCLC patients with a mean lesion diameter of 6.1 ± 1.5 cm were enrolled and underwent synchronous MWA + ITC procedures. The primary endpoint was local progression-free survival (LPFS); secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), complications, overall survival (OS), and associated prognostic factors. The median follow-up time was 19.0 months. At the 1-month CT scan, complete tumor ablation was observed in 47.7% of cases. Median LPFS was 12.1 months; 1-, 2-, and 3-year LPFS rates were 51.2%, 27.9%, and 13.6%, respectively. A shorter LPFS was significantly associated with large lesions (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.02-1.49; p = 0.032). Median PFS was 8.1 months; 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS rates were 29.5%, 18.2%, and 9.1%, respectively. LPFS was significantly superior to PFS (p = 0.046). Median OS was 18.8 months. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 65.9%, 43.2%, 26.4%, and 10.0%, respectively. In univariate comparisons, high performance status (PS) score, smoking, and larger lesions were significantly correlated with poor survival. In multivariate analysis, advanced age, higher PS score, higher stage, larger lesion, and prior systematic treatment were independent prognostic factors for shorter OS. Adverse events were well tolerated and all patients recovered after appropriate intervention. MWA + ITC is a safe and effective new modality of local treatment for large NSCLC and can significantly prolong LPFS.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

However, approximately 10% of patients with GIST are resistant to current targeted drug therapy. There is a need to explore other potential targets. Although p53 alterations frequently occur in most cancers, studies regarding p53 in GIST have been limited. The CDKN2A/MDM2/p53 axis regulates cell cycle progression and DNA damage responses, which in turn control tumor growth. This axis is the major event required for transformation from low- to high-risk GIST. Generally, p53 mutation is infrequent in GIST, but p53 overexpression has been reported to be associated with high-risk GIST and unfavorable prognosis, implying that p53 should play a critical role in GIST. Also, Wee1 regulates the cell cycle and the antitumor activity of Wee1 inhibition was reported to be p53 mutant dependent. In addition, Wee1 was reported to have potential activity in GIST through the regulation of KIT protein and this mechanism may be dependent on p53 status. In this article, we review previous reports regarding the role of p53 in GIST and propose targeting the p53 pathway as a novel additional treatment strategy for GIST.","misc","wim","misc"

Studies have demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment plays a key role in regulating osteosarcoma progression. Recent studies have also shown that scRNA-seq plays an essential role in understanding the tumor heterogeneity and distinct subpopulations of tumors. In order to further understand the scRNA-seq data of osteosarcoma tissues, the present study further analyzed the scRNA-seq dataset (GSE152048) and explored the potential role of nuclear receptor-related genes in the pathophysiology of osteosarcoma. In our analysis, we identified 11 cell types in all the osteosarcoma tissues and nuclear receptors (NRs) were distributed in all types of cells. Further stratification analysis showed that NRs were mainly detected in TIL and Osteoblastic of the metastasis osteosarcoma, in TIL, Myoblast, Endothelial, and Myeloid of the primary osteosarcoma, and in Chondroblastic, Osteoblast, and Pericyte of the recurrent osteosarcoma. The NRs were also differentially expressed in different cell types among the metastasis, primary, and recurrent osteosarcoma. Furthermore, several NRs such as NR4A2, NR4A1, and NR3C1 have been found to be differentially expressed in most types of DEGs among metastasis, primary, and recurrent osteosarcoma. A high expression of NR4A1 in the osteosarcoma tissues was significantly correlated with a shorter 5-year overall survival of patients with osteosarcoma. On the other hand, there was no significant association between NR4A2 expression and the 5-year overall survival of patients with osteosarcoma. The expression of NR4A1 was significantly higher in the metastasis osteosarcoma tissues than in the primary osteosarcoma tissues as validated from GSE32981 and GSE154540. The expression of NR4A1 was significantly higher in osteosarcoma tissues from patients with poor chemosensitivity than that from patients with good chemosensitivity as validated from GSE154540. Further analysis of the scRNA-seq data revealed that the percentage of osteoblasts with a high NR4A1 expression was higher in the recurrent osteosarcoma tissues than that with a low NR4A1 expression. In conclusion, the present study may suggest that NR4A1 may be an important prognostic biomarker for osteosarcoma progression. However, further validation studies should be performed to confirm our findings.","misc","wim","misc"

A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL on August 10, 2021. Single-arm or multi-arm prospective clinical trials on induction chemotherapy without targeted therapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors were included. Primary outcomes included survival outcomes, objective response rate, and disease control rate, and the secondary outcome was the rates of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events. The 39 studies included in the systematic review and meta-analysis comprised 36 clinical trials and 5389 patients. The estimates for 3-year overall and fail-free survival rates were 87% and 77%. The estimates for 5-year rates of overall and fail-free survival were 81% and 73%. Gemcitabine plus platinum and docetaxel combined with 5-fluorouracil plus platinum strategies were associated with the highest rates of 3-year and 5-year overall survival. The objective response and disease control rates were 85% and 98% after the completion of induction chemotherapy. Neutropenia (27%) and nausea/vomiting (7%) were the most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related hematological and non-hematological adverse events during the induction phase. Different induction chemotherapeutic strategies appear to have varying effects and risks; a comprehensive summary of the survival outcomes, responses, and toxicities in clinical trials may provide a crucial guide for clinicians.","meta_analysis","wim","systematic_review"

Between February 2009 and November 2014, 7,433 patients at the Shanghai Cancer Center who had undergone elective surgery for colorectal cancer were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Patients were divided into two groups: low and high preoperative WBC groups. Propensity score matching was used to address the differences in baseline characteristics. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to identify independent prognostic factors in colorectal cancer patients. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells in the high and low preoperative WBC groups were compared using immunohistochemical staining. Of the 7,433 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery and were available for analysis, 5,750 were included in the low preoperative WBC group, and 1,683 were included in the high preoperative WBC group. After propensity score matching, 1,553 patients were included in each group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that a high preoperative WBC count was associated with a decreased overall survival (P = 0.002) and disease-free survival (P = 0.003), and that preoperative WBC count was an independent risk factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.234; 95% confidence interval, 1.068-1.426; P = 0.004) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.210; 95% confidence interval, 1.047-1.397, P = 0.01). Compared to the low preoperative WBC group, the high preoperative WBC group exhibited higher expression of regulatory T cells (P = 0.0034), CD68+ macrophages (P = 0.0071), and CD66b+ neutrophils (P = 0.0041); increased expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (P = 0.005) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (P = 0.0019); and lower expression of CD8+ T cells (P = 0.0057) in colorectal cancer patients. Our research indicates that a high preoperative WBC count is a prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer patients and is associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which could aid in future risk stratification.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Eighteen institutions enrolled 259 low- and intermediate-risk patients. Median follow-up is 5.5 years, with 66 patients followed ≥ 10 years. This SBRT regimen specifically emulated an existing HDR brachytherapy dose schedule and isodose morphology, prescribed to 38 Gy/4 fractions, delivered daily by robotic SBRT, mandating > 150% dose escalation in the peripheral zone. Androgen deprivation therapy was not allowed, and a hydrogel spacer was not available at that time. Median pre-SBRT PSA 5.12 ng/mL decreased to 0.1 ng/mL by 3.5 years, with further decrease to a nadir of < 0.1 ng/mL by 7 years, maintained through 10 years. Ten-year freedom from biochemical recurrence measured 100% for low-risk, 84.3% for favorable intermediate risk (FIR), and 68.4% for unfavorable intermediate (UIR) cases. Multivariable analysis revealed that the UIR group bifurcated into two distinct prognostic subgroups. Those so classified by having Gleason score 4 + 3 and/or clinical stage T2 (versus T1b/T1c) had a significantly poorer 10 year freedom from biochemical recurrence rate, 54.8% if either or both factors were present, while UIR patients without these specific factors had a 94.4% 10-year freedom from biochemical recurrence rate. The cumulative incidence of grade 2 GU toxicity modestly increased over time - 16.3% at 5 years increased to 19.2% at 10 years-- while the incidence of grade 3+ GU and GI toxicity remained low and stable to 10 years - 2.6% and 0%, respectively. The grade 2 GI toxicity incidence also remained low and stable to 10 years - 4.1% with no further events after year 5. This HDR-like SBRT regimen prescribing 38 Gy/4 fractions but delivering much higher intraprostatic doses on a daily basis is safe and effective. This treatment achieves a median PSA nadir of <0.1 ng/mL and provides high long-term disease control rates without ADT except for a subgroup of unfavorable intermediate-risk patients.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

This study investigated whether PET/CT could replace bone marrow biopsy (BMB) in treatment-naive ENKTL patients. Newly diagnosed ENKTL patients (n = 356) who received BMB and PET/CT to evaluate BMI at the time of diagnosis were retrospectively reviewed at West China Hospital between August 2008 and January 2020. The BMI diagnosis was confirmed using BM histology. Clinical characteristics, survival outcomes, and prognostic indicators were summarized and analyzed. The cohort included 356 cases, of whom 261 were diagnosed with early-stage and 95 with advanced-stage ENKTL by PET/CT before initial treatment. No early-stage patients were identified with BMI by either BMB or PET/CT. Among the advanced-stage patients, 26 were BMB positive, and 12 of 22 patients (54.5%) with positive PET/BM results were also BMB positive. The sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT to detect BMI were 46% and 97%, respectively. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of PET/BM-negative patients were markedly longer (p = 0.010 and p = 0.001 for PFS and OS, respectively), which was consistent with the results of the BMB (p = 0.000 for both PFS and OS). Although 18F-FDG PET/CT showed the potential to replace BMB in the initial staging of early-stage ENKTL patients, baseline PET/CT cannot provide an accurate BMI evaluation for advanced-stage patients. A prospective study is required to confirm the diagnostic performance of BMI identification by PET/CT, along with targeted BMB and MRI for advanced-stage patients.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT images of 126 patients with grade 1-3A FL were retrospectively analyzed. A novel PET/CT parameter characterizing lesion dissemination, the distance between two lesions that were furthest apart (D max), was calculated. The total metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were computed by using 41% of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) thresholding method. The 5-year PFS rate was 51.9% for all patients. In the multivariate analysis, high D max [P = 0.046; hazard ratio (HR) = 2.877], high TLG (P = 0.004; HR = 3.612), and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.041; HR = 2.287) were independent predictors of PFS. A scoring system for prognostic stratification was established based on these three adverse factors, and the patients were classified into three risk categories: low risk (zero to one factor, n = 75), intermediate risk (two adverse factors, n = 29), and high risk (three adverse factors, n = 22). Patients in the high-risk group had a shorter 3-year PFS (21.7%) than those in the low- and intermediate-risk groups (90.6 and 44.6%, respectively) (P < 0.001). The C-index of our scoring system for PFS (0.785) was superior to the predictive capability of the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), FLIPI2, and PRIMA-Prognostic Index (C-index: 0.628-0.701). The receiver operating characteristic curves and decision curve analysis demonstrated that the scoring system had better differentiation and clinical utility than these existing indices. In addition, the median SUVmax was significantly higher in grade 3A (36 cases) than in grades 1 and 2 FL (90 cases) (median: 13.63 vs. 11.45, P = 0.013), but a substantial overlap existed (range: 2.25-39.62 vs. 3.17-39.80). TLG and D max represent two complementary aspects of the disease, capturing the tumor burden and lesion dissemination. TLG and D max are promising metrics for identifying patients at a high risk of progression or relapse. Additionally, SUVmax seems to have some value for distinguishing grade 3A from low-grade FL but cannot substitute for biopsy.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Univariate and multivariate Cox survival analyses were conducted to evaluate the indicators to set up a nomogram associated with the patients' overall survival (OS). The prediction accuracy and discriminative ability of the nomogram were measured by the concordance index (C-index), decision curve, calibration curve, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses demonstrated that immune globin A (IgA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were independent risk factors. A nomogram based on IgA, CRP, and cTNM stage was established for predicted OS in the training cohort and validated in the validation cohort. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.820 (95% CI: 0.705-0.934), which was higher than that of the cTNM stage (0.655 (95% CI: 0.546-0.764), p < 0.05) in the training cohort, and similar results were observed in the validation cohort (0.832 (95% CI: 0.760-0.903 vs 0.635 (95% CI: 0.509-0.757), p < 0.001). Furthermore, the prediction accuracy and net benefit of the nomogram verified by the calibration curve, decision curve, NRI, and IDI were satisfactory in the training and validation cohorts.

Additionally, AKIP1 was modified in 8505C and 8505C/Dox cells that underwent doxorubicin treatment by siRNA or overexpression plasmid, followed by cellular function and pathway detection. AKIP1 was elevated in FRO, 8505C, CAL-62, and KHM-5M cells compared to control cells (all p < 0.05). Subsequently, AKIP1 knockdown elevated apoptosis, inhibited viability and invasion, and inactivated PI3K/AKT and β-catenin pathways in 8505C and CAL-62 cells (all p < 0.05).

Although traditional drainage (e.g., anal and pelvic catheters) may reduce the impact of AL to some extent, their role in reducing the incidence of AL remains controversial. In this study, we developed a novel drainage technique involving the placement of drainage tubes through the gap between sutures during handsewn anastomosis, to reduce the occurrence of anastomotic leakage. We retrospectively analyzed 34 consecutive patients who underwent intersphincteric resection requiring handsewn anastomosis between February 1, 2017, and January 1, 2021. Patients were classified into the trans-anastomotic drainage tube group (TADT, n = 14) and the non-TADT group (n = 20) based on whether trans-anastomotic tube placement was performed. The incidence of postoperative complications, such as AL, was compared between the two groups, and anal function of patients at 1-year post-ISR was evaluated. Six cases of AL occurred in the non-TADT group, while none occurred in the TADT group; this difference was statistically significant (p=0.031). The TADT group also had a shorter hospital stay (p=0.007). There were no other significant intergroup differences in operation time, blood loss, pain score, anastomotic stenosis, intestinal obstruction, or incidence of wound infection. In the 30 patients (88.2%) evaluated for anal function, there were no significant intergroup differences in stool frequency, urgency, daytime/nocturnal soiling, Wexner incontinence score, or Kirwan grading. Taken together, trans-anastomotic tube placement is a novel drainage method that may reduce AL after ISR requiring handsewn anastomosis and without adversely affecting anal function.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Sintilimab, a monoclonal antiprogrammed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody, was used to treat patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we report a case of therapeutic heterogeneity in relapsed HCC with lung metastases. A 57-year-old female patient was diagnosed with HCC and underwent radical hepatectomy. One and a half years later, imaging scans found multiple metastatic tumors in the lung, which were accompanied by an increased α-fetoprotein (AFP) level. The patient then started to receive sintilimab. In the first 6 months after sintilimab treatment, all the metastatic nodules regressed gradually and ultimately disappeared, except for one nodule, which remained stable in the following 3 months. Finally, the patient underwent pulmonary lobectomy to remove the remaining nodule. Thereafter, follow-up visits showed the AFP level decreased to normal and imaging scans showed no signs of recurrence, confirming that the patient exhibited a clinically complete response. Pathological assessments showed that in the primary tumor site, the tumor comprised moderately differentiated HCC with a few infiltrated cytotoxic T cells and negative PD-L1 expression. While in the metastatic site, the nodule was composed of poorly differentiated HCC with cytotoxic T-cell infiltration with few cells inside the tumor and expressed PD-L1 in some areas of the tumor. There were dynamic alterations of PD-L1 expression and cytotoxic T-cell infiltration in the primary and relapsed HCC lesions after anti-PD-1 treatment. This case presented the heterogeneities of both the tumor microenvironment and the following antitumor response among the metastatic nodules in the same patient and revealed the importance of comprehensive therapy in cancer treatment.","misc","wim","misc"
"777",35965581,"Case report: ISL2 is involved in malignant transformation in a patient with multiple relapsed oligodendroglioma.","The majority of oligodendrogliomas exhibit an intrinsic tendency to develop into malignant high-grade tumors. Angiogenesis is a major factor contributing to the malignant transformation of oligodendroglioma, and its molecular regulatory mechanism needs further study. We provide a case report of an oligodendroglioma patient with two recurrences whose disease progressed from WHO grade II to grade III. We showed that the expression of insulin gene enhancer protein (ISL2) and its angiogenic ability were positively correlated with the progression of oligodendroglioma. In Low-grade glioma (LGG) patients, including oligodendroglioma patients, overexpression of ISL2 was correlated with poor prognosis, and this correlation was not affected by gender or isocitrate dehydrogenase 1(IDH1) mutation status. ISL2 expression and ISL2-mediated angiogenic pathway activity are ideal biomarkers for the malignant transformation of oligodendroglioma. Anti-ISL2 therapy is also a potential treatment option for malignantly transformed oligodendroglioma.","misc","wim","misc"

Loss of the RAS GTPase-activating protein NF1 and subsequent overactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK) signaling exist nearly uniformly in MPNST, making MAPK inhibition a promising therapeutic intervention. However, the efficacy of MEK inhibitor (MEKi) monotherapy was limited in MPNST and the relative mechanisms remained largely unexplored. In this study, we generated three MEKi-resistant cell models and investigated the mechanisms of MEKi resistance using high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing. We discovered that cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by MEKi were rescued in MEKi-resistant cells and the upregulation of LAMA4/ITGB1/FAK/SRC signaling conferred resistance to MEKi. In addition, concurrent inhibition of MAPK signaling and FAK/SRC cascade could sensitize MPNST cells to MEKi. Our findings provide potential solutions to overcome MEKi resistance and effective combination therapeutic strategies for treating MPNSTs.","misc","wim","misc"

The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib as third-line or above therapy for patients with HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Patients with HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer who have failed from prior therapy and treated with anlotinib monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy or immunotherapy from June 2018 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed based on real-world clinical practice. The primary end point was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS) and safety. 47 patients with HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer received anlotinib monotherapy or combination therapy as third-line or above therapy. In the general population, 10 patients achieved PR, 25 patients had SD and 12 patients had PD. The overall ORR and DCR were 21.3% and 74.5%, respectively. Subgroup analysis suggested that there were no statistically significant differences in ORR and DCR with respect to HR status (positive vs. negative), treatment programs (monotherapy vs. combination) and treatment type in combination group (chemotherapy vs. immunotherapy). The patients who did not received previously anti-angiogenesis therapy had superior DCR (84.8% vs. 50.0%, P=0.012). Median PFS and OS were 5.0 months (95% CI=4.3-5.7) and 21.0 (95% CI=14.9-27.1) months, respectively. The PFS (6.5m vs. 3.5m, P=0.042)and OS (28.2m vs. 12.6m, P=0.040) were better in HR positive patients than HR negative patients. And simultaneously, patients who received anlotinib combination therapy obtained better PFS (5.5m vs. 3.0m, P=0.045). The incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse events(AEs) was 31.9%.

In this study, we aimed to explore the capability of DLR for the prediction of 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using pretreatment PET/CT images. A total of 257 patients (170/87 patients in internal/external cohorts) with advanced NPC (TNM stage III or IVa) were enrolled. We developed an end-to-end multi-modality DLR model, in which a 3D convolutional neural network was optimized to extract deep features from pretreatment PET/CT images and predict the probability of 5-year PFS. The TNM stage, as a high-level clinical feature, could be integrated into our DLR model to further improve the prognostic performance. For a comparison between conventional radiomics and DLR, 1,456 handcrafted features were extracted, and optimal conventional radiomics methods were selected from 54 cross-combinations of six feature selection methods and nine classification methods. In addition, risk group stratification was performed with clinical signature, conventional radiomics signature, and DLR signature. Our multi-modality DLR model using both PET and CT achieved higher prognostic performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.842 ± 0.034 and 0.823 ± 0.012 for the internal and external cohorts) than the optimal conventional radiomics method (AUC = 0.796 ± 0.033 and 0.782 ± 0.012). Furthermore, the multi-modality DLR model outperformed single-modality DLR models using only PET (AUC = 0.818 ± 0.029 and 0.796 ± 0.009) or only CT (AUC = 0.657 ± 0.055 and 0.645 ± 0.021). For risk group stratification, the conventional radiomics signature and DLR signature enabled significant difference between the high- and low-risk patient groups in both the internal and external cohorts (p < 0.001), while the clinical signature failed in the external cohort (p = 0.177). Our study identified potential prognostic tools for survival prediction in advanced NPC, which suggests that DLR could provide complementary values to the current TNM staging.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies reporting the effect of prehabilitation strategies versus standard care or rehabilitation in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The primary outcomes were overall postoperative complications and length of hospital stay (LOS), and the secondary outcome was functional capacity (measured using the 6-min walk test [6MWT]) at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. Fifteen studies with 1,306 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed no significant reduction in the number of overall postoperative complications (risk ratio = 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79-1.31; p = 0.878) or LOS (standardized mean difference = 0.04; 95% CI = -0.11 to 0.20; p = 0.589) in patients who underwent colorectal surgery with or without prehabilitation strategy. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the functional capacity estimated using the 6MWT at 4 and 8 weeks postoperatively.

To address this need, the Nepalese Association of Palliative Care (NAPCare) created pain management guidelines (PMG) to support healthcare providers in assessing and treating serious pain. The NAPCare PMG are grounded in World Health Organization best practices but adapted for the cultural and resource context of Nepal. Wider adoption of the NAPCare PMG has been limited due to distribution of the guidelines as paper booklets. Building on a long-standing partnership between clinicians and researchers in the US and Nepal, the NAPCare PMG mobile application (app) was collaboratively designed. Healthcare providers in Nepal were recruited to pilot test the app using patient case studies. Then, participants completed a Qualtrics survey to evaluate the app which included the System Usability Scale (SUS) and selected items from the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). Descriptive and summary statistics were calculated and compared across institutions and roles. Regression analyses to explore relationships (α = 0.05) between selected demographic variables and SUS and MARS scores were also conducted. Ninety eight healthcare providers (n = 98) pilot tested the NAPCare PMG app. Overall, across institutions and roles, the app received an SUS score of 76.0 (a score > 68 is considered above average) and a MARS score of 4.10 (on a scale of 1 = poor, 5 = excellent). 89.8% (n = 88) agreed or strongly agreed that the app will help them better manage cancer pain. Age, years of experience, and training in palliative care were significant in predicting SUS scores (p-values, 0.0124, 0.0371, and 0.0189, respectively); institution was significant in predicting MARS scores (p = 0.0030). The NAPCare PMG mobile app was well-received, and participants rated it highly on both the SUS and MARS. Regression analyses suggest end-user variables important to consider in designing and evaluating mobile apps in lower resourced settings. Our app design and pilot testing process illustrate the benefits of cross global collaborations to build research capacity and generate knowledge within the local context.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Flexible behavior requires that neuronal populations optimize information processing through efficient multi-scale communication. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) fields to alter the cortical activity promise to illuminate the neurophysiological mechanisms that underpin neuro-cognitive and behavioral processing and their causal relationship. Here, we focus on the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) that have been increasingly used in cognitive neuroscience for modulating superficial neural networks in a polarity (tDCS) and frequency/phase (tACS) fashion. Specifically, we discuss recent evidence showing how tDCS and tACS modulate the performance monitoring network in neurotypical samples. Emphasis is given to studies using behavioral tasks tapping conflict and error processing such as the Stroop, the Flanker, and the Simon tasks. The crucial role of mid-frontal brain regions (such as the medial frontal cortex, MFC; and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dACC) and of theta synchronization in monitoring conflict and error is highlighted. We also discuss current technological limitations (e.g., spatial resolution) and the specific methodological strategies needed to properly modulate the cortical and subcortical regions.","misc","wim","misc"
"785",35965600,"A protocol for rapid construction of senescent cells.","Aging may be the largest factor for a variety of chronic diseases that influence survival, independence, and wellbeing. Evidence suggests that aging could be thought of as the modifiable risk factor to delay or alleviate age-related conditions as a group by regulating essential aging mechanisms. One such mechanism is cellular senescence, which is a special form of most cells that are present as permanent cell cycle arrest, apoptosis resistance, expression of anti-proliferative molecules, acquisition of pro-inflammatory, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and others. Most cells cultured in vitro or in vivo may undergo cellular senescence after accruing a set number of cell divisions or provoked by excessive endogenous and exogenous stress or damage. Senescent cells occur throughout life and play a vital role in various physiological and pathological processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing, host immunity, and tumor suppression. In contrast to the beneficial senescent processes, the accumulation of senescent also has deleterious effects. These non-proliferating cells lead to the decrease of regenerative potential or functions of tissues, inflammation, and other aging-associated diseases because of the change of tissue microenvironment with the acquisition of SASP. While it is understood that age-related diseases occur at the cellular level from the cellular senescence, the mechanisms of cellular senescence in age-related disease progression remain largely unknown. Simplified and rapid models such as in vitro models of the cellular senescence are critically needed to deconvolute mechanisms of age-related diseases. Here, we obtained replicative senescent L02 hepatocytes by culturing the cells for 20 weeks. Then, the conditioned medium containing supernatant from replicative senescent L02 hepatocytes was used to induce cellular senescence, which could rapidly induce hepatocytes into senescence. In addition, different methods were used to validate senescence, including senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), the rate of DNA synthesis using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay, and senescence-related proteins. At last, we provide example results and discuss further applications of the protocol.","protocol","wim","protocol"

Furthermore, emotional-cognitive distress factors, such as depression and anxiety, are a common feature in patients with fibromyalgia. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying fibromyalgia remain mostly unknown. Among non-pharmacological treatments, cognitive-behavioral therapy has been used during the last decade, namely with the enrolment of patients in programs of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and in mindfulness-based interventions (MBI). We critically analyzed the literature to search for scientific evidence for the use of MBI in fibromyalgia. The studies were evaluated as to several outcomes of fibromyalgia improvement along with aspects of the study design which are currently considered relevant for research in mindfulness. We conclude that despite the sparsity of well-structured longitudinal studies, there are some promising results showing that the MBI are effective in reducing the negative aspects of the disease. Future design of studies using MBI in fibromyalgia management should be critically discussed. The importance of active controls, evaluation of sustained effects along with investigation of the subserving neurobiological mechanisms and detailed reports of possible adverse effects should be considered.","misc","wim","systematic_review"

A 65-year-old woman with persistent atrial fibrillation was referred for LAAc. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed spontaneous contrast in the LAA without formation of a thrombus; the LAA shape was tortuous and difficult to assess. A first LAAc procedure was unsuccessful given the unsuitable sheath position. Therefore, a soft three-dimensional (3D) model printing was performed by laser sintering and revealed excessive sheath kinking with an inferior approach, but successful deployment would be feasible using a superior approach. Successful trans-jugular implantation of a Watchman FLX 31 device in stable position without residual leakage was achieved during the subsequent procedure. At 3-month follow-up, and after cessation of oral anticoagulation, the patient's symptoms improved. Imaging demonstrated complete LAA occlusion and correct placement of the device along the LAA superior axis. This is the first-reported clinical case of a complex transcatheter LAAc through a trans-jugular approach. Simulating the patient's anatomy with a laser sintering 3D-printed model showed why the transfemoral approach failed, validated the trans-jugular procedure, enabled selection of the simple curve access sheath that had the most direct trajectory towards the LAA, confirmed that transseptal puncture was possible, allowed determination of the angle of puncture, enabled selection of the most appropriate LAA device and had a very low cost compared with planning software or other printing methods.","misc","wim","misc"

Hence, the study was designed to predict the deleterious SNP and its effect on the S100A4 protein structure and function. Twenty-one SNP data sets were screened for nonsynonymous mutations and subsequently subjected to deleterious mutation prediction using different computational tools. The screened deleterious mutations were analyzed for their changes in functionality and their interaction with the tumor suppressor protein Tp53 by protein-protein docking analysis. The structural effects were studied using the 3DMissense mutation tool to estimate the solvation energy and torsion angle of the screened mutations on the predicted structures.

The tube voltage, tube current, and the size of fluoroscopic field of vision also have an impact on the radiation of workers during surgical exposure. Interventional surgery is difficult and easy. The exposure time of difficult surgery is relatively long, so the dose received by interventional staff is large. The intervention staff should improve their professional knowledge, be proficient in the operation technology, and try to reduce the exposure without affecting the diagnosis and treatment effect. During the intervention operation, the eye substance of the operator is exposed to a certain dose of radiation, and the wearing rate of protective lead glasses of the intervention staff is very low.

The goal of this study was to determine potential atrophy of the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, putamen, pallidum and caudate nucleus in glioma patients having undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after RT. Subcortical volumes were measured using T1-weighted MRI from patients before RT (N = 91) and from longitudinal follow-ups acquired in three-monthly intervals (N = 349). The volumes were normalized to the baseline values, while excluding structures touching the clinical target volume (CTV) or abnormal tissue seen on FLAIR imaging. A multivariate linear effects model was used to determine if time after RT and mean RT dose delivered to the corresponding structures were significant predictors of tissue atrophy. The hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, putamen, and pallidum showed significant atrophy after RT as function of both time after RT and mean RT dose delivered to the corresponding structure. Only the caudate showed no dose or time dependant atrophy. Conversely, the hippocampus was the structure with the highest atrophy rate of 5.2 % after one year and assuming a mean dose of 30 Gy.

"796",35965664,"Inequality in abundance.","With technological advance has come the possibility of a new era of abundance. Technologies like 3D printing and robotics promise to lower the costs of production and distribution of goods and services, presumably making these goods and services readily available to those across income and wealth spectrums. This undoubtedly is a good thing. But what will be the effect of these technologies on existing wealth inequalities and the psychological and societal burdens they impose? Can we expect that this newfound abundance will help remedy the current historic levels of inequality in the U.S. and other western countries? Unfortunately, the answer is likely no, for two reasons. First, history suggests that inequality often persists even under conditions of abundance due to dynamics of power and politics and ongoing impacts of structural inequalities. Having more than enough of a particular good or service to go around does not guarantee that all will have access to this good or service. Second, even if the new abundance enabled by technology extends into all levels of the socioeconomic spectrum, enabling individuals to access goods and services (and their attendant benefits) previously beyond their reach, the harms that attend unequal societies will persist. Increasing evidence suggests that these harms, including increased violence and decreased health, arise not from access (or a lack thereof) to particular goods and services, but from the adverse psychological consequences of living in an unequal society. This is a psychological burden shared not just by those at the losing end of the inequality equation, but also those who enjoy a relative advantage in society. Unequal societies are psychologically harmful to all who live in them, regardless of where these individuals fall on the socioeconomic spectrum, and largely independent of the particular goods and services they enjoy. The upshot is that society cannot rely on new abundance technologies to automatically solve problems of inequality and the social and psychological burdens that plague those who live in unequal societies. Indeed, depending on how society responds to questions of access to these technologies, their introduction might exacerbate various forms of inequality. In light of this, it is crucial to address conditions of inequality head-on, so that the new era of abundance promised by technological advance can lead to real gains in individual and societal wellbeing.","misc","wim","misc"

In contrast to the requirements associated with the Interoperability principle, the requirements associated with the Accessibility principle are often assumed to be relatively straightforward to implement. Indeed, a variety of different tools assessing FAIR rely on the data being deposited in a trustworthy digital repository. In this paper we note that there is an implicit assumption that access to a repository is independent of where the user is geographically located. Using a virtual personal network (VPN) service we find that access to a set of web sites that underpin Open Science is variable from a set of 14 countries; either through connectivity issues (i.e., connections to download HTML being dropped) or through direct blocking (i.e., web servers sending 403 error codes). Many of the countries included in this study are already marginalized from Open Science discussions due to political issues or infrastructural challenges. This study clearly indicates that access to FAIR data resources is influenced by a range of geo-political factors. Given the volatile nature of politics and the slow pace of infrastructural investment, this is likely to continue to be an issue and indeed may grow.

"799",35965736,"Exploring the use of self-sovereign identity for event ticketing systems.","Ticket fraud and ticket scalping activities often cause high costs as well as trust concerns for fans buying event tickets, especially in the secondary ticketing market. To address these issues, several publications and projects have proposed using blockchain technology to enable digital trust and ticket verifiability and thus to improve event ticketing systems. However, these approaches exhibit considerable privacy challenges and fall short concerning reliable, efficient visitor identification, which is necessary for controlling secondary market transactions. We demonstrate how a novel paradigm for end-user digital identity management, called self-sovereign identity (SSI), can be utilized to gain secondary market control. To do so, we follow a rigorous design science research approach to build and evaluate an SSI-based event ticketing framework. Our findings demonstrate that SSI-based event ticketing can enable efficient secondary market control by facilitating a practical implementation of the centralized exchange model. To generalize our results, we derive design principles for the efficient, reliable, and privacy-oriented ticket and identity verification and the use of revocation registries.","misc","wim","misc"

It may function in synaptic strengthening during spatial learning by promoting the stabilization and enrichment of dendritic spines. At present, almost nothing is known regarding CaMKv structure and regulation. In this study we confirm prior proteomic analyses demonstrating that CaMKv is palmitoylated on Cys5. Wild-type CaMKv is enriched on the plasma membrane, but this enrichment is lost upon mutation of Cys5 to Ser. We further show that CaMKv interacts with another regulator of synaptic plasticity, Arc/Arg3.1, and that the interaction between these two proteins is weakened by mutation of the palmitoylated cysteine in CamKv.","misc","wim","misc"

Patients with chronic tendinopathy and 'tendon-like' conditions treated within a single hospital outpatient clinic specialising in tendinopathy were identified. Pain scores, plus global function patient-reported outcome measures (5-Level version of EuroQol-5 Dimension and Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire (MSK-HQ)), were completed and compared with the S-LANSS questionnaire. 341 suitable patients with chronic tendinopathy and potentially similar conditions were identified. Numbers: lateral elbow tendinopathy (39), greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS; 112), patellar tendinopathy (11), non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy (40), insertional Achilles tendinopathy (39), plantar fasciopathy (100). 68% were female, with a mean age of 54.0±11.3 years and a mean symptom duration of 38.1±33.7 months.There was a mean S-LANSS score of 11.4±6.4. Overall, 47% of patients scored 12 or greater points on S-LANSS, indicating the possible presence of neuropathic pain. The highest proportion was in patients with plantar fasciopathy (61%), the lowest in those with GTPS (33%). Weak correlations were found between the S-LANSS score and MSK-HQ score, the numerical rating scale (0-10) values for 'average pain' and for 'worst pain', but not with the MSK-HQ %health value. S-LANSS identified nearly half of patients with chronic tendinopathy as possibly having a neuropathic pain component. This is of unclear clinical significance but worth further study to see if/how this may relate to treatment outcomes. These results are from a single hospital clinic dealing with patients with chronic tendinopathy, without a control group or those with shorter symptom duration. However, this reinforces the probability of neuropathic pain components in at least some patients with chronic tendinopathy.","misc","wim","human_intervention"
"802",35965786,"Comparison of efficacy and safety of laparoscopic and open enucleation for liver hemangioma in the right hemi liver: a retrospective cohort study.","Open enucleation (OE) is often performed for giant liver hemangioma (LH) because of its advantage in maximum preservation of functional liver parenchyma. Laparoscopic enucleation (LE) has been applied to LHs more frequently for its potential advantages in postoperative recovery and blood loss. However, to date, LE is still a difficult and complex surgical technique especially when the hemangioma is located in the right hemi liver. The aim of this study was to analyze whether LE is superior to OE for LH in the right hemi liver. Demographics and perioperative data of patients who underwent LE or OE for LH in the right hemi liver between May 2013 and July 2020 were collected. To decrease the selection bias, patients who underwent OE in first 2 years and those underwent LE in next 5 years by a same operation team were included. The data of sex, age, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, largest tumor size, and removed tumor number were enrolled in the propensity score matching (PSM) method to compensate for differences in the baseline characteristics between LE and OE groups. The perioperative outcomes were compared between 2 matched groups after PSM method. A total of 110 patients (36 LE vs. 74 OE) were matched by age, sex, BMI, ASA grade score, largest tumor size, removed tumor number and tumor location. Finally, 34 patients in each group were retained after PSM. There were no significant differences in operative time, estimated blood loss, amount of autologous transfusion, morbidity grade and the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) on postoperative day 1 or 3 or 5. LE was associated with a significantly higher rate of use of the Pringle maneuver (P<0.001), shorter time to oral feeding (P<0.001) and shorter postoperative length of stay (P<0.001). For LHs in the right hemi liver, the perioperative safety of LE is not inferior to OE, and LE seems to achieves a faster recovery from surgery compared with OE.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive pregnant women were the main participants in MTCT of HBV. Nevertheless, little was known about their knowledge and awareness of HBV infection and MTCT. We intended to evaluate their knowledge of HBV infection and MTCT prevention, and to clarify the emphasis of health education to improve the control of MTCT of HBV. We invited 164 HBsAg-positive pregnant women, who were aged ≥18 years old, had basic literacy skills and visited the Outpatient Clinic of Infectious Disease of the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital from May 2019 to January 2020, to independently and anonymously complete a self-administered survey regarding their knowledge of HBV infection and MTCT prevention. The correct rate of the questions was calculated and analyzed. A multivariate regression was conducted to identify predictors of HBV and MTCT knowledge and awareness. The average awareness rate of the 164 respondents was 52.56%, among which the awareness rates of basic knowledge and the transmission route of HBV were 80.49% and 53.29%, respectively. The awareness rates of knowledge about the interruption measures of MTCT during pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum were 43.78%, 49.75%, and 31.25%, respectively. The respondents who had a college education level or above, were employed, and had visited the outpatient Department of Infectious Disease before pregnancy had a significantly higher awareness rate. Previous visits to the Department of Infectious Disease were the only influencing factor for the higher awareness rate (OR =3.108, P=0.049). A lack of knowledge about the transmission route and interruption measures of MTCT of HBV is still common among HBsAg-positive pregnant women. Health education should be directed toward HBsAg-positive mothers to further improve the control of HBV infection.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The two existing treatment methods, hysteroscopic electric resection and vaginal surgery, are still controversial in terms of efficacy and safety. So, this paper to compares the effectiveness and safety of hysteroscopic electric resection and vaginal surgery in the treatment of USD after cesarean section. We performed a related literature search from main databases. According to the PICOS principles inclusion criteria were adult female USD patients to evaluate the efficacy of hysteroscopic resection and vaginal surgery for the treatment of USD, outcome data could be extracted to compare the efficacy and safety of the two procedures. Subsequently, according to the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the retrieved articles, studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria were eliminated. The RevMan 5.20 software was used for meta-analysis and Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2.0) was used to assess the risk of bias. The effectiveness and safety of hysteroscopic resection and vaginal surgery in the treatment of USD patients after cesarean section were compared. Eight articles were finally included, with a total of 191 patients in the hysteroscopic electric resection group and 212 patients in the vaginal surgery group. Compared with hysteroscopic resection and vaginal surgery, there is less intraoperative blood loss [mean difference (MD) is -25.23, P<0.00001], shorter operation time (MD is -29.45, P<0.00001), and shorter hospital stay (MD is -1.87, P<0.00001), but menstrual improvement risk ratio (RR) is 0.71 (P=0.51) and diverticulum recovery RR is 0.60 (P=0.43) there were no significant differences. Hysteroscopic electric resection provides a more satisfactory outcome than vaginal surgery in terms of intraoperative blood loss, operation time, and hospital stay. However, the sample size of the study was not large enough and some studies had high risk of bias, more large-sample multi-center high quality studies are needed for further comprehensive comparative analysis.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

In behavioral therapy, traditional pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) can be boring and monotonous, which can cause poor compliance. It's important to establish a new safe and effective crotch-pelvic floor functional reconstruction training method [Yun-type pelvic floor optimal training (Yun-type training)] for OAB patients. This randomized, double-blind, crossover trial recruited a total of 150 women with mild to moderate OAB. Patients were randomly assigned to receive Yun-type training (n=83) or PFMT (n=67). The intervention group was first given Yun-type training for 6 weeks, then switched to PFMT for 6 weeks after 2 weeks of elution. Patients in the control group were first treated with PFMT for 6 weeks, and changed to the use of Yun-type training for 6 weeks after 2 weeks of elution. The primary endpoint was overactive bladder symptom scores (OABSS) after 6 and 14 weeks of Yun-type training and PFMT. Yun-type training could significantly improve OABSS compared with PFMT after 6 and 14 weeks (P<0.001). Yun-type training was associated with an improvement in urine, urgency, urge urinary incontinence (UUI), urogenital distress inventory-6 (UDI-6), patient's perception of bladder condition (PPBC), voiding volume (VV), incontinence impact questionnaire-7 (IIQ-7), female sexual function index (FSFI), sexual desire, arousal, pain, satisfaction, pelvic floor muscle tone, type I muscle strength, type II muscle strength, and sex partner satisfaction as compared with PFMT after 6 and 14 weeks. Moreover, nocturia, maximum flow rate (Qmax), and climax in the Yun-type training group were significantly improved after 6 weeks, and the average flow rate (Qave) was improved after 14 weeks in the Yun-type training group. Yun-type training could yield additional benefits on OAB symptoms, sexual function, and sex partner satisfaction as compared with PFMT. The superior sexual function resulting from Yun-type training can be explained by the fact that it can contract deep and superficial muscle layers, resulting in increased vaginal wall pressure and blood flow, which further improves FSFI and sex partner satisfaction. It could lead to a new non-invasive treatment for OAB patients. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR-INR-17012192.","randomized_trial","wim","randomized_trial"

The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling pathway is a target for the treatment of epilepsy. TAK-242 is a potent TLR4 inhibitor with neuroprotective effects. No study has examined whether TAK-242 has a protective effect on epilepsy. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into the following 3 groups: (I) the control group; (II) the model [pentetrazol (PTZ)] group; and (III) the treatment group [PTZ + TAK-242 (3 mg/kg)], with 8 mice in each group. A mouse model of epilepsy was established via the intraperitoneal injection of PTZ (37 mg/kg). The behavioral changes of the mice were observed and scored using the Racine grading criteria. TAK-242 (3 mg/kg) was administered to establish the treatment model. The control group was intraperitoneally injected with normal saline at the same dose as the PTZ epileptogenic dose, and 3 mg/kg of normal saline was intragastrically administered. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions of TLR4, NF-κB, and the NF-κB downstream gene tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the mouse brain tissues were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. Compared to the control group, the mice in the model group showed generalized tonic convulsion and involuntary falling after PTZ modeling. The results of the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed that the treatment group had a higher number of normal neurons than the model group, and the neuronal cell morphology in the treatment group was closer to the control group. However, the occurrence of generalized tonic convulsion and involuntary falling in the mice in the treatment group was significantly improved. Comparing the Western Blot and RT-qPCR results, we detected higher TLR4, NF-KB, TNF-α protein and mRNA expression levels in the model group than the treatment group, and there was no significant difference between the control group and the treatment group. TAK-242 treatment ameliorates epileptic symptoms in mice, and the mechanism by which this occurs may be related to the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory pathway.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Thus, examining converting tumor immunogenicity and targeting novel pathways may be needed to improve response to immunotherapy. B7-H4 is an emerging target for breast cancer immunotherapy. However, the antitumor effect of B7-H4 is unstable during cell generation and further research is necessary to strengthen the antitumor efficacy of B7-H4. To explore the potential of B7-H4-targeted immunotherapy of breast cancer, current study generated four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against B7-H4 through immunization of mice followed by phage display technology. T cell-engaged bispecific antibodies and immunotoxins were created based on these mAbs. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of B7-H4-targeting bispecific antibody and immunotoxin, the anti-tumor efficacy test in vitro and in mice models in vivo were performed. Moreover, to boost the efficacy, oncolytic virus herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) was combined with the bispecific antibody and tested in mice models. Rigorous in vitro cytotoxicity assay showed that both B7-H4 bispecific antibodies and immunotoxins were toxic to B7-H4 positive cells, with the former being more potent. However, in vivo studies showed that immunotoxin was slightly more effective in suppressing tumor growth. Further, bispecific antibody combined with oncolytic virus HSV-2 revealed a synergistic effect in suppressing tumor growth without causing obvious adverse effects. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel strategy of combining oncolytic virus HSV-2 with bispecific antibody reinforce antitumor immune response, which warranted further translational investigation.","misc","wim","misc"

The protective effects of IL-35 against BBB dysfunction were examined using a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and an in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury in mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3). Intracerebroventricular administration of IL-35 (10 µg/g) was found to reduce cerebral edema and Evans blue (EB) leakage, and increase the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, thereby attenuating MCAO-induced neurological deficit in mice. Moreover, IL-35 (20 ng/mL) treatment upregulated the expression of TJ proteins in OGD/R-induced bEnd.3 cells. IL-35 also markedly suppressed the expression of caspase-1, IL-1β, and gasdermin D (GSDMD) in vivo and in vitro. In addition, IL-35 decreased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibited the expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) in OGD/R-induced bEnd.3 cells.

We proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and iterated random forest (RF) architecture for MRI image stratification by both anatomical location and image modality using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We employed 3 cross-sectional data sets from the ADNI to conduct our binary-stratification [AD and normal controls (NCs), or AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)], and multi-stratification (AD, MCI, and NCs) process using MRI. And the accuracy, recall, specificity, area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), F1 and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) scores to assess accuracy of auxiliary clinical diagnoses. Compared to other combinations of algorithms, our model obtained remarkable overall stratification accuracies in all different classification sets. In terms of AD vs. MCI, the mean training AUC of the 3 runs were 85.1% in 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In terms of AD vs. NC, the mean training AUC of the 3 runs was 90.6% in 95% CIs. In terms of the 3 stratifications of AD, MCI, and NC, relative precision, recall, and specificity for each category in the training test (TS) were all near 89%, while the F1 and MCC scores of both sets were 59.9% and 59.5%, respectively. Using a deep CNN and iterated RF architecture, we showed that brain image stratification is a promising means for evaluating AD, and examining the underlying etiology of the disease, by applying computer and medical images to achieve the early auxiliary diagnosis of AD.

ALF causes severe hepatocyte damage and necrosis, which can lead to liver dysfunction and even multi-organ failure. A growing body of evidence suggests that immune cell infiltration and some abnormally expressed genes are associated with ALF development. However, in ALF, they have yet to be thoroughly investigated. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to obtain microarray datasets such as GSE74000, GSE120652, GSE38941, and GSE14668, which were then examined via GEO2R to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with ALF. Metascape was employed to annotate the underlined genes using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. The mechanism of IGF1 in 2 different kinds of ALF including acetaminophen-induced ALF and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced ALF was studied using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Next, immune cell infiltration was investigated and differentiated in ALF using CIBERSORT. Six genes (HAO2, IGF1, PLA2G7, SC5D, GNE, SLC1A1) were found to be abnormally expressed in the 2 distinct types of ALF i.e., acetaminophen-induced ALF and HBV-induced ALF. IGF1 was identified as a hub gene in ALF and was found to be associated with several developmental cascades including immune responses, inflammatory responses, and intracellular calcium homeostasis. Additionally, the number of CD4 naive T cells, CD8 T cells, and follicular helper T cells was increased in acetaminophen-induced ALF, whereas the number of activated NK cells, resting NK cells, and plasma cells was increased in HBV-induced ALF. The present study determined a potential molecular target, namely IGF1, in acetaminophen-induced ALF and HBV-induced ALF, which may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology and management of ALF.

The potential mechanism through regulation of the calcineurin A (CnA)/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c2 pathway was investigated in the rat cardiomyoblast cell line H9c2. H9c2 cells were treated with ISO to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy to simulate CH in vitro. The cell surface area was assessed by phalloidin staining. The expression of miR-194, CnA mRNA, and CnA protein were assessed. Furthermore, the cellular localization of the NFATc2 protein after induction of CH was detected. The relationship between miR-194 and the CnA mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR) was verified by dual luciferase report assays. By constructing cardiomyocyte cell models with low expression of miR-194 and/or CnA, the effects of miR-194 and CnA on the localization of the NFATc2 protein and cell hypertrophy was investigated. Rescue experiments were conducted to analyze whether overexpression of miR-194 could alleviate the cell hypertrophy induced by ISO. The results demonstrated that induction with ISO significantly increased the surface area of H9c2 cells. After induction, the expression of miR-194 decreased, while both CnA mRNA and protein expression increased. Furthermore, the nuclear translocation of NFATc2 was obvious. MiR-194 bound to the 3'-UTR of CnA mRNA and inhibited CnA protein expression. Inhibition of miR-194 expression activated NFATc2 protein expression and increased the H9c2 cell surface area. After CnA expression was disturbed, hypertrophy induced by miR-194 down-regulation was blocked. In addition, overexpression of miR-194 significantly alleviated cell hypertrophy and activation of the CnA/NFATc2 pathway caused by ISO. In conclusion, increasing the expression of miR-194 can alleviate CH by targeting can and inhibiting the CnA/NFATc2 pathway.","misc","wim","rodent"

Patients with unresectable LA-NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive DCCRT either combined with Zengxiao Jiandu decoction (TCM arm) or placebo therapy (Control arm), by computer-generated random assignment lists using a central randomization system. The patients were routinely followed-up every 3 months for the first 2 years after the therapy, and every 6 months for the subsequent 3 years, or earlier if clinically indicated. The primary endpoint was grade ≥3 chemoradiotherapy-related toxicities, while secondary endpoints included the completion rate of chemoradiotherapy, the clinical objective response rate (ORR), and survival. The placebo achieved full consistency in color, aroma, taste and appearance with the Zengxiao Jiandu decoction. From February 2019 to December 2020, 163 patients were randomly allocated to TCM arm (n=82) or Control arm (n=81).

The gene interaction network of hub gene signatures was determined by ingenuity pathway analysis. Furthermore, the expression levels of the key genes were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). CIBERSORT analysis showed that the proportions of plasma cells, resting CD4+ memory T cells, M1 macrophages, and eosinophils were significantly different between gram-negative sepsis and normal samples. WGCNA identified 1,100 genes in the most relevant modules associated with these immune cells. In addition, 87 differentially expressed genes were identified. By overlapping the genes found in the WGCNA and the differentially expressed genes, a total of 46 genes related to immune cells were identified. Integrative analysis of LASSO and SVM-RFE identified NLR family CARD domain-containing 4 (NLRC4) and ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator like 4 (RGL4) as key gene signatures related to immune cells in gram-negative sepsis. The qRT-PCR results demonstrated that both NLRC4 and RGL4 were upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with sepsis. This investigation provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of immune cells involved in the pathogenesis of gram-negative sepsis. NLRC4 and RGL4 were identified as key gene signatures related to immune cells and may act as potential diagnostic biomarkers for gram-negative sepsis.","misc","wim","misc"
"816",35965816,"A narrative review of the protective effects of curcumin in treating ischemia-reperfusion injury.","Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is the cause of morbidity and mortality in a variety of diseases and surgical procedures including organ transplantation surgeries, acute coronary syndrome, strokes, and limb injuries. IR injury causes dysfunction of tissues and organs, and oxidative stress plays an important role in driving this process. Curcumin (CUR), a polyphenolic compound derived from turmeric, protects against IR injury by alleviating oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis. We review the protective effects of CUR against IR. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases using the keywords: ischemic reperfusion, CUR and summarized the results. The effects of CUR during IR have been reported for animal models in vitro and in vivo and the compound has been shown in various organs by suppression of oxidative stress, prevention of inflammation, inhibition of apoptosis and autophagy. CUR with nanocarriers showed many advantages than free CUR in the treatment of IR injury, such as improved bioavailability, sustained-release, better water solubility, better target organ accumulation, improved permeability across the blood-brain-barrier and more effective. Nanotechnology offers significant improvements and promising strategies to improve drug delivery to IR-injured tissues and achieve the desired protective effects. Thus, it is necessary to promote further clinical trials to promote the clinical application of CUR with nanocarriers.","misc","wim","systematic_review"
"817",35965817,"Diagnostic performance of coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography derived fractional flow reserve (CTFFR) in patients with coronary artery calcification: insights from multi-center experiments in China.","Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is affected by calcification artifacts, which reduces its diagnostic efficacy. CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CTFFR) based on CCTA has been proven to be accurate in the diagnosis of non-calcified patients, but its clinical use in patients with calcified coronary artery disease remains to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of coronary artery calcification on CTFFR. CCTA, coronary angiography, and FFR were performed on 128 patients in three clinical medical centers. Local investigators performed an assessment of stenosis for CCTA and the core laboratory performed the CTFFR calculations. CTFFR ≤0.8 and diameter stenosis ≥50% for CCTA was identified as lesion-specific ischemia. The diagnostic performance of CTFFR in identifying the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was analyzed using an invasive FFR ≤0.8 as the gold standard. We compared the diagnostic performances between CTFFR and CCTA according to the level of calcification. We divided patients into four groups based on the coronary artery calcification score [coronary artery calcification score (CACS) =0, >0 to <100, ≥100 to <400, and ≥400]. The Youden index indicated an optimal threshold of 0.80 for CTFFR to identify functionally ischemic lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for CTFFR on a per-patient basis were 90% (80-96%), 98% (92-99%), 94% (89-97%), 98% (91-99%), 92% (83-97%), and 96.9% (94.2-99.6%), respectively. Compared to CCTA, CTFFR had a higher specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV, and AUC in both the low to intermediate calcification group and the high calcification group. The diagnostic efficacy of CTFFR was higher than that of CCTA without the influence of calcification. This Chinese multi-center study showed that CTFFR based on novel computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling demonstrated very high diagnostic efficacy compared to the invasive measurement of FFR in all lesions suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Of particular note are the high specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of CTFFR, even in patients with calcification, which were significantly better than previous CCTA assessments.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

At present, there is no clear standard for simultaneous cervical lymph node dissection at home and abroad. We summarize the pattern of regional recurrence in glottic cancer after initial TLM and to evaluate the risk factors for neck metastasis. Seventy-five cases with recurrent glottic cancer after TLM between December 2004 and June 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Survival, regional control rate, and neck metastasis were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Univariate analysis was performed with the log-rank test and multivariate analysis was completed using Cox regression. The 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and regional control rate after the first TLM were 73.6%, 89.1%, and 69.7%, respectively. A total of 22 (29.3%) patients developed cervical metastases during long-term follow-up and showed a significant decline in OS and DSS rates. Multivariate analysis indicated that histological grading and type of TLM were both risk factors for neck metastasis. Patients treated with type Vc cordectomy were more likely to develop regional recurrence than patients treated with type III cordectomy [hazard ratio (HR) =14.737, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.117-102.610, P=0.007]. No significant correlation was present between rT stage and neck metastasis. Multivariate analysis indicated that histological grading and type of TLM were both risk factors for neck metastasis. Patients with recurrence after type V cordectomy may have an increased risk of developing cervical lymph node metastasis, especially those with supraglottic spread or high-grade tumors.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Several pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches have been employed to improve the quality of sleep of patients during the postoperative period, but these strategies have certain limitations. Intradermal needle therapy is now among the most common treatments for insomnia in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The present study was developed to explore the effects of intradermal needle therapy (as an adjunct to physiotherapy-based treatments for postoperative sleep impairment) on the postoperative sleep quality of patients who have undergone a laparoscopic hysterectomy. This is a prospective, single-center, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. In total, 80 eligible patients will be randomly allocated to the control and experimental groups at a 1:1 ratio. Random numbers and grouping schemes will be generated using the SPSS 25.0 software package. Following the completion of the laparoscopic hysterectomy procedure, the patients will be returned to the medical ward and undergo authentic or sham intradermal needle therapy as appropriate. For patients in the experimental group, following sterilization, intradermal needles will be inserted into the bilaterally Shenmen (HT36) and Sanyinjiao (SP6) acupoints; the needles will be replaced after 24 h. False intradermal needles that exhibit similar surface characteristics but lack needles will be employed in the control group. Patients will undergo a single 3-day treatment course. The primary outcome is the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The secondary outcomes are the 10-Item Short-Form Identity-Consequence Fatigue Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety, and postoperative pain scores, which will be rated using a visual analog scale. Time to postoperative defecation and the duration of hospitalization will also be recorded. The present study seeks to examine the efficacy of the intradermal needle as a therapeutic tool for improving the sleep quality of patients after surgery who have undergone a laparoscopic hysterectomy to provide a foundation for future large-scale clinical studies.

This study sought to explore the underlying roles of YaoYi-moxibustion (YY-moxi) in ischemic stroke. A total of 75 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following 5 groups: (I) the sham-operated group; (II) the middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO) group; (III) the YY-moxi group; (IV) the antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine, NAC) group; and (V) the NAC + YY-moxi group. After the model had been established, the NAC group received intracerebroventricular injections of NAC, the YY-moxi group received YY-moxi, and the NAC + YY-moxi group received a combination of these 2 interventions. The neurological deficit score was confirmed, and the cerebral infarction was examined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. In the ischemia site of stroke, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated Dutp nick end labeling staining was applied to examine the apoptotic cells. Additionally, the apoptosis-associated genes and protein expressions in the ischemic brains were investigated by the reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis. YY-moxi alone and YY-moxi combined with NAC significantly reduced the neurological scores and cerebral infarction area of the MCAO rats. Additionally, YY-moxi alone and the combined application of YY-moxi and NAC improved the pathological status of ischemic brain tissues. Further, we found that YY-moxi alone and YY-moxi in combination with NAC could enhanced the antioxidation ability and reduced the inflammatory response of the MCAO model rats. We also proved that YY-moxi alone and YY-moxi combined with NAC significantly suppressed apoptosis-related proteins in the MCAO model rats. These findings indicate that YY-moxi exerts a protective effect on cerebral ischemic injury by reducing apoptosis. The study suggests that the mechanism may be related to its downregulating the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NK-κB).","rodent","wim","rodent"

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion could reduce the incidence of CPSP in patients with breast cancer. Female patients undergoing radical breast cancer surgery were randomly assigned to the 2% lidocaine group (L) and the control group (S). group L received an intravenous infusion of 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine 10 minutes prior to induction, followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg/h until the end of surgery. The control group received an equal amount of saline. The primary outcome was the incidence of CPSP at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included VAS pain scores and frequency of remedial analgesia within 24 hours postoperatively; incidence of CPSP at 1 and 6 months; and scores on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Simplified McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), and Neuropathic Pain Score (DN-4) at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Eighty-two patients participated in this study. A total of 78 patients completed the 3-month postoperative follow-up (39 in group S and 39 in group L). At 3 months, the incidence of CPSP was significantly lower in the L group than in the S group (33.3% in the S group and 12.8% in the L group, P=0.032). Pain scores at rest and during exercise were significantly lower in the L group than in the S group at different time points (P≤0.001 and P<0.001). The need for remedial analgesia at 24 hours postoperatively also differed significantly between the two groups (P=0.036). At 6 months, the incidence of CPSP was also lower in the L group than in the S group (29.7% in the S group and 10.5% in the L group, P=0.038). The differences in SF-MPQ scores were statistically significant at both 3 and 6 months postoperatively (P=0.022, P=0.037). Intravenous infusion of lidocaine reduces the incidence of CPSP in breast cancer patients at 3 and 6 months and is effective in relieving acute postoperative pain.

However, its effectiveness remains controversial. This study sought to assess the effectiveness of FMT in the treatment of active UC by performing a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched the Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases from their inception to December 2021. RCTs that recruited patients with active UC and treated them with FMT, a placebo or a suitable comparator were included in the meta-analysis. PICOS: Patients, active UC; Intervention, FMT; Control, placebo or a suitable comparator; Outcomes, remission rate; Studies, RCTs. The risk of bias assessment was performed with Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (version 2). Meta-analyses of risk ratios (RRs) were performed to estimate the differences in remission rates and the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) between the FMT-treated and control patients. A total of 9 RCTs comprising 425 UC patients (213 FMT and 212 control) were included in the meta-analysis. The risk of bias was low in these RCTs. Clinical remission was observed in 86 of the 213 patients in the FMT groups and 47 of the 212 patients in the control groups [RR: 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.37, 2.47; P<0.0001]. Clinical remission was better when the FMT delivery route was via the lower gut, the FMT dose was >300 grams, and the fecal specimen from multiple donors. Endoscopic remission (observed in 7 RCTs) was achieved in 33 of the 195 FMT-treated patients compared to 17 of the 194 control patients (RR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.14, 3.31; P=0.01).

Significantly higher clinical and endoscopic remission rates are observed with FMT than with control treatments. However, FMT may cause a significantly higher incidence of SAEs than control treatments. Future studies should delineate the effects of donor selection, dosage, delivery route, and antibiotic pretreatment and should evaluate the safety profile of FMT.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

Due to its high disability rate, ischemic cerebrovascular disease is one of the most important diseases to be prevented and treated at present. The risk factors of cerebral ischemia include atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and blood viscosity caused by thrombocytosis. After cerebral ischemia, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury may be induced by oxidative stress (OS), inflammatory reaction, nitric oxide damage, apoptosis, excitatory amino acid toxicity, calcium (Ca2+) overload, and other mechanisms. Hesperidin is a flavanone compound and is a key component in citrus plants. It is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine extract with high levels of Pericarpium, shell, fruit, and green peel. In recent years, Hesperidin has received great attention, compelling evidence has indicated Hesperidin plays a beneficial role in cerebral ischemia. We conducted a literature search for published manuscripts hesperidin in ischemia/reperfusion up to December 2021 in common English databases (i.e., PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SpringerLink, Wiley, Cochrane Library) and Chinese databases [Chinese BioMedical Literature Service System (CBM), WANFANG database, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI)].

Solute carriers (SLCs) have been involved in the tumor progression of various cancer types. This study aimed to evaluate the role of these SLC-related glutamine transporters in the prognosis of BC patients by bioinformatics analysis. This study examined the transcription and prognostic data for glutamine-related transporters in BC from Oncomine Database, which is currently the largest oncogene microarray database platform in the world. As well as Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Kaplan-Meier (K-M), and cBioPortal online resources. The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) and GEPIA were also used to examine the relationship between SLCs and immune cell infiltration. The expression levels of SLC1A5, SLC3A2, SLC7A5, SLC7A8, and SLC38A1 were higher in BC tissues than normal breast tissues, but the expression level of SLC6A14 was lower. The expression levels of SLC7A5, SLC7A8, SLC6A14, and SLC38A2 were related to a later clinical tumor stage. In the K-M analyses, The K-M curves revealed that patients with high SLC1A5 expression had a poor prognosis (OS HR =1.28, 95% CI: 1.06-1.54; P=0.01). The high expression of SLC3A2 was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis (DMFS HR =1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.39; P=0.027). Increased SLC7A5 mRNA levels and decreased SLC7A8 mRNA levels were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in terms of OS, RFS, DMFS and PPS. The high expression of SLC6A14 was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis (PPS HR =1.35, 95% CI: 1.07-1.7; P=0.011). The high expression of SLC38A1 was correlated with a better prognosis than low expression of SLC38A1 (RFS HR =0.84, 95% CI: 0.76-0.93; P=0.00077; DMFS HR =0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.91; P=0.0013).

There is an unsatisfactory result for refractory CVO by sharp recanalization alone. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of blunt impingement followed by sharp recanalization for the treatment of CVO in hemodialysis patients. This study retrospectively examined hemodialysis patients with CVO who failed to recanalize using standard guidewire and catheter techniques in our department. In the first instance, all CVOs were recanalized using blunt impingement techniques, including a 6-Fr long sheath (Cook Incorporated, Bloomington, IN USA) and an 8-Fr sheath of Rosch-Uchida Transjugular Liver Access Set (RUPS-100; Cook Incorporated, Bloomington, IN, USA). If this was not successful, sharp recanalization devices were applied, including the stiff tip of a guidewire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), the RUPS-100, and the percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD) needle (Cook Incorporated, USA). All patients were followed up at least 4 months postoperatively. The technical success rate, arteriovenous access patency rates, and operation-related complications were analyzed. The procedural success rate was 100.0% (30 of 30). Thirty patients with CVO underwent blunt impingement with a technique success rate of 70.0% (21 of 30), and 9 patients received sharp recanalization after failed blunt impingement, with a technique success rate of 100.0% (9 of 9). The primary patency rates at 6 and 12 months postoperatively were 86.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The primary assisted patency rates were 93.3% and 63.3%, and the secondary patency rates were 93.3% and 70.0% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. One major procedure-related complication was detected, namely, a small injury of the superior vena cava (SVC) wall in a patient receiving recanalization via the stiff end of a guidewire, but this did not require further treatment. It is potentially effective and safe for interventionalists to use blunt impingement followed by sharp recanalization techniques to treat chronic CVO that is refractory to traversal using traditional catheter and guidewire techniques.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

All patients underwent lung transplantation. A total of 80 patients (74.8%) experienced a postoperative infection. Pathogenic microorganisms were found in 136 samples, predominantly in the sputum (n=120 samples; 88.2%). We detected 107 strains of Gram-negative bacteria (78.7%), including 30 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (22.1%) and 27 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.9%); 18 strains of Gram-positive bacteria (13.2%), including 11 strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus (8.1%) and 2 strains of Enterococcus faecium (1.5%); and 11 strains (8.1%) were infected by fungi. There were 87 strains of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The main multidrug-resistant bacteria included 28 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (32.2%) and 25 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.7%). Multivariate analysis showed that ventilator use over 3 days was an independent risk factor for postoperative infection [odds ratio (OR): 4.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31 to 18.66, P=0.019]. The infection rate after lung transplantation in our hospital is similar to that of other lung transplantation studies, but higher than that following transplantation of other organs. The pathogens of postoperative infection were similar to those identified in other lung transplantation studies. Using a ventilator for more than 3 days is a risk factor for postoperative infection, suggesting that preventive measures for postoperative infection should be taken in such patients, and early postoperative discontinuation of the ventilator may reduce postoperative infection.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

It is vulnerable to various damages, such as ionizing radiation. Exploration of proliferation, senescence and radiosensitivity of skin cells contributes to the development of medical and cosmetic countermeasures against skin aging and toward injury protection. Human antigen R (HuR) is one of the most widely studied RNA-binding proteins and serves an important role in stabilization of mRNA and regulation of the expression of the target genes. To investigate the role of HuR in modulating proliferation, senescence and radiosensitivity of skin cells, the present study performed an in vitro study using lentivirus-mediated overexpression or silencing of HuR in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells and human skin fibroblast WS1 cells. The results indicated that overexpression of HuR promoted proliferation, whereas downregulation of HuR inhibited proliferation of HaCaT and WS1 cells. Overexpression of HuR reduced apoptosis and senescence in skin cells. RNA-Seq of skin cells with HuR overexpression or knockdown identified 77 mRNAs positively or negatively correlated with HuR expression levels. In addition, silencing of HuR induced a significant increase in radiogenic reactive oxygen species after irradiation. Overexpression of HuR increased radiotolerance of HaCaT and WS1 cells. RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with RNA-Seq identified 14 mRNAs interacting with HuR upon radiation exposure. Overall, the findings of the present study illustrated the key role of HuR in modulating proliferation, senescence and radiosensitivity of skin cells providing a new therapeutic strategy for cosmetic treatments and to combat skin injury.","misc","wim","misc"

"830",35965862,"Enucleation versus hepatectomy for hepatic hemangiomas: A meta-analysis.","To compare the safety and efficacy of enucleation and hepatectomy for the treatment of hepatic hemangioma (HH). A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies evaluating enucleation versus hepatectomy for HH starting from the time of database creation to February 2022. Extraction of the data used in this study was done from the literature. The differences between the two surgical approaches were evaluated by comparing and analyzing the relevant data by means of meta-analysis. A total of 1,384 patients (726 underwent enucleation, and 658 with hepatectomy) were included in our meta-analysis from 12 studies. Enucleations were associated with favorable outcomes in terms of operation time [mean difference (MD): -39.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): -46.23, -33.30], blood loss (MD: -300.42, 95% CI: -385.64, -215.19), length of hospital stay (MD: -2.33, 95% CI: -3.22, -1.44), and postoperative complications (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.44-0.74). There were no differences between the groups in terms of patients needing transfusion (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.42), inflow occlusion time (MD: 1.72, 95% CI: -0.27, 3.71), and 30-day postoperative mortality (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.02-2.17). Compared with hepatectomy, enucleation is found to be effective at reducing postoperative complications, blood loss, and operation time and shortening the length of hospital stay. Enucleation is similar to hepatectomy in terms of inflow occlusion time, 30-day postoperative mortality, and patients needing transfusing to hepatectomy.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

Responses to 2 separate surveys on neurosurgical applicant research productivity in 115 neurosurgical programs and their PDs were analyzed. Neurosurgical research participation was analyzed using an IMG survey of residents who matched into neurosurgical residency within the previous 8 years. Productivity of IMGs conducting dedicated research at the study institution was also analyzed. Thirty-two of 115 (28%) PDs responded to the first research productivity survey and 43 (37%) to the second IMG research survey. PDs expected neurosurgery residency applicants to spend a median of 12-24 months on research (Q1-Q3: 0-12 to 12-24; minimum time: 0-24; maximum time: 0-48) and publish a median of 5 articles (Q1-Q3: 2-5 to 5-10; minimum number: 0-10; maximum number: 4-20). Among 43 PDs, 34 (79%) ranked research institution or associated personnel as the most important factor when evaluating IMGs' research. Forty-two of 79 (53%) IMGs responding to the IMG-directed survey reported a median of 30 months (Q1-Q3: 18-48; range: 4-72) of neurosurgical research and 12 published articles (Q1-Q3: 6-24; range: 1-80) before beginning neurosurgical residency. Twenty-two PDs (69%) believed IMGs complete more research than USMGs before residency. Of 20 IMGs conducting dedicated neuroscience/neurosurgery research at the study institution, 16 of 18 who applied matched or entered a US neurosurgical training program; 2 applied and entered a US neurosurgical clinical fellowship. The research work of IMGs compared to USMGs who apply to neurosurgery residency exceeds PDs' expectations regarding scientific output and research time. Many PDs perceive IMG research productivity before residency application as superior to USMGs. Although IMGs comprise a small percentage of trainees, they are responsible for a significant amount of US-published neurosurgical literature. Preresidency IMG research periods may be improved with dedicated mentoring and advising beginning before the research period, during the period, and within a neurosurgery research department, providing a formal structure such as a research fellowship or graduate program for IMGs aspiring to train in the US.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

The outcomes of RT and LRP were assessed after patients were stratified according to Gleason score, stage, and risk group. Crude survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, and metastasis-free survival were evaluated using the log-rank test. The 5-year crude survival rate was 93.3% in the LRP group and 59.3% in the RT group. A significant survival benefit was found in the LRP group compared with the RT group (p = 0.004). Furthermore, significant differences were found in disease-specific survival (93.3% vs. 64.7%, p = 0.022) and metastasis-free survival (48% vs. 40.2%, p = 0.045) between the LRP and RT groups.

Complete consolidative surgery with surgical metastasectomy has been associated with improved survival outcomes in well-selected patients in previous reports. No randomized control trial exists to determine the effectiveness of metastasectomy. Therefore, reviewing observational studies is important to best determine which patients are most appropriate for metastasectomy for mRCC and if such treatment continues to be effective with the development of new systemic therapies such as immunotherapy.

In carefully selected elderly patients, surgery can improve long-term survival. To identify candidates who would benefit from surgery, we performed this study and built a predictive model. Data from NSCLC patients over 80 years old were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. A 1:1 propensity score matching was performed to balance the clinicopathological features between the surgery and non-surgery groups. Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank tests were used to assess the significance of surgery to outcome, and Cox proportional-hazards regression and competing risk model were conducted to determine the independent prognostic factors for these patients. A nomogram was built using multivariable logistic analyses to predict candidates for surgery based on preoperative factors. The final study population of 31,462 patients were divided into surgery and non-surgery groups. The median cancer-specific survival time respectively was 53 vs. 13 months. The patients' age, sex, race, Tumor, Node, Metastasis score, stage, chemotherapy use, tumor histology and nuclear grade were independent prognostic factors. Apart from race and chemotherapy, other variates were included in the predictive model to distinguish the optimal surgical octogenarian candidates with NSCLC. Internal and external validation confirmed the efficacy of this model. Surgery improved the survival time of octogenarian NSCLC patients. A novel nomogram was built to help clinicians make the decision to perform surgery on elderly patients with NSCLC.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Leading public health agencies, including the World Health Organization, have recognized the strong association between SB and poor health outcomes, particularly cardiovascular disease. However, while public health agencies have begun to advocate for reductions in SB, the current US guidelines are typically vague and non-specific. There is good reasoning behind this non-committal advocacy-there is limited mechanistic and clinical evidence to support policy development. To guide SB policy development, it is important to first consider the origins and evolution of SB, including the following: 1) is SB really a novel/contemporary behavior? i.e., how has this behavior evolved? 2) how did our ancestors sit and in what contexts? 3) how does SB interact with 24-hour activity behaviors, including physical activity and sleep? 4) what other historical and contemporary facets of life interact with SB? and 5) in what context do these behaviors occur and how might they provide different evolutionarily novel stressors? This perspective article will synthesize the available evidence that addresses these questions and stimulate discussion pertaining to the lessons that we can learn from an historical and evolutionary perspective. Last, it will outline the gaps in current SB interruption literature that are hindering development of feasible SB reduction policy.","misc","wim","misc"
"836",35965889,"Influent carbon to phosphorus ratio drives the selection of PHA-storing organisms in a single CSTR.","Enriching a biomass with a high fraction of polyhydroxyalkanoate-storing organisms (PHA-storers) represents an essential step in the production of PHAs (bioplastics) from municipal wastewater using mixed microbial cultures. A major challenge is however to create selective growth conditions that are favourable to PHA-storers. Our study thus investigates to what extent the influent COD to phosphorus (COD:P) ratio can be used as a tool for the robust selection of PHA-storers in a single continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR). Therefore, we operated five CSTRs in parallel, fed with synthetic wastewater (50% acetate - 50% propionate) with different COD:P ratios (200-1000 gCOD gP-1), and performed a detailed analysis of the microbial communities over long-term (30-70 solid retention times). Our study demonstrates that efficient and robust selection of PHA-storers can be achieved in a single CSTR at high influent COD:P ratios. The selective advantage for PHA-storers increases with the influent COD:P ratio, but only if growth conditions remain limited by both C-substrate and P. In contrast, selection performance deteriorates when COD:P ratios are too high and growth conditions are limited by P only. At an optimal COD:P ratio of 800 gCOD gP-1, a stable microbial community consisting of >90% PHA-storers and dominated by Pannonibacter sp. was selected in the long-term. Finally, our results suggest that high COD:P ratios provide a selective advantage to microorganisms with low cellular P requirements, explaining why different PHA-storers (i.e., Xanthobacter sp. vs. Pannonibacter sp.) were selected depending on the influent COD:P ratio (i.e., 200 vs. 800 gCOD gP-1). Overall, our results provide relevant insights for the development of a new approach for selecting PHA-storers, based on the use of a single CSTR and control of the influent COD:P ratio.","misc","wim","misc"

Several glass-ceramic (gc) LPSs with different compositions and good Li conductivity have been previously reported, but the relationship among composition, atomic structure, stability, and Li conductivity remains unclear due to the challenges in characterizing noncrystalline phases in experiments or simulations. Here, we mapped the LPS phase diagram by combining first-principles and artificial intelligence (AI) methods, integrating density functional theory, artificial neural network potentials, genetic-algorithm sampling, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. By means of an unsupervised structure-similarity analysis, the glassy/ceramic phases were correlated with the local structural motifs in the known LPS crystal structures, showing that the energetically most favorable Li environment varies with the composition. Based on the discovered trends in the LPS phase diagram, we propose a candidate solid-state electrolyte composition, (Li2S) x (P2S5)1-x (x ∼ 0.725), that exhibits high ionic conductivity (>10-2 S cm-1) in our simulations, thereby demonstrating a general design strategy for amorphous or glassy/ceramic solid electrolytes with enhanced conductivity and stability.","misc","wim","misc"

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has shown itself capable of contributing to the development or reformulation of organizational processes to make them more competitive and sustainable. Thus, this article aims to propose drivers for the development of corporate sustainability via I4.0. To this end, a literature review and content analysis were used as research methods to identify and analyze, in recent scientific literature, boosting elements that enable organizational processes to become more sustainable via I4.0. Based on these elements, six drivers were systematized and proposed: strategy; product and process design; energy and material resources; people; smart production; and supply chain. Each driver was discussed in light of the scientific literature to generate recommendations for companies to develop the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. The main theoretical-scientific contribution of this work is the deepening and expansion of the knowledge block that articulates corporate sustainability with I4.0, which strengthens the basis for the development of new research on these topics and creates a reference for the analysis and discussion of empirical studies. As an applied-managerial contribution, the drivers proposed in this work will provide organizations and their managers with a point of reference to effectively move towards sustainability, making their businesses greener, fairer, and more profitable. A limitation of this study is that the proposed drivers were based on the 30 most cited articles and did not consider other sources, such as documentation from companies. Therefore, for future studies, we suggest increasing the article base and include organizational repositories and identify how SMEs can become sustainable through I4.0 in a way that strengthens the social dimension of sustainability.","misc","wim","misc"

The goal of this treatment was to boost up the fiber-polymer interfacial linkage. The action was conducted in a superheated steam oven at various times (30-120 min) and temperatures (170-220 °C). The biocomposites were assessed in terms of mechanical characteristics, dimensional stability and morphological properties. Compared to different treatment temperatures, the results showed that treatment at 210 °C for 60 min offered the best tensile characteristics. Because of the presence of SHS-Jute, the tensile, impact, bending and dimensional stability of the bio-composites have been improved. The FTIR and SEM study revealed progress in the interfacial linkage between SHS-Jute and PLA. This interfacial link improves the bending strength of SHS-Jute-PLA biocomposites by about 15.64%. X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigation also showed an elevation in the crystalline structure with the incorporation of SHS-Jute. The degradation tests of the biocomposite were carried out in deionized water. SHS treatment reduces hemicellulose contents in jute fiber which causes water uptake% reduction is 54% in SHS-Jute-PLA.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were used to characterize the prepared powders. The XRD results show that the composites prepared with 2 and 5 wt% MNa and sintered at 900 °C, show the formation of hydroxyapatite (HAP) structure, whereas that prepared with 10 wt% MNa leads to the formation of β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) structure. The HAP structure decomposes at 1000 °C and leads to the formation of biocomposite containing HAP, β and α-TCP. However, β-TCP composites show thermal stability. FTIR and structural refinement results show the incorporation of clay ions into the apatitic structure causing changes in the crystal structure of the formed calcium phosphate phases. The changes in the composition and structure lead to an increase in the dissolution rate of HAP and a decrease in that of β-TCP.","misc","wim","misc"

Characterization was performed on the OLPAC and the material was used for the removal of methyl orange (MO) and methylene (MB) dyes from wastewater. The results of the scanning electron microscope and N2 adsorption/desorption examination affirmed that the prepared nanocomposite is permeable, which is an advantage for the efficient removal of contaminants. Optimal conditions for the batch removal process were investigated using a one-factor time approach in different conditions of adsorption (Dye concentration 50-200 mg L-1, pH 2-10, adsorbent mass 0.010-0.8, and contact time 5-180 min. The adsorption isotherm equilibrium data were examined by Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin, isotherm model. As shown by the correlation coefficient (R2), the data were best described by Langmuir isotherms with maximum adsorption capacities of 33 and 38 mg g─1 for methyl orange and methylene blue, respectively. Adsorption kinetic data were described using the pseudo-second-order model which suggests that adsorption of MO and MB was by chemisorption mechanism. The method was applicable to real wastewater samples, with satisfactory removal percentages of OM and MB (96 and 98 %).

The free-energy difference, - ΔF , of n-molecules and (n-1)-molecules plus a free probe has been calculated using the Bennett acceptance ratio with the aid of Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results show that the relation between the free-energy difference divided by kBT and the number of molecules to the power minus one-third is linear for n>6 . Consequently, the surface tension can be extracted from the straight line slope, whereas the vapor density can be extracted from the intercept, which is proportional to the logarithmic ratio of liquid density to that of vapor density. By scaling the free-energy differences, for at least three different temperatures, to TCT-1, we estimated the critical temperature and hence the surface tension and the vapor density at a wide range of temperatures.

Abnormalities within cerebellar circuits are thought to underlie the pathogenesis of ET, resulting in aberrant synchronous oscillatory activity within the thalamo-cortical network leading to tremors. Harmaline produces pathological oscillations within the cerebellum, and a tremor that phenotypically resembles ET. However, the neural network dynamics in cerebellar-thalamo-cortical circuits in harmaline-induced tremor remains unclear, including the way circuit interactions may be influenced by behavioural state. Here, we examined the effect of harmaline on cerebello-thalamo-cortical oscillations during rest and movement. EEG recordings from the sensorimotor cortex and local field potentials (LFP) from thalamic and medial cerebellar nuclei were simultaneously recorded in awake behaving rats, alongside measures of tremor using EMG and accelerometery. Analyses compared neural oscillations before and after systemic administration of harmaline (10 mg/kg, I.P), and coherence across periods when rats were resting vs. moving. During movement, harmaline increased the 9-15 Hz behavioural tremor amplitude and increased thalamic LFP coherence with tremor. Medial cerebellar nuclei and cerebellar vermis LFP coherence with tremor however remained unchanged from rest. These findings suggest harmaline-induced cerebellar oscillations are independent of behavioural state and associated changes in tremor amplitude. By contrast, thalamic oscillations are dependent on behavioural state and related changes in tremor amplitude. This study provides new insights into the role of cerebello-thalamo-cortical network interactions in tremor, whereby neural oscillations in thalamocortical, but not cerebellar circuits can be influenced by movement and/or behavioural tremor amplitude in the harmaline model.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"847",35965997,"An Expanded Framework for Situation Control.","There is an extensive body of literature on the topic of estimating situational states, in applications ranging from cyber-defense to military operations to traffic situations and autonomous cars. In the military/defense/intelligence literature, situation assessment seems to be the sine qua non for any research on surveillance and reconnaissance, command and control, and intelligence analysis. Virtually all of this work focuses on assessing the situation-at-the-moment; many if not most of the estimation techniques are based on Data and Information Fusion (DIF) approaches, with some recent schemes employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods. But estimating and recognizing situational conditions is most often couched in a decision-making, action-taking context, implying that actions may be needed so that certain goal situations will be reached as a result of such actions, or at least that progress toward such goal states will be made. This context thus frames the estimation of situational states in the larger context of a control-loop, with a need to understand the temporal evolution of situational states, not just a snapshot at a given time. Estimating situational dynamics requires the important functions of situation recognition, situation prediction, and situation understanding that are also central to such an integrated estimation + action-taking architecture. The varied processes for all of these combined capabilities lie in a closed-loop situation control framework, where the core operations of a stochastic control process involve situation recognition-learning-prediction-situation error assessment-and action taking to move the situation to a goal state. We propose several additional functionalities for this closed-loop control process in relation to some prior work on this topic, to include remarks on the integration of control-theoretic principles. Expanded remarks are also made on the state of the art of the schemas and computational technologies for situation recognition, prediction and understanding, as well as the roles for human intelligence in this larger framework.","misc","wim","misc"

Therefore, the two modalities are now integrated into a hybrid tool, EEG-fMRI, which encapsulates the useful properties of the two. Among other benefits, EEG-fMRI can contribute to a better understanding of brain connectivity and networks. This review lays its focus on the methodologies applied in performing EEG-fMRI studies, namely techniques used for the recording of EEG inside the scanner, artifact removal, and statistical analysis of the fMRI signal. We will investigate simultaneous resting-state and task-based EEG-fMRI studies and discuss their clinical and technological perspectives. Moreover, it is established that the brain regions affected by a task-based neural activity might not be limited to the regions in which they have been initiated. Advanced methods can help reveal the regions responsible for or affected by a developed neural network. Therefore, we have also looked into studies related to characterization of structure and dynamics of brain networks.

Mounting evidence has shown that pathogenic autoantibody targeting of the GluN1 subunit of NMDARs, as in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, leads to altered NMDAR trafficking and synaptic localization. However, the underlying signaling pathways affected by antibodies targeting the NMDAR remain to be fully delineated. It remains unclear whether patient antibodies influence synaptic transmission via direct effects on NMDAR channel function. Here, we show using short-term incubation that GluN1 antibodies derived from patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis label synapses in mature hippocampal primary neuron culture. Miniature spontaneous calcium transients (mSCaTs) mediated via NMDARs at synaptic spines are not altered in pathogenic GluN1 antibody exposed conditions. Unexpectedly, spine-based and cell-based analyses yielded distinct results. In addition, we show that calcium does not accumulate in neuronal spines following brief exposure to pathogenic GluN1 antibodies. Together, these findings show that pathogenic antibodies targeting NMDARs, under these specific conditions, do not alter synaptic calcium influx following neurotransmitter release. This represents a novel investigation of the molecular effects of anti-NMDAR antibodies associated with autoimmune encephalitis.","misc","wim","misc"

However, it is not clear whether TLR4 signaling is associated with the expression of MCP-1, CXCL1, and Cx43 in LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-treated rat dorsal spinal cord astrocytes under in vitro condition. In the present study, we found that TLR4 antagonist TAK-242 significantly inhibited LPS-induced MCP-1, CXCL1, and Cx43 expression, suggesting the role of TLR4 in response to LPS in cultured dorsal spinal cord astrocytes. Application of TAK-242 significantly blocked LPS-induced NF-κB and AP-1 activity and the expression of MCP-1, CXCL1 and Cx43. Furthermore, NF-κB inhibitor PDTC and AP-1 inhibitor SR11302 significantly blocked LPS-induced MCP-1, CXCL1, and Cx43 expression. DNA-binding activity of NF-κB, its effect on MCP-1 expression was suppressed by PDTC and SR11302. On the other hand, DNA-binding activity of AP-1, its effect on CXCL1 or Cx43 expression was also suppressed by PDTC and SR11302. In addition, PDTC was found to inhibit the nuclear translocation of AP-1 and the expression of c-Jun induced by LPS, which suggested that NF-κBp65 is essential for the AP-1 activity. Similarly, SR11302 significantly blocked LPS-induced the nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65 and the expression of NF-κBp65 induced by LPS. Pretreatment with CBX, Gap26, or Gap19 (Cx43 blockers) significantly inhibited abnormal astrocytic hemichannel opening and chemokines (MCP-1 and CXCL1) release in LPS-stimulated astrocytes. In summary, cell culture experiments revealed that LPS stimulation could evoke TLR4 signaling with the subsequent activation of NF-κB and AP-1, resulting in the expression of MCP-1, CXCL1, and Cx43.

"851",35966012,"Altered expression of vesicular glutamate transporter-2 and cleaved caspase-3 in the locus coeruleus of nerve-injured rats.","Neuropathic pain is a debilitating chronic condition provoked by a lesion in the nervous system and it induces functional alterations to the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC), affecting distinct dimensions of pain, like sensorial hypersensitivity, pain-induced depression, and anxiety. However, the neurobiological changes induced by nerve damage in the LC remain unclear. Here, we analyzed excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the LC, as well as the possible damage that noradrenergic neurons suffer after the induction of neuropathic pain through chronic constriction injury (CCI). Neuropathic pain was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 or 2 (VGLUT1 or VGLUT2), vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) was analyzed by immunofluorescence 7 (CCI7d) or 28 days after the original lesion (CCI28d). While no significant differences in the density of VGLUT1 puncta were evident, CCI7d induced a significant increase in the perisomatic VGLUT2/VGAT ratio relative to Sham-operated and CCI28d animals. By contrast, when the entire region of LC is evaluated, there was a significant reduction in the density of VGLUT2 puncta in CCI28d animals, without changes in VGLUT2/VGAT ratio relative to the CCI7d animals. Additionally, changes in the noradrenergic soma size, and a lower density of mitochondria and lysosomes were evident in CCI28d animals. Interestingly, enhanced expression of the apoptotic marker CC3 was also evident in the CCI28d rats, mainly co-localizing with glial fibrillary acidic protein but not with any neuronal or noradrenergic marker. Overall, short-term pain appears to lead to an increase of markers of excitatory synapses in the perisomatic region of noradrenergic cells in the LC, an effect that is lost after long-term pain, which appears to activate apoptosis.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"852",35966013,"Upregulation of Netrin-1 in the hippocampus mediates the formation of visceral hypersensitivity induced by maternal separation.","Early adverse life events (EALs), such as maternal separation (MS), can cause visceral hypersensitivity, which is thought to be a key pathophysiological mechanism of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Previous studies mainly focused on EALs-induced visceral hypersensitivity in adulthood but did not consider that it may have occurred in the preadult period. We previously found that rats who experienced MS suffered from visceral hypersensitivity starting from the post-weaning period. Moreover, the hippocampus is considered to be critical in regulating the formation of visceral hypersensitivity induced by MS. But the underlying mechanisms throughout different life periods are unclear. In this study, behavioral tests, RNA-seq, lentiviral interference, and molecular biology techniques were applied to investigate the molecular mechanism in the hippocampus underlying MS-induced long-lasting visceral hypersensitivity. It was found that both visceral sensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors were significantly increased in MS rats in post-weaning, prepubertal, and adult periods, especially in the prepubertal period. Subsequently, RNA-seq targeting the hippocampus identified that the expression level of Netrin-1 was significantly increased in all periods, which was further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Knocking-down hippocampal Netrin-1 in the post-weaning period by lentivirus interference alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors of MS rats in the later phase of life. In addition, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), instead of neogenin-1(Neo-1) or uncoordinated (UNC5), was proved to be the specific functional receptor of Netrin-1 in regulating visceral hypersensitivity, whose upregulation may result in the most severe symptoms in the prepubertal period. Furthermore, the activation of the Netrin-1/DCC pathway could enhance long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, probably via recruitment of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, which finally resulted in the formation of visceral hypersensitivity. These novel findings suggest that long-lasting over-expression of Netrin-1 can mediate visceral hypersensitivity and anxiety disorder from the post-weaning period to adulthood by activating DCC/GluA1 pathway in the hippocampus. Moreover, early intervention of Netrin-1 in the post-weaning period could lead to significant symptom relief afterward, which provides evidence that the Netrin-1/DCC/GluA1 signaling pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of visceral hypersensitivity in clinics.","misc","wim","rodent"
"853",35966015,"Immunological and prognostic analysis of PSENEN in low-grade gliomas: An immune infiltration-related prognostic biomarker.","Metformin is widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and plays a role in antitumor and antiobesity processes. A recent study identified its direct molecular target, PEN2 (PSENEN). PSENEN is the minimal subunit of the multiprotein complex γ-secretase, which promotes the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into astrocytes in the central nervous system. This study was mainly based on gene expression data and clinical data from the TCGA and CGGA databases. Analysis of differential expression of PSENEN between tissues from 31 cancers and paracancerous tissues revealed that it had high expression levels in most cancers except 2 cancers. Using univariate Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, a high expression level of PSENEN was shown to be a risk factor in low-grade gliomas (LGG). Gene ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analyses indicated that PSENEN is widely involved in immune-related signaling pathways in LGG. PSENEN expression level was significantly associated with TMB, MSI, tumor stemness index, and the expression levels of immunomodulatory genes in LGG. Finally, immune infiltration analysis revealed that PSENEN level was associated with the presence of various immune infiltrating cells, among which PSENEN was strongly associated with the presence of M2 macrophages and played a synergistic pro-cancer role. In conclusion, PSENEN may partially influence prognosis by modulating immune infiltration in patients with LGG, and PSENEN may be a candidate prognostic biomarker for determining prognosis associated with immune infiltration in LGG.","misc","wim","misc"

In the setting of chronic inflammatory conditions, the activation of the melastatin family member 8 (TRPM8), the TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), and the TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is correlated with pain hypersensitivity reactions. Monoterpenes, among which pulegone and menthol, a major class of phytocompounds present in essential oils of medicinal plants, are known modulators of those TRP channels activity. In the present review, we correlate the monoterpene content of plants with their historical therapeutic properties. We then describe how monoterpenes exert their anti-inflammatory and antihyperalgesia effects through modulation of TRP channels activity. Finally, we discuss the importance and the potential of characterizing new plant extracts and reassessing studied plant extracts for the development of ethnopharmacology-based innovative treatments for chronic pain. This review suggests that monoterpene solutions, based on composition from traditional healing herbs, offer an interesting avenue for the development of new phytotherapeutic treatments to alleviate chronic inflammatory pain conditions.","misc","wim","misc"
"855",35966018,"Role of Eryptosis in Hemorrhagic Stroke.","Erythrocytes undergo certain morphological changes resembling apoptosis during senescence or in an abnormal state/site, which is termed eryptosis. This process is characterized by phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, membrane blebbing, and cell shrinkage. Eryptotic erythrocytes are subsequently removed via macrophage-mediated efferocytosis. In hemorrhagic stroke (HS), blood within an artery rapidly bleeds into the brain tissue or the subarachnoid space, resulting in severe neurological deficits. A hypoxic, over-oxidative, and pro-inflammatory microenvironment in the hematoma leads to oxidative stress, hyperosmotic shock, energy depletion, and Cl- removal in erythrocytes, which eventually triggers eryptosis. In addition, eryptosis following intracerebral hemorrhage favors hematoma clearance, which sheds light on a common mechanism of intrinsic phagocytosis. In this review, we summarized the canonical mechanisms of eryptosis and discussed its pathological conditions associated with HS. Understanding the role of eryptosis in HS may uncover additional potential interventions for further translational clinical research.","misc","wim","misc"

Traditional transgenic AD mouse models which were widely used in the past decades share a common limitation: The overexpression of APP and overproduction of amyloid-beta (Aβ) are accompanied by other APP peptide fragments, which could introduce artificial and non-clinically relevant phenotypes. Here, we performed an in-depth and time-resolved behavioral and metabolic characterization of a clinically relevant AD mouse model engineered to express normal physiological levels of APP harboring humanized Swedish (K670N/M671L), Beyreuther/Iberian (I716F), and Arctic (E693G) mutations (App NL-G-F/NL-G-F ), termed APP knock-in (APPKI) mice. Our result showed that APPKI mice exhibited fear learning deficits at 6-m age and contextual memory deficit at 12-m age. Histopathological analysis revealed mild amyloidosis (6E10) accompanied by microgliosis (Iba1) as early as 3 months, which progressed significantly together with significant astrocytosis at 6 and 12 m. We further analyzed hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction by multiple assays, while 3-m APPKI mice brain mitochondrial function remains a similar level as WT mice. Significant mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by decreased ATP production and higher membrane potential with subsequent overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in mitochondria isolated from 7-m APPKI mice hippocampal tissue. Morphologically, these mitochondria were larger in volume with a decreased level of mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin-2 (MFN2). At 12 months, APPKI mice exhibit a significantly decreased total mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in isolated hippocampal mitochondria detected by high-resolution respirometry. These data indicate early mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain at pre-symptomatic age in the App NL-G-F/NL-G-mice, which may play a key role in the progression of the disease. Moreover, the identified behavioral and bioenergetic alterations in this clinically relevant AD mouse model provide a valuable tool to optimize the temporal component for therapeutic interventions to treat AD.","rodent","wim","rodent"

People that use illicit drugs may have elevated risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 given their high prevalence of underlying medical conditions, including respiratory and pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions, diabetes, and compromised immune systems. Despite a widespread distribution on the Italian territory, a large presence of health personnel and a long-standing experience in vaccinations, addiction clinics have yet to be involved in the vaccination campaign against COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the beliefs of drug users attending some Italian addiction clinics, in order to envisage any vaccine administration strategies involving the services themselves. A questionnaire used for the Italian general population to investigate the relative importance of some factors in influencing the propensity to vaccinate against COVID-19, was administrated to drug users in a multicenter survey. The majority of respondents expressed general confidence in vaccines and a good willingness to undergo vaccination. Given strong peer networks, high coverage of treatment and harm reduction interventions, Italian public addiction clinics could play a strategic role in administering the vaccine in this hard-to-reach population, usefully aiding the global campaign against the virus.","misc","wim","misc"

However, not all patients that could benefit from fertility preservation can use the currently available technology. In this regard, obtaining functional mature oocytes from ovarian cortical tissue in vitro would represent a major breakthrough in fertility preservation as well as in human medically assisted reproduction. In this study, we have used a microfluidics platform to culture cryopreserved-thawed human cortical tissue for a period of 8 days and evaluated the effect of two different flow rates in follicular activation and growth. The results showed that this dynamic system supported follicular development up to the secondary stage within 8 days, albeit with low efficiency. Surprisingly, the stromal cells in the ovarian cortical tissue were highly sensitive to flow and showed high levels of apoptosis when cultured under high flow rate. Moreover, after 8 days in culture, the stromal compartment showed increase levels of collagen deposition, in particular in static culture. Although microfluidics dynamic platforms have great potential to simulate tissue-level physiology, this system still needs optimization to meet the requirements for an efficient in vitro early follicular growth.","misc","wim","misc"

A total of 1017 Inpatients with new-onset diabetes of five hospitals in Eastern China were included in the study. Clustering analysis was used to cluster the data into five subgroups according to six basic variables. The differences in clinical characteristics, treatments, and the prevalence of diabetes-related diseases among the five subgroups were analyzed by multiple groups comparisons and pairwise comparisons. The risk of diabetes-related diseases in the five subgroups was compared by calculating odd ratio (OR). P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Five subgroups were obtained by clustering analysis with the highest proportion of patients with severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD) 451 (44.35%), followed by patients with mild age-related diabetes (MARD) 236 (23.21%), patients with mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD) 207 (20.35%), patients with severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD) 81 (7.96%), and patients with severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID) 42 (4.13%). Five subtypes had their own unique characteristics and treatments. The prevalence and risk of diabetes-related complications and comorbidities were also significantly different among the five subtypes. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) was the most common in SIRD group. Patients in SIDD, SIRD, and MARD groups were more likely to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or stroke, diabetic peripheral vascular disease (DPVD), and diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN). The prevalence and risk of metabolic syndrome (MS) were the highest in MOD and SIRD groups. Patients in SAID group had the highest prevalence and risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Patients with MOD were more likely to develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The inpatients with new-onset diabetes in Eastern China had the unique clustering distribution. The clinical characteristics, treatments, and diabetes-related complications and comorbidities of the five subgroups were different, which may provide the basis for precise treatments of diabetes.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Many controversies surround the treatment method of T1N0M0 PTC. Recently, thermal ablation (TA) has shown some benefits in the treatment of PTC patients, but the safety and efficacy of its treatment remain controversial. This article performs a meta-analysis of TA in patients with T1aN0M0 and T1bN0M0 PTC. The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for retrospective or prospective studies of TA for treating patients with T1N0M0 PTC from the database establishment to May 1, 2022. Data on volume reduction rate (VRR), disease progress, and complication rate were collected. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed using the Stata 12.0 and Review Manager 5.3. A total of 9 eligible studies were included. Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of VRR and disease progress. The VRR was reduced after 3 months (-75.90%; 95% CI [-118.46-33.34%]), 6 months (34.33%; 95% CI [15.01-53.65%]), 12 months (78.69%; 95% CI [71.69-85.68%]), and 24 months (89.97%; 95% CI [84.00-95.94%]). The disease progress was 1.9% (95% CI [1.1-3.0]). Safety is justified by the complication rate, which was 6.5% (95% CI [3.5-10.2]). Pain and hoarseness were the most common complications, and no life-threatening complications were reported. Egger's test demonstrated that publication bias was acceptable.

The clinical information and blood samples were collected by trained interviewers and nurses. Genotyping of SNPs was conducted on the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Statistical analyses including t-test, ANOVA, chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression were performed. Differences in age, pre-pregnant body mass index (BMI), and family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) between the case and control groups were significant (p < 0.05). Compared with the wild-type genotype, pregnant women with genotypes of rs4506565-AT (OR = 1.89, 95%CI: 1.18-3.02), rs7895340 GA (OR = 1.93, 95%CI: 1.06-3.54), rs7901695-TC (OR = 1.79, 95%CI: 1.11-2.88), and rs11196205-GC (OR = 2.15, 95%CI: 1.16-3.98) had a significantly higher risk of GDM, adjusted by age, pre-pregnant BMI, and family history of T2DM. Functional annotation showed that all these four SNPs fell in the functional elements of human pancreatic islets. Further cumulative effects analysis concluded that when participants carried all these four risk genotypes, the risk of GDM was 3.51 times (OR = 3.51, 95%CI: 1.38-8.90) than that of those without any risk genotypes. The findings of this study suggested that rs4506565, rs7895340, rs7901695, and rs11196205 were the genetic susceptibility SNPs of GDM in the central Chinese population.

To more definitively identify these alterations, we evaluated the maternal and infant gut microbiota through the shotgun metagenomic analysis of a subset of stool specimens collected from a randomized, controlled trial in diet-controlled women with GDM. The women were fed either a CHOICE diet (60% complex carbohydrate/25% fat/15% protein, n=18) or a conventional diet (CONV, 40% complex carbohydrate/45% fat/15% protein, n=16) from 30 weeks' gestation through delivery. In contrast to other published studies, we designed the study to minimize the influence of other dietary sources by providing all meals, which were eucaloric and similar in fiber content. At 30 and 37 weeks' gestation, we collected maternal stool samples; performed the fasting measurements of glucose, glycerol, insulin, free fatty acids, and triglycerides; and administered an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to measure glucose clearance and insulin response. Infant stool samples were collected at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4-5 months of age. Maternal glucose was controlled to conventional targets in both diets, with no differences in Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). No differences in maternal alpha or beta diversity between the two diets from baseline to 37 weeks' gestation were observed. However, women on CHOICE diet had higher levels of Bifidobacteriaceae, specifically Bifidobacterium adolescentis, compared with women on CONV. Species-level taxa varied significantly with fasting glycerol, fasting glucose, and glucose AUC after the OGTT challenge. Maternal diet significantly impacted the patterns of infant colonization over the first 4 months of life, with CHOICE infants showing increased microbiome alpha diversity (richness), greater Clostridiaceae, and decreased Enterococcaceae over time. Overall, these results suggest that an isocaloric GDM diet containing greater complex carbohydrates with reduced fat leads to an ostensibly beneficial effect on the maternal microbiome, improved infant gut microbiome diversity, and reduced opportunistic pathogens capable of playing a role in obesity and immune system development. These results highlight the critical role a maternal diet has in shaping the maternal and infant microbiome in women with GDM.","misc","wim","randomized_trial"

A clinically convenient, non-invasive approach for monitoring the development of DKD would benefit the overall life quality of patients with DM and contribute to lower medical burdens through promoting preventive interventions. We utilized 5hmC-Seal to profile genome-wide 5-hydroxymethylcytosines in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Candidate genes were identified by intersecting the differentially hydroxymethylated genes and differentially expressed genes from the GSE30528 and GSE30529. Then, a protein interaction network was constructed for the candidate genes, and the hub genes were identified by the MCODE and cytoHubba algorithm. The correlation analysis between the hydroxymethylation level of the hub genes and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was carried out. Finally, we demonstrated differences in expression levels of the protein was verified by constructing a mouse model of DKD. In addition, we constructed a network of interactions between drugs and hub genes using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. This study found that there were significant differences in the overall distribution of 5hmC in plasma of patients with DKD, and an alteration of hydroxymethylation levels in genomic regions involved in inflammatory pathways which participate in the immune response. The final 5 hub genes, including (CTNNB1, MYD88, CD28, VCAM1, CD44) were confirmed. Further analysis indicated that this 5-gene signature showed a good capacity to distinguish between DKD and DM, and was found that protein levels were increased in renal tissue of DKD mice. Correlation analysis indicated that the hydroxymethylation level of 5 hub genes were nagatively correlated with eGFR. Toxicogenomics analysis showed that a variety of drugs for the treatment of DKD can reduce the expression levels of 4 hub genes (CD44, MYD88, VCAM1, CTNNB1). The 5hmC-Seal assay was successfully applied to the plasma cfDNA samples from a cohort of DM patients with or without DKD. Altered 5hmC signatures indicate that 5hmC-Seal has the potential to be a non-invasive epigenetic tool for monitoring the development of DKD and it provides new insight for the future molecularly targeted anti-inflammation therapeutic strategies of DKD.","misc","wim","rodent"

We followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The databases were searched for studies published through November 2021 that measured physical performance in adults with sarcopenic obesity. Most of the studies applied a strength training protocol in which improvement was noted post-treatment on the Time Chair Rise (TCR), 30-s Chair Stand, and Single Leg Stance (SLS) tests. Discrepancies between the studies were observed when resistance training was combined with or without elastic bands or electromyostimulation, as measured with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Physical Performance Test (PPT), Gait Speed, and Timed Up & Go (TUG) test. Post-intervention SPPB, PPT, and gait speed scores showed an increase or maintenance of performance, while TUG test scores were higher according to one study but lower according to another. Engagement in physical exercise, and resistance training in particular, can improve or maintain physical performance in adults with sarcopenic obesity. Study samples should include more men. A future area of focus should be the impact of different types of training (aerobic, power training, combined modalities).

Our research covered three separate time points of hospitalization (days 1, 4, and 10). We did not exclude patients treated with glucocorticoids but, instead, compared them with patients not treated with steroids. We correlated the results of thyroid function tests with markers of systemic inflammation. We checked if abnormal thyroid function can predict unfavorable outcomes defined as combined primary endpoint and/or secondary endpoints; the combined primary endpoint was the occurrence of death, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressor infusion, or prolonged hospital stay, and the secondary endpoint was any of the listed events. In general, 80.46% of evaluated patients displayed abnormalities in thyroid function tests over at least one time point throughout the observation. We noticed a high prevalence of features typical for thyroid dysfunction in non-thyroidal illness (NTI). Free triiodothyronine (fT3) concentration was significantly lower in the group requiring glucocorticoids. Patients displaying abnormal thyroid function were statistically more likely to meet the predefined combined primary endpoint. We found that fT3 measured at admission could be perceived as an independent predictor of endpoint completion for all analyzed groups. Thyroid involvement is common in COVID-19.

The majority are benign and non-functioning and therefore do not require immediate treatment. In contrast, the rare adrenal malignant tumors are often highly aggressive and with poor prognosis. Besides usually being detected in advanced stages, often already with metastases, one of the reasons of the unfavorable outcome of the patients with adrenal cancer is the absence of effective treatments. Autophagy is one of the intracellular pathways targeted by several classes of chemotherapeutics. Mitotane, the most commonly used drug for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma, was recently shown to also modulate autophagy. Autophagy is a continuous programmed cellular process which culminates with the degradation of cellular organelles and proteins. However, being a dynamic mechanism, understanding the autophagic flux can be highly complex. The role of autophagy in cancer has been described paradoxically: initially described as a tumor pro-survival mechanism, different studies have been showing that it may result in other outcomes, namely in tumor cell death. In adrenal tumors, this dual role of autophagy has also been addressed in recent years. Studies reported both induction and inhibition of autophagy as a treatment strategy of adrenal malignancies. Importantly, most of these studies were performed using cell lines. Consequently clinical studies are still required. In this review, we describe what is known about the role of autophagy modulation in treatment of adrenal tumors. We will also highlight the aspects that need further evaluation to understand the paradoxical role of autophagy in adrenal tumors.","misc","wim","misc"

The logistic regression was adopted to investigate the relationships between various durations of diabetes and the control rates of achieving the control targets for T2DM as well as diabetic vascular complications. There were 972, 896, 875 and 1097 patients with a duration of diabetes of <1, 1~5, 5~10 and ≥10 years, respectively. In logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, BMI, smoking and family history of diabetes, elderly T2DM patients with a duration of diabetes of ≥10 years were more likely to reach the comprehensive control targets for TC (ORTC = 1.36, 95% CI =1.14-1.63), LDL-C (ORLDL-C = 1.39, 95% CI =1.17-1.66), TG (ORTG = 1.76, 95% CI =1.46-2.12) and BMI (ORBMI = 1.82, 95% CI =1.52-2.18). Elderly T2DM patients with a duration of diabetes of 1~5 years were more likely to achieve the HbA1c control target (ORHbA1c = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.59-2.31) than elderly T2DM patients with a duration of diabetes of <1 year. Furthermore, in elderly T2DM patients with a duration of diabetes of 5~10 years or ≥ 10 years, the duration of diabetes was positively associated with diabetic macrovascular complications (coronary heart disease and peripheral artery disease). In elderly T2DM patients with a duration of diabetes of over 10 years, the duration of diabetes was associated with diabetes kidney disease (all P < 0.05). It is worth noting that the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes in different durations of diabetes are different.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Bone is considered an endocrine organ, playing an emerging role in regulating glucose and energy metabolism. Accumulating research has proven that bone-derived hormones are involved in glucose metabolism and the pathogenesis of DM complications, especially DKD. Furthermore, these hormones are considered to be promising predictors and prospective treatment targets for DM and DKD. In this review, we focused on bone-derived hormones, including fibroblast growth factor 23, osteocalcin, sclerostin, and lipocalin 2, and summarized their role in regulating glucose metabolism and DKD.","misc","wim","misc"

The preliminary results have demonstrated its efficacy in body-weight control. However, the low quality of available trials limited its application. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LAS in body-weight control by using a randomized, parallel, sham-controlled clinical trial design. This was a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial including 84 adult participants (18-60 years) with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 24 kg/m2 conducted in three general hospitals in Shanghai, China. Participants were equally assigned to receive LAS or sham LAS (SLAS) once per 10 days, eight times in total. After completion, an additional intervention with a 3-month follow-up period was set to examine the continued effect of LAS. The primary outcome was the change in body weight from baseline to treatment endpoint within the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Secondary outcomes contained changes in waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), lipid metabolism, and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues. From 14 May 2018 to 03 November 2019, 84 participants out of 201 screened individuals met the eligibility criteria, were randomized, and were analyzed (42 participants in each group). From baseline to treatment endpoint, the body-weight reduction in the LAS group was significantly larger than in the sham control (net difference: 1.57 kg, 95% CI: 0.29-2.86, p = 0.012). The superior weight reduction effect persisted in the follow-up period (net difference: 3.20 kg, 95% CI: 1.17-5.21, p = 0.001). LAS therapy also showed improvement in triglyceride and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) compared with sham control. One participant in the LAS group reported a slightly uncomfortable and tingling sensation after the additional intervention. No other adverse events (AEs) were documented. LAS, a modified acupuncture technique, is safe and effective in body-weight control. It could be used as an alternative choice to classical acupuncture for obesity management.

Interestingly, recent studies indicate light pollution is a novel environmental risk factor for chronic kidney disease. However, the impact of light pollution on obesity-related kidney disease remains largely unknown, with its underlying mechanism insufficiently explained. Renal hypoxia induced factor 1α (HIF1α) is critical in the development of glomerulosclerosis and renal fibrosis. The present study explored effects of constant light exposure on high fat diet (HFD) -induced renal injury and its association with HIF1α signal pathway. Thirty-two male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups according to diet (HFD or normal chow diet) and light cycles (light/dark or constant light). After 16 weeks treatment, rats were sacrificed and pathophysiological assessments were performed. In normal chow fed rats, constant light exposure led to glucose abnormalities and dyslipidemia. In HFD fed rats, constant light exposure exacerbated obesity, glucose abnormalities, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, renal functional decline, proteinuria, glomerulomegaly, renal inflammation and fibrosis. And, constant light exposure caused an increase in HIF1α and a decrease in prolyl hydroxylase domain 1 (PHD1) and PHD2 expression in kidneys of HFD-fed rats. Then, we demonstrated that BMAL1 bound directly to the promoters of PHD1 in mouse podocyte clone 5 cell line (MPC5) by ChIP assays. In conclusion, chronic constant light exposure aggravates HFD-induced renal injuries in rats, and it is associated with activation of HIF1α signal pathway.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Kisspeptin affects trophoblastic migration and has antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of kisspeptin in the fetal-placental dysfunction of hypothyroid Wistar rats. Hypothyroidism was induced by daily administration of propylthiouracil. Kisspeptin-10 (Kp-10) treatment was performed every other day or daily beginning on day 8 of gestation. Feto-placental development, placental histomorphometry, and expression levels of growth factors (VEGF, PLGF, IGF1, IGF2, and GLUT1), hormonal (Dio2) and inflammatory mediators (TNFα, IL10, and IL6), markers of hypoxia (HIF1α) and oxidative damage (8-OHdG), antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, Cat, and GPx1), and endoplasmic reticulum stress mediators (ATF4, GRP78, and CHOP) were evaluated on day 18 of gestation. Daily treatment with Kp-10 increased free T3 and T4 levels and improved fetal weight. Both treatments reestablished the glycogen cell population in the junctional zone. Daily treatment with Kp-10 increased the gene expression levels of Plgf, Igf1, and Glut1 in the placenta of hypothyroid animals, in addition to blocking the increase in 8-OHdG and increasing protein and/or mRNA expression levels of SOD1, Cat, and GPx1. Daily treatment with Kp-10 did not alter the higher protein expression levels of VEGF, HIF1α, IL10, GRP78, and CHOP caused by hypothyroidism in the junctional zone compared to control, nor the lower expression of Dio2 caused by hypothyroidism. However, in the labyrinth zone, this treatment restored the expression of VEGF and IL10 and reduced the GRP78 and CHOP immunostaining. These findings demonstrate that daily treatment with Kp-10 improves fetal development and placental morphology in hypothyroid rats, blocks placental oxidative damage, and increases the expression of growth factors and antioxidant enzymes in the placenta.","rodent","wim","rodent"

However, the underlying mechanism have long remained elusive, despite its profound biological and agricultural significance. In the current study, the reciprocal crossing between White Leghorns and Beijing You chickens were performed to measure the sexual maturation heterosis, and the ovary lncRNAs and mRNAs of purebreds and crossbreeds were profiled to illustrate molecular mechanism of heterosis. Heterosis larger than 20% was found for pubic space and oviduct length, whereas age at first egg showed negative heterosis in both crossbreeds. We identified 1170 known lncRNAs and 1994 putative lncRNAs in chicken ovary using a stringent pipeline. Gene expression pattern showed that nonadditivity was predominant, and the proportion of nonadditive lncRNAs and genes was similar between two crossbreeds, ranging from 44.24% to 49.15%. A total of 200 lncRNAs and 682 genes were shared by two crossbreeds, respectively. GO and KEGG analysis showed that the common genes were significantly enriched in the cell cycle, animal organ development, gonad development, ECM-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway and GnRH signaling pathway. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified that 7 out of 20 co-expressed lncRNA-mRNA modules significantly correlated with oviduct length and pubic space. Interestingly, genes harbored in seven modules were also enriched in the similar biological process and pathways, in which nonadditive lncRNAs, such as MSTRG.17017.1 and MSTRG.6475.20, were strongly associated with nonadditive genes, such as CACNA1C and TGFB1 to affect gonad development and GnRH signaling pathway, respectively. Moreover, the results of real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) correlated well with the transcriptome data. Integrated with positive heterosis of serum GnRH and melatonin content detected in crossbreeds, we speculated that nonadditive genes involved in the GnRH signaling pathway elevated the gonad development, leading to the sexual maturation heterosis. We characterized a systematic landscape of ovary lncRNAs and mRNAs related to sexual maturation heterosis in chicken. The quantitative exploration of hybrid transcriptome changes lays foundation for genetic improvement of sexual maturation traits and provides insights into endocrine control of sexual maturation.","misc","wim","misc"

High-income North America (9.5 [2.7 to 18.8]) and Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa (2.0 [0.5 to 4.2]) had the highest and lowest regional age-standardized death rates, respectively, for cancers attributable to HFPG. In 2019, the global number of attributable cancer DALYs were highest in 65-69 age group. Moreover, there was an overall positive association between SDI and the regional age-standardized DALY rate for HFPG-attributable cancers. HFPG was associated with more burden in 2019.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis gathers available evidence on the emerging role of IL1β in T2DM. PubMed and Embase were searched for human studies that assessed 1L1β in T2DM individuals from 2016-2021. Thirteen studies (N=2680; T2DM=1182, controls=1498) out of 523 were included in the systematic review and only 3 studies in the meta-analysis. Assays were the most commonly used quantification method and lipopolysaccharides as the most common stimulator for IL1β upregulation. Random and fixed effects meta-analysis showed non-significant mean differences of IL1β concentrations between the T2DM and controls. Given the high heterogeneity and small subset of studies included, caution is advised in the interpretation of results. The present systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the limited evidence available that could implicate 1L1β as a potent biomarker for T2DM.

Due to its multifactorial etiology, its treatment requires several actions, including dietary intervention and physical exercise. Excessive fat accumulation leads to several health problems involving alteration in the gut-microbiota-brain axis. This axis is characterized by multiple biological systems generating a network that allows bidirectional communication between intestinal bacteria and brain. This mutual communication maintains the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal, central nervous and microbial systems of animals. Moreover, this axis involves inflammatory, neural, and endocrine mechanisms, contributes to obesity pathogenesis. The axis also acts in appetite and satiety control and synthesizing hormones that participate in gastrointestinal functions. Exercise is a nonpharmacologic agent commonly used to prevent and treat obesity and other chronic degenerative diseases. Besides increasing energy expenditure, exercise induces the synthesis and liberation of several muscle-derived myokines and neuroendocrine peptides such as neuropeptide Y, peptide YY, ghrelin, and leptin, which act directly on the gut-microbiota-brain axis. Thus, exercise may serve as a rebalancing agent of the gut-microbiota-brain axis under the stimulus of chronic low-grade inflammation induced by obesity. So far, there is little evidence of modification of the gut-brain axis as a whole, and this narrative review aims to address the molecular pathways through which exercise may act in the context of disorders of the gut-brain axis due to obesity.","misc","wim","misc"

The aim of this study was to describe the movement characteristics performed during exercise in custom-designed exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises among patients who have undergone unilateral total knee replacement (TKR). In addition, the secondary aim was to assess the relation of these exercise methods, and to assess participants' perceived exertion and knee pain during exergaming and exercising. Patients up to 4 months after the TKR surgery were invited in a single-visit exercise laboratory session. A 2D motion analysis and force plates were employed to evaluate movement characteristics as the volume, range, and intensity of movement performed during custom-designed knee extension-flexion and weight shifting exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises post TKR. The perceived exertion and knee pain were assessed using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion and Visual Analog Scale, respectively. Evaluation of seven patients with TKR [age median (IQR), 65 (10) years] revealed that the volume and intensity of movement were mostly higher during exergames. Individual goniometer-measured knee range of motion were achieved either with exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises, especially in knee extension exercises. The perceived exertion and knee pain were similar after exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises. During custom-designed exergaming the patients with TKR achieve the movement characteristics appropriate for post-TKR rehabilitation without increasing the stress and pain experienced even though the movement characteristics might be partly different from conventional therapeutic exercises by the volume and intensity of movement. Physical therapists could consider implementing such exergames in rehabilitation practice for patients with TKR once effectiveness have been approved and they are widely available.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Therefore, understanding stress related experiences in the context of professional sport would help design appropriate stress management interventions for effective coping. The overarching aim of this research was to assess occupational stress related experiences among players and coaches in the Ghana premier league. The study sought to assess: (1) the prevalence and sources of stressors among players and coaches, and (2) how age and years of experience influenced the stressors they experienced. Using a census survey, 44 premier league coaches and 424 players who were officially registered by 17 premier league clubs completed the intensity dimension of the Organizational Stressor Indicator for Sport Performers which has 5 subscales namely: Goals and Development, Logistics and Operations, Team and Culture, Coaching and Selection. Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviation) and multivariate analysis of variance were used to analyze the data. The results revealed that stressors were prevalent among football players and coaches, with these being significantly more dominant among coaches, p < 0.001. Selection was identified as the most predominant stressor for coaches (i.e., selecting players to play) and players (i.e., being selected). Age and experience were found not to be significant predictors of stressors for players and coaches in Ghana. Findings suggest that generally, stressors are common among football players and coaches, especially on issues related to selection.

Scheimpflug imaging and densitometry analysis were performed in order to quantify the severity of the scar, however, there was significant difficulty in acquiring densitometry data. During a subsequent follow-up visit to monitor the scar, standardized room lighting and a neutral density filter were used to obtain reproducible and reliable imaging for densitometry analysis. The corneal scar was monitored over time using this standardized imaging protocol and by densitometry analysis minimal progression of the scar was evident, suggesting that recently documented significant vision loss in the left eye could not be attributed solely to changes in the scar.

Rat CellSaics (rCellSaics) were produced by rat bone marrow-derived MSC (rBMSCs). The secretion potential of neurotrophic factors and the cell proliferation rate were compared under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. rCellSaics, rBMSCs, or saline were transplanted into the hollow cavity of a rat chronic ICH model. Functional and histological analyses were evaluated, and single-photon emission computed tomography for benzodiazepine receptors was performed to monitor sequential changes in neuronal integrity. Furthermore, human CellSaics (hCellSaics) were transplanted into a chronic ICH model in immunodeficient rats. Antibodies neutralizing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were used to elucidate its mode of action. rCellSaics demonstrated a higher secretion potential of trophic factors and showed better cell proliferation in the OGD condition. Animals receiving rCellSaics displayed better neurological recovery, higher intracerebral BDNF, and better cell engraftment; they also showed a tendency for less brain atrophy and higher benzodiazepine receptor preservation. hCellSaics also promoted significant functional recovery, which was reversed by BDNF neutralization.

Due to the 2 parameters of this diagnostic system, chronic rhinosinusitis is to be divided to 4 groups and some patients fall into the 2 groups other than ECRS and NECRS: probable ECRS (pECRS) and probable non-ECRS (pNECRS). We attempted to clarify clinical and histopathological similarities and differences, especially concerning major basic protein (MBP), among those groups. One hundred twenty-eight patients treated by endoscopic sinus surgery was included. Clinical characteristics were compared among each group, and immunohistological analysis for MBP was performed to 35 randomly selected patients. MBP deposition at intra mucosal epithelium was evaluated by semiquantificational approach. ECRS patients showed significantly higher comorbidity rate with allergic rhinitis (36 patients, 78.3%), asthma (36 patients, 78.3%) compared with other groups. Also, percentage of the patients complaining olfactory dysfunction (42 patients, 91.3%) was significantly higher (p < 0.001). Lund-Mackay score (mean, 14.5; 6-24) and recurrence rate (27 patients, 61.4%) was the highest in ECRS patients. Regarding pECRS, the number of patients with olfactory dysfunction (5 patients, 55.6%) was higher than pNECRS and NECRS groups. Also, comorbidity of asthma and percentage of blood eosinophils tended to be higher than those 2 groups. MBP score of pECRS group was significantly higher than NECRS (p < 0.05), despite of smaller tissue eosinophil counts. pECRS might share some characteristics with ECRS although tissue eosinophil count was significantly smaller compared with ECRS.

Review of charts were done. The demographic and clinical profile used a descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation for quantitative data and frequency and percent for categorical data. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to measure the degree of the relationship of CD4 count and DHRs. A total of 337 eligible patients were included. There was a 25% incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. However, the prevalence of DHRs across the different CD4 groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.167). Likewise, the study found no significant association between the CD4 count and DHRs to first-line HAART, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, and antitubercular agents (p = 0.311). The most common DHR was morbilliform rash, and nevirapine was the most reported antiretroviral drug causing DHR. There was no association in the CD4 count and DHRs to first-line HAART, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, and antitubercular agents. Hence, regardless of the baseline CD4 lymphocyte count, the physician should be vigilant in monitoring hypersensitivity reactions. Patient education on common DHRs is very important upon diagnosis of HIV and/or initiation of treatment.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

However, the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have limited social contact to protect vulnerable groups in care homes, and even if technology use has increased in other areas, there is little known about the potential uptake of communication technology and changes in social interaction in the care context during a lasting crisis. This paper explores changes in communication technology use triggered by the pandemic at two care homes, using a qualitative diary study, online interviews and observations, and in-situ interviews within the care home with residents and workers. Our findings point to increasing use of tablets and video conference software triggered by COVID-related experiences, with implications for living and working in care homes. We also characterise the isolation experience of the residents, the workers' concerns about the residents and changes in social interaction. We observed new areas of technology usage, associated changing work practices, technical affinity issues and context-specific attitudes towards future technologies. While the pandemic has triggered the use of communication technology in care homes on a small scale, this has also caused increasing workload and in particular articulation work, which requires support structures and the re-definition of work roles.","misc","wim","misc"

Good SC adherence and survival in conduit tubes across various studies was observed. Improvement in morphological and functional outcomes with the use of SCs in long gap peripheral nerve injuries was observed in nearly all studies. Based on contemporary literature, SCs have demonstrated clear potential in the repair of peripheral nerve injury in animal studies. It has yet to be determined which nerve conduit or graft will prove superior for delivery and retention of SCs for nerve regeneration.

"895",35966200,"Microbial neuraminidase induces TLR4-dependent long-term immune priming in the brain.","Innate immune memory explains the plasticity of immune responses after repeated immune stimulation, leading to either enhanced or suppressed immune responses. This process has been extensively reported in peripheral immune cells and also, although modestly, in the brain. Here we explored two relevant aspects of brain immune priming: its persistence over time and its dependence on TLR receptors. For this purpose, we used an experimental paradigm consisting in applying two inflammatory stimuli three months apart. Wild type, toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and TLR2 mutant strains were used. The priming stimulus was the intracerebroventricular injection of neuraminidase (an enzyme that is present in various pathogens able to provoke brain infections), which triggers an acute inflammatory process in the brain. The second stimulus was the intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (a TLR4 ligand) or Pam3CSK4 (a TLR2 ligand). One day after the second inflammatory challenge the immune response in the brain was examined. In wild type mice, microglial and astroglial density, as well as the expression of 4 out of 5 pro-inflammatory genes studied (TNFα, IL1β, Gal-3, and NLRP3), were increased in mice that received the double stimulus compared to those exposed only to the second one, which were initially injected with saline instead of neuraminidase. Such enhanced response suggests immune training in the brain, which lasts at least 3 months. On the other hand, TLR2 mutants under the same experimental design displayed an enhanced immune response quite similar to that of wild type mice. However, in TLR4 mutant mice the response after the second immune challenge was largely dampened, indicating the pivotal role of this receptor in the establishment of immune priming. Our results demonstrate that neuraminidase-induced inflammation primes an enhanced immune response in the brain to a subsequent immune challenge, immune training that endures and that is largely dependent on TLR4 receptor.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"896",35966203,"Impact of Perineuronal Net Removal in the Rat Medial Prefrontal Cortex on Parvalbumin Interneurons After Reinstatement of Cocaine Conditioned Place Preference.","Parvalbumin (PV)-positive cells are GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons that modulate the activity of pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and their output to brain areas associated with learning and memory. The majority of PV cells within the mPFC are surrounded by a specialized extracellular matrix structure called the perineuronal net (PNN). We have shown that removal of PNNs with the enzyme chondroitinase-ABC (Ch-ABC) in the mPFC prevents the consolidation and reconsolidation of cocaine-associated conditioned place preference (CPP) memories. Here we examined the extent to which retrieval of a CPP memory during cocaine-primed reinstatement altered the levels and function of PV neurons and their surrounding PNNs during the reconsolidation period. We further determined the extent to which PNN removal prior to reinstatement altered PV intensity levels and PV cell function. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained for cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) followed by extinction training, microinjection of Ch-ABC in the prelimbic PFC, and cocaine-induced reinstatement. Rats were sacrificed immediately prior to reinstatement or at 2 h, 6 h, or 48 h after reinstatement for immunohistochemistry or 2 h later for electrophysiology. Our findings indicate that PNN removal only partially diminished reinstatement. Cocaine-primed reinstatement produced only minor changes in PNN or PV intensity in vehicle controls. However, after PNN removal, the intensity of remaining PNN-surrounded PV cells was decreased at all times except at 2 h post-reinstatement, at which time cocaine increased PV intensity. Consistent with this, in vehicle controls, PV neurons naturally devoid of PNNs showed a similar pattern to Ch-ABC-treated rats prior to and after cocaine reinstatement, suggesting a protective effect of PNNs on cocaine-induced changes in PV intensity. Using whole-cell patch-clamp, cocaine-primed reinstatement in Ch-ABC-treated rats decreased the number of elicited action potentials but increased excitatory synaptic transmission, which may have been compensatory. These findings suggest that without PNNs, cocaine-induced reinstatement produces rapid changes in PV intensity and PV cell excitability, which may in turn regulate output of the mPFC post-memory retrieval and diminish the maintenance of cocaine memory during reconsolidation.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"897",35966206,"Homeostatic regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activity and axonal Kv7.3 expression by prolonged blockade of hippocampal neuronal activity.","Homeostatic plasticity encompasses the mechanisms by which neurons stabilize their synaptic strength and excitability in response to prolonged and destabilizing changes in their network activity. Prolonged activity blockade leads to homeostatic scaling of action potential (AP) firing rate in hippocampal neurons in part by decreased activity of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptors and subsequent transcriptional down-regulation of potassium channel genes including KCNQ3 which encodes Kv7.3. Neuronal Kv7 channels are mostly heterotetramers of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits and are highly enriched at the axon initial segment (AIS) where their current potently inhibits repetitive and burst firing of APs. However, whether a decrease in Kv7.3 expression occurs at the AIS during homeostatic scaling of intrinsic excitability and what signaling pathway reduces KCNQ3 transcript upon prolonged activity blockade remain unknown. Here, we report that prolonged activity blockade in cultured hippocampal neurons reduces the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) followed by a decrease in the activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor, Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). Furthermore, both prolonged activity blockade and prolonged pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 decrease KCNQ3 and BDNF transcripts as well as the density of Kv7.3 and ankyrin-G at the AIS. Collectively, our findings suggest that a reduction in the ERK1/2 activity and subsequent transcriptional down-regulation may serve as a potential signaling pathway that links prolonged activity blockade to homeostatic control of BDNF-TrkB signaling and Kv7.3 density at the AIS during homeostatic scaling of AP firing rate.","misc","wim","misc"

Gamma oscillations specifically control the connectivity between different brain regions, which is crucial for perception, movement, memory, and emotion. Studies have linked abnormal gamma oscillations to conditions of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that gamma entrainment using sensory stimuli (GENUS) provides significant neuroprotection.

As a secondary metabolic product, enzymatic biosynthesis as the early stage of β-ocimene is a factor that needs to be known. Thus, this study was done to identify the mechanism of the two well-known terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, namely Mevalonate Acid (MVA) and 1-Deoxy-D-Xylulose 5-Phosphate (DXP) pathways, in the biosynthesis of β-ocimene in salam leaves. The activity of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR)-MVA pathway-determining enzyme and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS)-DXP pathway-determining enzyme in the crude enzyme and their derivative products of salam leaves were analysed for their changes by differences of substrate ratios and enzyme inhibitors. The results showed that the activity of the HMGR enzyme was lower significantly than the DXS enzyme based on the addition of variations to the substrate ratio. These results were also supported by the enzyme and substrate reaction products, MVA and Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) intermediates from the MVA pathway, which were significantly lower when compared to DXP and IPP intermediates from the DXP pathway. As the end product of the reaction, β-ocimene gave a significantly higher value of the DXP pathway than the MVA pathway. Therefore, it can conclude that the mechanism of the biosynthetic pathway of β-ocimene in salam leaves was synthesised via the DXP pathway. The production of β-ocimene could have crosstalk-pathway through the MVA pathway, especially when the DXP pathway was blocked.","misc","wim","misc"

Before different spiking patterns can be analyzed, spike sorting is necessary to distinguish the activity of particular fibers of a recorded bundle. Due to single-electrode measurements and high noise contamination, standard methods based on spike shapes are insufficient and need to be enhanced with additional information. Such information can be derived from the activity-dependent slowing of the fiber propagation speed, which in turn can be assessed by introducing continuous background 0.125-0.25 Hz electrical stimulation and recording the corresponding responses from the fibers. Each fiber's speed propagation remains almost constant in the absence of spontaneous firing or additional stimulation. This way, the responses to the background stimulation can be sorted by fiber. In this article, we model the changes in the propagation speed resulting from the history of fiber activity with polynomial regression. This is done to assess the feasibility of using the developed models to enhance the spike shape-based sorting. In addition to human microneurography data, we use animal in-vitro recordings with a similar stimulation protocol as higher signal-to-noise ratio data example for the models.","misc","wim","misc"

Eligible patients were divided into the following two groups: PORT group and non-PORT group. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, and differences in survival were evaluated with log-rank test. Long-term cause-specific mortality consisted of lung cancer-related mortality and non-lung cancer-related mortality was investigated through competing risk analysis. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify variables that significantly affected OS. We identified 2,347 eligible patients, after propensity score matching (PSM), 877 pairs were selected. Overall, there was no significant difference in OS between two groups, but the patients who received PORT had a lower lung cancer-related mortality rate. Subgroup analysis showed that PORT was associated with a significantly better OS and lower lung cancer-related mortality rate in patients with T2, grade I-II and positive/resected lymph node ratio (LNR) ≥0.31. The non-lung cancer-related mortality of PORT group was higher in the patients with squamous cell carcinoma, although the difference was not significant.

The activation of Recombinant Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) was shown to significantly reduce the susceptibility of microglia to inflammatory stress. The purpose of this study is to determine whether miRNA-494 can regulate the activation and oxidative stress of SAE microglia through SIRT3. An SAE rat model was established, and the expression of Ionized calcium bindingadaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) in rat brain tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry. Enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay was performed to detect the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in brain tissue. Real time quantitative PCR was performed to detect the relative expression of SIRT3 and related miRNAs, while Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of SIRT3. Rat microglia cells were cultured in vitro. After miRNA-494 was transfected, the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 was detected. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of SIRT3 and Iba-1 in microglia. The results showed that the expression of Iba-1 in the brain tissue of the SAE model group increased, and the expression of inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-6 increased significantly (P<0.01). The expression of SIRT3 protein and mRNA in the brain tissue of the SAE model group also significantly increased (P<0.05). The relative expression of miRNA-494 in the SAE model group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.01). After miRNA-494 was transfected into microglia, cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide. In the miRNA transfection group, the expression levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly lower than those in the negative control (NC) group (P<0.01), and the protein expression levels of Iba-1 and SIRT3 were also significantly lower than those in the NC (P<0.01). MiRNA-494 may further regulate the activation of microglia in SAE by regulating mitochondrial function, providing basic research data for the development of new SAE treatment methods.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"910",35966298,"Imaging features of primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of bladder outlet and urethra: a case report and literature review.","Primary bladder adenocarcinoma (PBA) only accounts for 2% of primary bladder cancers. PBA symptoms vary according to the volume, location, and the metastasis of the tumor. The most common symptoms include suprapubic pain, hematuria, dysuria, and bladder irritation. In the initial stage, the diagnosis of PBA is possibly delayed due to the lack of obvious symptoms. When diagnosed, up to 40% of patients are reported to have metastatic disease. PBA can occur anywhere in the bladder, especially the bottom, neck, and roof. However, the mass at the bladder outlet and urethra is a rare presentation of PBA. Through this rare case, when clinicians encounter similar patients, they can have richer ideas for diagnosis and treatment, which is helpful for the timely diagnosis and effective treatment. A 62-year-old female was referred to an outpatient urology surgery service due to a 1-year history of narrowing of the urinary route and difficulties in urination. No significant abnormalities were found in other surgical examinations, and the patient denied having a genetic history or similar history in her family. Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic mass of 6.5 cm × 3.8 cm × 4.4 cm at the bladder outlet and urethra. Computed tomography (CT) plain scan and enhancing scan displayed that the wall of bladder was thickened, and soft tissue density was seen at the bladder outlet and urethra with slight enhancement and an unclear partial boundary. The mass was confirmed to be PBA. Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of bladder usually detected in the posterior wall and trigone, but at the bladder outlet and urethra was rare. In this report, Imaging examination showed that the mass was located at the bladder outlet and urethra, and was finally confirmed by surgery. Due to the location of the growth, our patient's only symptoms were dysuria and urinary tract thinning, without hematuria, suprapubic pain, or bladder irritation. Timely diagnosis and treatment of this case depend on the findings of imaging examination. We describe the imaging features of this rare disease entity and the relevant literature review.","misc","wim","misc"

Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy for HCC treatment, and understanding the immune microenvironment of HCC provides a theoretical basis for identifying new immune targets. However, the roles of immune components and their regulatory mechanisms in HCC require further clarified. By analyzing HCC expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we depicted the proportion profile of immune cells for each sample using the software CIBERSORTx. Using R packages, we also characterized the distribution of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in immune cells, calculated the correlation coefficient between immune cells and common DEGs, and analyzed their biology function by Gene-Ontology analysis. We found that seven immune cell types were related to the overall survival of HCC patients, and identified 3,692 differentially expressed immune-related genes, predominantly functioning in nucleic acid processing and metabolism. Moreover, 14 DEGs were identified as common candidates related to immune cells and overall survival. Our study not only presents an overview of the immune features of the microenvironment of HCC, but also provides potential targets related to immune components.","misc","wim","misc"

We retrospectively reviewed 297 untreated primary lung adenocarcinoma patients with exact EGFR status. Based on their EGFR status, the patients were divided into a mutant-type group (138 patients) and wild-type group (159 patients). General patient characteristics and possible factors reflecting the status of EGFR were also evaluated. Of the 297 lung adenocarcinoma patients analyzed for EGFR status who underwent positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) between January 2013 and December 2017, mutations in the EGFR gene were detected in 138 patients (46.5%). EGFR mutations were more frequently associated with women, never smokers, and low 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT maximal standard uptake value of the primary tumor (pSUVmax). Multivariate analysis indicated that women [odds ratio (OR) =2.853; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.451-5.611; P=0.002], never smokers (OR =2.414; 95% CI: 1.217-4.789; P=0.012), tumor size <3.5 cm (OR, 2.170; 95% CI: 1.205-3.908; P=0.010), and pSUVmax <8.2 (OR =1.904; 95% CI: 1.098-3.302; P=0.022) were effective predictors of EGFR mutation. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) of pSUVmax and tumor size was 0.623 and 0.600, respectively. Combined with clinical characteristics, including sex and smoking status, the AUC of the 4 predictors was 0.770.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress results from protein misfolding imbalance and has been shown to participate in the development of cancer. We aimed to develop and validation a reliable and robust ER stress-related prognostic signature to accurately predict prognosis for patients with LUAD. The mRNA expressions data and the clinical information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as training set. The data of external validation sets were downloaded from GEO database with the accession number GSE 30219, GSE 31210, GSE 50081 and GSE 37745. Univariate Cox regression analyses was performed to identify mRNAs associated with overall survival (OS) in LUAD. ER-associated genes were retrieved using GeneCards database. Next, we construct the best risk score model by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression with tenfold cross-validation. Subsequently, predictive models and risk scores were developed in the TCGA training dataset. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for univariate and multivariate analysis of risk score and clinicopathologic characteristics. As a validation set GSE30219, GSE31210 and (GSE50081+GSE37745) were used to validate the predictive performance of the model in TCGA. Finally, functional enrichment analysis, including the gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathways and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to further explore function and mechanisms. A prognostic prediction model based on eight genes was developed in the TCGA training dataset. As expected, in validation sets, patients with higher risk scores were found to have worse prognosis. Time-dependent ROC curve analyses demonstrated that the risk score model was reliable. The nomograms showed excellent predictive ability. Multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that the risk score was an independent prognostic factor for LUAD. Additionally, functional enrichment analysis showed that the relevant biomarkers were enriched in cell cycle and glycolysis related signaling pathways. The 8-gene signature may enable improved the prediction of clinical events and decisions about management of LUAD.","misc","wim","misc"

The data was presented by an odds ratio (OR) with an accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI). We then generated forest plots calculated by fixed-effects or random-effects model. This study enrolled a total of 201 studies (140 papers). Our analysis showed a higher frequency of methylation of the CpG islands in GC tissues compared to non-neoplastic tissues. Besides, the data demonstrated that polygene's aberrant promoter methylation might be linked to the initial development and progression of GC. The genes with altered DNA methylation might serve as epigenetic biomarkers, providing a promising molecular diagnostic and prognostic tool for human GC.

It typically presents with unilateral sweating and flushing of the face. It could be caused not only by autonomic dysfunction or space-occupying central neuropathy, but by some clinical interventions as well. Although iatrogenic Harlequin syndrome is rare, clinicians should be aware of this condition to diagnose correctly and provide suitable assistance. Here we report a case of iatrogenic Harlequin syndrome. The unique part of this case is that this patient presented with successive presentations of Harlequin syndrome on different sides of the body. The patient was a 30-40-year-old woman who had flushing and sweating on one side of the face after intraspinal analgesia. This symptom disappeared on its own after a period of persistence, and reappeared several days later after increasing the dose of the drug injected into the epidural cavity. Interestingly, the second blush appeared on the other side of the patient's face. Triggered by intraspinal analgesia and manifested in different body parts, Harlequin syndrome is proven here to be derived from iatrogenic stimuli. We believe that the different distribution states of analgesic drugs after entering the spinal canal can promote Harlequin syndrome to manifest in different body parts.","misc","wim","misc"

ALKBH4 is a member of the AlkB homolog (ALKBH) family that controls demethylation of DNA and RNA. This study enrolled 160 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent complete resection. The expression of ALKBH4 in cancer tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The correlation among the expression of ALKBH4, clinicopathological factors, and prognostic outcome was evaluated. In the NSCLC clinical samples, the expression of ALKBH4 was identified not only in cell membranes but also in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. In 140 of 160 cases, ALKBH4 was more highly expressed in the cancerous tissue than in the surrounding normal tissue. The proportion of cancer cells expressing ALKBH4 was higher in adenocarcinoma than in other histological types. In addition, the expression intensity of ALKBH4 in each cancer cell was also stronger in adenocarcinoma than in squamous cell carcinoma. The expression of ALKBH4 was not associated with clinicopathological factors, except for histological type. In adenocarcinoma, the recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were significantly lower in the ALKBH4-positive group than in the ALKBH4-negative group (P=0.008, 0.031, respectively). A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the ALKBH4 expression was an independent prognostic factor for RFS (P=0.003) and OS (P=0.013).

This study applied models, including the coupling coordination degree, spatial autocorrelation, and Tobit, to explore the heterogeneous characteristics of the coupling of China's industrial agglomeration and regional economic resilience from 2005 to 2019. Additionally, by applying the perspectives of economic and geographic location, indicators were selected to analyze the associated influencing factors, including industrial externalities, new economic geographies, economic policy factors, and other aspects. We found that the overall coupling between industrial agglomeration and economic resilience increased over the study period, but with only a moderate level of coordination. Provinces with high, moderate, and low levels of coordination eventually emerged along a strip-like alternating pattern in space. The dependence increased with an increase in space, but was not significant, and there was a lack of benign interaction between the regions. With respect to interactivity between locations, the interaction of the east and the coast was the most active. There were lower levels of interaction between the west and inland regions. This further confirmed the significant temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the coupling. Environmental pollution, market consumption, the quality of space, and technological support significantly promoted the coupling; opening to the outside world did not. Specifically, with respect to economic location, market consumption and spatial quality had a significant positive effect on the eastern coupling. The center and west regions were significantly affected by economic density and market consumption, and the northeast region was affected by spatial quality and capital intensity. Concerning geographical location, market and technological forces strongly promoted interactions in both the coast and inland regions. The study found that both the government and the market need better guidance to effectively engage with and shape industrial agglomeration and economic resilience in a scientific, reasonable, localized, and distinctive manner.","misc","wim","misc"

Second, we investigate the specificity-generalizability trade-off in building such predictive models by investigating whether predictive models should be built for every course individually based on course-specific sequential patterns, or across several courses based on more general behavioral patterns. Finally, we present a methodology for capturing temporal aspects in behavioral data and analyze its influence on the predictive performance of the models. The results of our improved sequence classification technique are capable to predict student performance with high levels of accuracy, reaching 90% for course-specific models.","misc","wim","misc"

This reaction is considered both a potentially important step in industrial water treatment and an attractive, commercially relevant synthetic pathway. Surprisingly, an important factor, the role of the reaction medium on the reduction performance, has so far been overlooked. Here, we report a pronounced effect of the solvent on the reaction kinetics in the presence of silver and gold nanoparticles. We demonstrate that the addition of methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol to the reaction mixture leads to a dramatic decrease in the reaction rate. For typical concentrations of reactants, the reduction is completely suppressed in the presence of 50 vol% alcohols. 4-NiP reduction rate in aqueous alcohol mixtures can, however, be improved noticeably by increasing the borohydride concentration or the reaction temperature. The analysis of various factors responsible for solvent effects reveals that the decrease in the reduction rate in the presence of alcohols is related, amongst others, to a substantially higher oxygen solubility in alcohols compared to water. The results of this work show that the effects of solvent properties on reaction kinetics must be considered for unambiguous comparison and optimization of the catalytic performance of metallic nanoparticles in the liquid phase 4-NiP reduction.","misc","wim","misc"

In this study, a representative sample of plastic- and rubber-containing artificial turf (AT) fields from Stockholm, Sweden, was subjected to total fluorine (TF), extractable organic fluorine (EOF), and target PFAS analysis. TF was observed in all 51 AT samples (ranges of 16-313, 12-310, and 24-661 μg of F/g in backing, filling, and blades, respectively), while EOF and target PFAS occurred in <42% of all samples (<200 and <1 ng of F/g, respectively). A subset of samples extracted with water confirmed the absence of fluoride. Moreover, application of the total oxidizable precursor assay revealed negligible perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) formation across all three sample types, indicating that the fluorinated substances in AT are not low-molecular weight PFAA precursors. Collectively, these results point toward polymeric organofluorine (e.g., fluoroelastomer, polytetrafluoroethylene, and polyvinylidene fluoride), consistent with patent literature. The combination of poor extractability and recalcitrance toward advanced oxidation suggests that the fluorine in AT does not pose an imminent risk to users.

We review publicly available sources to estimate the amount of CO2 that has been stored by facilities since 1996. We organize these sources into three categories corresponding to the associated degree of assurance: (1) legal assurance, (2) quality assurance through auditing, and (3) no assurance. Data were found for 20 facilities, with an aggregate capture capacity of 36 Mt of CO2 year-1. Combining data from all categories, we estimate that 29 Mt of CO2 was geologically stored in 2019 and there was cumulative storage of 197 Mt over the period of 1996-2020. These are climate relevant scales commensurate with recent cumulative and ongoing emissions impacts of renewables in some markets, e.g., solar photovoltaics in the United States. The widely used capture capacity is in aggregate 19-30% higher than storage rates and is not a good proxy for estimating storage volumes. However, the discrepancy is project-specific and not always a reflection of project performance. This work provides a snapshot of storage amounts and highlights the need for uniform reporting on capture and storage rates with quality assurance.","misc","wim","misc"

Finally, competency assessments, comprising of a test of knowledge and skills through role-plays, was administered. Twenty three Primary Urban Health Centers across seven districts of Delhi were approached and 408 ASHAs were engaged in initial meetings. Telephonic screening with 127 ASHAs resulted in 72 ASHAs being selected for in-person interviews. Of the 45 ASHAs who attended, 33 were shortlisted for training and 18 completed it. Fifteen ASHAs entered the internship of which 7 ASHAs achieved competency. There was significant attrition along the pathway to having a competent non-specialist worker deliver a complex autism intervention. The lessons learnt from this process can inform the possibility of developing a cadre of disability specific frontline health workers who can deliver evidence-based interventions for neurodevelopmental disorders under supervision.","misc","wim","misc"
"929",35966460,"Internalized-stigma and dissociative experiences in bipolar disorder.","Dissociative symptoms have been recently related to bipolar disorder (BD) symptomatology. Moreover, the disease burden carries on a share of perceived self-stigma that amplifies the BD impairment. Internalized stigma and dissociative symptoms often seem overlapping, leading toward common outcomes, with reduced treatment seeking and poor adherence. We hypothesize a potential relationship between dissociation and self-stigma in patients suffering from BD. In this cross-sectional study we enrolled a total of 120 adult clinically stable BD outpatients. All participants completed the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI), Dissociative Experiences Scale-II (DES-II), and Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA). Average age and age at BD (BD-I n = 66, 55%; BD-II n = 54, 45%) onset were 46.14 (±4.23), and 27.45 (±10.35) years, with mean disease duration of 18.56 (±13.08) years. Most participants were female (n = 71; 59.2%) and 40 (33%) of them experienced lifetime abuse, with an average of 1.05 (±0.78) suicide attempts. DES scores (mean 31.8, ±21.6) correlated with ISMI total-score, with significant association with spikes in Alienation (13.1, SD±3.1) (p < 0.001) and Stereotype (13.8, SD±3.9) (p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis has shown a significant association between DES total score and alienation (p < 0.001), stereotype (p < 0.001) and MANSA total-score (p < 0.001). For the first time, our data suggests that self-stigma is associated to dissociative symptoms, reducing overall quality of life in BD. The early identification of at-risk patients with previous lifetime abuse and high perceived stigma could lead the way for an ever more precise tailoring of treatment management.","misc","wim","human_intervention"
"930",35966462,"Tourettic OCD: Current understanding and treatment challenges of a unique endophenotype.","Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and chronic tic disorders (CTD) including Tourette Syndrome (TS) are often comorbid conditions. While some patients present with distinct symptoms of CTD and/or OCD, a subset of patients demonstrate a unique overlap of symptoms, known as Tourettic OCD (TOCD), in which tics, compulsions, and their preceding premonitory urges are overlapping and tightly intertwined. The specific behaviors seen in TOCD are typically complex tic-like behaviors although with a compulsive and partially anxious nature reminiscent of OCD. TOCD is not classified within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-5) as an independent diagnostic entity, but mounting evidence suggests that TOCD is an intermediate neuropsychiatric disorder distinct from either TS or OCD alone and as such represents a unique phenomenology. In this review of TOCD we discuss clinical, genetic, environmental, neurodevelopmental, and neurocircuit-based research to better characterize our current understanding of this disorder. TOCD is characterized by earlier age of onset, male predominance, and specific symptom clusters such as lower tendency toward compulsions related to checking, cleaning, and reassurance seeking and higher tendency toward compulsions such as rubbing, tapping, or touching associated with symmetry concerns or thoughts of exactness. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) imaging suggests that TOCD symptoms may arise from involvement of an intermediate neurocircuitry distinct from classic OCD or classic CTD. Small cumulative contributions from multiple genetic loci have been implicated, as have environmental factors such as infection and perinatal trauma. In addition, this review addresses the treatment of TOCD which is especially complex and often treatment resistant and requires pharmacology and behavioral therapy in multiple modalities. Given the distressing impact of TOCD on patients' functioning, the goal of this review is to raise awareness of this distinct entity toward the goal of improving standards of care.","misc","wim","misc"

This highlights the elusiveness of meeting unmet needs in existing pharmacotherapies for treatment-resistant depression. There is accumulating evidence that antidepressant agents involving the glutamatergic system such as brexpiprazole and esketamine/ketamine have more rapid onset of action and potentially improved effectiveness as an augmentation therapy in treatment-resistant depression. This case series aimed to report five complex cases of unipolar and bipolar treatment-resistant depression where conventional treatment strategies were inadequate in managing high risk suicidal behavior and achieving functional recovery. We discussed further the possible synergistic mechanisms of the novel combination strategy of brexpiprazole and esketamine/ketamine, clinical and patient factors that influenced treatment response, challenges with this combination strategy and implications for future practice and research.","misc","wim","misc"

However, human intrinsic brain activity is time-varying and dynamic. There is a lack of knowledge about the brain dynamical pattern in bipolar disorder across different mood states. This study used the dynamical degree centrality (dDC) to investigate the resting-state whole-brain dynamical pattern voxel-wise in a total of 62 bipolar disorder [28 bipolar depression (BD), 13 bipolar mania (BM), 21 bipolar euthymia (BE)], and 30 healthy controls (HCs). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to explore the omnibus differences of the dDC pattern across all groups, and Pearson's correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the dDC variability in detected regions with clinical symptom severity. One-way ANOVA analysis showed the omnibus differences in the left inferior parietal lobule/middle occipital gyrus (IPL/MOG) and right precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCUN/PCC) across all groups. The post hoc analysis revealed that BD showed decreased dDC in the IPL/MOG compared with all other groups, and both BD and BM exhibited decreased dDC in the PCUN/PCC compared with BE and HCs. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that the dDC variability of the IPL/MOG and PCUN/PCC negatively correlated with the depression symptom levels in all patients with bipolar disorder. This study demonstrated the distinct and shared brain dynamical pattern of the depressive, manic, and euthymia states. Our findings provide new insights into the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder across different mood states from the dynamical brain network pattern perspective.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Dementia and MCI were diagnosed, respectively, with DSM-IV and Petersen criteria. Performance in activities of daily living (ADL) at three different levels [basic (The Katz Index of Independence), instrumental (Lawton instrumental ADL scale) and advanced (Reuben's advanced ADL scale)], measured through self- and informant-report, as well as awareness (discrepancy between self- and informant-report), were compared between groups. Stepwise regression models explored predictors of ADL and their awareness. PwD showed impairment in all ADL levels, particularly when measured through informant-report. No differences were seen between controls and PwMCI regardless of measurement type. PwD differed in awareness of instrumental and basic, but not of advanced ADL, compared to controls. Age, gender, education and fluency were the most consistent predictors for ADL. Diagnosis was a significant predictor only for instrumental ADL. Awareness of basic ADL was predicted by memory, and awareness of instrumental ADL was predicted by general cognitive status, educational level, and diagnosis. Results reinforce the presence of lack of awareness of ADL in PwD. Use of informant-reports and cognitive testing for fluency are suggested for the clinical assessment of ADL performance. Finally, assessment of instrumental ADL may be crucial for diagnostic purposes.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

This article aims to summarize some of these important concepts, such as the effects of ageism, preservation of human rights and dignity, supported or shared decision making and palliative approaches. It emerged from a study that found two thirds of 100 participants 60 years of age and older with serious mental illness had end-of-life decision-making capacity. This finding highlighted the individual and contextual nature of decision-making capacity, the importance of consideration of individual values and protection of human dignity during end-of-life care. Healthcare providers have a duty to initiate end-of-life and advance care discussions, to optimize decision-making capacity, and to protect autonomous decision-making. Chronological age or diagnostic categories should never be used as reasons for discrimination and all patients should receive end-of-life care in keeping with their preferences and values.","misc","wim","misc"

The personality characteristics of all patients were evaluated by using the simplified Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). The incidence rate of organic personality disorder after all kinds of craniocerebral trauma was 33.1%, while it was 38.7 and 44.2% in the patients after moderate and severe craniocerebral trauma, respectively, which was significantly higher than that in the patients after mild craniocerebral trauma (18.0%) (P < 0.05). Compared with the patients without personality disorder, the neuroticism, extraversion and agreeableness scores all showed significantly differences (P < 0.05) in the patients with personality disorder after craniocerebral trauma; especially the conscientiousness scores showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in the patients with personality disorder after moderate and severe craniocerebral trauma. The agreeableness and conscientiousness scores in the patients with personality disorder after moderate and severe craniocerebral trauma were significantly lower than that after mild craniocerebral trauma, and the patients with personality disorder after severe craniocerebral trauma had lower scores in extraversion than that after mild craniocerebral trauma. The severity and area of craniocerebral trauma is closely related to the incidence rate of organic personality disorder, and it also affects the clinical manifestations of the latter, which provides a certain significance and help for forensic psychiatric appraisal.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Combining internal and external positive resources can effectively prevent and alleviate depression. This study explores the moderating role of psychological capital (PsyCap) in the relationship between interpersonal sensitivity and depression, as well as the moderating effect of familial support on the conditional influence of PsyCap among Chinese college freshmen. A cross-sectional mental health survey was performed and the anonymous self-reported questionnaires, including the Patient Health Questionnaire, interpersonal sensitivity subscale of Symptom Checklist-90, Psychological Capital Questionnaire 24, and Perceived Social Support from Family, were distributed to the freshmen. Pearson's coefficient was employed to describe correlations between variables. The PROCESS macro and slope difference tests were used to explore the moderating role of PsyCap and family support in the relationship between interpersonal sensitivity and depression. The prevalence of depression among freshmen was 30.89% (694/2,247). The correlation analysis revealed that depression negatively related to PsyCap (r = -0.187, p < 0.001) and family support (r = -0.193, p < 0.001) and positively related to interpersonal sensitivity (r = 0.399, p < 0.001). The moderation analysis showed that PsyCap negatively moderated the positive relationship between interpersonal sensitivity and depression (β = -0.159, p < 0.001). We also found that family support played a moderating role in the conditional influence of PsyCap (β = 0.076, p < 0.01). The slope difference test further showed that family support weakened the effect of interpersonal sensitivity on depression in freshmen when they had low PsyCap. More attention should be paid to freshmen's mental health and interpersonal interaction problems. For freshmen with interpersonal sensitivity and depression, mental health departments can conduct PsyCap development interventions to alleviate psychological symptoms. Freshmen themselves should also seek family support in time, but those individuals with high PsyCap should seek an appropriate level of family support to maintain their autonomy.","misc","wim","human_intervention"
"938",35966477,"Long-term changes of parvalbumin- and somatostatin-positive interneurons of the primary motor cortex after chronic social defeat stress depend on individual stress-vulnerability.","Chronic stress is a major risk factor for developing mental illnesses and cognitive deficiencies although stress-susceptibility varies individually. In a recent study, we established the connection between chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and impaired motor learning abilities accompanied by chronically disturbed structural neuroplasticity in the primary motor cortex (M1) of mice. In this study, we further investigated the long-term effects of CSDS exposure on M1, focusing on the interneuronal cell population. We used repeated CSDS to elicit effects across behavioral, endocrinological, and metabolic parameters in mice. Susceptible and resilient phenotypes were discriminated by symptom load and motor learning abilities were assessed on the rotarod. Structural changes in interneuronal circuits of M1 were studied by immunohistochemistry using parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SST+) markers. Stress-susceptible mice had a blunted stress hormone response and impaired motor learning skills. These mice presented reduced numbers of both interneuron populations in M1 with layer-dependent distribution, while alterations in cell size and immunoreactivity were found in both susceptible and resilient individuals. These results, together with our previous data, suggest that stress-induced cell loss and degeneration of the GABAergic interneuronal network of M1 could underlay impaired motor learning, due to their role in controlling the excitatory output and spine dynamics of principal neurons required for this task. Our study further highlights the importance of long-term outcomes of chronically stressed individuals which are translationally important due to the long timecourses of stress-induced neuropsychiatric disorders.","rodent","wim","rodent"
"939",35966478,"Experiences of siblings to children with autism spectrum disorder.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is prevalent globally resulting in increased awareness and understanding of the disorder internationally and to a lesser extent in Southern African countries. This understanding has predominantly been in relation to the impact of the disorder on the neurodivergent child and family relations. Internationally, limited research has explored the impact on neurotypical siblings who have been raised alongside children diagnosed with ASD, with a dearth of such studies emerging from the South African context. The importance of neurotypical siblings' developmental experiences emerging from their immediate environment is significant within the traditionally collectivist nation of South Africa. For this reason, this study aimed to explore South African neurotypical siblings' experiences of living with a brother or sister diagnosed with ASD; through a qualitative study adopting an interpretative phenomenological design. Semi-structured interviews, aimed at generating demographic data and exploring the experiences of being raised alongside a sibling diagnosed with ASD, were conducted with eight university students. The data generated were analyzed employing the five stages of interpretive phenomenological analysis approach. Themes of emotional burden, perceived family dynamics, acceptance, and identity development emerged through data analysis. The participants reported experiences of pre-mature development, unfair treatment, and feelings of being overburdened, along with reported efforts toward acceptance of their sibling's diagnosis, and support from community members. Consequently, an understanding that their neurodivergent sibling played a key role in the development of their identities and career trajectories emerged. The impact of being raised alongside a sibling diagnosed with ASD highlights the need for additional support for neurotypical individuals, supported by programs to enhance awareness about ASD in the general South African community. These interventions would be aimed at mitigating the impact of heightened childhood stress, stigmatization, and marginalization.","misc","wim","misc"

Investigates the network structure and interaction of the MMPI-2 clinical scales between healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia through the Bayesian network. Data was collected from Wuhan Psychiatric Hospital from March 2008 to May 2018. A total of 714 patients with schizophrenia and 714 healthy subjects were identified through propensity score matching according to the criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Separated MMPI-2 clinical scales Bayesian networks were built for healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, respectively. The Bayesian network showed that the lower 7 scale was a consequence of the correlation between the lower 2 scale and the greater 8 scale. A solely lower 7 scale does yield neither a lower 2 scale nor a higher 8 scale. The proposed method showed 72% of accuracy with 78% area under the ROC curve (AUC), similar to the previous studies. The proposed method simplified the continuous Bayesian network to predict binary outcomes, including other categorical data is not explored. Besides, the participants might only represent an endemic as they come from a single hospital. This study identified MMPI-2 clinical scales correlation and built separated Bayesian networks to investigate the difference between patients with schizophrenia and healthy people. These differences may contribute to a better understanding of the clinical symptoms of schizophrenia and provide medical professionals with new perspectives for diagnosis.","misc","wim","misc"

Data from gamblers (N = 5,878) participating in a cross-sectional survey in 2019 based on random sampling from the Norwegian Population Registry, were analysed. The survey included questions about use of eight measures, which comprised the dependent variables. Questions about sociodemographics, gambling behaviour, gambling problems, self-reported impact from gambling advertisement and beliefs in measures to control gambling comprised the predictor variables. Logistic regression analyses were employed to identify significant predictors. Use of measures varied, ranging from 0.8% (contacting help services) to 23.2% (pre-commitment to affordable loss limits). All predictors had at least one significant association with the actual use of measures. Being a moderate risk or problem gambler was the most consistent predictor and was associated with the use of all eight measures. Being born outside Norway in a western or non-western country was associated with use of seven of the eight measures, whereas gambled online and participated in low-risk game only (inversely) were associated with use of six measures. Gender, age, game spending and beliefs in the usefulness of measures were associated with use of four measures. Participation in random games only was inversely associated with use of three measures. Self-reported impact from gambling advertisement was only (inversely) associated with self-testing for gambling problems. Several mechanisms responsible for the associations between predictors and the dependent variables are suggested, e.g., younger gamblers and moderate risk or problem gamblers may use these measures as they may acknowledge personal susceptibilities for developing gambling problems, such as impaired impulse control. Online gambling on the other hand was associated with use of various measures as the latter more often are integrated in online than offline gambling. Notably, the beliefs in measures as helpful was a significant predictor of use of four of the measures, which illustrates that positive views on the use of measures are not consistently associated with actual use of all the measures. Characteristics of the gamblers (e.g., place of birth, moderate risk or problem gambler), the game itself and the online distribution seem to be the most consistent predictors.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

We used the New Castle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to evaluate the risk of bias in prospective research and cross-sectional research, respectively. The major exposure was HCWs' sleep disturbance, and the major outcome was mental health. The correlation coefficients (r), regression coefficients (β) and odds ratios (OR) of the included studies were integrated. Fifty-nine studies were included for qualitative analysis, of which 30 studies could be combined and entered into quantitative analysis. There were 23 studies during the COVID-19 pandemic among the 59 included studies. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the correlation coefficient between sleep disturbance and mental health was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.39-0.47). HCWs with sleep disturbance had a 3.74 (95% CI: 2.76-5.07) times higher risk of mental health problems than those without sleep disturbance.

The number of Afghan refugees in Iran has dramatically increased since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021. Multiple pre-and post-migratory traumatic experiences affect immigrants' physical, psychological, social, and economic wellbeing. The coronavirus outbreak, considered a traumatic experience in human life in the 21st century, added to their problems in Iran and exposed them to new challenges. This qualitative study aimed to investigate their experiences early before, during, and after immigration and the pandemic's challenges to their lives in Iran. In the present qualitative study, ten Afghan residents living in Iran who immigrated to Iran legally or illegally since the summer of 2021 and the last year after the second Taliban invasion were selected via purposive sampling. A semi-structured interview was applied to gather the data, and the data were analyzed through Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis method. Ten male participants with a mean age of 26 y/o were interviewed. Their residence in Iran was between 20 days and 8 months. Four main themes were extracted. The first theme, the Tsunami of suffering, represents a disruption of the normal flow of life. Six subthemes, including loss, being near death, insecurity, sudden hopelessness, leaving the country involuntarily, and reluctance to explore underlying emotions, are included in this category. The second one, Lost in space, describes the participant's attempt to leave Afghanistan following the extensive losses and violent death threats. Their experiences are categorized into four subthemes: the miserable trip, encountering death, life-threatening experiences, and being physically and verbally abused. The third theme, with its five subthemes, try to demonstrate the participants' experiences after getting to their destination in Iran. The last one, Challenges of the COVID-19 explained the experience of Taliban return, war trauma, running away, and living as a refugee or immigrant coincided with the COVID pandemic. Our interviewees explained multiple and successive traumatic experiences of war, migration, and the pandemic. The central clinical features of survivors are fears of losing control, being overwhelmed, and inability to cope. They felt abandoned because not only lost their family support in their homeland but could not also receive support in Iran due to the pandemic-related social distancing and isolation. They were dissociated and emotionally numb when describing their experience, which is a hallmark of experiencing severe, unprocessed traumas. Gaining a better understanding of Afghan refugees lived experiences may help provide them with better social and health care support. Proper mental and physical healthcare support and de-stigmatization programs may reduce the impact of multiple traumas on their wellbeing.","misc","wim","misc"

Self-rating depression scale (SDS), Barratt impulsiveness scale-11th version (BIS-11), and self-rating idea of suicide scale (SIOSS) were applied. A moderated mediation path model was established including impulsiveness, depression, and suicidal ideation as observed variables. The main results revealed that the moderated mediation path model fit well in describing the relationships among impulsiveness, depression, and suicidal ideation. The indirect effect of impulsiveness mediated by depression and the moderating effect of impulsiveness on suicidal ideation was significant. Multiple comparisons showed that the indirect effects under different conditions of impulsiveness had statistical differences. The higher the impulsiveness was, the stronger the predictive effect of depression on suicidal ideation was. The present study confirms that people who have impulsive traits are riskier to generate suicidal thoughts because they are more likely to suffer from depression and that people who are depressive have even higher risk to develop suicidal thoughts when they simultaneously have impulsive traits. In clinical and health care work, when considering depression to prevent suicidal ideation, impulsiveness needs to be monitored throughout the process of premorbid and onset stages of depression.","misc","wim","misc"

This meta-analysis was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) according to the guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement (registration number CRD42021241938). Therefore, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining CBT or ICBT was conducted in this study to treat GAD patients diagnosed with DMS-IV. The researchers searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for relevant studies published from 2000 to July 5, 2022. Evidence from RCTs was synthesized by Review Manager 5.4 as mean difference (MD) for change in scores of scales through a random-effects meta-analysis.

The diagnosis of FH was defined according to the ACMG/AMP criteria as carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. The clinical features of FH and the relationship of FH to the average 16.6-month risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) were assessed. The prevalence of molecularly defined FH in enrolled patients was 26.9%, and coronary artery lesions were more severe in patients with FH than in those without (Gensini score 66.0 vs. 28.0, respectively; P < 0.001). After lipid lowering, patients with FH still had significantly higher LDL-C levels at their last visit (73.5 ± 25.9 mg/dL vs. 84.7 ± 37.1 mg/dL; P = 0.013) compared with those without. FH increased the incidence of CVEs in patients with ACS [hazard ratio (HR): 3.058; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.585-5.900; log-rank P < 0.001].

The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of some miRNAs in visceral and subcutaneous AT in patients undergoing adrenalectomy for aldosterone-secreting adrenal adenoma (APA) compared to the samples of AT obtained in patients undergoing adrenalectomy for non-functioning adrenal mass (NFA). The quantitative expression of selected miRNA using real-time PCR was analyzed in surrounding adrenal neoplasia, peri-renal, and subcutaneous AT samples of 16 patients with adrenalectomy (11 patients with APA and 5 patients with NFA). Real-time PCR cycles for miRNA-132, miRNA-143, and miRNA-221 in fat surrounding adrenal neoplasia and in peri-adrenal AT were significantly higher in APA than in patients with NFA. Unlike patients with NFA, miRNA-132, miRNA-143, miRNA-221, and miRNA-26b were less expressed in surrounding adrenal neoplasia AT compared to subcutaneous AT in patients with APA. This study, conducted on tissue expression of miRNAs, highlights the possible pathophysiological role of some miRNAs in determining the metabolic alterations in patients with PA.","misc","wim","human_intervention"
"948",35966516,"Crosstalk between dendritic cells and T lymphocytes during atherogenesis: Focus on antigen presentation and break of tolerance.","Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease resulting from an impaired lipid and immune homeostasis, where the interaction between innate and adaptive immune cells leads to the promotion of atherosclerosis-associated immune-inflammatory response. Emerging evidence has suggested that this response presents similarities to the reactivity of effector immune cells toward self-epitopes, often as a consequence of a break of tolerance. In this context, dendritic cells, a heterogeneous population of antigen presenting cells, play a key role in instructing effector T cells to react against foreign antigens and T regulatory cells to maintain tolerance against self-antigens and/or to patrol for self-reactive effector T cells. Alterations in this delicate balance appears to contribute to atherogenesis. The aim of this review is to discuss different DC subsets, and their role in atherosclerosis as well as in T cell polarization. Moreover, we will discuss how loss of T cell tolerogenic phenotype participates to the immune-inflammatory response associated to atherosclerosis and how a better understanding of these mechanisms might result in designing immunomodulatory therapies targeting DC-T cell crosstalk for the treatment of atherosclerosis-related inflammation.","misc","wim","misc"

We assessed the relationship between high access flow (Qa) and myocardial fibrosis in HD patients. Myocardial fibrosis was assessed by native T1 relaxation times on non-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and a potential marker of fibrosis. Serum levels of galectin-3, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) were measured in 101 HD patients who underwent regular monitoring of AVF Qa. A high-flow AVF was defined as a Qa >2 L/min. Hemodialysis patients showed significantly higher galectin-3 value and increased T1 relaxation time compared to healthy volunteers, suggesting increased myocardial fibrosis in uremic cardiomyopathy. In HD patients, 20 (19.8%) had a Qa > 2L/min, and they had significantly higher cardiac output, cardiac index, left ventricular mass, and increased T1 times than those with a Qa ≤ 2 L/min. Also, serum galectin-3 and NT-proBNP levels were much higher in the high Qa group, indicating a close relationship between the high Qa, increased myocardial fibrosis, and the risk of heart failure (HF) in HD patients. It is interesting that a higher AVF Qa for myocardial fibrosis was independent of several traditional cardiovascular risk factors as well as serum levels of NT-proBNP and MCP-1. A supra-physiologically high Qa can be related to myocardial fibrosis and increased risk of HF in HD patients. Regular Qa monitoring could allow early detection of a high-flow AVF that could arise cardiac complications.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

Randomized controlled trials were searched from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, OpenGray, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for data extraction and synthesis. The pairwise meta-analysis compared statins and controls using a random-effects model, and a network meta-analysis compared the types and dosages of statins using the Bayesian random-effects model. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42021242067. The study included 37 randomized controlled trials with 17,410 participants and 20 interventions. According to the pairwise meta-analysis, statins significantly decreased CRP levels compared to controls (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-1.31, -0.64], P < 0.0001). In the network meta-analysis, simvastatin 40 mg/day appeared to be the best strategy for lowering CRP (Rank P = 0.18, WMD = -4.07, 95% CI = [-6.52, -1.77]). The same was true for the high-sensitivity CRP, non-acute coronary syndrome (ACS), <12 months duration, and clear measurement subgroups. In the CRP subgroup (rank P = 0.79, WMD = -1.23, 95% CI = [-2.48, -0.08]) and ≥12-month duration subgroup (Rank P = 0.40, WMD = -2.13, 95% CI = [-4.24, -0.13]), atorvastatin 80 mg/day was most likely to be the best. There were no significant differences in the dyslipidemia and ACS subgroups (P > 0.05). Node-splitting analysis showed no significant inconsistency (P > 0.05), except for the coronary heart disease subgroup. Statins reduced serum CRP levels in patients with dyslipidemia or coronary heart disease. Simvastatin 40 mg/day might be the most effective therapy, and atorvastatin 80 mg/day showed the best long-term effect.

Whether there is an accelerated effect of aging on endothelial decline in former preeclamptic women is unknown. We investigated if the arterial aging regarding endothelial-dependent and -independent vascular function is more pronounced in women with a history of preeclampsia as compared to women with a history of solely normotensive gestation(s). Data was used from the Queen of Hearts study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02347540); a large cross-sectional study on early detection of cardiovascular disease among young women (≥18 years) with a history of preeclampsia and a control group of low-risk healthy women with a history of uncomplicated pregnancies. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD; absolute, relative and allometric) and sublingually administered nitroglycerine-mediated dilation (NGMD; absolute and relative) were measured using ultrasound. Cross-sectional associations of age with FMD and NGMD were investigated by linear regression. Models were adjusted for body mass index, smoking, antihypertensive drug use, mean arterial pressure, fasting glucose, menopausal state, family history of CVD and stress stimulus during measurement. Effect modification by preeclampsia was investigated by including an interaction term between preeclampsia and age in regression models. Of the 1,217 included women (age range 22-62 years), 66.0% had a history of preeclampsia and 34.0% of normotensive pregnancy. Advancing age was associated with a decrease in relative FMD and NGMD (unadjusted regression coefficient: FMD: -0.48%/10 years (95% CI:-0.65 to -0.30%/10 years), NGMD: -1.13%/10 years (-1.49 to -0.77%/10 years)) and increase in brachial artery diameter [regression coefficient = 0.16 mm/10 years (95% CI 0.13 to 0.19 mm/10 years)]. Similar results were found when evaluating FMD and NGMD as absolute increase or allometrically, and after confounder adjustments. These age-related change were comparable in former preeclamptic women and controls (p-values interaction ≥0.372). Preeclampsia itself was independently associated with consistently smaller brachial artery diameter, but not with FMD and NGMD. In young- to middle-aged women, vascular aging in terms of FMD and NGMD was not accelerated in women after preeclampsia compared to normotensive pregnancies, even though former preeclamptic women consistently have smaller brachial arteries.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

A total of 98 first anterior wall STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention [85 men (86.7%), mean age: 58 ± 12 years] were enrolled. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed 24-72 h after angioplasty and during 3-month follow-up. MW was estimated from the left ventricular pressure-strain loop derived from speckle tracking echocardiography and simultaneous noninvasive brachial artery cuff pressure. The primary endpoint was early LV remodeling, defined as an increase in LV end-diastolic volume ≥20% compared with baseline at 3 months after STEMI. Major adverse cardiac events and combined clinical outcomes were recorded. LV remodeling was present in 32 patients (33%), who exhibited lower global and culprit-regional work index (WI), constructive work (CW), work efficiency (WE), and specifically, greater differences of WE (delta-WE) and CW (delta-CW) between the culprit and non-culprit region than those without LV remodeling both at the acute phase and follow-up (all P < 0.0125). During follow-up, all global and regional WI, CW, and WE were improved (P < 0.0125 compared with baseline), with less improvement in patients with LV remodeling. In multivariate analysis, baseline delta-WE (odds ratio: 2.304; 95% CI: 1.093-4.856, P = 0.028) and peak troponin I level (odds ratio: 1.035; 95%CI: 1.008-1.063, P = 0.010) were independently associated with early LV remodeling. Patients with greater delta-WE at baseline were associated with a higher incidence of heart failure and combined clinical outcomes during follow-up. After reperfused acute anterior STEMI, patients with LV remodeling presented with more inhomogeneous MW distribution. The absolute difference of WE between culprit and non-culprit territory at the acute phase is an independent predictor for early LV remodeling. www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT05107102.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

However, few research findings have estimated the relationship between atrial fibrillation (AF) and CVD-related mortality among hypertension individuals. The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of AF in a hypertension population and determine the relationship between AF and CVD-related mortality. Using a multistage, stratified, and cluster random sampling method, the prospective cohort study with a median follow-up of 3.51 years enrolled 10,678 hypertensive participants at baseline. The prevalence, awareness, and anticoagulation data of AF in this focal population were carefully assessed. Stepwise logistic regression and Cox regression analysis were respectively performed to evaluate the determinants of AF and the association between AF and CVD-related mortality. The overall prevalence of AF was 1.3% (95% CI, 1.1%-1.6%) in the hypertensive population, and it was higher in men than in women (1.8% vs. 1.0%, respectively; p=0.001). The awareness of AF was 53.1%, and the rate of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy was only 4.2%, although all AF participants should have required according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. The determinants of AF included elder, male, and history of coronary heart disease in the hypertensive population. Besides, compared with individuals without AF, the risk of CVD-related mortality significantly increased in the hypertensive population with AF (HR 3.37, 95% CI 2.10-5.40). Our results indicated a huge burden of AF and underuse of OAC therapy for them in a community-based hypertensive population. Considering that most of the risk factors of AF were unmodifiable in hypertensive individuals, as well as its high risk of mortality, long-term interventions including AF education, timely screening, and widespread use of OACs should be emphasized in the focal populations.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

In the context of limited medical resources, it is crucial to set the right priorities of extended heart rhythm monitoring by stratifying patients into different risk groups likely to have newly detected AF (NDAF). This study aimed to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based machine learning model to assess the risk of NDAF in an early stage after stroke. Linked data between a hospital stroke registry and a deidentified research-based database including EHRs and administrative claims data was used. Demographic features, physiological measurements, routine laboratory results, and clinical free text were extracted from EHRs. The extreme gradient boosting algorithm was used to build the prediction model. The prediction performance was evaluated by the C-index and was compared to that of the AS5F and CHASE-LESS scores. The study population consisted of a training set of 4,064 and a temporal test set of 1,492 patients. During a median follow-up of 10.2 months, the incidence rate of NDAF was 87.0 per 1,000 person-year in the test set. On the test set, the model based on both structured and unstructured data achieved a C-index of 0.840, which was significantly higher than those of the AS5F (0.779, p = 0.023) and CHASE-LESS (0.768, p = 0.005) scores. It is feasible to build a machine learning model to assess the risk of NDAF based on EHR data available at the time of hospital admission. Inclusion of information derived from clinical free text can significantly improve the model performance and may outperform risk scores developed using traditional statistical methods. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical usefulness of the prediction model.","misc","wim","human_intervention"

A systematic search of the PubMed database was performed to identify clinical presentations, imaging strategies, stent types, and treatment modalities for stent migration in hemodialysis patients. A total of 14 case reports on stent migration in TCVO procedures for hemodialysis patients were included and analyzed. Ten cases included migration to the cardiac chambers and the remainder migration to the pulmonary artery. The common symptoms of stent migration in TCVO procedures are reported to be chest pain and dyspnea, while three of the cases studied involved no symptoms. Echocardiography, chest X-ray, and computed tomography are the commonly used methods for the diagnosis of stent migration and identification of the precise positioning of the stent. Stent migration to the right subclavian or innominate veins was the most prevalent case (seven cases). All were bare stents. Seven cases involved retrieval by interventional surgery, while four cases involved retrieval by open heart surgery. However, there were three cases in which the wait-and-see approach was adopted since the patients were asymptomatic. Stent migration in TCVO procedures is a rare but extremely serious complication. The causes are not fully understood. The current treatment strategies include interventional surgery, open heart surgery, and the wait-and-see approach.","misc","wim","misc"

The RAW264.7 macrophage-derived foam cell model was successfully induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) (80 μg/ml). It showed that TAN, HxMF, and HpMF alleviated ox-LDL-induced NO release while also inhibiting the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in RAW264.7 cells. Uptake of excess ox-LDL was inhibited by TAN, HxMF, and HpMF, resulting in the reduction of its foam cell formation. Moreover, TAN, HxMF, and HpMF promoted HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. Western blot experiment showed that TAN, HxMF, and HpMF inhibited the expression of scavenger receptor class A type I (SRA1) and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), while upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), liver X receptor α (LXRα), phospholipid ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), and scavenger receptor class B type I (SRB1) expression. Together, our findings suggested that PMFs inhibited foam cell formation might inhibit lipid uptake via downregulating SRA1/CD36 expression and promote cholesterol efflux from foam cells via upregulating PPARγ/LXRα/ABCG1/SRB1 expression. This antiatherosclerotic activity is expected to provide new insights into the development of healthcare uses for PMFs.","misc","wim","misc"

The objective of this study was to clarify the prognostic value of the blood CXCL12 level in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) through meta-analysis. All related studies about the association between the blood CXCL12 level and the prognosis of CAD were comprehensively searched and screened according to inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.

Subgroup analysis of the CXCL12 level as the continuous variable group found significant associations in non-ACS (multivariate OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.23-1.92), Caucasian (multivariate OR 3.83, 95% CI 1.44-10.19), and long-term (multivariate OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.37-1.93) subgroups, but not in ACS (multivariate OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.67-2.75), Asian (multivariate OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.91-2.14), and short-term (multivariate OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.28-4.76) subgroups. No significant publication bias was found in this meta-analysis. The higher blood CXCL12 level is associated with increased MACEs in patients with CAD, and the blood CXCL12 level may serve as an important prognostic index for CAD. Integrating the blood CXCL12 level into CAD risk assessment tools may provide more comprehensive messages for evaluating and managing patients with CAD.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

A patient with symptomatic severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis was admitted to a high-volume center specializing in transfemoral TAVR with self-expanding valves. No anatomical risk factors of coronary occlusion were identified on pre-procedural computed tomography analysis. The patient was scheduled for a transfemoral TAVR with a self-expanding valve. Balloon pre-dilatation prior to prosthesis implantation was routinely used for assessing the supra-annular structure and assessing the risk of coronary occlusion. Immediately after the tubular balloon inflation, fluoroscopy revealed that the right coronary artery was not visible, and the flow in the left coronary artery was reduced. The patient would be at high-risk of coronary occlusion if a long stent self-expanding valve was implanted. Therefore, our heart team decided to suspend the ongoing procedure. A transapical TAVR with a 23 mm J-valve was performed 3 days later. The prosthesis was deployed at a proper position without blocking the coronary ostia and the final fluoroscopy showed normal flow in bilateral coronary arteries with the same filling as preoperatively. Our successful case highlights the importance of a comprehensive assessment of coronary risk and a thorough understanding of the TAVR procedure for the heart team. A short-stent prosthesis is feasible for patients at high risk of coronary occlusion. Most importantly TAVR should be called off even if the catheter has been introduced when an extremely high risk of coronary obstruction is identified during the procedure and no solution can be found.","misc","wim","misc"

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of WXKL combined with metoprolol tartrate in the treatment of ventricular premature beats (VPCs). We searched seven databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for this study. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted the data. The Cochrane Manual criteria were used for methodological quality assessment. Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.4.1 software. Risk ratios (RR) were used for effect sizes for dichotomous data, demonstrated in effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 11 RCTs of WXKL combined with metoprolol tartrate in the treatment of premature ventricular contractions were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed that WXKL combined with metoprolol tartrate (treatment group) was more effective than metoprolol tartrate (control group) in improving premature ventricular contractions (RR = 1.32, 95% CI: [1.24, 1.40], P < 0.00001); significantly improved the rate of premature ventricular contractions (RR = 1.32, 95% CI: [1.23, 1.41], P < 0.00001); there was no difference in adverse drug reactions compared with the control group (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: [0.35, 0.1.05], P = 0.08), but the number of adverse reactions (n = 18) was less than that of the control group (n = 32), and the severity was lower than that of the control group. The included studies only mentioned randomization and did not describe the generation of random sequences in detail. This study found that Wenxin Keli combined with metoprolol tartrate in the treatment of premature ventricular contractions increased the efficacy of the drug, reduced the occurrence of adverse reactions, and reduced the severity of adverse reactions. Due to the quality limitations of the included studies, more high-quality RCTs are needed in the future to provide more evidence for longer-term analyses.","meta_analysis","wim","meta_analysis"

We report on data from an interview study with young adults exiting or recently exited foster care in Maryland (N=15) designed to understand what facilitates their engagement with courts. Our findings indicate that despite challenges of ?being in foster care?, youth found ways to pursue their goals and make their voices heard through developing stable relationships with supportive adults (including judges, caseworkers, or lawyers) and demanding that child welfare professionals ?speak to me not at me.? Youth indicated that their needs, capabilities, and goals changed as they matured and as their circumstances changed. Such changes helped them find their voices but also created tensions within their child welfare system interactions. This led us to develop the theory of adaptive responsivity, according to which child welfare stakeholders should respond appropriately to developmental and circumstantial changes to help child-welfare involved youth face difficult circumstances and thrive. Such responses include providing developmentally and situationally appropriate information and decision-making power to youth in their own cases as well as opportunities to weigh in on systems change.","misc","wim","misc"
"968",35966576,"Continuous theta-burst stimulation enhances and sustains neurogenesis following ischemic stroke.","Rationale: Previous work has indicated that continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), a modality of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), may provide neuroprotection and improve neurological function after stroke by preserving the blood-brain barrier, altering glial polarization phenotypes, and supporting peri-infarct angiogenesis. The present study was performed to examine whether cTBS, a noninvasive neurostimulation technique, promotes neurogenesis in a photothrombotic (PT) stroke rat model and contributes to functional recovery. Methods: Beginning 3 h or 1 week after the induction of PT stroke, once-daily 5-min cTBS treatments were applied to the infarcted hemisphere for 6 days. Samples were collected 6 days, 22 days, and 35 days after PT stroke. Fluorescent labeling, Western blotting, and behavioral tests were performed accordingly. Results: We found that cTBS therapy significantly expanded the pool of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and newly generated immature neurons in the cortical peri-infarct region after PT stroke. Likewise, the amount of DCX-positive immature neurons in the peri-infarct area was markedly elevated by cTBS. Application of cTBS strikingly diminished the PT-induced loss of NPCs and newly-formed neurons. In addition, the amount of newly generated mature neurons in the peri-infarct zone was significantly promoted by cTBS. Intriguingly, cTBS reduced reactive gliogenesis significantly while promoting oligodendrogenesis and preserving myelination. Mechanistic studies uncovered that cTBS upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). Finally, cTBS-treated animals displayed improved motor functions. To be noted, temozolomide (TMZ), a drug that has been previously used to suppress neurogenesis, could reverse the beneficial effects of cTBS. Conclusions: Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism by which cTBS promotes functional recovery from stroke. We demonstrated that cTBS effectively enhances and sustains neurogenesis after PT stroke. Both early and delayed cTBS treatment could improve the survival of newly generated neurons and functional recovery, and inhibition of neurogenesis could reverse these therapeutic benefits. Mechanistically, cTBS was effective in upregulating the release of neurotrophic factors, protecting NPC and immature neurons, as well as suppressing excessive gliogenesis.","misc","wim","rodent"

LPP2 increases cell growth and LPP2 expression is elevated in a variety of malignancies, implying that LPP2 is a pro-tumorigenic factor. Methods: LPP2 expression in human breast tumors and normal breast tissue was measured by qPCR. To understand the role of LPP2, we knocked out its expression in multiple cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9. Cell proliferation and migration were compared between wild type and LPP2 knockout cells. Cell cycle was measured by flow cytometry, and cell cycle proteins were determined by western blotting. Effects of LPP2 on tumor growth were investigated using syngeneic and xenograft mouse breast cancer models. Results: LPP2 mRNA levels were higher in ER/PR positive, ER/HER2 positive, and triple negative human breast tumors, relative to normal breast tissue. Higher levels of LPP2 in breast tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and melanomas were prognostic of poorer survival. LPP2 mRNA expression is also increased in Hs-578T, MDA-MB-231, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell lines, relative to non-malignant Hs-578Bst, MCF10A and MCF-12A cells. LPP2 knockout in breast cancer cells decreased cell growth by inhibiting G1/S transition, whereas, increasing LPP2 levels in Hs-578Bst and MCF10A cells promoted proliferation. The effects of LPP2 on cell cycle were associated with changes in cyclin A2, cyclin B1, and cell cycle inhibitors, p27 or p21. The level of c-Myc was downregulated by knocking out LPP2, and it was partly restored by re-expressing LPP2. The positive correlation between the expression of LPP2 and c-Myc exists in multiple cancer cell lines including breast, lung, upper aerodigestive tract and urinary tract cancer. LPP2 knockout in MDA-MB-231 or 4T1 cells suppressed tumor formation in mouse breast cancer models, and decreased the in vivo expression of Ki67 and c-Myc of the cancer cells. Conclusion: Targeting LPP2 could provide a new strategy for decreasing c-Myc expression and tumor growth.","misc","wim","rodent"
"970",35966580,"Emerging roles of extracellular vesicle-associated non-coding RNAs in hypoxia: Insights from cancer, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.","Hypoxia is a central pathophysiological component in cancer, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, which represent the most common medical conditions resulting in long-term disability and death. Recent evidence suggests common signaling pathways in these diverse settings mediated by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are packaged in extracellular vesicles (EVs) protecting ncRNAs from degradation. EVs are a heterogeneous group of lipid bilayer-covered vesicles released from virtually all cells, which have important roles in intercellular communication. Recent studies pointed out that ncRNAs including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are selectively sorted into EVs, modulating specific aspects of cancer development, namely cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, immune tolerance or drug resistance, under conditions of hypoxia in recipient cells. In myocardial infarction and stroke, ncRNAs shuttled via EVs have been shown to control tissue survival and remodeling post-hypoxia by regulating cell injury, inflammatory responses, angiogenesis, neurogenesis or neuronal plasticity. This review discusses recent evidence on EV-associated ncRNAs in hypoxic cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke, discussing their cellular origin, biological function and disease significance. The emerging concept of lncRNA-circular RNA/ miRNA/ mRNA networks is outlined, upon which ncRNAs synergistically respond to hypoxia in order to modify disease responses. Particular notion is given to ncRNAs participating in at least two of the three conditions, which revealed a large degree of overlaps across pathophysiological conditions. Possible roles of EV-ncRNAs as therapeutic products or theranostic markers are defined.","misc","wim","misc"
"971",35966581,"Postnatal Dexamethasone Therapy Impairs Brown Adipose Tissue Thermogenesis and Autophagy Flux in Neonatal Rat Pups.","Rationale: Very preterm infants may require dexamethasone (Dex) for facilitating extubation or treating bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, Dex may result in disturbance of metabolisms. This study was to investigate the effects of postnatal short course Dex exposure on brown adipose tissue (BAT) in neonatal rats. Method: Neonatal rats received either three consecutive doses of daily Dex (0.2 mg/kg/day) or saline from postnatal P1 to P3. We investigated the effects of Dex on BAT including thermogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy flux. We also compared diurnal temperature variation between preterm infants who received systemic corticosteroid and their treatment-naïve controls. Results: Postnatal Dex treatment induced growth retardation, BAT whitening, UCP1 downregulation and cold intolerance in neonatal rats. BAT mitochondria were damaged, evident by loss of normal number, structure, and alignment of cristae. Mitochondrial fission-fusion balance was disrupted and skewed toward increased fusion, reflected by increased OPA1 and MFN2 and decreased DRP1, FIS1 and phosphorylated MFF protein levels. Autophagosome synthesis was increased but clearance was inhibited, indicated by accumulation of p62 protein after Dex treatment and no further increase of LC3-II after chloroquine co-treatment. While autophagy modulators, including chloroquine and rapamycin, did not improve UCP1 downregulation and BAT whitening, AMPK activators could partially rescue these damages. We also demonstrated that preterm infants had higher diurnal temperature variation during corticosteroid treatment. Conclusions: Postnatal short course Dex impaired BAT mitochondrial function and autophagy flux in rat pups. AMPK activators had the potential to rescue the damage.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Attenuation of Treg differentiation and function by GLK could also contribute to autoimmune diseases. Methods: We analyzed the roles of GLK and IKKβ in Treg differentiation and function using T-cell-specific GLK transgenic mice and IKKβ conditional knockout mice. The mechanism of GLK/IKKβ-mediated attenuation of Treg differentiation/function was studied by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, reporter assays, in vitro kinase assays, protein-protein interaction assays, mass spectrometry, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Results: We found that GLK signaling inhibited Foxp3 transcription by blocking the function of the transcription factor FoxO1. Mechanistically, GLK directly phosphorylated and activated IKKβ at Ser733 in a PKCθ-independent manner. The phospho-IKKβ Ser733 induced FoxO1 Ser319 phosphorylation and nuclear export, leading to Foxp3 downregulation. Consistently, scRNA-seq analyses showed that Foxp3 mRNA levels were inversely correlated with FoxO1 mRNA levels in GLK transgenic CD4+ T cells. Conclusions: GLK-IKKβ-FoxO1 signaling axis inhibits Foxp3 transcription, leading to reduction of Treg differentiation and suppressive activity, as well as induction of autoimmune disease.","misc","wim","rodent"

OSNs are generated from basal cells, which show the characteristics of progenitor/stem cells. In the mammalian OE, persistent neurogenesis occurs during lifetime, providing a unique model to study the tissue turnover and fate determination of stem cells. Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis and RNAscope in situ hybridization indicated the localization of leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) in the intact and injured OE. Lineage tracing was conducted to analyze the dynamic role of Lgr5+ cells in the OE homeostasis and regeneration. We also used DTR-driven genetic depletion of Lgr5+ cells and lentivirus-mediated Lgr5 downregulation to demonstrate the essential role of Lgr5+ cells in the OE regeneration. Results: We show that Lgr5 marks horizontal basal cells (HBCs) in the OE of adults but not newborns. We revisit the role of Lgr5+ cells in the OE homeostasis and regeneration, and find that Lgr5+ cells participate in the OE homeostasis from neonatal to one-month-old age, as well as in the OE regeneration post injury. During the OE regeneration, Lgr5 is transiently expressed in apical supporting cells, immature neurons, and mature sensory neurons. The Lgr5+ cells become or generate HBCs in the regenerated OE. DTR-driven cell depletion shows that Lgr5+ cells are not necessary in the adult OE homeostasis, but required in the recovery of OE from injury. Lgr5 down-regulation by lentiviral infection also demonstrates the essential role of Lgr5 expression in the OE regeneration. Conclusion: Our study elucidates the role of Lgr5+ cells in the OE homeostasis and regeneration, potentially providing a candidate to cell-based therapy against olfactory dysfunction.","misc","wim","misc"
"974",35966595,"Therapeutic aptamer targeting sclerostin loop3 for promoting bone formation without increasing cardiovascular risk in osteogenesis imperfecta mice.","Rationale: Sclerostin inhibition demonstrated bone anabolic potential in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) mice, whereas humanized therapeutic sclerostin antibody romosozumab for postmenopausal osteoporosis imposed clinically severe cardiac ischemic events. Therefore, it is desirable to develop the next generation sclerostin inhibitors to promote bone formation without increasing cardiovascular risk for OI. Methods and Results: Our data showed that sclerostin suppressed inflammatory responses, prevented aortic aneurysm (AA) and atherosclerosis progression in hSOSTki.Col1a2+/G610C.ApoE-/- mice. Either loop2&3 deficiency or inhibition attenuated sclerostin's suppressive effects on expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in vitro, whilst loop3 deficiency maintained the protective effect of sclerostin on cardiovascular system both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, loop3 was critical for sclerostin's antagonistic effect on bone formation in Col1a2+/G610C mice. Accordingly, a sclerostin loop3-specific aptamer aptscl56 was identified by our lab. It could recognize both recombinant sclerostin and sclerostin in the serum of OI patients via targeting loop3. PEG40k conjugated aptscl56 (Apc001PE) demonstrated to promote bone formation, increase bone mass and improve bone microarchitecture integrity in Col1a2+/G610C mice via targeting loop3, while did not show influence in inflammatory response, AA and atherosclerosis progression in Col1a2+/G610C.ApoE-/- mice with Angiotensin II infusion. Further, Apc001PE had no influence in the protective effect of sclerostin on cardiovascular system in hSOSTki.Col1a2+/G610C.ApoE-/- mice, while it inhibited the antagonistic effect of sclerostin on bone formation in hSOSTki.Col1a2+/G610C mice via targeting loop3.

This study aims to uncover the essential role and the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of the m6A reader YTHDC1 in promoting triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) metastasis. In vitro and in vivo models were employed to determine the pathological function of YTHDC1 in TNBC metastasis. To identify bona fide YTHDC1 target RNAs, we conducted RNA-seq, m6A-seq, and RIP-seq, followed by integrative data analysis and validation assays. By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, we found that elevated expression of YTHDC1 is positively correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Using a mammary fat pad mouse model of TNBC, YTHDC1 significantly promoted lung metastasis of TNBC cells. Through multiple transcriptome-wide sequencing and integrative data analysis, we revealed dysregulation of metastasis-related pathways following YTHDC1 depletion and identified SMAD3 as a bona fide YTHDC1 target RNA. Depletion of YTHDC1 caused nuclear retention of SMAD3 mRNA, leading to lower SMAD3 protein levels. Loss of YTHDC1 led to impaired TGF-β-induced gene expression, leading to inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppressed TNBC cell migration and invasion. SMAD3 overexpression was able to restore the response to TGF-β in YTHDC1 depleted TNBC cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the oncogenic role of YTHDC1 is mediated through its recognition of m6A as m6A-binding defective mutants of YTHDC1 were unable to rescue the impaired cell migration and invasion of YTHDC1 knockout TNBC cells. We show that YTHDC1 plays a critical oncogenic role in TNBC metastasis through promoting the nuclear export and expression of SMAD3 to augment the TGF-β signaling cascade. Overall, our study demonstrates that YTHDC1 is vital for TNBC progression by enhancing TNBC cell survival and TGF-β-mediated EMT via SMAD3 to enable the formation of distant metastasis and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting the YTHDC1/m6A/SMAD3 axis for TNBC treatment.","misc","wim","rodent"
"976",35966598,"SETD1A-SOX2 axis is involved in tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor α-positive breast cancer cells.","Rationale: Approximately 30-40% of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (BC) cases recur after tamoxifen therapy. Thus, additional studies on the mechanisms underlying tamoxifen resistance and more specific prognostic biomarkers are required. In this study, we investigated the role of the SET domain containing 1A (SETD1A), a histone H3-lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase, in the development of tamoxifen resistance in BC. Methods: The relationship between tamoxifen resistance and SETD1A protein level was investigated using resistant cell lines derived from the parent BC cells. Biochemical and molecular assays, such as RNA-sequencing, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, chromatin-immunoprecipitation, and protein-binding assays, were used to identify the SETD1A target gene in tamoxifen-resistant BC cells. Additionally, the role of SETD1A in cancer stem cells (CSCs) was investigated using CSCs isolated from tamoxifen-resistant BC cells. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis and immunofluorescence staining using clinical datasets and tissue microarray were performed to determine the correlation between the expression of the SETD1A-SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) pair and recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients with BC. Results: SETD1A was expressed at higher levels in tamoxifen-resistant BC cells than in primary BC cells. Notably, SETD1A-depleted tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells showed restored sensitivity to tamoxifen, whereas SETD1A overexpression in MCF-7 cells resulted in decreased sensitivity. SETD1A is recruited to the SOX2 gene via its interaction with SOX2, thereby enhancing the expression of SOX2 genes in tamoxifen-resistant BC cells. The growth of tamoxifen-resistant cells and CSCs was effectively suppressed by SETD1A knockdown. In addition, high levels of SETD1A and SOX2 were significantly correlated with a low survival rate in patients with ER-positive tamoxifen-resistant BC. Conclusion: Our findings provide the first evidence of the critical role of the SETD1A-SOX2 axis in tamoxifen-resistant BC cells, implying that SETD1A may serve as a molecular target and prognostic indicator of a therapeutic response in patients with tamoxifen-resistant BC.","misc","wim","misc"

We conducted the study in two contrasting soils (acidic and neutral) over the course of 28 days. Our results indicated that DMPP had higher inhibitory efficacy in the acidic soil (30.7%) compared to the neutral soil (12.1%). The abundance of AOB and Nitrospira-like NOB were positively associated with nitrate content in acidic soil. In neutral soil, these communities were joined by the abundance of AOA and Nitrobacter-like NOB in being positively associated with nitrate content. By blocking the growth of AOB in acidic soil-and the growth of both AOB and comammox in neutral soil-DMPP supported higher rates of AOA growth. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that urea and urea + DMPP treatments significantly increased the diversity indices of bacteria, including Chao 1, ACE, Shannon, and Simpson in the acidic soil but did not do so in the neutral soil. However, both urea and urea + DMPP treatments obviously altered the community structure of bacteria in both soils relative to the control treatment.

Six treatments were established: no fertilizer (CK, control), chemical fertilizers (CF, conventional dosage for this region), balanced fertilization (BF, 30% reduction of chemical fertilizers), and balanced fertilization plus 3,000, 6,000, or 12,000 kg.ha-1 bio-organic fertilizer (Lvneng Ruiqi Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Gansu, China) (BF + OF1, BF + OF2, BF + OF3, respectively). A two-season field experiment with cauliflower was conducted under the different fertilizer treatments in irrigation districts along the Yellow River, Northwest China. The results indicate that the yield, soil organic matter, total potassium content, and enzyme activity under the bio-organic treatments were generally higher than those under the CF treatment. Compared with the CF treatment, the BF treatment increased soil organic matter content, enzyme activity and soil bacterial relative abundance. Moreover, the bacterial alpha-diversity were higher than those of conventional fertilization. The predominant phyla, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Chloroflexi, were the main contributors to the microbiome shift, as demonstrated by their remarkable enrichment in the soil under BF + OF2 and BF + OF3 treatments. Furthermore, Pearson correlation analyses show significant correlations among the soil organic matter, available P and K, electrical conductivity, and relative abundance of potentially beneficial microbial groups, such as the genera Massilia, Bacillus, Lysobacter, and Nitrosospira.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that SFG rickettsiae infections were firstly reported in Shiqu county for these tick species. Our results indicated that H. qinghaiensis and D. everestianus ticks from Shiqu county became highly infected with a R. raoultii-like bacteria during their feeding process. This observation is alarming because of the zoonotic potentiality of these species. Overall, the present study detected a widespread of R. raoultii-like bacteria in ticks that are considered a serious threat to domestic animals and humans in Shiqu county. The prevalence of R. raoultii-like bacteria in human and wildlife hosts should be further investigated in the future.","misc","wim","misc"

At present, it is still a challenge to control potato common scab in the field. To address this problem, the 972 family lactococcin (Lcn972) was screened from Bacillus velezensis HN-Q-8 in this study, and an Escherichia coli overexpression system was used to obtain Lcn972, which showed a significant inhibitory effect on Streptomyces scabies, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10.58 μg/mL. The stability test showed that Lcn972 is stable against UV radiation and high temperature. In addition, long-term storage at room temperature and 4°C had limited effects on its activity level. The antibacterial activity of Lcn972 was enhanced by Cu2+ and Ca2+, but decreased by protease K. The protein was completely inactivated by Fe2+. Cell membrane staining showed that Lcn972 damaged the cell membrane integrity of S. scabies. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations revealed that the hyphae of S. scabies treated with Lcn972 were deformed and adhered, the cell membrane was incomplete, the cytoplasm distribution was uneven, and the cell appeared hollow inside, which led to the death of S. scabies. In conclusion, we used bacteriocin for controlling potato common scab for the first time in this study, and it provides theoretical support for the further application of bacteriocin in the control of plant diseases.","misc","wim","misc"

Moreover, the increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) characterizing HAI-associated microbes is one of the human health's main concerns, requiring the characterization of the contaminating microbial population in the hospital environment. The monitoring of surface microbiota in hospitals is generally addressed by microbial cultural isolation. However, this has some important limitations mainly relating to the inability to define the whole drug-resistance profile of the contaminating microbiota and to the long time period required to obtain the results. Hence, there is an urgent need to implement environmental surveillance systems using more effective methods. Molecular approaches, including next-generation sequencing and PCR assays, may be useful and effective tools to monitor microbial contamination, especially the growing AMR of HAI-associated pathogens.

It is a long journey to decisively demonstrate the unique viral pathogenic function of acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in pediatric patients. Respiratory specimens collected from pediatric patients with ARTI from January 2017 to December 2021 were screened by a capillary electrophoresis-based multiplex PCR (CEMP) assay, then genotyped by PCR and sequencing for HBoV1. For the antigen test, a part of HBoV1 DNA positive nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) was used as an antigen, while a rabbit anti-HBoV1 DR2 specific to HBoV1 was used as an antibody in the indirect-immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Finally, the levels of IgG specific to HBoV1 in acute and convalescent sera selected retrospectively from only HBoV1 DNA-positive patients were evaluated by IFA. Among 9,899 specimens, 681 were positive for HBoV1 DNA (6.88%, 681/9899), which included 336 positives only for HBoV1 (49.34%, 336/681) and 345 (50.66%, 345/681) positives also for other pathogens.

Both folic acid and zinc significantly reduce uric acid levels and alleviate hyperuricemia. However, whether the underlying mechanisms are associated with the regulation of the gut microbiota remain unknown. To explore alterations of the gut microbiota related to folic acid and zinc treatment in rats with hyperuricemia in our study. A hyperuricemic rat model was established with a high-purine diet. The effects of folic acid and zinc on uric acid levels were evaluated. Alterations of the gut microbiota related to hyperuricemia and the treatments were evaluated by sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq system. The results demonstrated that uric acid levels dropped observably, and the activities of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) were downregulated after folic acid or zinc intervention. 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based gut microbiota analysis revealed that folic acid and zinc enhanced the abundance of probiotic bacteria and reduced that of pathogenic bacteria, thus improving intestinal barrier function. PICRUST analysis indicated that folic acid and zinc restored gut microbiota metabolism. These findings indicate that folic acid and zinc ameliorate hyperuricemia by inhibiting uric acid biosynthesis and stimulating uric acid excretion by modulating the gut microbiota. Thus, folic acid and zinc may be new and safe therapeutic agents to improve hyperuricemia.","rodent","wim","rodent"

Here, we present the redefined repeat-spacer boundaries of the CRISPR subtype I-B locus of serovar Lai. Such refinement of boundaries of arrays in serovar Lai was done after comparison with the characterized array of another serovar Copenhageni and the manual analysis of CRISPR flanking sequences. Using the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), we account that the seven CRISPR are transcriptionally active in serovar Lai. Our RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR analysis of transcripts in serovar Lai indicated that seven CRISPR of subtype I-B transcribe together as a single precursor unit. Moreover, the cleavage of the two miniature pre-crRNA of the subtype I-B by Cas6 demonstrates the biogenesis of the expected size of mature crRNA essential for the guided interference of foreign DNA.

The cave system was chosen as the sampling site due to its touristic use and the presence of high-impact illuminations. The biofilms and the mats of the illuminated walls were sampled. Samples were investigated by 16S rRNA gene analysis and culturable cyanobacteria isolation. The isolated strains were then screened for the production of PHAs under typical culturing and nutritional starvation. Cultures were checked for PHA accumulation, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) presence (infrared spectroscopy), and pigment production. The 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. Highlighted a considerable extent of the pressure exerted by anthropogenic activities. However, the isolation yielded eleven cyanobacteria isolates with good PHA (mainly PHB)-producing abilities and interesting pigment production rates (chlorophyll a and carotenoids). Under normal conditions (BG110), the accumulation abilities ranged from 266 to 1,152 ng mg dry biomass-1. The optimization of bioprocesses through nutritional starvation resulted in a 2.5-fold increase. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies established the occurrence of PHB within PHAs extracted by cyanobacteria isolates. The comparison of results with standard strains underlined good production rates. For C2 and C8 strains, PHA accumulation rates under starvation were higher than Azospirillum brasilense and similar to Synechocystis cf. salina 192. This study broadened the knowledge of the microbial communities of mats and biofilms on the lightened walls of the caves. These findings suggested that these structures, which are common in tourist caves, could be used to isolate valuable strains before remediation measures are adopted.","misc","wim","misc"

We aim to investigate the effect of aging gut microbiota on acute pancreatitis and explore the potential mechanism of this phenomenon. Eighteen fecal samples from healthy adult participants, including nine older and nine younger adults were collected. C57BL/6 mice were treated with antibiotics for fecal microbiota transplantation from older and younger participants. Acute pancreatitis was induced by cerulein and lipopolysaccharide in these mice. The effect of the aged gut microbiota was further tested via antibiotic treatment before or after acute pancreatitis induction. The gut microbiota of older and younger adults differed greatly. Aged gut microbiota exacerbated acute pancreatitis during both the early and recovery stages. At the same time, the mRNA expression of multiple antimicrobial peptides in the pancreas and ileum declined in the older group. Antibiotic treatment before acute pancreatitis could remove the effect of aging gut microbiota, but antibiotic treatment after acute pancreatitis could not. Aging can affect acute pancreatitis through gut microbiota which characterizes the deletion of multiple types of non-dominant species. This change in gut microbiota may potentially regulate antimicrobial peptides in the early and recovery stages. The level of antimicrobial peptides has negative correlations with a more severe phenotype.","rodent","wim","rodent"

GBS population structure is composed of multiple clades that differ in virulence, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and niche adaptation; however, there is growing evidence of interspecies transmission, both from evolutionary analysis and from disease investigations. The prevention of GBS infections through vaccination is desirable in humans as well as animals because it reduces the burden of GBS disease and reduces our reliance on antimicrobials, and the risk of adverse reactions or selection for AMR. In this perspective article, we navigate through the landscape of AMR in the pediatric and multi-host pathogen GBS under the One Health perspective and discuss the use of antimicrobials to control GBS disease, the evolution of AMR in the GBS population, and the future perspectives of resistant GBS infections in the post-pandemic era.","misc","wim","misc"

The swine pathogen Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) is a naturally transformable bacterium. The regulation of competence, however, is not fully understood. In this study, the natural transformability of 99 strains was investigated. Only 44% of the strains were transformable under laboratory conditions. Through a high-resolution melting curve and phylogenetic analysis, we found that genetic differences in the core regulator of natural transformation, the tfoX gene, leads to two distinct natural transformation phenotypes. In the absence of the tfoX gene, the highly transformable strain SC1401 lost its natural transformability. In addition, when the SC1401 tfoX gene was replaced by the tfoX of SH0165, which has no natural transformability, competence was also lost. These results suggest that TfoX is a core regulator of natural transformation in G. parasuis, and that differences in tfoX can be used as a molecular indicator of natural transformability. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the SC1401 wildtype strain, and a tfoX gene deletion strain showed that differential gene expression and protein synthesis is mainly centered on pathways related to glucose metabolism. The results suggest that tfoX may mediate natural transformation by regulating the metabolism of carbon sources. Our study provides evidence that tfoX plays an important role in the natural transformation of G. parasuis.","misc","wim","misc"

However, the transportation system of PAA as a side chain of PG are unclear yet. To discover ABC transporters (ABCTs) involved in the transportation of PAA, the expression levels of 38 ABCT genes in the genome of Monascus ruber M7, culturing with and without PAA, were examined, and found that one abct gene, namely abct31, was considerably up-regulated with PAA, indicating that abct31 may be relative with PAA transportation. Furthermore the disruption of abct31 was carried out, and the effects of two PG substrate's amino acids (L-Cys and L-Val), PAA and some other weak acids on the morphologies and production of secondary metabolites (SMs) of Δabct31 and M. ruber M7, were performed through feeding experiments. The results revealed that L-Cys, L-Val and PAA substantially impacted the morphologies and SMs production of Δabct31 and M. ruber M7.

However, the mechanism underlying the inhibitory role of DT against B. dothidea is not fully understood. Comparing the control and the DT-treated B. dothidea mycelial transcriptomes revealed that heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) strongly responded to DT treatment. This study identified four Hsp20 genes throughout the B. dothidea genome (BdHsp20_1-4). Each BdHsp20 gene had a conserved ACD with a variable N-terminal region and a short C-terminal extension. The segmental duplication event has contributed to the expansion of the BdHsp20 gene family. Compared to the wild-type strain, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited BdHsp20 mutant (ΔBdHsp20) decreased the mycelial growth by 55.95% and reduced the disease symptom in postharvest apple fruit by 96.34%. However, the BdHsp20 complemented strain (ΔBdHsp20_C) significantly restored the growth and pathogenicity, which suggested that the BdHsp20 gene was closely involved in the growth and pathogenicity of B. dothidea.

The concept of microbial electrochemistry has been gaining tremendous attention for the past two decades, mainly due to its numerous applications. This technology offers a wide range of applications in areas such as the environment, industries, and sensors. The biocatalysts governing the reactions could be cell secretion, cell component, or a whole cell. The electroactive bacteria can interact with insoluble materials such as electrodes for exchanging electrons through colonization and biofilm formation. Though biofilm formation is one of the major modes for extracellular electron transfer with the electrode, there are other few mechanisms through which the process can occur. Apart from biofilm formation electron exchange can take place through flavins, cytochromes, cell surface appendages, and other metabolites. The present article targets the various mechanisms of electron exchange for microbiome-induced electron transfer activity, proteins, and secretory molecules involved in the electron transfer. This review also focuses on various proteomics and genetics strategies implemented and developed to enhance the exo-electron transfer process in electroactive bacteria. Recent progress and reports on synthetic biology and genetic engineering in exploring the direct and indirect electron transfer phenomenon have also been emphasized.","misc","wim","misc"

Recent evidence, however, points to the production of MeHg also in oxic pelagic waters, but the magnitude and the drivers for this process remain unclear. Here, we performed a controlled experiment testing the hypothesis that inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (tDOM) to coastal waters enhance MeHg formation via increased bacterial activity. Natural brackish seawater from a coastal area of the Baltic Sea was exposed to environmentally relevant levels of Hg(II) and additions of tDOM according to climate change scenarios. MeHg formation was observed to be coupled to elevated bacterial production rates, which, in turn, was linked to input levels of tDOM. The increased MeHg formation was, however, not coupled to any specific change in bacterial taxonomic composition nor to an increased abundance of known Hg(II) methylation genes. Instead, we found that the abundance of genes for the overall bacterial carbon metabolism was higher under increased tDOM additions. The findings of this study may have important ecological implications in a changing global climate by pointing to the risk of increased exposure of MeHg to pelagic biota.","misc","wim","misc"

The ability of the gut microbiota to signal across the gut-brain-microbiota axis with metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, impacts brain health and has been identified to play a role in the gastrointestinal and developmental symptoms affecting autistic children. The fecal microbiome of older children with ASD has repeatedly shown particular shifts in the bacterial and fungal microbial community, which are significantly different from age-matched neurotypical controls, but it is still unclear whether these characteristic shifts are detectable before diagnosis. Early microbial colonization patterns can have long-lasting effects on human health, and pre-emptive intervention may be an important mediator to more severe autism. In this study, we characterized both the microbiome and short-chain fatty acid concentrations of fecal samples from young children between 21 and 40 months who were showing early behavioral signs of ASD. The fungal richness and acetic acid concentrations were observed to be higher with increasing autism severity, and the abundance of several bacterial taxa also changed due to the severity of ASD. Bacterial diversity and SCFA concentrations were also associated with stool form, and some bacterial families were found with differential abundance according to stool firmness. An exploratory analysis of the microbiome associated with pre-emptive treatment also showed significant differences at multiple taxonomic levels.

However, several variables, including improper mechanization, limited arable land, and the presence of several biotic and abiotic pressures, continually impact agricultural productivity. Drought is a notable destructive abiotic stress and may be the most serious challenge confronting sustainable agriculture, resulting in a significant crop output deficiency. Numerous morphological and physiological changes occur in plants as a result of drought stress. Hence, there is a need to create mitigation techniques since these changes might permanently harm the plant. Current methods used to reduce the effects of drought stress include the use of film farming, super-absorbent hydrogels, nanoparticles, biochar, and drought-resistant plant cultivars. However, most of these activities are money and labor-intensive, which offer limited plant improvement. The use of plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) has proven to be a preferred method that offers several indirect and direct advantages in drought mitigation. PGPB are critical biological elements which have favorable impacts on plants' biochemical and physiological features, leading to improved sugar production, relative water content, leaf number, ascorbic acid levels, and photosynthetic pigment quantities.

Unlike conventional multiplex real-time PCR (qPCR) methods, the multiplex ddPCR assay was developed using two types of probe fluorophores, allowing the assay to perform with a common two-color ddPCR system. After optimization, the assay performance was evaluated, showing a lower limit of detection (LOD) (0.1-1.0 pg/μL) and good selectivity for the five bacteria targets. The multiplex assay's ability to simultaneously detect two or more kinds of targets in a sample was also demonstrated. The assay showed strong sample tolerance when testing simulated soil samples; the LOD for bacteria in soil was 2 × 102-2 × 103 colony-forming unit (CFU)/100 mg soil (around 5-50 CFU/reaction), which was 10-fold lower than that of the single-target qPCR method. When testing simulated soil samples at bacterial concentrations of 2 × 103-2 × 104 CFU/100 mg soil, the assay presented a higher sensitivity (100%, 35/35) than that of the qPCR method (65.71%, 23/35) and a good specificity (100%, 15/15).

Chromosome size varied from 4.7-4.8 Mbp (phylogenetic Lineage 1 of P. agardhii/P. rubescens thriving in shallow waterbodies) to 5.4-5.6 Mbp (Lineage 2 of P. agardhii/P. rubescens thriving in deeper physically stratified lakes and reservoirs) and 6.3-6.6 Mbp (Lineage 3, P. pseudagardhii/P. tepida including planktic and benthic ecotypes). Although the variation in chromosome size was positively related to the proportion of IS elements (1.1-3.7% on chromosome), quantitatively, IS elements and other paralogs only had a minor share in chromosome size variation. Thus, the major part of genomic variation must have resulted from gene loss processes (ancestor of Lineages 1 and 2) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Six of seven peptide synthesis gene clusters were found located on the chromosome and occurred already in the ancestor of P. agardhii/P. rubescens, and became partly lost during evolution of Lineage 1. In general, no increased IS element frequency in the vicinity of peptide synthesis gene clusters was observed. We found a higher proportion of IS elements in ten breaking regions related to chromosomal rearrangements and a tendency for colocalization of toxic/bioactive peptide synthesis gene clusters on the chromosome.","misc","wim","misc"

To study the relationship between negative Ag-RDT results with virological, molecular, and serological parameters, we selected a cross-sectional and a follow-up dataset and analyzed virus culture, subgenomic RNA quantification, and sequencing to determine infectious viruses and mutations. We demonstrated that RT-qPCR positive while SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT negative discordant results correlate with the absence of infectious virus in nasopharyngeal samples. A decrease in sgRNA detection together with an expected increase in detectable anti-S and anti-N IgGs was also verified in these samples. The data clearly demonstrate that a negative Ag-RDT sample is less likely to harbor infectious SARS-CoV-2 and, consequently, has a lower transmissible potential.","misc","christiaan","misc"

To unravel the observed differences in the progression of the infection, an in-depth molecular and biological characterization of the subgenotype F1b was performed. Phylogenetic analysis of subgenotype F1b full-length genomes revealed the existence of two highly supported clusters. One of the clusters, designated as gtF1b Basal included sequences mostly from Alaska, Peru and Chile, while the other, called gtF1b Cosmopolitan, contained samples mainly from Argentina and Chile. The clusters were characterized by a differential signature pattern of eight nucleotides distributed throughout the genome. In vitro characterization of representative clones from each cluster revealed major differences in viral RNA levels, virion secretion, antigen expression levels, as well as in the localization of the antigens. Interestingly, a differential regulation in the expression of genes associated with tumorigenesis was also identified. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the molecular and biological characteristics of the subgenotype F1b clusters and contributes to unravel the different clinical outcomes of subgenotype F1b chronic infections.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This cross-sectional study was done among MI survivors using Cardiac Depression Scale, MacNew Quality of Life After Myocardial Infarction Questionnaire and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support to assess for depression, QoL and PSS respectively. A total of 103 MI survivors were included in the study, and the mean age was 59.66 (± 10.42) years. Depression was found in 21.36% of the participants.

The total indirect effects of PSS and depression on emotional QoL were b = 0.16, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.17 and b = - 0.05, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.06, - 0.03, respectively. Depression and poor PSS impair physical and social domains, which impairs the emotional domain of QoL; as such, overall QoL is undermined. As limited physical and social activity because of depression and poor PSS may increase the risk of further cardiovascular events, a holistic approach which includes mental health care is warranted.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Accumulating evidence indicates that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a core lesion in AD and persistent ER stress promotes AD pathology and impairs cognition. However, whether the imbalance of the gut microbiota is involved in triggering the ER stress in the brain remains unknown. In the present study, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed with gut microbiota from AD patients and APP/PS1 mice, respectively, resulting in two mouse models with dysregulated gut microbiota. The ER stress marker protein levels in the cerebral cortex were assessed using western blotting. The composition of the gut microbiota was assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Excessive ER stress was induced in the cerebral cortex of mice after FMT. Elevated ER stress marker proteins (p-perk/perk, p-eIF2α/eIF2α) were observed, which were rescued by 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB). Notably, DMB is a compound that significantly attenuates serum trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite of the gut microbiota widely reported to affect cognition. The findings indicate that imbalance of the gut microbiota induces ER stress in the cerebral cortex, which may be mediated by TMAO.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

In this study, we designed a series of dedicated WMH labeling protocols and proposed a convolutional neural network named 2D VB-Net for the segmentation of WMH and other coexisting intracranial lesions based on a large dataset of 1,045 subjects across various demographics and multiple scanners using 2D thick-slice protocols that are more commonly applied in clinical practice. Using our labeling pipeline, the Dice consistency of the WMH regions manually depicted by two observers was 0.878, which formed a solid basis for the development and evaluation of the automatic segmentation system. The proposed algorithm outperformed other state-of-the-art methods (uResNet, 3D V-Net and Visual Geometry Group network) in the segmentation of WMH and other coexisting intracranial lesions and was well validated on datasets with thick-slice magnetic resonance (MR) images and the 2017 medical image computing and computer assisted intervention WMH Segmentation Challenge dataset (with thin-slice MR images), all showing excellent effectiveness. Furthermore, our method can subclassify WMH to display the WMH distributions and is very lightweight. Additionally, in terms of correlation to visual rating scores, our algorithm showed excellent consistency with the manual delineations and was overall better than those from other competing methods. In conclusion, we developed an automatic WMH quantification framework for multiple application scenarios, exhibiting a promising future in clinical practice.","misc","christiaan","protocol"

Although previous studies have selectively investigated the localization of amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition in certain brain regions, a comprehensive characterization of the rostro-caudal distribution of Aβ plaques in the brain and their inter-regional correlation remain unexplored. Our results demonstrated remarkable working and spatial memory deficits in 9-month-old 5xFAD mice compared to wildtype mice. High Aβ plaque load was detected in the somatosensory cortex, piriform cortex, thalamus, and dorsal/ventral hippocampus; moderate levels of Aβ plaques were observed in the motor cortex, orbital cortex, visual cortex, and retrosplenial dysgranular cortex; and low levels of Aβ plaques were located in the amygdala, and the cerebellum; but no Aβ plaques were found in the hypothalamus, raphe nuclei, vestibular nucleus, and cuneate nucleus. Interestingly, the deposition of Aβ plaques was positively associated with brain inter-regions including the prefrontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, medial amygdala, thalamus, and the hippocampus. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive morphological profile of Aβ deposition in the brain and its inter-regional correlation. This suggests an association between Aβ plaque deposition and specific brain regions in AD pathogenesis.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

It has been hypothesized that cumulative impairments in multiple domains affect functional reserve of swallowing with age, but the multifactorial etiology and postulated compensatory strategies of the brain are incompletely understood. This study investigates presbyphagia and its neural correlates, focusing on the clinical determinants associated with adaptive neuroplasticity. 64 subjects over 70 years of age free of typical diseases explaining dysphagia received comprehensive workup including flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), magnetoencephalography (MEG) during swallowing and pharyngeal stimulation, volumetry of swallowing muscles, laboratory analyzes, and assessment of hand-grip-strength, nutritional status, frailty, olfaction, cognition and mental health. Neural MEG activation was compared between participants with and without presbyphagia in FEES, and associated clinical influencing factors were analyzed. Presbyphagia was defined as the presence of oropharyngeal swallowing alterations e.g., penetration, aspiration, pharyngeal residue pooling or premature bolus spillage into the piriform sinus and/or laryngeal vestibule. 32 of 64 participants showed swallowing alterations, mainly characterized by pharyngeal residue, whereas the airway was rarely compromised. In the MEG analysis, participants with presbyphagia activated an increased cortical sensorimotor network during swallowing. As major clinical determinant, participants with swallowing alterations exhibited reduced pharyngeal sensation. Presbyphagia was an independent predictor of a reduced nutritional status in a linear regression model. Swallowing alterations frequently occur in otherwise healthy older adults and are associated with decreased nutritional status. Increased sensorimotor cortical activation may constitute a compensation attempt to uphold swallowing function due to sensory decline. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the swallowing alterations observed can be considered physiological per se or whether the concept of presbyphagia may need to be extended to a theory with a continuous transition between presbyphagia and dysphagia.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Cuproptosis is a recently reported form of cell death, which appears to result in the progression of various diseases. Therefore, our study aimed to explore cuproptosis-related molecular clusters in Alzheimer's disease and construct a prediction model. Based on the GSE33000 dataset, we analyzed the expression profiles of cuproptosis regulators and immune characteristics in Alzheimer's disease. Using 310 Alzheimer's disease samples, we explored the molecular clusters based on cuproptosis-related genes, along with the related immune cell infiltration. Cluster-specific differentially expressed genes were identified using the WGCNA algorithm. Subsequently, the optimal machine model was chosen by comparing the performance of the random forest model, support vector machine model, generalized linear model, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Nomogram, calibration curve, decision curve analysis, and three external datasets were applied for validating the predictive efficiency. The dysregulated cuproptosis-related genes and activated immune responses were determined between Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's disease controls. Two cuproptosis-related molecular clusters were defined in Alzheimer's disease. Analysis of immune infiltration suggested the significant heterogeneity of immunity between distinct clusters. Cluster2 was characterized by elevated immune scores and relatively higher levels of immune infiltration. Functional analysis showed that cluster-specific differentially expressed genes in Cluster2 were closely related to various immune responses. The Random forest machine model presented the best discriminative performance with relatively lower residual and root mean square error, and a higher area under the curve (AUC = 0.9829). A final 5-gene-based random forest model was constructed, exhibiting satisfactory performance in two external validation datasets (AUC = 0.8529 and 0.8333). The nomogram, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis also demonstrated the accuracy to predict Alzheimer's disease subtypes. Further analysis revealed that these five model-related genes were significantly associated with the Aβ-42 levels and β-secretase activity. Our study systematically illustrated the complicated relationship between cuproptosis and Alzheimer's disease, and developed a promising prediction model to evaluate the risk of cuproptosis subtypes and the pathological outcome of Alzheimer's disease patients.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The purpose of this study was to establish a visual model map of the articles in the field of neuroinflammation-induced MCI over the past 11 years to reveal the research hotspots and predict the future development trends in this field, which will help to promote the research and development for MCI. The neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment were used as search terms, and literature about neuroinflammation-induced MCI published between 2011 and 2021 was collected from the Web of Science. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to create visual model maps, and assess collaboration among different authors, countries, and institutions. Finally, the current research hotspots and future research directions were analyzed by using high-frequency keywords analysis and co-cited reference burst analysis. A total of 226 articles were retrieved. The number of publications in neuroinflammation-induced MCI shows an upward trend. Since 2018, the number of papers published in this field has increased significantly, with an average of more than 100 published each year. The United States had the highest literature production and the number of cited journals in this research area, and the National Institute on Aging was the most productive research institution.

Resting-state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to document neurological involvement in the two groups from the aspect of brain dysfunction. Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) starts decades ago before the onset of clinical symptoms and may already have been associated with brain function in high-risk populations. However, this study aims to compare the patterns of fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) maps between cognitively normal high-risk groups (SCD and T2DM) and healthy elderly and evaluate the association between regional amyloid deposition and local fALFF signals in certain cortical regions. A total of 18 T2DM, 11 SCD, and 18 healthy elderlies were included in this study. The differences in the fALFF maps were compared between HC and high-risk groups. Regional amyloid deposition and local fALFF signals were obtained and further correlated in two high-risk groups. Compared to HC, the altered fALFF signals of regions were shown in SCD such as the left posterior cerebellum, left putamen, and cingulate gyrus. The T2DM group illustrated altered neural activity in the superior temporal gyrus, supplementary motor area, and precentral gyrus. The correlation between fALFF signals and amyloid deposition was negative in the left anterior cingulate cortex for both groups. In the T2DM group, a positive correlation was shown in the right occipital lobe and left mesial temporal lobe. The altered fALFF signals were demonstrated in high-risk groups compared to HC. Very early amyloid deposition in SCD and T2DM groups was observed to affect the neural activity mainly involved in the default mode network (DMN).","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

We investigated whether a SFN intake intervention improved cognitive performance and mood states in healthy older adults. In a 12-week, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT), we randomly assigned 144 older adults to a SFN group or a placebo group. We asked the participants to take a supplement (SFN or placebo) for 12 weeks. We measured several cognitive functions, mood states, and biomarkers before and after the intervention period. The SFN group showed improvement in processing speed and a decrease in negative mood compared to the placebo group. In addition, the SFN group exhibited a higher SFN-N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) level compared to the placebo group. However, there were no significant results in other biomarkers of oxidant stress, inflammation, or neural plasticity. These results indicate that nutrition interventions using SFN can have positive effects on cognitive functioning and mood in healthy older adults.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"
"1013",35966785,"Enriched environment ameliorates propagation of tau pathology and improves cognition in rat model of tauopathy.","The typical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are cognitive impairment, disrupted spatial orientation, behavioral and psychiatric abnormalities, and later motor deficits. Neuropathologically, AD is characterized by deposits of pathological forms of endogenous proteins - amyloid-β, and neurofibrillary tau protein pathology. The latter closely correlates with brain atrophy and clinical impairment. Pharmacological therapies for these pathologies are largely absent, raising the question whether non-pharmacological interventions could be efficacious. Environmental factors can play a role in the manifestation of AD. It is unknown whether enriched environment (EE) can ameliorate the propagation of protein aggregates or their toxic components. We injected insoluble tau extracts from human brains with AD (600 or 900 ng per animal) into hippocampi of SHR72 transgenic rats that express non-mutated truncated human tau 151-391/4R, but usually do not develop hippocampal tangles. The rats had either standard housing, or could access an EE 5×/week for 3 months. Behavioral analysis included the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Histological analysis was used to assess the propagation of tau pathology. Animals exposed to EE performed better in the MWM (spatial acquisition duration and total distance, probe test); unexposed animals improved over the course of acquisition trials, but their mean performance remained below that of the EE group. Enriched environment abrogated tau propagation and hippocampal tangle formation in the 600 ng group; in the 900 ng group, tangle formation was ∼10-fold of the 600 ng group, and unaffected by EE. Even a small difference in the amount of injected human AD tau can cause a pronounced difference in the number of resulting tangles. EE leads to a noticeably better spatial navigation performance of tau-injected animals. Furthermore, EE seems to be able to slow down tau pathology progression, indicating the possible utility of similar interventions in early stages of AD where tangle loads are still low.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Although these changes have been demonstrated to be associated with the incidence of frailty in older adults, no studies have investigated this relationship in patients at high risk for vascular disease. In this longitudinal study, we followed outpatients with cardiometabolic diseases for a maximum of 6 years (median, 3 years) and evaluated the association of baseline DTI data of seven white matter tracts with the incidence of frailty. The modified version of the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria and the Kihon Checklist were used as indices of frailty; fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were used as indices of white matter changes. Patients who developed frailty based on both indices had low FA and high MD in many of the tracts tested, with the most significant difference found in the MD of the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR). Cox proportional hazard model analysis revealed a significantly high risk of frailty defined by both indices in the groups with high MD values in the left ATR. Similar results were found in patients with diabetes mellitus but not in those without diabetes mellitus. Therefore, abnormalities in the integrity of the left ATR could be associated with the progression of frailty in older adults with cardiometabolic disease, particularly those with diabetes mellitus.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Growing pediatric usage of anesthetics during painless procedures has raised concerns about the effect of low-dose anesthetics on neurodevelopment. It is urgent to ascertain the neuronal effect of low-dose Propofol, a widely used anesthetic in pediatrics, on developing brains. The behavioral tests after neonatal exposure to low-dose/high-dose Propofol in mice were conducted to clarify the cognitive effect. The nascent cells undergoing proliferation and differentiation stage in the hippocampus and cultured neural stem cells (NSCs) were further identified. In addition, single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), NSCs bulk RNA-seq, and metabolism trials were performed for pathway investigation. Furthermore, small interfering RNA and stereotactic adenovirus injection were, respectively, used in NSCs and hippocampal to confirm the underlying mechanism. Behavioral tests in mice showed enhanced spatial cognitive ability after being exposed to low-dose Propofol. Activated neurogenesis was observed both in hippocampal and cultured NSCs. Moreover, transcriptome analysis of snRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and metabolism trials revealed a significantly enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) level in NSCs. Furthermore, PGC-1α, a master regulator in mitochondria metabolism, was found upregulated after Propofol exposure both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, downregulation of PGC-1α remarkably prevented the effects of low-dose Propofol in activating OXPHOS and neurogenesis. Taken together, this study demonstrates a novel alteration of mitochondrial function in hippocampal neurogenesis after low-dose Propofol exposure, suggesting the safety, even potentially beneficial effect, of low-dose Propofol in pediatric use.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"
"1016",35966791,"Dynamic modeling of practice effects across the healthy aging-Alzheimer's disease continuum.","Standardized tests of learning and memory are sensitive to changes associated with both aging and superimposed neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, repeated behavioral test administration can be confounded by practice effects (PE), which may obscure declines in level of abilities and contribute to misdiagnoses. Growing evidence, however, suggests PE over successive longitudinal measurements may differentially predict cognitive status and risk for progressive decline associated with aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. Thus, when viewed as a reflection of neurocognitive plasticity, PE may reveal residual abilities that can add to our understanding of age- and disease-related changes in learning and memory. The present study sought to evaluate differences in PE and verbal recall in a clinically characterized aging cohort assessed on multiple occasions over 3 years. Participants included 256 older adults recently diagnosed as cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 126), or with MCI of amnestic (n = 65) or non-amnestic MCI (n = 2085), and multi-domain amnestic dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT; n = 45). We applied a continuous time structural equation modeling (ctsem) approach to verbal recall performance on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test in order to distinguish PE from individual occasion performance, coupled random changes, age trends, and differing measurement quality. Diagnoses of MCI and dementia were associated with lower recall performance on all trials, reduced PE gain per occasion, and differences in non-linear dynamic parameters. Practice self-feedback is a dynamic measure of the decay or acceleration in PE process changes over longitudinal occasions. As with PE and mean recall, estimated practice self-feedback followed a gradient from positive in CU participants to null in participants with diagnosed MCI and negative for those with dementia diagnoses. Evaluation of sensitivity models showed this pattern of variation in PE was largely unmodified by differences in age, sex, or educational attainment. These results show dynamic modeling of PE from longitudinal performance on standardized learning and memory tests can capture multiple aspects of behavioral changes in MCI and dementia. The present study provides a new perspective for modeling longitudinal change in verbal learning in clinical and cognitive aging research.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Conflicting reports of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) necessitate the exploration of novel therapeutic interventions using bioactive natural products having the least toxicity and a holistic mode of action for the preservation of metabolic homeodynamics with aging in women. The present study was planned to investigate the effects of aging and/or a high-fat diet (HFD) on cognitive impairments and anxiety and further their management by dietary supplement with the Tinospora cordifolia stem powder (TCP). Acyclic female rats were included in this study as the model system of the perimenopause phase of women along with young 3-4 months old rats as controls. Rats were fed on with and without TCP supplemented normal chow or HFD for 12 weeks. Animals fed on a TCP supplemented normal chow showed consistent management of body weight over a 12-week regimen although their calorie intake was much higher in comparison to their age-matched controls. Post-regimen, neurobehavioral tests, such as novel object recognition and elevated plus maze, performed on these animals showed improvement in their learning and memory abilities as well as the anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, due to the presence of multiple components, TCP was observed to modulate the expression of key marker proteins to ameliorate neuroinflammation and apoptosis and promote cell survival and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions of the brain. These findings suggest that TCP supplementation in diet during the midlife transition period in women may be a potential interventional strategy for the management of menopause-associated anxiety and cognitive impairments and healthy aging.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Recent studies suggested that the accumulation of inflammatory molecules and impaired protein degradation mechanisms might both play a critical role in the progression of AD. Autophagy is a major protein degradation pathway that can be controlled by several HECT-E3 ligases, which then regulates the expression of inflammatory molecules. E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to be upregulated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we studied the expressional change of HECT-E3 ligase using M01 on autophagy and inflammasome pathways in the context of AD pathogenesis. Our results demonstrated that the M01 treatment reversed the working memory deficits in 3xTg-AD mice when examined with the T-maze and reversal learning with the Morris water maze. Additionally, the electrophysiology recordings indicated that M01 treatment enhanced the long-term potentiation in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. Together with the improved memory performance, the expression levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome protein were decreased. On the other hand, autophagy-related molecules were increased in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. Furthermore, the protein docking analysis indicated that the binding affinity of M01 to the WWP1 and NEDD4 E3 ligases was the highest among the HECT family members. The western blot analysis also confirmed the decreased expression level of NEDD4 protein in the M01-treated 3xTg-AD mice. Overall, our results demonstrate that the modulation of HECT-E3 ligase expression level can be used as a strategy to treat early memory deficits in AD by decreasing NLRP3 inflammasome molecules and increasing the autophagy pathway.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

With the advancement of endoscopic DCR and the silicone stents, an update of the surgical outcomes and preferable approaches is required. This study aims at comparing the surgical outcomes of endoscopic DCR using pushed bicanalicular intubation (BCI) to pulled monocanalicular intubation (MCI) in adults with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO). Forty five eyes of 45 patients were enrolled, including 22 eyes of 22 patients treated with endoscopic DCR with pulled MCI and 23 eyes of 23 patients with pushed BCI from January 2014 to June 2021. The success rates at stent removal, 1 month and 3 months after removal were 95, 91, and 82%, respectively, in the MCI group, and 100, 87, and 87% in the BCI group. The BCI group had better success rates but failed to reach a significant difference (p = 0.49, p = 0.67, p = 0.24, respectively). After analyzing with binary logistic regression, the implant material was demonstrated as the predictive of surgical success (p = 0.045). There was no significant difference in success rates between patients with dacryocystitis and those without dacryocystitis. We conclude that endoscopic DCR with pushed BCI is easily manipulated and has a promising surgical outcome over pulled MCI. Stent indwelling duration as well as history of dacryocystitis have less influence on the success rates.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

The diagnostic criteria for septic cardiomyopathy has not been unified, which brings serious difficulties to clinical treatment. This study aimed to provide evidence for the early identification and intervention in patients with sepsis by clarifying the relationship between the ultrasound phenotype of septic cardiomyopathy and the prognosis of patients with sepsis. This was a multicenter, prospective cohort study. The study population will consist of all eligible consecutive patients with sepsis or septic shock who meet the Sepsis 3.0 diagnostic criteria and were aged ≥18 years. Clinical data and echocardiographic measurements will be recorded within 2 h, at the 24th hour, at the 72nd hour, and on the 7th day after admission. The prevalence of each phenotype will be described as well, and their association with prognosis will be analyzed statistically. To achieve early recognition, prevent reinjury, achieve precise treatment, and reduce mortality in patients with sepsis, it is important to identify septic cardiac alterations and classify the phenotypes at all stages of sepsis. First, there is a lack of studies on the prevalence of each phenotype in Chinese populations. Second, each phenotype and its corresponding prognosis are not clear. In addition, the prognosis of patients with normal cardiac ultrasound phenotypes vs. those with suppressed or hyperdynamic cardiac phenotypes is unclear. Finally, this study was designed to collect data at four specific timing, then the timing of occurrence, duration, changes over time, impact to outcomes of each phenotype will probably be found. This study is expected to establish a standard and objective method to assess the ultrasound phenotype of septic cardiomyopathy due to its advantages of visualization, non-invasiveness and reproducibility, and to provide more precise information for the hemodynamic management of septic patients. In addition, this research will promote the clinical application of critical care ultrasound, which will play an important role in medical education and make ultrasound the best method to assess cardiac changes in sepsis. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05161104, identifier NCT05161104.","protocol","christiaan","protocol"

To evaluate the de novo cytokines gene expression in the transition of atopic dermatitis symptoms to psoriasiform erythema during dupilumab treatment in children. Two 17-year-old teenage twin patients with AD were included in this study who developed psoriasiform erythema after initiation of dupilumab. The lesional skin biopsy specimens were obtained for the histopathological investigation and RNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (RNA-FISH). Dermoscopy, cytometry (cytokine detection in the blood), and blood investigations were completed for the pedigree and the lesioned descriptions. Two twin patients with AD presented with erythematic scaly plaques on the back, scalp, abdomen, and extensor extremities after 20 weeks of dupilumab treatment. The transitional change of AD to psoriasiform erythema treated with dupilumab was observed. Our subjects' dermoscopy showed pinpoint bleeding and white scales on pink background. Histopathology features showed psoriasiform hyperplasia, epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis), ectatic capillaries, perivascular lymphocytes infiltration, and parakeratosis, with the absence of the granular cell layer. mRNA (RNA-FISH) cytokines gene expression showed a significantly high concentration of IL-17A. Blood investigation results showed a high concentration of (Immunoglobulin E) IgE and Eosinophils, and cytokines detection in blood showed IL-5,6 and IL-17 in one patient; however, only IL-5 in another patient. The dupilumab was discontinued and initiated with Baricitinib. Baricitinib showed a significant reduction in skin lesions. Psoriasiform erythema can appear during dupilumab treatment in atopic dermatitis children. Potently, by suppressing skewed Th2 activation in patients with AD, the balance might shift toward Th1/Th17 predominance, and psoriasis develops. Baricitinib is a potential drug for psoriasiform erythema with significant therapeutic effects.","misc","christiaan","misc"

As antibiotic stewardship requirements are being deployed for the outpatient setting, community providers are facing systematic challenges in implementing stewardship programs. Given that the vast majority of antibiotics are prescribed in the outpatient setting, there are endless opportunities to make a smart and informed choice when prescribing and to move the needle on antibiotic stewardship. Antibiotic stewardship in the community, or smart prescribing as we suggest, should factor in antibiotic efficacy, safety, local resistance rates, and overall cost, in addition to patient-specific factors and disease presentation, to arrive at an appropriate therapy. Here, we discuss some of the challenges, such as patient/parent pressure to prescribe, lack of data or resources for implementation, and a disconnect between guidelines and real-world practice, among others. We have assembled an easy-to-use best practice guide for providers in the outpatient setting who lack the time or resources to develop a plan or consult lengthy guidelines. We provide specific suggestions for antibiotic prescribing that align real-world clinical practice with best practices for antibiotic stewardship for two of the most common bacterial infections seen in the outpatient setting: community-acquired pneumonia and skin and soft-tissue infection. In addition, we discuss many ways that community providers, payors, and regulatory bodies can make antibiotic stewardship easier to implement and more streamlined in the outpatient setting.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Two reviewers independently conducted data extraction and analyses. Seventysix systematic review papers were included in the study. We identified eight types of interventions based on medical error type classification: overall medical error, medication error, diagnostic error, patients fall, healthcare-associated infections, transfusion and testing errors, surgical error, and patient suicide. Most studies focused on medication error (66%) and were conducted in hospital settings (74%). Despite a plethora of suggested interventions, patient safety has not significantly improved. Therefore, policymakers need to focus more on the implementation considerations of selected interventions.","systematic_review","christiaan","systematic_review"

In this study, we aimed to examine the occurrence rate of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among DM patients and its incidence rate between different treatments. This cohort study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 1997 and 2013 to evaluate the primary outcomes of the preventive role of sulfonylureas or biguanides in the development of RA. We used the Chi-square test for categorical variables and Cox proportional hazard regression and log-rank test to explore the time for development of RA in DM patients. Logistic regression was adopted to estimate the odds ratio of RA in different dosages of medication exposure. Our cohort study included 94,141 DM cases. The risk of RA development of non-sulfonylureas/biguanides users among the DM group in each analysis was set as the reference, and the adjusted hazard ratio of RA in DM patients who were using sulfonylureas or biguanides was 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.60-0.90). Within 1 year before the index date, compared with no-biguanides users, patients with more than 180 days of prescription of biguanides had a significantly lower RA risk. Similarly, the significantly lower risk of RA was still observed in DM patients who had more than 365 days of prescription of sulfonylurea within 2 or 3 years before the index date of first RA visit (all p < 0.05). Our data suggest that sulfonylureas or biguanides are associated with a lower rate of RA development in patients with DM; the effect of biguanides appeared more rapid than that of sulfonylureas, but the sulfonylureas might have a longer effect on lowering RA development incidence.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Given the lower availability of transient elastography, we aimed to assess the longitudinal variation of two non-invasive liver fibrosis scores, APRI and Fib-4, in cases with HIV monoinfection, HIV-HBV co-infection and individuals with HBsAg-seroclearance. We performed an observational retrospective study between 2013 and 2019 on 212 HIV patients including 111 individuals with HIV mono-infection, 62 individuals with HIV-HBV co-infection and positive HBsAg and 39 cases with HIV-HBV infection and HBsAg-loss. The groups were followed at 36, 48, and 60 months. Liver fibrosis was indicated by an APRI >0.5 or Fib-4≥1.45 score and advanced fibrosis by an APRI score >1.5 or Fib-4 >3.25. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to assess the predictors for the presence of liver fibrosis over time. During a median follow-up of 58.5 months the prevalence of liver fibrosis in all patients increased with 0.5% reaching 11.3% using an APRI score and with 0.9% reaching 10.8% using the Fib-4 score. At the visit corresponding to 60 months the prevalence of liver fibrosis was higher in all HIV-HBV patients compared with individuals with HIV mono-infection, namely: 16.1% on APRI and 12.9% on the Fib-4 score in HIV-HBV/HBsAg-positive individuals, 12.8% on both APRI and Fib-4 scores in HIV-HBV/HBsAg-negative individuals vs. 8.1 and 9%, respectively in HIV mono-infection. The presence of liver fibrosis over the study period was independently associated with plasma HIV RNA, CD4+T cell counts, HIV-HBV co-infection (for APRI >0.5) and ART non-adherence (for Fib-4 >1.45). At the final visit, non-adherence to ART and CD4+T cell counts remained associated with liver fibrosis. The study found a slow progression of APRI and Fib-4 scores over time in young PLWH with extensive ART. Liver fibrosis scores continued to increase in patients with HIV mono-infection yet remained lower than in HIV-HBV patients irrespective on the presence of HBsAg. The periodic follow-up using non-invasive scores on the long-term could help improve the surveillance in low-income settings and high scores should be followed by additional diagnostic methods.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

This study aimed to visualize the knowledge structure and identify emerging research trends and potential hotspots in this field. Articles and reviews on RA-CVD published from 2001 to 2021 were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database. CiteSpace and VOSviewer software were used to visualize the knowledge network of countries, institutions, authors, references and keywords in this field. SPSS and Microsoft Excel software were used for curve fitting and correlation analysis. A total of 2,618 articles and reviews were included. The number of publications about RA-related CVD significantly increased yearly. Publications were mainly concentrated in North America, Europe and East Asia. The United States contributed most with 699 publications, followed by the United Kingdom and Italy. Gross Domestic Product was an important factor affecting scientific output. University of Manchester and Professor Kitas George D. were the most prolific institutions and influential authors, respectively. Journal of Rheumatology was the most productive journal for RA-related CVD research. The research hotspots switched in the order of clinical features (cardiovascular events), mechanism exploration, anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, risk factors, and antirheumatic drug safety, which can be observed from the keyword analysis and co-cited reference cluster analysis. This study found that research on RA-related CVD is flourishing. The safety and cardiovascular pharmacological mechanisms of anti-rheumatoid drugs, especially targeted synthetic DMARDs, would be the focus of current research and developmental trends in future research.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This study aimed to investigate the infection by SARS-CoV-2 in children with newly-diagnosed T1D to explore a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 infection, T1D and DKA. Thirty-nine children with a T1D new onset between October 15, 2020, and April 15, 2021, were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 infection was investigated through a polymerase chain reaction on the nasal swab, dosage of specific antibodies, and an anamnestic question form. Nine (23%) of them had antibodies directed toward SARS-CoV-2, and five (12%) had a history of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection in themselves or in their family. No molecular swabs were positive. Compared to the general pediatric population, the overall incidence of COVID-19 was 5.6 times higher in the T1D patients' group (p < 0.00001). Referring only to the cases in the metropolitan area, we find a net increase in the incidence of T1D compared to the 5 years preceding our study, by 50% compared to the same months in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018, by 69% compared to 2018/2019 and by 77% compared to 2019/2020. The same trend was observed regarding DKA cases. The attributable risk of the pandemic cohort compared to the previous year is 44%. The abnormal disproportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection between children with T1D and the pediatric reference population, with a ratio of 5.6, appears to support the causative role of SARS-CoV-2 in triggering the immune response underlying diabetes, as often described for other viral infections. The difficulty accessing care services during the pandemic, with a consequent diagnosis delay, does not justify the increase in observed T1D cases, which could to be directly linked to the pandemic. The acceleration of the immune process provoked by SARS-CoV-2 may play a suggestive role in the development of T1D with DKA. Multicenter studies are needed to deepen and fully understand the pathophysiological link between SARS-CoV-2 and the onset of T1D in children.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

After obtaining ethical clearance double-blinded single centered a randomized controlled trial was conducted in a total of 86 pregnant mothers who were randomly allocated into two groups by computer-generated random number. Approximately 1 ml of 10 mg preservative-free pethidine was added to 12.5 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia in the treatment group and 12.5 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine alone was given in the control group. Incidence and severity of shivering, as well as adverse effect was recorded intraoperatively, in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and ward. Independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square were used for analysis. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Shivering was observed in 53.5 and 20.9% in the control and treatment groups, respectively, which was statistically significant with p = 0.002. The risk of developing shivering was reduced by 61% in the treatment group with (RR = 0.39 and CI of 0.205-0.745); the intensity of shivering was also higher in the control group than in the treatment group with p = 0.004. Considering an adverse effect, the incidence of PONV was not significantly different between with p > 0.05 while the incidence of pruritus was higher in the treatment group than the control group with p = 0.003. Adding 10 mg of preservative free pethidine intrathecally during spinal anesthesia is effective in reducing incidence and severity of shivering, without causing significant adverse effects on mother.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"

Alkaline phosphatase (AP), an endogenous enzyme that de-phosphorylates extracellular ATP, likely plays an anti-inflammatory role in immune responses. We hypothesized that ilofotase alfa, a human recombinant AP, protects kidneys from ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), a model of acute kidney injury (AKI), by metabolizing extracellular ATP to adenosine, which is known to activate adenosine receptors. Ilofotase alfa (iv) with or without ZM241,385 (sc), a selective adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonist, was administered 1 h before bilateral IRI in WT, A2AR KO (Adora2a-/- ) or CD73-/- mice. In additional studies recombinant alkaline phosphatase was given after IRI. In an AKI-on-chronic kidney disease (CKD) ischemic rat model, ilofotase alfa was given after the three instances of IRI and rats were followed for 56 days. Ilofotase alfa in a dose dependent manner decreased IRI in WT mice, an effect prevented by ZM241,385 and partially prevented in Adora2a-/- mice. Enzymatically inactive ilofotase alfa was not protective. Ilofotase alfa rescued CD73-/- mice, which lack a 5'-ectonucleotidase that dephosphorylates AMP to adenosine; ZM241,385 inhibited that protection. In both rats and mice ilofotase alfa ameliorated IRI when administered after injury, thus providing relevance for therapeutic dosing of ilofotase alfa following established AKI. In an AKI-on-CKD ischemic rat model, ilofotase alfa given after the third instance of IRI reduced injury. These results suggest that ilofotase alfa promotes production of adenosine from liberated ATP in injured kidney tissue, thereby amplifying endogenous mechanisms that can reverse tissue injury, in part through A2AR-and non-A2AR-dependent signaling pathways.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Plasma fetuin-A levels were significantly lower in patients with sepsis, but data regarding CAP are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of fetuin-A as a prognostic biomarker of CAP. A multicenter cohort study on CAP was conducted between January 2017 and December 2018. Demographic and clinical data were recorded for all enrolled patients. Plasma fetuin-A levels were determined using a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to analyse the effect of variables on 30-day mortality. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors associated with severe CAP (SCAP) and 30-day mortality. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to verify the association between variables and CAP prognosis. Correlations were assessed using Spearman's test. Survival curves were constructed and compared using the log-rank test. A total of 283 patients with CAP were enrolled in this study. Fetuin-A levels were decreased in patients with CAP, especially in SCAP and non-survivors. A cox regression analysis showed that CURB-65 and fetuin-A levels were independent prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality. Via a multiple logistic regression analysis, plasma level of fetuin-A (<202.86 mg/L) was determined to be the strongest independent predictor of 30-day mortality considered (odds ratio, 57.365), and also was also determined to be an independent predictor of SCAP. The area under the curve (AUC) of fetuin-A for predicting 30-day mortality was 0.871, and accuracy was high (P < 0.05). Plasma fetuin-A levels were negatively correlated with WBC, NE%, Glu, CRP, PCT, CURB-65, and pneumonia severity index scores and positively correlated with albumin level. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that lower plasma levels of fetuin-A levels were associated with increased 30-day mortality levels (P < 0.0001). Plasma fetuin-A levels were decreased in patients with CAP. Fetuin-A can reliably predict mortality in patients with CAP, and is a useful diagnostic indicator of SCAP.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Between January 2010 to January 2020, out of 1,030 eligible patients requiring VA-ECMO, 427 with analyzable vascular screening were included. Duplex sonography and/or CT scan after decannulation were used to screen for thrombosis and pulmonary embolism as well as arterial complications. Near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) was established at the time of cannulation and was continuously monitored during the ECMO therapy. The prevalence of venous complications was 27%. Thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were observed in 21 and 7% of patients, respectively. Pulmonary embolism was more frequently diagnosed in patients with thrombosis (22 vs. 3%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, cannulation in the jugular vein was determined as a risk factor for venous thrombosis in contrast to the extent of anticoagulation. The prevalence of arterial complications was 37%, mainly ischemia followed by bleeding, dissection, and compartment syndrome. Vascular surgery was necessary for 19% of the patients, of whome 1% required major amputations. A distal perfusion cannula (DPC) was implanted at cannulation in 24% of patients and secondarily in 16% of patients after cannulation as required during ECMO support. In the multivariate analysis, risk factors for leg ischemia at the time of cannulation were elevated D-dimers, lower NIRS on the cannulated leg, and lack of a DPC. The best discriminative parameter was the difference in NIRS between the non-cannulated leg and the cannulated leg. In contrast, during ECMO support, only the lack of a DPC was associated with leg ischemia. A similar rate of complications associated with decannulation, mainly arterial thrombosis, ischemia, or bleeding, was seen with percutaneous and surgical approaches (18 vs. 17%, p = 0.295). Patients requiring VA ECMO should be routinely screened for vascular complications. The decision to insert a DPC should be evaluated individually. However, NIRS monitoring of the cannulated leg and the non-cannulated leg is essential to identify the legs at risk for critical ischemia. As complications associated with decannulation were equally distributed between percutaneous and surgical approaches, the applied method may be chosen according to local experience.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

The American Cancer Society estimated about 34,500 deaths from prostate cancer in the United States in year 2022. The Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a major pathway that sustains local and metastatic prostate tumor growth. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer patient and can suppress the tumor growth for a median of 2-3 years. Unfortunately, the malignancy inevitably progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which is more aggressive and no longer responsive to ADT. Surprisingly, for most of the CPRC patients, cancer growth still depends on androgen receptor signaling. Accumulating evidence suggests that CRPC cells have rewired their transcriptional program to retain AR signaling in the absence of androgens. Besides AR, other transcription factors also contribute to the resistance mechanism through multiple pathways including enhancing AR signaling pathway and activating other complementary signaling pathways for the favor of AR downstream genes expression. More recent studies have shown the role of transcription factors in reconfiguring chromatin 3D structure and regulating topologically associating domains (TADs). Pioneer factors, transcription factors and coactivators form liquid-liquid phase separation compartment that can modulate transcriptional events along with configuring TADs. The role of AR and other transcription factors on chromatin structure change and formation of condensate compartment in prostate cancer cells has only been recently investigated and appreciated. This review intends to provide an overview of transcription factors that contribute to AR signaling through activation of gene expression, governing 3D chromatin structure and establishing phase to phase separation. A more detailed understanding of the spatial role of transcription factors in CRPC might provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of CRPC.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Abdominal CT revealed a heterogeneous mass in the rectum and thickening of one caudal mesenteric lymph node. The mass induced a focal rectal obstruction. Cytological evaluation of fine-needle aspirates showed signs of mixed inflammation for the rectal mass and a reactive lymph node. Because a definite diagnosis was not achieved, complete resection of the mass via a dorsal approach to the rectum was attempted. Histopathology confirmed complete removal and diagnosed feline gastrointestinal eosinophilic sclerosing fibroplasia (FGESF). The cat was treated with psyllium husks and lactulose after surgery. In the postoperative year, the owner reported normal behaviour, food intake and defecation of the patient. Dyschezia reoccurred 14 months after surgery. Imaging revealed recurrence of a rectal mass. Owing to clinical deterioration, the owner elected for euthanasia. This is the first report of rectal FGESF with dyschezia and weight loss as the main clinical signs. The case demonstrates an acceptable outcome for more than 1 year without additional immunosuppressive therapy, and emphasises that FGESF must be considered as a differential diagnosis for rectal masses in cats.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Sampling was conducted during the 1st quarter International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) on board the Danish R/V DANA (DTU Aqua Denmark) and the Swedish R/V Svea (SLU Sweden), as part of the ichthyoplankton investigation during night-time. A total of 147 stations were investigated in the western, central and eastern North Sea as well as the Skagerrak and Kattegat. Sampling was conducted with a 13 m long Midwater Ring Net (MIK net, Ø 2 m, mesh size 1.6 mm, cod end with smaller mesh size of 500 µm), equipped with a flow meter. The MIK net was deployed in double oblique hauls from the surface to c. 5 m above the sea floor [1,2]. Samples were visually analysed unpreserved on a light table and/or with a stereomicroscope or magnifying lamp within 2 hours after catch. A total of 13,510 individuals were counted/sized. Twelve gelatinous macrozooplankton species or genera were encountered, namely the hydrozoan Aequorea vitrina, Aglantha digitale, Clytia spp., Leuckartiara octona, Tima bairdii, Muggiaea atlantica; the scyphozoans Cyanea capillata and Cyanea lamarckii and the ctenophores Beroe spp., Bolinopsis infundibulum, Mnemiopsis leidyi, Pleurobrachia pileus. Abundance data are presented on a volume specific (m-3) and area specific (m-2) basis. Size data have been used to estimate wet weights based on published length-weight regressions (see Table 1). For the groups i) hydrozoan jellyfish, ii) scyphozoan jellyfish, iii) ctenophores, as well as iv) grouped gelatinous macrozooplankton, spatial weight specific distribution patterns are presented. This unpublished dataset contributes baseline information about the gelatinous macrozooplankton diversity and its specific distribution patterns in the extended North Sea area during winter (January-February) 2021. These data can be an important contribution to address global change impacts on marine systems, especially considering gelatinous macrozooplankton abundance changes in relation to anthropogenic stressors.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The HRES under consideration consists of solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, lithium-ion batteries, and diesel generators. The islands were identified from Google Maps™, Bing Maps™, and the study of Meschede and Ocon et al. (2019) [1]. The peak loads of these islands were acquired from National Power Corporation - Small Power Utilities Group (NPC-SPUG), if available, or estimated from the island population otherwise. Hourly-resolution load profiles were synthesized using the normalized profiles reported by Bertheau and Blechinger (2018) [2]. Existing diesel generators in the islands were compiled from reports by NPC-SPUG, while monthly average global horizontal irradiance and wind speeds were taken from the Phil-LIDAR 2 database. Islands that are electrically interconnected were lumped into one microgrid, so the 634 islands were grouped into 616 microgrids. The HRES were optimized using Island System LCOEmin Algorithm (ISLA), our in-house energy systems modeling tool, which sized the energy components to minimize the net present cost. The component sizes and corresponding techno-economic metrics of the optimized HRES in each microgrid are included in the dataset. In addition, the net present value, internal rate of return, payback period, and subsidy requirements of the microgrid are reported at five different electricity rates. This data is valuable for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders who are working to provide sustainable energy access to off-grid communities.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess this relationship, and to evaluate the associated factors of diabetes self-care, social support, and glycemic control in Egyptian PHC patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). A cross-sectional study was conducted on 320 T2DM patients at four PHC settings in Port Said city, affiliated with the General Authority of Healthcare. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data, including demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status scale, disease profile, the Arabic versions of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities, and the received social support scales. Data were collected from January 2020 to June 2020. Diabetes self-care activities, and self-monitoring of blood glucose had a very weak negative correlations with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (rho = - 0.125, p = 0.025, rho = - 0.112, p = 0.044, respectively). Receiving social support on following a meal correlated positively and very weakly with HbA1c levels (rho = 0.145, p = 0.010). Hardly positive correlation was found between receiving emotional support on feelings about diabetes, and following a specific diet (rho = 0.169, p = 0.002). Diabetes self-care activities were positively associated with higher education levels, and elevated BMI. Received social support was negatively associated with having coronary artery disease, and marital status e.g. divorced and widow. Increased age, and female gender were the predictors of good glycemic control. Diabetes self-care activities were linked with reduced HBA1c levels. Further studies are needed to evaluate the buffering effect of social support on glycemic outcomes in PHC patients with T2DM.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Correct interpretation of phenotypes depends upon knowledge of the Cre expression pattern in the chosen mouse driver line to ensure that appropriate cell types are targeted.

Here we compare a widely used pan-neuronal mouse Cre driver line, Syn1-cre, with a little-known alternative, Snap25-IRES2-cre. Our results show that the Syn1-cre line broadly expresses in the brain but is indetectable in more than half of all neurons and weakly active in testes. In contrast the Snap25-IRES2-cre line expressed Cre in a high proportion of neurons (~85%) and was indetectable in all non-brain tissues that were analysed, including testes.

A key finding is the recognition of mesenteric continuity, which extends from the oesophagogastric junction to the mesorectal level. All abdominal digestive organs develop within, or on, the mesentery and in adulthood remain directly connected to the mesentery. Identification of mesenteric continuity has enabled division of the abdomen into two separate compartments. These are the mesenteric domain (upon which the abdominal digestive system is centered) and the non-mesenteric domain, which comprises the urogenital system, musculoskeletal frame, and great vessels. Given this anatomical endpoint differs significantly from conventional descriptions, a reappraisal of mesenteric developmental anatomy was recently performed.

As the field moves toward clinical implementation of AAC-BCI systems, research involving participants with SSPI is essential. Research has demonstrated variability in AAC-BCI system performance across users, and mixed results for comparisons of performance for users with and without disabilities. The aims of this systematic review were to (1) describe study, system, and participant characteristics reported in BCI research, (2) summarize the communication task performance of participants with disabilities using AAC-BCI systems, and (3) explore any differences in performance for participants with and without disabilities. Electronic databases were searched in May, 2018, and March, 2021, identifying 6065 records, of which 73 met inclusion criteria. Non-experimental study designs were common and sample sizes were typically small, with approximately half of studies involving five or fewer participants with disabilities. There was considerable variability in participant characteristics, and in how those characteristics were reported. Over 60% of studies reported an average selection accuracy ≤70% for participants with disabilities in at least one tested condition. However, some studies excluded participants who did not reach a specific system performance criterion, and others did not state whether any participants were excluded based on performance. Twenty-nine studies included participants both with and without disabilities, but few reported statistical analyses comparing performance between the two groups. Results suggest that AAC-BCI systems show promise for supporting communication for people with SSPI, but they remain ineffective for some individuals. The lack of standards in reporting outcome measures makes it difficult to synthesize data across studies. Further research is needed to demonstrate efficacy of AAC-BCI systems for people who experience SSPI of varying etiologies and severity levels, and these individuals should be included in system design and testing. Consensus in terminology and consistent participant, protocol, and performance description will facilitate the exploration of user and system characteristics that positively or negatively affect AAC-BCI use, and support innovations that will make this technology more useful to a broader group of people. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42018095345, PROSPERO: CRD42018095345.","systematic_review","christiaan","systematic_review"

However, current BCIs are unable to sufficiently use the information from time and frequency domains simultaneously. Thus, we proposed a novel hybrid time-frequency paradigm to investigate better ways of using the time and frequency information. We adopt multiple omitted stimulus potential (OSP) and steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP) to design the hybrid paradigm. A series of pre-experiments were undertaken to study factors that would influence the feasibility of the hybrid paradigm and the interaction between multiple features. After that, a novel Multiple Time-Frequencies Sequential Coding (MTFSC) strategy was introduced and explored in experiments. Omissions with multiple short and long durations could effectively elicit time and frequency features, including the multi-OSP, ERP, and SSVEP in this hybrid paradigm. The MTFSC was feasible and efficient. The preliminary online analysis showed that the accuracy and the ITR of the nine-target stimulator over thirteen subjects were 89.04% and 36.37 bits/min. This study first combined the SSMVEP and multi-OSP in a hybrid paradigm to produce robust and abundant time features for coding BCI. Meanwhile, the MTFSC proved feasible and showed great potential in improving performance, such as expanding the number of BCI targets by better using time information in specific stimulated frequencies. This study holds promise for designing better BCI systems with a novel coding method.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1051",35966994,"Electrical stimulation mapping in the medial prefrontal cortex induced auditory hallucinations of episodic memory: A case report.","It has been well documented that the auditory system in the superior temporal cortex is responsible for processing basic auditory sound features, such as sound frequency and intensity, while the prefrontal cortex is involved in higher-order auditory functions, such as language processing and auditory episodic memory. The temporal auditory cortex has vast forward anatomical projections to the prefrontal auditory cortex, connecting with the lateral, medial, and orbital parts of the prefrontal cortex. The connections between the auditory cortex and the prefrontal cortex thus help in localizing, recognizing, and comprehending external auditory inputs. In addition, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is believed to be a core region of episodic memory retrieval and is one of the most important regions in the default mode network (DMN). However, previous neural evidence with regard to the comparison between basic auditory processing and auditory episodic memory retrieval mainly comes from fMRI studies. The specific neural networks and the corresponding critical frequency bands of neuronal oscillations underlying the two auditory functions remain unclear. In the present study, we reported results of direct cortical stimulations during stereo-electro-encephalography (SEEG) recording in a patient with drug-resistant epilepsy. Electrodes covered the superior temporal gyrus, the operculum and the insula cortex of bilateral hemispheres, the prefrontal cortex, the parietal lobe, the anterior and middle cingulate cortex, and the amygdala of the left hemisphere. Two types of auditory hallucinations were evoked with direct cortical stimulations, which were consistent with the habitual seizures. The noise hallucinations, i.e., I could hear buzzing noises in my head, were evoked with the stimulation of the superior temporal gyrus. The episodic memory hallucinations I could hear a young woman who was dressed in a red skirt saying: What is the matter with you?, were evoked with the stimulation of MPFC. The patient described how she had met this young woman when she was young and that the woman said the same sentence to her. Furthermore, by analyzing the high gamma power (HGP) induced by direct electrical stimulation, two dissociable neural networks underlying the two types of auditory hallucinations were localized. Taken together, the present results confirm the hierarchical processing of auditory information by showing the different involvements of the primary auditory cortex vs. the prefrontal cortex in the two types of auditory hallucinations.","misc","christiaan","misc"

"1053",35967001,"Alterations in motor modules and their contribution to limitations in force control in the upper extremity after stroke.","The generation of isometric force at the hand can be mediated by activating a few motor modules. Stroke induces alterations in motor modules underlying steady-state isometric force generation in the human upper extremity (UE). However, how the altered motor modules impact task performance (force production) remains unclear as stroke survivors develop and converge to the three-dimensional (3D) target force. Thus, we tested whether stroke-specific motor modules would be activated from the onset of force generation and also examined how alterations in motor modules would induce changes in force representation. During 3D isometric force development, electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded from eight major elbow and shoulder muscles in the paretic arm of 10 chronic hemispheric stroke survivors and both arms of six age-matched control participants. A non-negative matrix factorization algorithm identified motor modules in four different time windows: three exploratory force ramping phases (Ramps 1-3; 0-33%, 33-67%, and 67-100% of target force magnitude, respectively) and the stable force match phase (Hold). Motor module similarity and between-force coupling were examined by calculating the scalar product and Pearson correlation across the phases. To investigate the association between the end-point force representation and the activation of the motor modules, principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate multiple linear regression analyses were applied. In addition, the force components regressed on the activation profiles of motor modules were utilized to model the feasible force direction. Both stroke and control groups developed exploratory isometric forces with a non-linear relationship between EMG and force. During the force matching, only the stroke group showed abnormal between-force coupling in medial-lateral and backward-forward and medial-lateral and downward-upward directions. In each group, the same motor modules, including the abnormal deltoid module in stroke survivors, were expressed from the beginning of force development instead of emerging during the force exploration. The PCA and the multivariate multiple linear regression analyses showed that alterations in motor modules were associated with abnormal between-force coupling and limited feasible force direction after stroke. Overall, these results suggest that alterations in intermuscular coordination contribute to the abnormal end-point force control under isometric conditions in the UE after stroke.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

The current work aims to provide a richer understanding of DM1 imbalance. Standing balance in 16 patients and 40 controls was tested in two posturographic tests (EquiTest™). In the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), standstill balance was challenged by combining visual (eyes open vs. closed) and environmental conditions (fixed vs. sway-tuned platform and/or visual surround). In the react test, reflexes induced by sudden shifts in the support base were studied. Oscillations of the body centre of mass (COM) were measured. In the SOT, COM sway was larger in patients than controls in any condition, including firm support with eyes open (quiet standing). On sway-tuned support, COM oscillations when standing with closed eyes were larger in patients than controls even after taking into account the oscillations with eyes open. In the react paradigm, balance reflexes were delayed in patients. Results in both experimental paradigms (i.e., SOT and react test) are consistent with leg muscle weakness. This, however, is not a sufficient explanation. The SOT test highlighted that patients rely on vision more than controls to maintain static balance. Consistently enough, evidence is provided that an impairment of proprioceptive and vestibular systems contributes to falls in DM1. Rehabilitation programs targeted at reweighting sensory systems may be designed to improve safe mobility in DM1.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

In this paper, the interference effect between branches on oil recovery is studied in three steps. First, the interferences between fishbone wells with different branch angles were measured by hydro-electric simulation experiments. Second, two-dimensional visualization water flooding experiments were carried out to clarify the remaining oil distribution at different branch angles. Third, the distribution of oil and water in fishbone wells was verified by establishing a numerical model. The modeling results agree well with the experimental phenomena. At the same time, the variation trend of water and oil production in each branch is analyzed by numerical simulation results.

Herein, a true triaxial stress loading and permeability testing device was designed and fabricated, and a permeability evaluation model was established under various states, which can realize the accurate measurement of multiple faces and the total permeability of tight specimens before and after hydraulic fracturing. It can directly measure permeability under the conditions of the true triaxial fracture propagation experiment. The comparative experimental result shows that the new technique can quantitatively evaluate the fracture propagation experiment of true triaxial hydraulic fracturing. The overall permeability and the directional permeability of the five faces were obtained, and the fracture propagation was evaluated by comparing the change in permeability. The test permeability error rate is within ±10%. Furthermore, a more refined evaluation of hydraulic fracturing fracture propagation can be carried out based on the fracture observation and AE event results.

The low-field nuclear magnetic resonance equipment was used to characterize the peak area, pore size distribution, and pore number of each group of coal samples. The pore transformation effect of coal samples at different temperature intervals was compared, and the change characteristics of the pore structure of coal samples under the freeze-thaw action were explored. The research shows that the freeze-thaw cycles at different freezing temperature intervals have obvious differences in the effect of coal pore transformation. The area of each peak spectrum in the T 2 distribution curve of coal samples increased significantly under the action of freeze-thaw cycles in different freezing temperature intervals. The increased value of the number of mesopores and macropores shows the phenomenon of first increase and then decrease with the increase of the temperature difference. There is a quadratic function relationship between the temperature difference in the freezing temperature interval and the proportion change rate of the adsorption pore or seepage pore. The continuous increase of the temperature difference has a certain marginal effect on the proportion change rate of seepage pores and adsorption pores in coal.","misc","christiaan","misc"

In this paper, a series of Mo-modified pseudoboehmite supported Ni catalysts were developed and evaluated for efficient hydrogen production from formic acid. Pseudoboehmite (PB) as a catalyst carrier was used for the first time. Ni/PB and NiMo/PB possessed a mesostructure, and the pore size distribution was mainly concentrated between 2 and 20 nm. The oxygen vacancies caused by Mo enhanced Ni anchoring, thus inhibiting Ni sintering. Compared with Ni10/PB (7.62 nm), Ni10Mo1/PB had smaller Ni particles (5.08 nm). The Ni-O-Al solid solutions formed through the interaction of Ni with the PB improved the catalytic performance. Ni10Mo1/PB gave the highest conversion of 92.8% with a H2 selectivity of 98% at 300 °C, and the catalyst activity hardly decreased during the 50 h stability test. In short, Ni10Mo1/PB was a promising catalyst for hydrogen production from formic acid because of the oxygen vacancy anchoring effect as well as the formation of Ni-O-Al solid solutions which could effectively suppress the Ni sintering.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The results reveal that both the UCL and DCL gradually decrease as the metal ion concentrations increase, and high sensitivity is obtained for Cu2+ ions with a detection limit of 0.22 nM (∼650 nm) and 0.63 nM (∼976 nm). In addition, these SrF2:Nd3+/Yb3+/Er3+ NCs are further demonstrated to achieve a solid-state display under 980 nm excitation, exhibiting obvious red and green patterns by varying the doping rare earth ion concentrations.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1063",35967027,"Experimental Investigation of CO2-Induced Silica Gel as the Water Blocking Grout Effect of Aquifer Ions.","This study aimed to prevent water flow in microcracks and simultaneously achieve CO2 capture during grouting (CCG). Using sodium silicate (SS) as the primary material, the microcracks were grouted by a two-step approach. The low-initial-viscosity (5 mPa s) SS was first saturated within the microcracks followed by CO2 injection at 2 MPa. Through CO2 dissolution, silica gel was developed and tolerated a hydraulic pressure of up to 5.5 MPa. The effects of aquifer ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3 -, and SO4 2-) were equally evaluated at harsh conditions, and it was found that the strength of the silica gel was reduced, which was caused by salting out, low CO2 solubility, and precipitation. As a result, the hydraulic pressure was reduced to as low as 3 MPa. After 210 days, 16% of the silica gels (without ion inclusion) were reversible to the liquid phase, where a similar effect was found in the cases of Na+ and Mg2+ ions. The degradation increased with more Ca2+ ions (up to 55%) and decreased with more HCO3 - and SO4 2- ions. Microcracks grouted with CCG extended the CO2 utilization in grouting application. Combined with the effect of dissolved ions, the proposed approach is feasible in the field implementation for underground engineering under water bodies.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1064",35967031,"Hybrid Metal Oxide/Biochar Materials for Wastewater Treatment Technology: A Review.","This paper discusses the properties of metal oxide/biochar systems for use in wastewater treatment. Titanium, zinc, and iron compounds are most often combined with biochar; therefore, combinations of their oxides with biochar are the focus of this review. The first part of this paper presents the most important information about biochar, including its advantages, disadvantages, and possible modification, emphasizing the incorporation of inorganic oxides into its structure. In the next four sections, systems of biochar combined with TiO2, ZnO, Fe3O4, and other metal oxides are discussed in detail. In the next to last section probable degradation mechanisms are discussed. Literature studies revealed that the dispersion of a metal oxide in a carbonaceous matrix causes the creation or enhancement of surface properties and catalytic or, in some cases, magnetic activity. Addition of metallic species into biochars increases their weight, facilitating their separation by enabling the sedimentation process and thus facilitating the recovery of the materials from the water medium after the purification process. Therefore, materials based on the combination of inorganic oxide and biochar reveal a wide range of possibilities for environmental applications in aquatic media purification.","misc","christiaan","misc"

KRM-II-81 is active against many seizure and pain models in rodents, where it exhibits improved pharmacological properties over standard-of-care agents. Since salts can be utilized to create opportunities for increased solubility, enhanced absorption, and distribution, as well as for efficient methods of bulk synthesis, a hydrochloride salt of KRM-II-81 was prepared. KRM-II-81·HCl was produced from the free base with anhydrous hydrochloric acid. The formation of the monohydrochloride salt was confirmed by X-ray crystallography, as well as 1H NMR and 13C NMR analyses. High water solubility and a lower partition coefficient (octanol/water) were exhibited by KRM-II-81·HCl as compared to the free base. Oral administration of either KRM-II-81·HCl or the free base resulted in high concentrations in the brain and plasma of rats. Oral dosing in mice significantly increased the latency to both clonic and tonic convulsions and decreased pentylenetetrazol-induced lethality. The increased water solubility of the HCl salt enables intravenous dosing and the potential for higher concentration formulations compared with the free base without impacting anticonvulsant potency. Thus, KRM-II-81·HCl adds an important new compound to facilitate the development of these imidazodiazepines for clinical evaluation.","misc","christiaan","rodent"
"1067",35967039,"Geological Characteristics of Lower Paleozoic Shale Gas Accumulation in the Yuxi Region, Southern Sichuan Basin: In View of High-Density Methane Inclusions.","Twelve shale fracture veins and forty-nine fluid inclusion assemblages within the veins of 3800-4200 m in three wells located in different tectonic zones in the Yuxi Region, southern Sichuan Basin were selected in this study. The burial and thermal histories of single wells were reconstructed, and time-temperature-pressure of oil and gas filling were clarified using microscopy observation, Raman microprobe analyses, geochemical tests, and fluid inclusion microtemperature measurement. The shale fracture veins of the Wufeng-Longmaxi Formation in the Yuxi Region are mainly formed vertically and horizontally, where the vein-forming fluids are derived from endogenous fluids. A large number of methane inclusions, bituminous inclusions, and methane-bearing bituminous inclusions within the veins confirm the process of oil cracking gas and kerogen cracking gas. The homogeneous temperature (Th) of the aqueous inclusions contemporaneous with the bituminous inclusions ranges from 109.3 to 174.1 °C, which were trapped during 220 to 250 Ma. The homogeneous temperature of the aqueous inclusions contemporaneous with the methane inclusions ranges from 137.3 to 226.8 °C, which were trapped during 160 to 195 Ma and 51 to 56 Ma. The trapped pressure calculated by high-density methane inclusions (0.246-0.293 g/cm3) is between 82.9 and 140.1 MPa, with a pressure coefficient between 1.64 and 2.07. The formation pressure coefficient is nearly two, indicating that the current overpressure is inherited from the overpressure at the maximum burial depth. The earlier the fracture vein opening, the less the damage to the shale gas accumulation, and the more opening-closing phases, the lower the homogeneous temperature of the gas-liquid two-phase aqueous inclusions coeval with the high-density methane inclusions and the greater the degree of damage to the shale gas accumulation. The results provide a basis for further study on the genesis of overpressure and the migration of shale gas.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This study investigated whether the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) UC.360+ is involved in diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy (DCAN) mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome-induced pyroptosis in the stellate ganglion (SG). Using a rat type 2 diabetes model, we found that lncRNA UC.360+ short hairpin RNA (shRNA) ameliorated the dyslipidaemia of type 2 diabetic rats and reduced serum adrenaline and ROS production in SG under hyperglycemia. In addition, UC.360+ shRNA also reduced the expression of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-18 in the SG of diabetic rats and inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Therefore, lncRNA-UC.360+ shRNA may modulate the NLRP3 inflammasome/inflammatory pathway in the SG, which in turn alleviates diabetic heart sympathetic nerve damage.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

The similarity transformation is used to convert the governing PDEs into nonlinear ODEs. The HAM (homotopy analysis method) is used to solve dimensionless nonlinear ODEs. The impact of significant elements on various profiles is exposed and explored. Graphical results are used to examine the influence of the velocity profile, temperature, concentration, and entropy formation rate using tables to indicate the characteristics of skin friction, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number for numerous parameters. It is noticed that the velocity is enhanced by raising the stratification parameter, while the opposite behavior is observed for temperature distribution. The concentration profile declined as the solute stratification parameter was enhanced. For both the unstratified and stratified regions, incremental values of the Brinkman number and magnetic parameter depict augmentation in entropy production, while entropy production drops for a large value of the temperature ratio parameter.","misc","christiaan","misc"

C. vulgaris was selected to be one of the constituents of the prepared composite because of its high capability in phytoremediation. The morphology and the structure of CS/GT*m-Alg/ZnO beads were characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD, and TGA. Different monitoring experimental conditions, such as contact time, pH, BPA concentration, and sorbent dosage, were optimized.

However, its unwanted occurrence in any (eco)system can affect nontarget bacterial communities, which may also impair the performance of the natural or artificially established bioremediation system. The problem could be minimized by optimization of operational parameters via modeling of multifactorial tests. To this end, we used a Box-Behnken design in response surface methodology (RSM) to generate the experimental layout for testing the effect of the CFX biodegradation for four important parameters, that is, temperature (°C), pH, inoculum size (v/v %), and CFX concentration (mg L-1). For inoculation, a consortium of three bacterial strains, namely, Acenitobacter lwofii ACRH76, Bacillus pumilus C2A1, and Mesorihizobium sp. HN3 was used to degrade 26 mg L-1 of CFX. We found maximum degradation of CFX (98.97%; initial concentration of 25 mg L-1) at 2% inoculum size, 7 pH, and 35 °C of temperature in 16 days. However, minimum degradation of CFX (48%; initial concentration of 50 mg L-1) was found at pH 6, temperature 30 °C, and inoculum size 1%. Among different tested parameters, pH appears to be the main limiting factor for CFX degradation. Independent factors attributed 89.37% of variation toward CFX degradation as revealed by the value of the determination coefficient, that is, R 2 = 0.8937. These results were used to formulate a mathematical model in which the computational data strongly correlated with the experimental results. This study showcases the importance of parameter optimization via RSM for any bioremediation studies particularly for antibiotics in an economical, harmless, and eco-friendly manner.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles were 99% pure. Also, highly corrosive environmentally hazardous acid leachate generated during the leaching process of ilmenite sand was effectively converted into a highly efficient visible light active photocatalyst.

During the mid-Cretaceous, the studied area is located in the transition zone between the fluvio-deltaic and shallow marine settings at the southern margin of the Tethys Ocean. Thirty rock cutting samples were collected from the Kharita Formation and analyzed for major and trace elements, total organic carbon, and palynological composition. These data, together with geophysical gamma ray log values and lithological composition, allowed us to reconstruct the changes in relative sea level at this time in the framework of a third-order transgressive-regressive (T-R) sequence stratigraphic model. Palynomorph composition, represented by a fairly diverse assemblage of terrestrial plant spores and pollen grains versus marine dinoflagellate cysts and other microplankton, was employed along with the variation in the particulate organic matter composition. Chemical proxies, including Si, Ti, and often K and Fe, and their ratios normalized to Al, as well as the carbonate content and the Sr/Ca ratio, provided significant stratigraphic variations with respect to sea-level changes.

CWAs are a family of organic chemicals that are used as chemical weapons because of their enormous severity and lethal effects when faced with unforeseen challenges. To stop the spread of CWAs, it is critical to develop a platform that detects them in a sensitive, timely, selective, and minimally invasive manner. Rapid advances in the demand for on-site sensors, metal nanoparticles, and biomarker identification for CWAs have made it possible to use fluorescence as a precise real-time and point-of-care (POCT) testing technique. For POCT-based applications, the new capabilities of micro- and nanomotors offer enormous prospects.

The percutaneous titanium implants are used as the research object in this project. To solve the integration of implant and tissue, a graphene oxide/gelatin (GO/gel) composite coating was used to optimize the implant surface. Bacterial and cell experiments were used to investigate the antimicrobial activity, biocompatibility, and regulation of macrophage polarization of GO/gel-modified titanium. According to our findings, GO/gel-modified titanium has a good bacteriostatic effect against Staphylococcus aureus. On the modified surface, L929 cells proliferated well and showed no cytotoxicity. Simultaneously, the GO/gel-modified titanium surface could inhibit macrophage adhesion and spread in the early stage of culture and showed a more obvious inflammatory decline in the late stage of culture.

The adsorption and desorption behavior of these elements on BC15 and BC18 has been examined in various types of aqueous solutions over a wide temperature range. As a result, it was shown that BC15 and BC18 have sufficient adsorption ability for the simultaneous recovery of V, U, and Li from seawater. Moreover, it was seen that the distribution coefficients (K d) of V decrease with an increase in [HCl]T (subscript T: total concentration), indicating that the anionic V species such as H2V4O13 4- are exponentially changed into the cationic V species such as V3+, VO2+, and VO2 + under the condition [HCl]T = 1.0 M, and the complexation reactions between BC15 (or BC18) and the initial V structures are inhibited. Besides, it was reasonably shown that the adsorption mechanism is the path through the electrostatic interaction between the anionic V species such as H2V4O13 4-, and the -C-O-C- single bond that the electron density is eccentrically located in ether functional groups in crown ether rings in BC15 and BC18 (or the -C-OH single bond that the electron density is eccentrically located in bisphenol A in BC15 and BC18). Then, the chromatography experiment of V, U, and Li on BC15 (or BC18) at 298 K was carried out by flowing seawater, 1.0 × 10-2 M HCl, and 1.0 M HCl in sequence. The first peak of V can be separated from the plateau of Li and the first and second peaks of U in the case of the BC15 system. The recovery ratios of V and U were more than 80%. On the other hand, entirely overlapping chromatograms were obtained in the case of the BC18 system, and accordingly, the recovery ratios of V and U were much lower. In short, the separation efficiency of V with BC15 is more pre-eminent than that with BC18. Judging from these results, the durability of BC15 was finally assessed for industrial applications, that is, the aforementioned chromatography experiment was repeatedly carried out to check whether V, U, and Li were stably and mutually separated from seawater or not. The evidence that the recovery performances of V, U, and Li from seawater do not decrease at all after at least five cycle tests was provided. This indicates that this information will be valuable for the development of a practical chromatographic technology to simultaneously recover V, U, and Li from seawater.","misc","christiaan","misc"

At the third position, d-amino acids were required for melanocortin agonist activity, while both l- and d-residues resulted in MC4R antagonist activity. These results indicate that l-indoylated phenylalanine residues at the third position of the scaffold can generate MC4R over MC3R selective antagonist ligands, resulting in a substitution pattern that may be exploited for novel MC4R ligands that can be used to probe the in vivo activity of the MC4R without involvement of the MC3R.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Persistent dysphagia following primary chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancers can have a devastating effect on a patient's quality of life. Many studies have shown that the dosimetric sparing of critical structures which were included in swallowing such as the pharyngeal constrictor muscle and larynx can provide improved functional outcomes and better quality of life. However, there are no current randomized studies confirming the benefits of such swallowing-sparing strategies. The aim is to evaluate late dysphagia after chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer and to examine its correlation with clinical and dosimetric parameters. Materials and methods The period of this prospective study was from November 2018 to March 2020. Patients were divided randomly in 1:1 ratio into two groups, group 1 and group 2, each with 25 patients. Group 1 was planned by three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) technique and group 2 was planned by intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique (IMRT) technique. Treatment was delivered after approval of radiotherapy plan. To evaluate the dose to dysphagia aspiration-related structures (DARS), these structures were contoured and dose-volume histograms were generated. Various dosimetric parameters of DARS were evaluated. Swallowing status was clinically evaluated based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5. Results A significant advantage was seen with intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique (IMRT) in comparison to three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in terms of mean dose delivered to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles (66.03 Gy vs 68.77 Gy, p=0.003). The mean dose delivered to the combined dysphagia/aspiration-related structures (DARS) was statistically significantly lower in IMRT compared to 3D-CRT (66.15 Gy vs. 70.09 Gy, p<0.001). Other dose-volumes were also reduced in IMRT group (V30: {98.64% vs. 99.88%, p=0.05}; V50: {90.49% vs. 99.02%, p=0.0002}; V60: {83.92% vs. 95.04, p=0.0002}; D50: {70 Gy vs. 71.16 Gy, p=0.001); and D80: {61.18 Gy vs. 67.39 Gy, p=0.01}. Futhermore, the clinical worsening of dysphagia was less common in IMRT group (48% vs. 80%, p=0.039). Conclusion IMRT can reduce the high-dose volumes received by the DARS receiving high doses by sparing these structures through optimization. This may provide a significant additional benefit that could improve dysphagia and hence the quality of life of patients with head and neck cancer.","randomized_trial","christiaan","human_intervention"

Results Out of 130 patients with pediatric IBD, 88 (67.7%) had anthropometric data available. Fifty-five (62.5%) were males. Forty-seven (53.4%) had Crohn's disease and 41 (46.6%) had ulcerative colitis. The mean age at presentation was 10.7±3.8 years. The median age at the time of growth measurement was 14.2 (interquartile range=12.1-24.4) years. Fifteen (17%) patients were stunted, and seven (46.7%) of those stunted patients were severely stunted. Weight at presentation was lower in stunted patients (21.6±5.9 kilograms) compared to normal height patients (31±13.4 kilogram) (p=0.048). Sex, delivery type, birth weight, height at presentation, age at presentation, age at growth measurements, IBD type, disease duration, presence of extraintestinal manifestations, and prednisolone and biologic therapy use were not significant factors of stunting. Conclusion Patients with pediatric IBD have a high prevalence of LGI compared to the general population. Low weight at disease presentation is the only significant risk factor for LGI. This might indicate that IBD as a disease by itself is having the main negative impact on linear growth.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

The role of exogenous melatonin in addiction treatment is still inconsistent and unclear. The present study aimed to review the literature on randomized clinical trials that evaluated the role of melatonin supplementation, compared to placebo, in the treatment of various substance addictions. The literature searches of relevant articles published in the English language in MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases were performed from inception up to May 2021. We included only randomized clinical trials investigating the effect of melatonin treatment, compared to placebo, on substance addiction-related parameters. Non-randomized clinical trials, observation studies, and animal studies were excluded. The risk of bias-2 was used to assess the quality of the studies. Of 537 articles, 12 randomized control trials (RCT) met our inclusion criteria. Studies have been conducted on substances of addiction including benzodiazepine (BZD), alcohol, nicotine, and opioids. Our results indicated that melatonin treatment had mixed results in improving sleep quality and was not found beneficial in BDZ cessation/discontinuation rate among patients with BDZ dependence. Sleep quality and mental health had improved by melatonin supplements in opioid addiction. In nicotine addiction, melatonin treatment showed effectiveness only on mood changes but not in performance tests. In patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), melatonin treatment did not show any improvement in sleep quality. We found that the use of exogenous melatonin in substance addiction has mixed results which do not provide sufficient evidence, relative to randomized clinical trials, to establish its role.","systematic_review","christiaan","systematic_review"

"1085",35967150,"Effectiveness of Communication Skills Training in Medical Students Using Simulated Patients or Volunteer Outpatients.","Communication skills are the vital basis for patient-doctor interactions in undergraduate medical education. With excellent patient-physician interaction and communication, patients will likely build better rapport and trust with the physician. This allows all the necessary information to be divulged with the reassurance of confidentiality and devise appropriate investigations and treatment plans that patients would be more inclined to follow. The most common and effective ways of teaching communication skills to medical students are by using simulated patients and volunteer outpatients. However, which types of patients to use for better development of practical communication skills training. Establishing the demonstrable difference between using two kinds of patients would refine the training scheme for students. This would produce doctors that have practical communication skills and enhance their care to assist patients on their road to recovery or palliative care. This review compares and establishes the effectiveness of medical students' communication skills training using simulated patients and volunteer outpatients about the adult learning theories. This research is carried out following a critical review of internationally reputed guidelines from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the General Medical Council (GMC). Several search terms were used on various online databases such as Medline (Ovid), PubMed, and Academic Medicine. A thorough selection process was applied using the inclusion and exclusion criteria to narrow the search. Four studies related to this review's aim were collected and critically analyzed. The methods of obtaining the studies were structured using the PRISMA guidelines. The studies showed that one study favored volunteer outpatients while the other preferred having simulated patients. Another study showed that students considered both types of patients essential for communication skills training. All the studies presented the strengths and weaknesses of both simulated and volunteer outpatients. Discussion of the validity of all analyses was based on the CASP criteria. Study design, sample selection, and biases were scrutinized for each study. Various adult learning theories were used to correlate the effects of the communication skills training. In conclusion, simulated patients are more useful for pre-clinical years, intimate examination, and giving instructions about the physical examination. Whereas volunteer outpatients are put to better use in clinical years to incorporate more medical aspects such as obtaining a differential diagnosis, management of illness, and procedural techniques. Introducing different types of patients based on their study progression and topic of discussion could be adapted.","systematic_review","christiaan","systematic_review"

A retrospective review of intraoperative reports, imaging, and pertinent medical records was conducted for a patient who underwent posterior spinal surgery with a tiny apical pneumothorax, which subsequently developed into a major pneumothorax. The clinical signs imperative to recognition and prompt treatment are discussed. Our case report demonstrates that the unrecognized disruption of the pleural cavity during posterior spinal surgery caused the exacerbation of the patient's bilateral pneumothoraces. The patient was successfully treated with finger thoracostomy and chest tube insertion. In conclusion, posterior spinal surgery is an invasive procedure with the potential for serious complications such as the exacerbation of a previous non-surgical pneumothorax. A low index of suspicion is imperative due to the potentially lethal nature of pneumothoraces. Vital signs, pulmonary exam findings, portable radiography, and sonography equipment are all invaluable to the accurate diagnosis and early intervention of patients with pneumothoraces.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This study aims to develop a Bayesian model to predict critical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Sensitivity and specificity were obtained from previous meta-analysis studies. The complex vulnerability index (IVC-COV2 index for its abbreviation in Spanish) was used to set the pretest probability. Likelihood ratios were integrated into a Fagan nomogram for posttest probabilities, and IVC-COV2 + National Early Warning Score (NEWS) values and CURB-65 scores were generated. Absolute and relative diagnostic gains (RDGs) were calculated based on pretest and posttest differences. The IVC-COV2 index was derived from a population of 1,055,746 individuals and was based on mortality in high-risk (71.97%), intermediate-risk (26.11%), and low-risk (1.91%) groups. The integration of models in which IVC-COV2 intermediate + NEWS ≥ 5 and CURB-65 > 2 led to a number needed to (NNT) diagnose that was slightly improved in the CURB-65 model (2 vs. 3). A comparison of diagnostic gains revealed that neither the positive likelihood ratio (P = 0.62) nor the negative likelihood ratio (P = 0.95) differed significantly between the IVC-COV2 NEWS model and the CURB-65 model. According to the proposed mathematical model, the combination of the IVC-COV2 intermediate score and NEWS or CURB-65 score yields superior results and a greater predictive value for the severity of illness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-based/mathematical model developed for use in COVID-19 critical care decision-making.","misc","christiaan","meta_analysis"

"1095",35967183,"The Antipyretic Effect of High-Dose Paracetamol Versus Mefenamic Acid in the Treatment of Febrile Children: A Randomized Control Trial.","Introduction Fever is the most common presenting symptom in children and causes distress in patients and parents. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used as antipyretics, they should be reserved for pain or chronic inflammatory conditions due to safety concerns. If we can safely achieve the same antipyretic effect using a higher dose (20 mg/kg) of paracetamol, NSAIDs may be avoided for treating fever. There is a paucity of literature comparing the antipyretic effect of mefenamic acid and high-dose paracetamol. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in the antipyretic effect of high-dose paracetamol and mefenamic acid. Methods In this randomized control trial, 165 febrile children were randomly allocated to one of the following three groups: standard-dose (15 mg/kg) paracetamol (SDPCM) as the control group and high-dose (20 mg/kg) paracetamol (HDPCM) and mefenamic acid (6 mg/kg) (MFN) as the intervention groups. The temperature was measured using a digital thermometer at the start of drug dosage and every 15 minutes until it reached normal. One-way between-group analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare outcome measures such as time for temperature to reach normal, fall of temperature in 60 minutes, and time for the next fever. Post hoc analysis was performed to compare mean differences. Patients were monitored for adverse effects. Results Out of 165 enrolled patients, 159 were analyzed. The baseline demographic data were comparable among the groups. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean time taken for the temperature to reach normal (F-value (F) (2,156)=3.184, p<0.05) and the mean reduction in temperature at 60 minutes (F (2,156)=23.40, p<0.001) among the groups. The mean time for temperature to reach normal in the SDPCM group (97.50±26.60 minutes) was longer than that in the HDPCM (85.09±31.43 minutes) and MFN (84.90±30.42 minutes) groups. The decrease in temperature over 60 minutes was greater in the HDPCM (0.46°C±0.19°C) and MFN (0.45°C±0.11°C) groups than in the SDPCM (0.33°C±0.10°C) group. The time to the next fever spike was shorter for the SDPCM group (5.07±2.66 hours) than for the HDPCM (7.20±3.08 hours) and MFN (8.82±3.83 hours) groups. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that high-dose paracetamol and mefenamic acid had similar and faster antipyretic effects than standard-dose paracetamol. Although the duration of action was found to be longer in the mefenamic acid group, the difference was not statistically significant. There were negligible adverse effects in the groups. Conclusion  Standard-dose paracetamol (15 mg/kg/dose) had a slower and shorter antipyretic effect than high-dose paracetamol (20 mg/kg/dose) and mefenamic acid (6 mg/kg/dose). A single dose of high-dose paracetamol was safe and had a similar antipyretic effect as mefenamic acid. Mefenamic acid may be avoided as an antipyretic and spared for pain and anti-inflammatory indications. Multicentered double-blind clinical trials with larger sample sizes and comparisons of other NSAIDs will be required to confirm these findings.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"

The aims of our study were to (a) ascertain the population demographics of patients presenting with this problem in our local area of East Kent, (b) see if an association could be drawn between this presentation and proposed risk factors such as a psychiatric illness or socioeconomic deprivation, and (c) to review how foreign bodies are being removed in the East Kent Hospital University Foundation NHS Trust, United Kingdom and to highlight best practice with regards to this in line with the latest guidelines. Methodology Between 2017 and 2021, 32 cases of entrapped rectal foreign bodies were diagnosed and managed at our NHS Trust. Retrospective data taken from the theatre directory and electronic patient records were used to audit patient demographics, co-morbidities, the type of foreign body, and the extraction technique. Results The majority of patients (90%) were male (n = 29). The patients' age ranged from 15 to 95 years, with a median age of 48 years. In total, 12 (37.5%) patients had a medical history of a psychiatric illness. The most common foreign bodies removed were sex toys or vibrators (n = 8) and roll-on deodorant bottles (n = 7). Kent Area B (n = 10) and Kent Area A (n = 9) were the areas with the highest number of cases. Twenty-two (68.8%) patients underwent examination under a general anaesthetic for removal, seven (21.8%) patients had the object manually removed without sedation, and three (9.4%) required a laparotomy with or without bowel resection. Conclusions Cases of an entrapped rectal foreign body in this local region typically involved male patients between 40 and 50 years old. A high proportion of this group had a history of a psychiatric illness supporting an association between this presentation and mental health. We have proposed some explanations for this association including the anal canal nervous system interplay with the brain-gut axis. Lower socioeconomic status and unemployment may also be risk factors for this surgical problem. A trans-anal approach for management is successful in the majority of cases; however, almost 10% of patients required emergency surgical management. We have highlighted best practice guidelines for the investigation and management of the entrapped rectal foreign body as part of our discussion.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on viral hepatitis elimination programs, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) conducted a survey in liver centers worldwide in 2021. A web-based questionnaire was distributed (May-July 2021) to all EASL members representing clinical units providing HBV and HCV hepatitis care. Results are expressed as absolute numbers and reduction rates for each care activity. Data were collected from 32 European and 12 non-European clinical centers. Between January 2019 (pre-pandemic) and December 2020 (during the pandemic), chronic HBV consultations decreased by 32% and 26%, new referrals by 38% and 39%, HBV testing rates by 39% and 21% (for HBsAg detection) and 30% and 22% (for HBV DNA detection), and new HBV treatments by 20% and 44% (p = 0.328) in European and non-European centers, respectively. With regard to HCV during the same time frame, the overall reductions were 39% and 50% for consultations, 49% and 49% for new referrals, 11% and 38% for HCV RNA detection, and 51% and 54% for new HCV antiviral treatments for European and non-European Centers, respectively (p = 0.071). All steps in the viral hepatitis care cascade have been hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a comparable impact across different centers. These data reaffirm the pandemic's major effect on global viral hepatitis elimination programs and suggest that actions to achieve the WHO 2030 targets should be reconsidered and revised to account for each country's progress relative to pre-pandemic values. The EASL multinational survey conclusively shows that viral hepatitis elimination programs, expected to provide control of hepatitis B and hepatitis C worldwide by 2030, have been held back by the COVID-19 pandemic in clinical centers from several European and non-European countries, with a comparable impact across centers. Limitations in the cascade of care for both HBV and HCV were linked to limited access to screening, consultations, specific testing, and actual treatment. As restrictions for COVID-19 begin to lift, efforts to diagnose and provide treatment for viral hepatitis should remain high on the list of priorities for public health officials to maintain the WHO elimination efforts. Measures that have been put in place to control the COVID-19 pandemic could be transferred to increasing the diagnosis and linkage to care of people with hepatitis.","misc","christiaan","misc"

However, the genus Hellenia within the Asian clade has been shown to be non-monophyletic and its morphology has not been studied carefully. Therefore, the complete plastid genomes of Hellenia species were obtained and the monophyly of Hellenia was tested through four different datasets in this study. Plastid phylogenomic analyses of Costaceae revealed that Hellenia is strongly supported as paraphyletic. Two major clades are recovered, namely the Hellenia s.s. subclade and the Parahellenia subclade. Phylogenetic analyses based on an enlarged taxon sampling of the Asian clade using a two chloroplast markers dataset (trnK intron and trnL-F spacer) confirmed the paraphyly of Hellenia. Meanwhile, morphological analyses suggested that members of the Parahellenia subclade differ from the remaining Hellenia species in many characters including inflorescences, bracts, stigma, axillary buds, floral tubes and labellum.

Previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of large-scale elevational gradients on plants, with little attention on the impact of smaller-scale gradients. In this study we used 14 microsatellite loci to survey the genetic structure of 332 Juniperus squamata plants along elevation gradient from two sites in the Hengduan Mountains. We found that the genetic structure (single, clonal, mosaic) of J. squamata shrubs is affected by differences in elevational gradients of only 150 m. Shrubs in the mid-elevation plots rarely have a clonal or mosaic structure compared to shrubs in lower- or higher-elevation plots. Human activity can significantly affect genetic structure, as well as reproductive strategy and genetic diversity. Sub-populations at mid-elevations had the highest yield of seed cones, lower levels of asexual reproduction and higher levels of genetic diversity. This may be due to the trade-off between elevational stress and anthropogenic disturbance at mid-elevation since there is greater elevational stress at higher-elevations and greater intensity of anthropogenic disturbance at lower-elevations. Our findings provide new insights into the finer scale genetic structure of alpine shrubs, which may improve the conservation and management of shrublands, a major vegetation type on the Hengduan Mountains and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Combining the information encoded in functional traits and metacommunities provides a new perspective to predict the abundance of species in communities. We applied a community assembly via trait selection model to predict quadrat-scale species abundances using functional trait variation on ontogenetic stages and metacommunity information for over 490 plant species in a subtropical forest and a lowland tropical forest in Yunnan, China. The relative importance of trait-based selection, mass effects, and stochasticity in shaping local species abundances is evaluated using different null models. We found both mass effects and trait selection contribute to local abundance patterns. Trait selection was detectable at all studied spatial scales (0.04-1 ha), with its strength stronger at larger scales and in the subtropical forest. In contrast, the importance of stochasticity decreased with spatial scale. A significant mass effect of the metacommunity was observed at small spatial scales. Our results indicate that tree community assembly is primarily driven by ontogenetic traits and metacommunity effects. Our findings also demonstrate that including ontogenetic trait variation into predictive frameworks allows ecologists to infer ecological mechanisms operating in community assembly at the individual level.","misc","christiaan","misc"

As substance use disorder (SUD) treatment providers could potentially improve linkage to HCV testing and treatment, we sought to understand SUD providers, clinic and client characteristics; referral patterns; HCV knowledge; willingness to participate in additional trainings; and local linkage-to-care pathways for treatment of substance use and HCV. Online survey data were collected from 78 SUD providers serving PWID in eight western rural North Carolina counties. Providers' attitudes toward working with HCV+ clients were very positive. One-third of providers reported a low fund of knowledge regarding HCV, HCV treatment, and financial assistance opportunities. Non-prescribing providers rarely initiated discussions about HCV testing/treatment, but were receptive to training. Respondents indicated that HCV testing and treatment were best delivered at local health departments or primary care clinics but were open to other venues where PWID access care. The vast majority of prescribing and non-prescribing providers expressed interest in obtaining training in HCV treatments, how to obtain HCV medications and topics on advanced liver disease. Data from prescribing and non-prescribing SUD providers suggest opportunities to develop or expand integrated care models for HCV testing/treatment in PWID in rural Appalachian North Carolina.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1105",35967265,"Urban agriculture in São Paulo: an analysis from the sociology of public action.","How can one analyze the public actions of organizations and actors from different sectors? Studies using a policy analysis perspective have shed light on the role of the state in making and implementing urban agriculture (UA) policy. However, this perspective has limitations when it comes to explaining the interactions between the state, civil society, and the business organizations that support it. This article provides an analytical framework derived from the sociology of public action (SPA) to understand how multiple organizations support UA. We have applied the SPA framework to the city of São Paulo and our analysis indicates that civil society has mobilized significant meanings, ideas, and networks to reinforce the importance of UA. As a result, there has been a paradigm shift in terms of UA: it has gone from a state of invisibility within an institutional void to an improved state of policy planning. However, civil society organizations still lead the delivery of services for farmers with intermittent state support, which indicates that there has been a paradigm shift in UA policy planning, but not in policy implementation.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1106",35967267,"Testing for COVID-19 is Much More Effective When Performed Immediately Prior to Social Mixing.","Objective: To quantify the utility of RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests in preventing post-arrival transmission based on timing of the pre-departure test. Methods: We derived analytical expressions to compute post-arrival transmission when no test is performed, and when either an RT-PCR or any of 18 rapid antigen tests is performed at specified times before arrival. We determined the diagnostic sensitivity of the rapid antigen tests by propagating their RT-PCR percent positive agreement onto known RT-PCR diagnostic sensitivity. Results: Depending on the rapid antigen test used, conducting a rapid antigen test immediately before departure reduces post-arrival transmission between 37.4% (95% CrI: 28.2%-40.7%) and 46.7% (95% CrI:40.0%-49.3%), compared to a 31.1% (95% CrI: 26.3%-33.5%) reduction using an RT-PCR 12 h before arrival. Performance of each rapid antigen test differed by diagnostic sensitivity over the course of disease. However, these differences were smaller than those engendered by testing too early. Conclusion: Testing closer to arrival-ideally on the day of arrival-is more effective at reducing post-arrival transmission than testing earlier. Rapid antigen tests perform the best in this application due to their short turnaround time.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1107",35967295,"A hierarchy of selection pressures determines the organization of the T cell receptor repertoire.","We systematically examine the receptor repertoire in T cell subsets in young, adult, and LCMV-infected mice. Somatic recombination generates diversity, resulting in the limited overlap between nucleotide sequences of different repertoires even within the same individual. However, statistical features of the repertoire, quantified by the V gene and CDR3 k-mer frequency distributions, are highly conserved. A hierarchy of immunological processes drives the evolution of this structure. Intra-thymic divergence of CD4+ and CD8+ lineages imposes subtle but dominant differences observed across repertoires of all subpopulations in both young and adult mice. Differentiation from naive through memory to effector phenotype imposes an additional gradient of repertoire diversification, which is further influenced by age in a complex and lineage-dependent manner. The distinct repertoire of CD4+ regulatory T cells is more similar to naive cells in young mice and to effectors in adults. Finally, we describe divergent (naive and memory) and convergent (CD8+ effector) evolution of the repertoire following acute infection with LCMV. This study presents a quantitative framework that captures the structure of the repertoire in terms of its fundamental statistical properties and describes how this structure evolves as individual T cells differentiate, migrate and mature in response to antigen exposure.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Here we mapped at single-cell resolution the spatial distribution of quiescent and proliferative human ILCs within the vascular versus tissue compartment. For this purpose, we employed MISTRG humanized mice as an in-vivo model to study human ILCs. We uncovered subset-specific differences in the proliferative status between vascular and tissue ILCs within lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. We also identified CD117-CRTH2-CD45RA+ ILCs in the spleen that were highly proliferative and expressed the transcription factor TCF-1. These proliferative ILCs were present during the neonatal period in human blood and emerged early during population of the human ILC compartment in MISTRG mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Single-cell RNA-sequencing combined with intravascular cell labeling suggested that proliferative ILCs actively migrated from the local vasculature into the spleen tissue. Collectively, our comprehensive map reveals the proliferative topography of human ILCs, linking cell migration and spatial compartmentalization with cell division.","misc","christiaan","rodent"

Accumulating evidence attests to the important roles of the immune system in OA pathogenesis. Understanding the role of various immune cells in joint degeneration or joint repair after injury is vital for improving therapeutic strategies for treating OA. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) develops in ~50% of individuals who have experienced an articular trauma like an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Here, using the high resolution of single-cell RNA sequencing, we delineated the temporal dynamics of immune cell accumulation in the mouse knee joint after ACL rupture. Our study identified multiple immune cell types in the joint including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, B cells, T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells. Monocytes and macrophage populations showed the most dramatic changes after injury. Further characterization of monocytes and macrophages reveled 9 major subtypes with unique transcriptomics signatures, including a tissue resident Lyve1hiFolr2hi macrophage population and Trem2hiFcrls+ recruited macrophages, both showing enrichment for phagocytic genes and growth factors such as Igf1, Pdgfa and Pdgfc. We also identified several genes induced or repressed after ACL injury in a cell type-specific manner.

Since endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in viral sensing, we investigated the impact of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within TLR3 and TLR9 genes on the occurrence of overall and high-level (≥1,000 IU/ml) CMV infection in a cohort of 197 KT recipients. Homozygous carriers of the minor allele of TLR3 (rs3775291) had higher infection-free survival compared with reference allele carriers (60.0% for TT versus 42.3% for CC/CT genotypes; P-value = 0.050). Decreased infection-free survival was observed with the minor allele of TLR9 (rs352139) (38.2% for TC/CC versus 59.3% for TT genotypes; P-value = 0.004). After multivariable adjustment, the recessive protective effect of the TLR3 (rs3775291) TT genotype was confirmed (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.327; 95% CI: 0.167-0.642; P-value = 0.001), as was the dominant risk-conferring effect of TLR9 (rs352139) TC/CC genotypes (aHR: 1.865; 95% CI: 1.170-2.972; P-value = 0.009).

Single-cell RNA sequencing has laid the foundation for studying RILI at the cellular microenvironmental level. This study focused on changes during the acute pneumonitis stage of RILI at the cellular microenvironmental level and investigated the interactions between different cell types. An acute RILI model in mice and a single-cell transcriptional library were established. Intercellular communication networks were constructed to study the heterogeneity and intercellular interactions among different cell types. A single-cell transcriptome map was established in a mouse model of acute lung injury. In total, 18,500 single-cell transcripts were generated, and 10 major cell types were identified. The heterogeneity and radiosensitivity of each cell type or subtype in the lung tissues during the acute stage were revealed. It was found that immune cells had higher radiosensitivity than stromal cells. Immune cells were highly heterogeneous in terms of radiosensitivity, while some immune cells had the characteristics of radiation resistance. Two groups of radiation-induced Cd8+Mki67+ T cells and Cd4+Cxcr6+ helper T cells were identified. The presence of these cells was verified using immunofluorescence. The ligand-receptor interactions were analyzed by constructing intercellular communication networks. These explained the origins of the cells and revealed that they had been recruited from endothelial cells to the inflammatory site. This study revealed the heterogeneity of in vivo radiosensitivity of different cell types in the lung at the initial stage post irradiation.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

This has important implications for reducing treatment burden in diseases that require chronic prophylaxis, such as hemophilia. Clearance of PEG molecules with high molecular weights (≥ 40 kDa) has been reported to cause cellular vacuolation in mammals. Rurioctocog alfa pegol (PEGylated recombinant coagulation factor VIII) contains a 20-kDa PEG. This study investigated the effects of exposure to 20-kDa PEG (10 μg/ml to 10 mg/ml) on the morphology and function of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in vitro. Exposure to PEG for 24 hours was associated with significant vacuolation only at concentrations of 1 mg/ml or more, which far exceed the levels associated with clinically relevant doses of rurioctocog alfa pegol. Immunofluorescence staining of PEG was detected in the cytoplasm of MDMs, indicating uptake into the cells. No impairment of MDM phagocytic activity (ability to ingest fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli) was observed with 24-hour exposure to PEG, even at concentrations associated with significant vacuolation. Furthermore, PEG exposure did not have significant effects on cytokine secretion in resting or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated MDMs, or on the expression of cell surface markers in stimulated MDMs. Cell viability was not affected by 24-hour exposure to PEG. In conclusion, vacuolation of human MDMs after exposure to 20-kDa PEG only occurred with PEG concentrations far in excess of those equivalent to clinically relevant doses of rurioctocog alfa pegol and did not affect MDM viability or functionality. Together, these results support the concept that PEG-mediated vacuolation is an adaptive cellular response rather than a toxic effect.","misc","christiaan","misc"

GFPA efficiently decreased adipocyte size and ameliorated inflammatory infiltration in the three types of white adipose tissue and alleviated steatosis, fat accumulation and inflammatory infiltration in the livers of HFD-fed mice. GFPA also decreased the concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and pro-inflammatory factors in the sera and livers of HFD-treated mice. Furthermore, GFPA was found to regulate lipid metabolism via the inhibition of ceramide levels in HFD-treated mice.

The fate of a MBC in secondary immune reactions appears to depend upon multiple parameters, whose understanding is mandatory for the design of efficient vaccine strategies. We followed the behavior of MBCs in recall responses to SRBCs using an inducible AID fate mapping mouse model in which B cells engaged in a germinal center (GC) response are irreversibly labeled upon simultaneous tamoxifen ingestion and immunization. We used different schemes of mouse immunization and tamoxifen feeding in adoptive-transfer experiments of total splenic B cells into congenic mice that have been pre-immunized or not, to assess the contribution of the different effector subsets in a physiological competitive context. We were able to show that naive B cells can differentiate into GC B cells with kinetics similar to MBCs in the presence of previously activated T follicular helper (TFH) cells and a primed microenvironment. We also showed that MBCs are recruited into secondary GCs, together with naive B cells. In contrast, PC differentiation, which dominated secondary MBC responses, was not dependent upon a previous TFH activation. We observed that the presence of persisting germinal centers and circulating antibody levels are key factors determining the germinal center versus plasma cell fate in a recall response. Notably, disruption of persistent germinal center structures by a lymphotoxin beta-receptor fusion protein or a longer timing between the prime and the boost, which correlated with reduced antigen-specific immunoglobulin levels in serum, were two conditions with an opposite impact, respectively inhibiting or promoting a GC fate for MBCs. Altogether, these studies highlight the complexity of recall responses, whose outcome varies according to immunization contexts.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Despite advancements in prevention and therapy, quality of life remains poor for many HF patients due to associated target organ damage. Pulmonary manifestations of HF are well-established. However, difficulties in the treatment of HF patients with chronic lung phenotypes remain as the underlying patho-mechanistic links are still incompletely understood. Here, we aim to investigate the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) involvement in lung inflammation during HF, a concept that may provide new mechanism-based therapies for HF patients with pulmonary complications. In a mouse model of HF, pharmacological CFTR corrector therapy (Lumacaftor (Lum)) was applied systemically or lung-specifically for 2 weeks, and the lungs were analyzed using histology, flow cytometry, western blotting, and qPCR. Experimental HF associated with an apparent lung phenotype characterized by vascular inflammation and remodeling, pronounced tissue inflammation as evidenced by infiltration of pro-inflammatory monocytes, and a reduction of pulmonary CFTR+ cells. Moreover, the elevation of a classically-activated phenotype of non-alveolar macrophages coincided with a cell-specific reduction of CFTR expression. Pharmacological correction of CFTR with Lum mitigated the HF-induced downregulation of pulmonary CFTR expression and increased the proportion of CFTR+ cells in the lung. Lum treatment diminished the HF-associated elevation of classically-activated non-alveolar macrophages, while promoting an alternatively-activated macrophage phenotype within the lungs. Collectively, our data suggest that downregulation of CFTR in the HF lung extends to non-alveolar macrophages with consequences for tissue inflammation and vascular structure. Pharmacological CFTR correction possesses the capacity to alleviate HF-associated lung inflammation.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

In particular, innate, T- and B-cell specific responses were evaluated over time. Household contacts of COVID-19 cases screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal swab for surveillance purposes were enrolled (T0, n=42). Of these, 28 subjects returned for a follow-up test (T1). The innate response was assessed by detecting a panel of soluble factors by multiplex-technology in plasma samples. Cell-mediated response was evaluated by measuring interferon (IFN)-γ levels by ELISA in plasma harvested from whole-blood stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools, including spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins. The serological response was assessed by quantifying anti-Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD), anti-Nucleocapsid (N), whole virus indirect immunofluorescence, and neutralizing antibodies. At T0, higher levels of plasmatic IFN-α, IL-1ra, MCP-1 and IP-10, and lower levels of IL-1β, IL-9, MIP-1β and RANTES were observed in subjects with positive swab compared to individuals with a negative one (p<0.05). Plasmatic IFN-α was the only cytokine detectable in subjects with positive SARS-CoV-2 swabs with high accuracy for swab score positivity (0.93, p<0.0001). Among subjects with positive swabs, significant negative correlations were found among the RT-PCR cycle threshold values reported for genes S and N and IFN-α or IP-10 levels. At T0, the IFN-γ T-cell specific response was detected in 50% (5/10) of subjects with positive swab, while anti-RBD/anti-N antibodies showed a positivity rate of 10% (1/10). At T1, the IFN-γ T-cell specific response was detected in most of the confirmed-infection subjects (77.8%, 7/9), whereas the serological response was still observed in a minority of them (44.4%, 4/9). Overall, the swab test showed a moderate concordance with the T-cell response (78.6%, k=0.467), and a scarce concordance with the serological one (72.9%, k=0.194).

SP-D has a crucial immune function in detecting and clearing pulmonary pathogens; DC-SIGN is involved in facilitating dendritic cell interaction with naïve T cells to mount an anti-viral immune response. SP-D and DC-SIGN have been shown to interact with various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped RNA virus that causes COVID-19. A recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) comprising of α-helical neck region, carbohydrate recognition domain, and eight N-terminal Gly-X-Y repeats has been shown to bind SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by preventing viral entry in Vero cells and HEK293T cells expressing ACE2. DC-SIGN has also been shown to act as a cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 independent of ACE2. Since rfhSP-D is known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and DC-SIGN, this study was aimed at investigating the potential of rfhSP-D in modulating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Coincubation of rfhSP-D with Spike protein improved the Spike Protein: DC-SIGN interaction. Molecular dynamic studies revealed that rfhSP-D stabilised the interaction between DC-SIGN and Spike protein. Cell binding analysis with DC-SIGN expressing HEK 293T and THP- 1 cells and rfhSP-D treated SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotypes confirmed the increased binding. Furthermore, infection assays using the pseudotypes revealed their increased uptake by DC-SIGN expressing cells. The immunomodulatory effect of rfhSP-D on the DC-SIGN: Spike protein interaction on DC-SIGN expressing epithelial and macrophage-like cell lines was also assessed by measuring the mRNA expression of cytokines and chemokines. RT-qPCR analysis showed that rfhSP-D treatment downregulated the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-α, IFN-α, IL-1β, IL- 6, IL-8, and RANTES (as well as NF-κB) in DC-SIGN expressing cells challenged by Spike protein. Furthermore, rfhSP-D treatment was found to downregulate the mRNA levels of MHC class II in DC expressing THP-1 when compared to the untreated controls. We conclude that rfhSP-D helps stabilise the interaction between SARS- CoV-2 Spike protein and DC-SIGN and increases viral uptake by macrophages via DC-SIGN, suggesting an additional role for rfhSP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Remodeling in mucosal microbiota and systemic immunoregulation may represent an important component in tissue injury. Here, we aim to characterize the ileal microbiota in both pathological and healthy settings and to evaluate the correlated systemic microbial-associated inflammatory markers comparing first-time surgery and relapse clinical conditions. We enrolled 28 CD patients at surgery; we collected inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa tissues and blood samples from each patient. Bacterial wall adherence was observed histologically, while its composition was assessed through amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. In addition, we evaluated the systemic microRNA (miRNA) using quantitative real-time PCR amplification and free fatty acids (FFAs) using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The total number of mucosal adherent microbiota was enriched in healthy compared to inflamed mucosa. In contrast, the phylum Tenericutes, the family Ruminococcaceae, and the genera Mesoplasma and Mycoplasma were significantly enriched in the pathological setting. Significant microbiota differences were observed between the relapse and first surgery patients regarding the families Bacillaceae 2 and Brucellaceae and the genera Escherichia/Shigella, Finegoldia, Antrobacter, Gemmatimonas, Moraxella, Anoxibacillus, and Proteus. At the systemic level, we observed a significant downregulation of circulating miR-155 and miR-223, as well as 2-methyl butyric, isobutyric, and hexanoic (caproic) acids in recurrence compared to the first surgery patients. In addition, the level of hexanoic acid seems to act as a predictor of recurrence risk in CD patients (OR 18; 95% confidence interval 1.24-261.81; p = 0.006). We describe a dissimilarity of ileal microbiota composition comparing CD and healthy settings, as well as systemic microbial-associated inflammatory factors between first surgery and surgical relapse. We suggest that patterns of microbiota, associated with healthy ileal tissue, could be involved in triggering CD recurrence. Our findings may provide insight into the dynamics of the gut microbiota-immunity axis in CD surgical recurrence, paving the way for new diagnostics and therapeutics aimed not only at reducing inflammation but also at maintaining a general state of eubiosis in healthy tissue.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms that amplify neutrophil extravasation has limited innovation in therapeutic targeting of neutrophil mediated pathology. Attention has focussed on neutrophil interactions with endothelia, but data from mouse models also point to a role for the underlying pericyte layer, as well as perivascular macrophages, the only other cell type found within the perivascular space in the cerebral microvasculature. We tested the hypothesis that human brain vascular pericytes (HBVP) contribute to neutrophil extravasation in a transwell model of the cerebral post-capillary venule. We show that pericytes augment endothelial barrier formation. In response to inflammatory cues, they significantly enhance neutrophil transmigration across the endothelial barrier, without increasing the permeability to small molecules. In our model, neither pericytes nor endothelia responded directly to bacterial stimulation. Instead, we show that paracrine signalling by multiple cytokines from monocyte derived macrophages drives transcriptional upregulation of multiple neutrophil chemokines by pericytes. Pericyte mediated amplification of neutrophil transmigration was independent of transcriptional responses by endothelia, but could be mediated by direct chemokine translocation across the endothelial barrier. Our data support a model in which microbial sensing by perivascular macrophages generates an inflammatory cascade where pericytes serve to amplify production of neutrophil chemokines that are translocated across the endothelial barrier to act directly on circulating neutrophils. In view of the striking redundancy in inflammatory cytokines that stimulate pericytes and in the neutrophil chemokines they produce, we propose that the mechanism of chemokine translocation may offer the most effective therapeutic target to reduce neutrophil mediated pathology in pyogenic meningitis.","misc","christiaan","misc"

A clinical perspective.","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with barrier defects and immune dysregulations. The pathogenesis of AD involves the physical barrier as well as epithelial cells, which are considered a vital part of the innate immunity of the skin. The importance of filaggrin mutations in the pathogenesis of AD has also been well-established with reproducible results around the world in multiple studies and ethnic groups. This protein plays an important role in skin barrier functions and further reaffirms barrier defects as one of the primary causes of AD. The main epithelial cells, keratinocytes, function as a major sentinel for the skin in detecting danger signals or microbial pathogens, and trigger downstream immune responses. In AD, these cells express TSLP, IL-33 and IL-25, which lead to downstream systemic production of type 2 cytokines. In spite of major advances in our understanding of the innate immunity of AD, recent success in the systemic therapeutics of AD have focused on targeting the products of the adaptive immunity, particularly cytokines produced by T cells. In addition to type 2 cytokines, type 17 cytokines have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. The current review examines the implications of these cytokines in AD from clinical perspectives.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Those lymphocytes contribute to the major pathogenetic features of IgG4-RD. However, they are not the only cellular components in the immunoinflammatory environment of this mysterious disease entity. Recent studies have suggested that various non-lymphocytic components, including macrophages and fibroblasts, may also play an important role in the pathogenetic process of IgG4-RD in terms of contributing to the chronic and complex progress of the disease. Therefore, the potential role of non-lymphocyte in the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD is worth discussing.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Severe pulmonary inflammation induces vascular permeability, edema, and organ dysfunction. We previously demonstrated that poly(I:C) (pICLC) induced type 1 interferon (t1IFN) protected mice from Cryptococcus gattii (Cg) via local iron restriction. Here we show pICLC increased serum protein and intravenously injected FITC-dextran in the lung airspace suggesting pICLC induces vascular permeability. Interestingly, pICLC induced a pro-inflammatory signature with significant expression of IL-1 and IL-6 which depended on MDA5 and t1IFN. Vascular permeability depended on MDA5, t1IFN, IL-1, and IL-6. T1IFN also induced MDA5 and other MDA5 signaling components suggesting that positive feedback contributes to t1IFN dependent expression of the pro-inflammatory signature. Vascular permeability, induced by pICLC or another compound, inhibited Cg by limiting iron. These data suggest that pICLC induces t1IFN which potentiates pICLC-MDA5 signaling increasing IL-1 and IL-6 resulting in leakage of antimicrobial serum factors into lung airspace. Thus, induced vascular permeability may act as an innate defense mechanism against opportunistic fungal infection, such as cryptococcosis, and may be exploited as a host-directed therapeutic target.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

We retrieved relevant studies from the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) database. Two reviewers independently reviewed the eligible studies, assessed their validity, and extracted relevant data. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to distinguish sources of heterogeneity. A total of 10 studies, which comprised 6984 participants, were included in the analysis. The overall quality of evidence was rated as moderate to low. The smoking prevalence among CVD patients was 39.28% (271/690), which was higher than 31.36% (1974/6294) among non-CVD patients. Compared with never-smokers, the risk of developing CVD in current smokers was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.21-1.66). No significant publication bias was found in our meta-analysis. In spite of the several negative results, this study found that current smokers with SLE have an increased risk of developing CVD, although most of the included studies were in low-to-moderate quality. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42022338109.","meta_analysis","christiaan","meta_analysis"

However, about one-third of RA patients are negative for ACPAs, which presents a challenge to the early diagnosis of RA. The purpose of this study was to analyze differences in lymphocyte subsets and CD4+ T cell subsets between ACPA+ and ACPA- RA patients, and to evaluate the value of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) as a diagnostic and monitoring marker in ACA- RA patients. A total of 145 ACPA+ RA patients, 145 ACPA- RA patients, and 38 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. Peripheral lymphocyte subsets were detected using flow cytometry, and serum MMP-3 was detected using chemiluminescence. Information about joint symptoms, other organ involvement, and related inflammatory markers was also collected. The results showed that, compared to ACPA- RA patients, ACPA+ cases had greater imbalances between peripheral CD4+ T cell subsets, mainly manifested as an increase in T-helper 1 (Th1) cells (p < 0.001) and decrease in regulatory T (Treg) cells (p = 0.029). This makes these patients more prone to inflammatory reactions and joint erosion. MMP-3 levels in ACPA+ and ACPA- RA patients were significantly higher than in HCs (p < 0.001), and MMP-3 could effectively distinguish between ACPA- RA patients and HCs (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.930, sensitivity 84.14%, specificity 92.11%). MMP-3 was also a serum marker for distinguishing between RA patients with low and high disease activities. Further analysis showed that MMP-3 was positively correlated with the levels of inflammatory markers and disease activity, and negatively correlated with the levels of lymphocyte subsets. In addition, with improvements in the disease, MMP-3 levels decreased, and further increased as the patients started to deteriorate. In summary, our research showed that there was a mild imbalance between peripheral CD4+ T cell subsets in ACPA- RA patients. MMP-3 may be used as a potential marker for early diagnosis of ACPA- RA. MMP-3 was an important index for RA disease evaluation, disease activity stratification, and prognosis.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

The relevance of this in AD is largely unclear. To characterize the role of TIM-3 and Gal-9 in the pathogenesis of AD and underlying mechanisms. We assessed the expression of Gal-9 and TIM-3 in 30 AD patients, to compare them with those of 30 healthy controls (HC) and to explore possible links with disease features including AD activity (SCORAD), IgE levels, and circulating eosinophils and B cells. We also determined the effects of Gal-9 on T cells from the AD patients. Our AD patients had markedly higher levels of serum Gal-9 and circulating TIM-3-expressing TH1 and TH17 cells than HC. Gal-9 and TIM-3 were linked to high disease activity, IgE levels, and circulating eosinophils and/or B cells. The rates of circulating TIM-3-positive CD4+ cells were positively correlated with rates of TH2/TH22 cells and negatively correlated with rates of TH1/TH17 cells. Gal-9 inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of T cells in patients with AD, especially in those with severe AD. Our findings suggest thatGal-9, via TIM-3, contributes to the pathogenesis of AD by augmenting TH2/TH22 polarization through the downregulation of TH1/TH17immunity. This makes Gal-9 and TIM-3 interesting to explore further, as possible drivers of disease and targets of novel AD treatment.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1130",35967338,"Plasma protein profiling reveals dynamic immunomodulatory changes in multiple sclerosis patients during pregnancy.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Pregnancy represents a natural modulation of the disease course, where the relapse rate decreases, especially in the 3rd trimester, followed by a transient exacerbation after delivery. Although the exact mechanisms behind the pregnancy-induced modulation are yet to be deciphered, it is likely that the immune tolerance established during pregnancy is involved. In this study, we used the highly sensitive and specific proximity extension assay technology to perform protein profiling analysis of 92 inflammation-related proteins in MS patients (n=15) and healthy controls (n=10), longitudinally sampled before, during, and after pregnancy. Differential expression analysis was performed using linear models and p-values were adjusted for false discovery rate due to multiple comparisons. Our findings reveal gradual dynamic changes in plasma proteins that are most prominent during the 3rd trimester while reverting post-partum. Thus, this pattern reflects the disease activity of MS during pregnancy. Among the differentially expressed proteins in pregnancy, several proteins with known immunoregulatory properties were upregulated, such as PD-L1, LIF-R, TGF-β1, and CCL28. On the other hand, inflammatory chemokines such as CCL8, CCL13, and CXCL5, as well as members of the tumor necrosis factor family, TRANCE and TWEAK, were downregulated. Further in-depth studies will reveal if these proteins can serve as biomarkers in MS and whether they are mechanistically involved in the disease amelioration and worsening.

However, the development of new strategies is needed to improve clinical efficacy and safety of NK cell-based immunotherapy. NK cell-mediated recognition and lysis of tumor cells are strictly dependent on the expression of ligands for NK cell-activating receptors NKG2D and DNAM-1 on tumor cells. Of note, the PVR/CD155 and Nectin-2/CD112 ligands for DNAM-1 are expressed primarily on solid tumor cells and poorly expressed in normal tissue cells. Here, we generated human NK cells expressing either the full length DNAM-1 receptor or three different DNAM-1-based chimeric receptor that provide the expression of DNAM-1 fused to a costimulatory molecule such as 2B4 and CD3ζ chain. Upon transfection into primary human NK cells isolated from healthy donors, we evaluated the surface expression of DNAM-1 and, as a functional readout, we assessed the extent of degranulation, cytotoxicity and the production of IFNγ and TNFα in response to human leukemic K562 cell line. In addition, we explored the effect of Nutlin-3a, a MDM2-targeting drug able of restoring p53 functions and known to have an immunomodulatory effect, on the degranulation of DNAM-1-engineered NK cells in response to human neuroblastoma (NB) LA-N-5 and SMS-KCNR cell lines. By comparing NK cells transfected with four different plasmid vectors and through blocking experiments, DNAM-1-CD3ζ-engineered NK cells showed the strongest response. Furthermore, both LA-N-5 and SMS-KCNR cells pretreated with Nutlin-3a were significantly more susceptible to DNAM-1-engineered NK cells than NK cells transfected with the empty vector. Our results provide a proof-of-concept suggesting that the combined use of DNAM-1-chimeric receptor-engineered NK cells and Nutlin-3a may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of solid tumors, such as NB, carrying dysfunctional p53.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Although many of the mechanisms that control αβ- and γδ-lineage differentiation are shared between human and mouse, important differences have also been observed. Here, we studied the regulatory dynamics of the E and ID protein encoding genes during pediatric human T cell development by evaluating changes in chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and bulk and single cell gene expression. We profiled patterns of ID/E protein activity and identified up- and downstream regulators and targets, respectively. In addition, we compared transcription of E and ID protein encoding genes in human versus mouse to predict both shared and unique activities in these species, and in prenatal versus pediatric human T cell differentiation to identify regulatory changes during development. This analysis showed a putative involvement of TCF3/E2A in the development of γδ T cells. In contrast, in αβ T cell precursors a pivotal pre-TCR-driven population with high ID gene expression and low predicted E protein activity was identified. Finally, in prenatal but not postnatal thymocytes, high HEB/TCF12 levels were found to counteract high ID levels to sustain thymic development. In summary, we uncovered novel insights in the regulation of E and ID proteins on a cross-species and cross-developmental level.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Despite the biological functions of miR-144/451 have been extensively studied in erythropoiesis and tumorigenesis, few studies have been conducted in immune responses. In this study, we showed that miR-144/451-/- DCs exhibit increased activation. Mechanistically, the miR-144 directly targets the 3`-UTR of IRF5 and represses the expression of IRF5 in DCs. Ectopic expression of miR-144/451 by lentiviruses downregulates the levels of IRF5 and suppresses DCs function. In addition, knockdown of IRF5 by shRNA significantly inhibits activities of the miR-144/451-/- DCs. Expression of miR144/451 was decreased in DCs from both patients with IBD and mice with DSS-colitis compared with controls. Human PBMC derived DCs were downregulated expression of miR144/451 after LPS stimulation. In the DSS-induced colitis mice model, we showed that ablation of the miR-144/451 gene causes severe colitis, and their DCs from both periphery and MLN expressed higher co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines than wild-type mice. In addition, DCs isolated from miR-144/451-/- mice transfusion exacerbates mice colitis. In the bone marrow transplanted chimeric mice model, we show that miR-144/451-/- bone marrow transplantation deteriorated DSS-induced colitis. At last, we treat the mice with miR-144/451 delivered by chitosan nanoparticles revealing protective effects in DSS-induced colitis mice. Thus, our results reveal a novel miR144/451-IRF5 pathway in DCs that protects experimental colitis. The manipulation of miR-144/451 expression and DCs activation in IBD patients may be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Here, we expressed monomeric and dimeric receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the spike protein of prototype SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron variant in E. coli and investigated the reactivity of anti-sera from Chinese subjects immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to these recombinant RBDs. In 106 human blood samples collected from 91 participants from Jiangxi, China, 26 sera were identified to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies by lateral flow dipstick (LFD) assays, which were enriched in the ones collected from day 7 to 1 month post-boost (87.0%) compared to those harvested within 1 week post-boost (23.8%) (P < 0.0001). A higher positive ratio was observed in the child group (40.8%) than adults (13.6%) (P = 0.0073). ELISA results showed that the binding activity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive sera to Omicron RBDs dropped by 1.48- to 2.07-fold compared to its homogeneous recombinant RBDs.

To review emerging evidence on belimumab in cSLE published up to April 2022, so as to provide information for clinical decision-making. A comprehensive search of relevant publications up to the date of April 2022 in PUBMED, EMBASE, WOS, COCHRANE, ClinicalTrials.gov, CBM, CNKI and WANFANG was performed using the following criteria: (a) English and Chinese language studies; (b) RCT studies, cohort studies, or case-control studies; (c) patients with age <18; (d) Observational studies or case series studies contain more than 5 patients. All relevant literature was independently screened and reviewed by at least two reviewers and the obtained literature data were extracted and reviewed by two authors.

There was a high degree of heterogeneity among several studies, and the availability of baseline and outcome data provided was uneven. At present, there is a lack of high-quality clinical trials of belimumab in the treatment of cSLE. Based on the current research, it is believed that the use of belimumab can inhibit cSLE activity, reduce the dose of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, and delay kidney damage.

Disruption in the tissue-resident macrophage niche, such as in Kupffer cells, can lead to a window of susceptibility to systemic infections, which represents a significant cause of mortality in patients with acetaminophen (APAP) overdose-induced acute liver injury (ALI). However, how Kupffer cell niche disruption increases susceptibility to systemic infections in ALI is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of ALI induced by APAP overdose, we found that Kupffer cells upregulated the apoptotic cell death program and were markedly reduced in the necrotic areas during the early stages of ALI, opening the niche for the infiltration of neutrophils and monocyte subsets. In addition, during the resolution phase of ALI, the remaining tissue macrophages with a Kupffer cell morphology were observed forming replicating cell clusters closer to necrotic areas devoid of Kupffer cells. Interestingly, mice with APAP-induced liver injury were still susceptible to infections despite the dual cellular input of circulating monocytes and proliferation of remaining Kupffer cells in the damaged liver. Therapy with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) was shown to be effective in occupying the niche devoid of Kupffer cells following APAP-induced ALI. The rapid BMDM migration to the liver and their positioning within necrotic areas enhanced the healing of the tissue and restored the liver firewall function after BMDM therapy. Therefore, we showed that disruption in the Kupffer cell niche and its impaired function during acute liver injury are key factors for the susceptibility to systemic bacterial infections. In addition, modulation of the liver macrophage niche was shown to be a promising therapeutic strategy for liver injuries that reduce the Kupffer cell number and compromise the organ function.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Our study constructed pyroptosis-score (PYS) via principal-component analysis (PCA) to unveil the link between pyroptosis and tumor immunity in 369 HBV-HCC patients. Compared with the low-PYS group, subjects with higher PYS were associated with poor prognosis but were more susceptible to anti-PD-L1 treatment. In addition, we found that PYS can serve independently as a prognostic factor for HBV-HCC, making it possible for us to identify specific small molecule drugs with a potential value in inhibiting tumors via targeting pyroptosis. Also, the target genes predicted by the Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and pharmacophore model were enriched in the HIF-1 signaling pathway and NF-kB transcription factor activity, which were related to the mechanism of inflammation-driven cancer.

We observed an increased proportion of IgA-producing plasma cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and an enhanced secretion of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and antimicrobial peptides in the small intestine. Small intestine transcriptome analysis further suggested that anthocyanins influenced IgA production. We found that oral administration of anthocyanins altered the gut microbiota through maintaining the anaerobic intestinal environment, promoting the secretion of sIgA and antimicrobial peptides, and downregulating cell motility and mobile genetic elements of commensal bacteria. These observations suggest that the oral administration of anthocyanins helps in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and thus it may find applications in immunotherapy and related fields.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

In contrast, the downregulation of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in T helper (Th) 1-dominant skin disorders may lead to more adverse events, given the crucial role of IFN-γ in antiviral and antitumoral immunity. Modulating Th17 and Th2 cell differentiation is performed by blocking IL-23 and IL-4, respectively, whereas anti-IL-12 antibodies are only moderately effective in downregulating Th1 lymphocyte differentiation. Therefore, a targeted approach of IFN-γ-driven disorders remains challenging. Recent literature suggests that certain pathogenic Th17 cell subsets with Th1 characteristics, such as CD4+CD161+CCR6+CXCR3+IL-17+IFN-y+ (Th17.1) and CD4+CD161+CCR6+CXCR3+IL-17-IFN-y+ (exTh17), are important contributors in Th1-mediated autoimmunity. Differentiation to a Th17.1 or exTh17 profile results in the upregulation of IFN-y. Remarkably, these pathogenic Th17 cell subsets are resistant to glucocorticoid therapy and the dampening effect of regulatory T cells (Treg). The identification of Th17.1/exTh17 cells in auto-immune disorders may explain the frequent treatment failure of conventional immunosuppressants. In this review, we summarize the current evidence regarding the cellular plasticity of Th17 cells in inflammatory skin disorders. A deeper understanding of this phenomenon may lead to better insights into the pathogenesis of various skin diseases and the discovery of a potential new treatment target.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This review provides a comprehensive summary of the effects of HSCs on the injury stage of liver IRI and their associated molecular mechanisms. In addition, we discuss the regulation of liver repair and regeneration after IRI by HSCs. Finally, we highlight unanswered questions and future avenues of research regarding contributions of HSCs to IRI in the liver.","misc","christiaan","misc"

With the development of immunotherapy, the treatment of RCC has entered a new stage and has made a series of progress. This study mainly outlines the knowledge map and detects the potential research hotspots by using bibliometric analysis. Publications concerning RCC immunotherapy from 2002 to 2021 in the Web of Science Core Collection were collected. Visualization and statistical analysis were mainly performed by freeware tools VOSviewer, CiteSpace, R software, and Microsoft Office Excel 2019. A total of 3,432 papers were collected in this study, and the annual number of papers and citations showed a steady growth trend. The United States is the leading country with the most high-quality publications and is also the country with the most international cooperation. The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is the most productive organization. The Journal of Clinical Oncology is the highest co-cited journal, and Brian I. Rini is both the most prolific author and the author with the largest centrality. The current research hotspots may be focused on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), PD-1, and mammalian target of rapamycin. Immunotherapy has a bright future in the field of RCC treatment, among which ICIs are one of the most important research hotspots. The main future research directions of ICI-based immunotherapy may focus on combination therapy, ICI monotherapy, and the development of new predictive biomarkers.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Our aim was to correlate the magnitude of the antibody response to vaccination with previous clinical conditions and AEFI. A multicentric comparative study where SARS-CoV-2 spike 1-2 IgG antibodies IgG titers were measured at baseline, 21-28 days after the first and second dose (when applicable) of the following vaccines: BNT162b2 mRNA, mRNA-1273, Gam-COVID-Vac, Coronavac, ChAdOx1-S, Ad5-nCoV and Ad26.COV2. Mixed model and Poisson generalized linear models were performed. We recruited 1867 individuals [52 (SD 16.8) years old, 52% men]. All vaccines enhanced anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgG antibodies over time (p<0.01). The highest increase after the first and second dose was observed in mRNA-1273 (p<0.001). There was an effect of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection; and an interaction of age with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, Gam-COVID-Vac and ChAdOx1-S (p<0.01). There was a negative correlation of Severe or Systemic AEFI (AEs) of naïve SARS-CoV-2 subjects with age and sex (p<0.001); a positive interaction between the delta of antibodies with Gam-COVID-Vac (p=0.002). Coronavac, Gam-COVID-Vac and ChAdOx1-S had less AEs compared to BNT162b (p<0.01). mRNA-1273 had the highest number of AEFIs. The delta of the antibodies showed an association with AEFIs in previously infected individuals (p<0.001). The magnitude of seroconversion is predicted by age, vaccine type and SARS-CoV-2 exposure. AEs are correlated with age, sex, and vaccine type. The delta of the antibody response only correlates with AEs in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

Clinical data and histological material of nine patients suffering from S. aureus spondylodiscitis were retrospectively collected at a single center. To mirror the clinical findings experimentally, we developed a novel porcine ex vivo model mimicking acute S. aureus spondylodiscitis and assessed the interaction between S. aureus and IVD cells within their native environment. In addition, the inflammatory features underlying this interaction were assessed in primary human IVD cells. Finally, mirroring the clinical findings, we assessed primary human neutrophils for their ability to respond to secreted inflammatory modulators of IVD cells upon the S. aureus challenge. Acute S. aureus spondylodiscitis in patients was characterized by tissue necrosis and neutrophil infiltration. Additionally, the presence of empty IVD cells' lacunae was observed. This was mirrored in the ex vivo porcine model, where S. aureus induced extensive IVD cell death, leading to empty lacunae. Concomitant engagement of the apoptotic and pyroptotic cell death pathways was observed in primary human IVD cells, resulting in cytokine release. Among the released cytokines, functionally intact neutrophil-priming as well as broad pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines which are known for their involvement in IVD degeneration were found. In patients as well as ex vivo in a novel porcine model, S. aureus IVD infection caused IVD cell death, resulting in empty lacunae, which was accompanied by the release of inflammatory markers and recruitment of neutrophils. These findings offer valuable insights into the important role of inflammatory IVD cell death during spondylodiscitis and potential future therapeutic approaches.","misc","christiaan","misc"

A recent placebo-controlled trial of low-dose methotrexate (MTX) in PWH found that numbers of total CD4 and CD8 T cells decreased in the low-dose MTX arm. In this report we analyzed T cell phenotypes and additional plasma inflammatory indices in samples from the trial. We found that cycling (Ki67+) T cells lacking Bcl-2 were reduced by MTX but plasma inflammatory cytokines were largely unaffected. In a series of in vitro experiments to further investigate the mechanisms of MTX activity, we found that MTX did not inhibit effector cytokine production but inhibited T cell proliferation downstream of mTOR activation, mitochondrial function, and cell cycle entry. This inhibitory effect was reversible with folinic acid, suggesting low-dose MTX exerts anti-inflammatory effects in vivo in PWH largely by blocking T cell proliferation via dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, yet daily administration of folic acid did not rescue this effect in trial participants. Our findings identify the main mechanism of action of this widely used anti-inflammatory medicine in PWH and may provide insight into how MTX works in the setting of other inflammatory conditions.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1149",35967372,"Glycyrrhetinic acid regulates impaired macrophage autophagic flux in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","Macrophages are involved in hepatocyte steatosis and necroinflammation and play an important role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Impaired autophagy function (decreased autophagy or blocked autophagic flow) leads to cell damage and death and promotes NAFLD progression. The experimental and clinical research of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) in the treatment of NAFLD has gradually attracted attention with clear pharmacological activities such as immune regulation, antiviral, antitumor, antioxidant, liver protection, and anti-inflammatory. However, the effects of GA on the STAT3-HIF-1α pathway and autophagy in macrophages are still unclear, and its mechanism of action in the treatment of NAFLD remains to be further elucidated. We constructed a NAFLD mouse model through a high-fat and high-sugar diet to investigate the therapeutic effects of GA. The results showed that GA reduced weight, improved the pathological changes and hepatic lipid deposition of liver, and abnormally elevated the levels of serum biochemical (AST, ALT, TG, T-CHO, LDL-C, and HDL-C) and inflammatory indexes (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-α) in NAFLD mice. Further examination revealed that GA ameliorates excessive hepatic macrophage infiltration and hepatocyte apoptosis. The results of the cell experiments further elaborated that GA modulated the PA-induced macrophage STAT3-HIF-1α pathway and ameliorated impaired autophagic flux (blockade of autophagosome-lysosome fusion) and overactivation of inflammation. Excessive hepatocyte apoptosis caused by the uncontrolled release of inflammatory cytokines was also suppressed by GA. This study demonstrated that GA could regulate the STAT3-HIF-1α pathway of macrophages, ameliorate the impaired autophagy flux, and reduce the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines to improve the excessive apoptosis of liver cells, thus playing a therapeutic role on NAFLD.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"
"1150",35967373,"Systematic identification of key extracellular proteins as the potential biomarkers in lupus nephritis.","Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common and severe clinical manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with considerable morbidity/mortality and limited treatment options. Since kidney biopsy is a relative hysteretic indicator, it is indispensable to investigate potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and predicting clinical outcomes of LN patients. Extracellular proteins may become the promising biomarkers by the secretion into body fluid. Our study linked extracellular proteins with lupus nephritis to identify the emerging biomarkers. The expression profiling data were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Meanwhile, the two gene lists encoding extracellular proteins were collected from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and UniProt database. Subsequently, the extracellular protein-differentially expressed genes (EP-DEGs) were screened out, and the key EP-DEGs were determined by MCODE, MCC, and Degree methods via the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The expression level, immune characteristics, and diagnostic value of these candidate biomarkers were investigated. Finally, the Nephroseq V5 tool was applied to evaluate the clinical significance of the key EP-DEGs. A total of 164 DEGs were acquired by comparing LN samples with healthy controls based on GSE32591 datasets. Then, 38 EP-DEGs were screened out through the intersection between DEGs and extracellular protein gene lists. Function enrichment analysis indicated that these EP-DEGs might participate in immune response and constitute the extracellular matrix. Four key EP-DEGs (LUM, TGFBI, COL1A2, and POSTN) were eventually identified as candidate biomarkers, and they were all overexpressed in LN samples. Except that LUM expression was negatively correlated with most of the immune regulatory genes, there was a positive correlation between the remaining three biomarkers and the immune regulatory genes. In addition, these biomarkers had high diagnostic value, especially the AUC value of the LUM-TGFBI combination which reached almost 1 (AUC = 0.973), demonstrating high accuracy in distinguishing LN from controls. Finally, we found a meaningful correlation of these biomarkers with sex, WHO class, and renal function such as glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine level, and proteinuria. In summary, our study comprehensively identified four key EP-DEGs exerting a vital role in LN diagnosis and pathogenesis and serving as promising therapeutic targets.","misc","christiaan","misc"

More evidence has suggested the potential associations between necroptosis and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Currently, the underlying role of necroptosis remains elusive in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at antitumor immunity and inter-tumoral heterogeneity. This study enrolled a total of 728 HCC patients and 139 immunotherapy patients from eight public datasets. The consensus clustering approach was employed to depict tumor heterogeneity of cancer necroptosis. Subsequently, our study further decoded the heterogeneous clinical outcomes, genomic landscape, biological behaviors, and immune characteristics in necroptosis subtypes. For each patient, providing curative clinical recommendations and developing potential therapeutic drugs were used to promote precise medicine. With the use of the weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm, necroptosis-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (NALRs) were identified in HCC. Based on the NALR expression, two heterogeneous subtypes were decoded with distinct clinical outcomes. Compared to patients in C1, patients in C2 harbored superior pathological stage and presented more unfavorable overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Then, the robustness and reproducibility of necroptosis subtypes were further validated via the nearest template prediction (NTP) approach and classical immune phenotypes. Through comprehensive explorations, C1 was characterized by enriched immune-inflammatory and abundant immune infiltration, while C2 possessed elevated proliferative and metabolic activities and highly genomic instability. Moreover, our results indicated that C1 was more prone to obtain desirable benefits from immunotherapy. For patients in C2, numerous underlying therapeutic agents were developed, which might produce significant efficacy. This study identified two necroptosis subtypes with distinct characteristics, decoding the tumor heterogeneity. For an individualized patient, our work tailored corresponding treatment strategies to improve clinical management.","misc","christiaan","misc"

HS is characterized by aberrant activation of the innate immune system, resulting in activation of pathways that aim to protect against pathogenic microorganisms, and also contribute to failure to resolve inflammation. Imbalance in innate immunity is evident in deregulation of host antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and the complement system associated with the microbiome dysbiosis. The pathology is further complicated by ability of pathogens associated with HS to overcome host immune response. Potential roles of major AMPs, cathelicidin, defensins, dermcidin, S100 proteins, RNAse 7 and complement proteins are discussed. Dysregulated expression pattern of innate immunity components in conjunction with bacterial component of the disease warrants consideration of novel treatment approaches targeting both host immunity and pathogenic microbiome in HS.","misc","christiaan","misc"

However, it is unclear whether the administration route of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) alters tissue distribution patterns and subsequent downstream effects. This study aimed to investigate the distribution and efficacy of radiolabeled ofatumumab and ocrelizumab in humanized-CD20 (huCD20) transgenic mice following subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) administration. For distribution analysis, huCD20 and wildtype mice (n = 5 per group) were imaged by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT 72 h after SC/IV administration of ofatumumab or SC/IV administration of ocrelizumab, radiolabeled with Indium-111 (111In-ofatumumab or 111In-ocrelizumab; 5 µg, 5 MBq). For efficacy analysis, huCD20 mice with focal delayed-type hypersensitivity lesions and associated tertiary lymphoid structures (DTH-TLS) were administered SC/IV ofatumumab or SC/IV ocrelizumab (7.5 mg/kg, n = 10 per group) on Days 63, 70 and 75 post lesion induction. Treatment impact on the number of CD19+ cells in select tissues and the evolution of DTH-TLS lesions in the brain were assessed. Uptake of an 111In-labelled anti-CD19 antibody in cervical and axillary lymph nodes was also assessed before and 18 days after treatment initiation as a measure of B-cell depletion. SPECT/CT image quantification revealed similar tissue distribution, albeit with large differences in blood signal, of 111In-ofatumumab and 111In-ocrelizumab following SC and IV administration; however, an increase in both mAbs was observed in the axillary and inguinal lymph nodes following SC versus IV administration. In the DTH-TLS model of MS, both treatments significantly reduced the 111In-anti-CD19 signal and number of CD19+ cells in select tissues, where no differences between the route of administration or mAb were observed. Both treatments significantly decreased the extent of glial activation, as well as the number of B- and T-cells in the lesion following SC and IV administration, although this was mostly achieved to a greater extent with ofatumumab versus ocrelizumab. These findings suggest that there may be more direct access to the lymph nodes through the lymphatic system with SC versus IV administration. Furthermore, preliminary findings suggest that ofatumumab may be more effective than ocrelizumab at controlling MS-like pathology in the brain.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"
"1154",35967380,"Left ventricle- and skeletal muscle-derived fibroblasts exhibit a differential inflammatory and metabolic responsiveness to interleukin-6.","Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important player in chronic inflammation associated with heart failure and tumor-induced cachexia. Fibroblasts are salient mediators of both inflammation and fibrosis. Whereas the general outcome of IL-6 on the heart's function and muscle wasting has been intensively studied, the influence of IL-6 on fibroblasts of the heart and skeletal muscle (SM) has not been analyzed so far. We illustrate that SM-derived fibroblasts exhibit higher basal mRNA expression of α-SMA, extracellular matrix molecules (collagen1a1/3a1/5a1), and chemokines (CCL2, CCL7, and CX3CL1) as compared to the left ventricle (LV)-derived fibroblasts. IL-6 drives the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts as indicated by an increase in α-SMA expression and upregulates NLRP3 inflammasome activity in both LV- and SM-derived fibroblasts. IL-6 increases the release of CCL7 to CX3CL1 in the supernatant of SM-derived fibroblasts associated with the attraction of more pro(Ly6Chi) versus anti(Ly6Clo) inflammatory monocytes as compared to unstimulated fibroblasts. IL-6-stimulated LV-derived fibroblasts attract less Ly6Chi to Ly6Clo monocytes compared to IL-6-stimulated SM-derived fibroblasts. In addition, SM-derived fibroblasts have a higher mitochondrial energy turnover and lower glycolytic activity versus LV-derived fibroblasts under basal and IL-6 conditions. In conclusion, IL-6 modulates the inflammatory and metabolic phenotype of LV- and SM-originated fibroblasts.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Combining conventional methods with newer biologically based treatments such as immunotherapy can be a promising approach to treating different tumors. The concept of cancer immunoediting that occurs in the field of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is the aspect of cancer therapy that has not been at the center of attention. One group of the role players of the so-called immunoediting process are the immune checkpoint molecules that exert either co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory effects in the anti-tumor immunity of the host. It involves alterations in a wide variety of immunologic pathways. Recent studies have proven that conventional cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of them, i.e., chemoradiotherapy, alter the immune compartment of the TME. The mentioned changes encompass a wide range of variations, including the changes in the density and immunologic type of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the alterations in the expression patterns of the different immune checkpoints. These rearrangements can have either anti-tumor immunity empowering or immune attenuating sequels. Thus, recognizing the consequences of various chemo(radio)therapeutic regimens in the TME seems to be of great significance in the evolution of therapeutic approaches. Therefore, the present review intends to summarize how chemo(radio)therapy affects the TME and specifically some of the most important, well-known immune checkpoints' expressions according to the recent studies in this field.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1156",35967386,"Emerging translational strategies and challenges for enhancing regulatory T cell therapy for graft-versus-host disease.","Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a curative therapy for many types of cancer. Genetic disparities between donor and host can result in immune-mediated attack of host tissues, known as graft versus host disease (GVHD), a major cause of morbidity and mortality following HSCT. Regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) are a rare cell type crucial for immune system homeostasis, limiting the activation and differentiation of effector T cells (Teff) that are self-reactive or stimulated by foreign antigen exposure. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with Treg has demonstrated, first in murine models and now in patients, that prophylactic Treg infusion can also suppress GVHD. While clinical trials have demonstrated Treg reduce severe GVHD occurrence, several impediments remain, including Treg variability and practical need for individualized Treg production for each patient. Additionally, there are challenges in the use of in vitro expansion techniques and in achieving in vivo Treg persistence in context of both immune suppressive drugs and in lymphoreplete patients being treated for GVHD. This review will focus on 3 main translational approaches taken to improve the efficacy of tTreg ACT in GVHD prophylaxis and development of treatment options, following HSCT: genetic modification, manipulating TCR and cytokine signaling, and Treg production protocols. In vitro expansion for Treg ACT presents a multitude of approaches for gene modification to improve efficacy, including: antigen specificity, tissue targeting, deletion of negative regulators/exhaustion markers, resistance to immunosuppressive drugs common in GVHD treatment. Such expansion is particularly important in patients without significant lymphopenia that can drive Treg expansion, enabling a favorable Treg:Teff ratio in vivo. Several potential therapeutics have also been identified that enhance tTreg stability or persistence/expansion following ACT that target specific pathways, including: DNA/histone methylation status, TCR/co-stimulation signaling, and IL-2/STAT5 signaling. Finally, this review will discuss improvements in Treg production related to tissue source, Treg subsets, therapeutic approaches to increase Treg suppression and stability during tTreg expansion, and potential for storing large numbers of Treg from a single production run to be used as an off-the-shelf infusion product capable of treating multiple recipients.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Mutant mice lacking Axl and Mer exhibited a marked accumulation of apoptotic cells during the time that autoreactive and nonreactive thymocytes normally die. Unexpectedly, these double mutants also displayed a profound deficit in the total number of highly phagocytic macrophages in the thymus, and concomitantly exhibited diminished expression of TIM-4, CD163, and other non-TAM phagocytic engulfment systems in the macrophages that remained. Importantly, these previously unrecognized deficits were not confined to the thymus, as they were also evident in the spleen and bone marrow.

The N6 subtype NAs are mostly found in viruses infecting birds. However, they have also been identified in viruses that infect mammals, such as swine and seals. More recently, highly pathogenic H5N6 subtype viruses have caused rare infections and mortality in humans. Here, we generated murine mAbs to the N6 NA, characterized their breadth and antiviral properties in vitro and in vivo and mapped their epitopes by generating escape mutant viruses. We found that the antibodies had broad reactivity across the American and Eurasian N6 lineages, but relatively little binding to the H5N6 NA. Several of the antibodies exhibited strong NA inhibition activity and some also showed activity in the antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity reporter assay and neutralization assay. In addition, we generated escape mutant viruses for six monoclonal antibodies and found mutations on the lateral ridge of the NA. Lastly, we observed variable protection in H4N6 mouse challenge models when the antibodies were given prophylactically.","misc","christiaan","misc"

As of now, the rate and pathophysiological relevance of impaired sweating in patients with CholU are ill-defined. To assess in CholU patients the rate and extent of impaired sweating and its links to clinical and pathophysiological features of CholU. We assessed sweating in patients with CholU (n = 13) subjected to pulse-controlled ergometry (PCE) provocation testing. Pre- and post-PCE biopsies of lesional (L) and non-lesional (NL) skin were analyzed for the expression of acetylcholine receptor M3 (CHRM3) and acetylcholine esterase (ACh-E) by quantitative histomorphometry and compared to those of healthy control subjects (HCs). CholU patients were assessed for disease duration and severity as well as other clinical features. Of the 13 patients with CholU, 10 showed reduced sweating in response to PCE provocation, and 3 had severely reduced sweating. Reduced sweating was linked to long disease duration and high disease severity. CholU patients with impaired sweating responses showed reduced sweat gland epithelial expression of CHRM3 and ACh-E. Reduced sweating is common in CholU patients, especially in those with long-standing and severe disease, and it can be severe. Reduced expression of CHRM3 and ACh-E may be the cause or consequence of CholU in patients with impaired sweating, and this should be explored by further studies.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

While suckling mice prove to be highly useful small animal models of RV infection and pathogenesis, direct visualization tools are lacking to track the temporal dynamics of RV replication and transmissibility in vivo. Here, we report the generation of the first recombinant murine-like RV that encodes a Nano-Luciferase reporter (NLuc) using a newly optimized RV reverse genetics system. The NLuc-expressing RV was replication-competent in cell culture and both infectious and virulent in neonatal mice in vivo. Strong luciferase signals were detected in the proximal and distal small intestines, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes. We showed, via a noninvasive in vivo imaging system, that RV intestinal replication peaked at days 2 to 5 post infection. Moreover, we successfully tracked RV transmission to uninoculated littermates as early as 3 days post infection, 1 day prior to clinically apparent diarrhea and 3 days prior to detectable fecal RV shedding in the uninoculated littermates. We also observed significantly increased viral replication in Stat1 knockout mice that lack the host interferon signaling. Our results suggest that the NLuc murine-like RV represents a non-lethal powerful tool for the studies of tissue tropism and host and viral factors that regulate RV replication and spread, as well as provides a new tool to facilitate the testing of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in the future.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

"1164",35967407,"ILC2s expanded by exogenous IL-33 regulate CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophage polarization to alleviate hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.","Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an adverse consequence of hepatectomy or liver transplantation. Recently, immune mechanisms involved in hepatic IRI have attracted increased attention of investigators working in this area. In specific, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), have been strongly implicated in mediating type 2 inflammation. However, their immune mechanisms as involved with hepatic IRI remain unclear. Here, we reported that the population of ILC2s is increased with the development of hepatic IRI as shown in a mouse model in initial stage. Moreover, M2 type CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophages increased and reached maximal levels at 24 h followed by a significant elevation in IL-4 levels. We injected exogenous IL-33 into the tail vein of mice as a mean to stimulate ILC2s production. This stimulation of ILC2s resulted in a protective effect upon hepatic IRI along with an increase in M2 type CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophages. In contrast, depletion of ILC2s as achieved with use of an anti-CD90.2 antibody substantially abolished this protective effect of exogenous IL-33 and M2 type CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophage polarization in hepatic IRI. Therefore, this exogenous IL-33 induced potentiation of ILC2s appears to regulate the polarization of CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophages to alleviate IRI. Such findings provide the foundation for the development of new targets and strategies in the treatment of hepatic IRI.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"
"1165",35967411,"ELISA based assays to measure adenosine deaminases concentration in serum and saliva for the diagnosis of ADA2 deficiency and cancer.","Adenosine deaminases (ADAs) are enzymes of purine metabolism converting adenosine to inosine. There are two types of ADAs in humans ADA1 and ADA2. While both ADA1 and ADA2 share the same substrate, they differ in expression, cellular localization, and catalytic properties. The genetic deficiency of ADA1 results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), while lack in ADA2 (DADA2) results in multiple phenotypes ranging from systemic inflammation to vascular pathology. Clinical studies have shown that the levels of ADAs in biological fluids are altered in pathophysiological conditions, suggesting that ADA activity could be a convenient marker for the diagnosis of immune diseases and cancer. Here, we describe sensitive and straightforward ELISA assays to measure ADA1 and ADA2 concentrations in biological fluids. Analysis of the serum and saliva samples from the healthy controls and DADA2 patients revealed that ADA2 enzyme concentration is significantly lower in patients than in healthy controls. In contrast, the concentration of ADA2 increases in the serum of patients with large granular leukocyte leukemia (LGLL) and patients' saliva with head and neck cancer. Thus, this simple, non-invasive method allows for distinguishing healthy controls from the affected patient. It can be implemented in screening and diagnosis of DADA2 and follow up the treatment of LGLL and several types of head and neck cancer.","misc","christiaan","misc"

However, little is known about the immune characteristic of COAD. Here, by calculating the enrichment score of immune characteristics in three online COAD datasets (TCGA-COAD, GSE39582, and GSE17538), we identified 17 prognostic-related immune characteristics that overlapped in at least two datasets. We determined that COADs could be stratified into three immune subtypes (IS1-IS3), based on consensus clustering of these 17 immune characteristics. Each of the three ISs was associated with distinct clinicopathological characteristics, genetic aberrations, tumor-infiltrating immune cell composition, immunophenotyping (immune hot and immune cold), and cytokine profiles, as well as different clinical outcomes and immunotherapy/therapeutic response. Patients with the IS1 tumor had high immune infiltration but immunosuppressive phenotype, IS3 tumor is an immune hot phenotype, whereas those with the IS2 tumor had an immune cold phenotype. We further verified the distinct immune phenotype of IS1 and IS3 by an in-house COAD cohort. We propose that the immune subtyping can be utilized to identify COAD patients who will be affected by the tumor immune microenvironment. Furthermore, the ISs may provide a guide for personalized cancer immunotherapy and for tumor prognosis.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Infected individuals include asymptomatic cases to severe disease leading to death, suggesting the involvement of the genetic constitution of populations and pathogens contributing to differential individuals' outcomes. To investigate shared immunogenic features between SARS-CoV-2 targets and other coronaviruses, we modeled their peptides in 3D structures of HLA-A*02:01 (pMHC), comparing their molecular surfaces These structures were also compared with a panel of epitopes from unrelated viruses, looking for potential triggers conferring cross-protection in uninfected individuals. As expected, SARS-CoV 1 and 2 peptides share molecular and physicochemical features, providing an explanation for the verified experimental immunogenicity among them. Surprisingly, even discordant sequences from human coronaviruses 229E, OC43 and epitopes from unrelated viruses involved in endemic human infections exhibit similar fingerprints of immunogenicity with SARS-CoV-2 peptides. The same approach indicates a conserved CD8+ T cell recognition between Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 sequences and altered peptides from Variants of Concern. Examination of structural data over epitope sequence analysis here could explain how previous infections may produce a heterologous immunity response in a global scale against emergent diseases such as Covid-19, mitigating its full lethal potential, and paves the way for the development of wide spectrum vaccine development.","misc","christiaan","misc"

AEE had various pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic, anti-oxidative stress and so on. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effect of AEE on the acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. In vitro experiments evaluated the protective effect of AEE on the LPS-induced A549 cells. The tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured in the cell supernatant. The Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 8): control group, model group (LPS group), LPS + AEE group (AEE, 54 mg·kg-1), LPS + AEE group (AEE, 108 mg·kg-1), LPS + AEE group (AEE, 216 mg·kg-1). The lung wet-to-dry weight (W/D) ratio and immune organ index were calculated. WBCs were counted in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and total protein concentration was measured. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining of lung tissue was performed. Glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), macrophage mobility inhibitory factor (MIF), TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β activity were measured. The metabolomic analysis of rat serum was performed by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. From the results, compared with LPS group, AEE improved histopathological changes, reduced MDA, CRP, MPO, MDA, and MIF production, decreased WBC count and total protein content in BALF, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, immune organ index and lung wet-dry weight (W/D), increased antioxidant enzyme activity, in a dose-dependent manner. The results of serum metabolomic analysis showed that the LPS-induced ALI caused metabolic disorders and oxidative stress in rats, while AEE could ameliorate it to some extent. Therefore, AEE could alleviate LPS-induced ALI in rats by regulating abnormal inflammatory responses, slowing down oxidative stress, and modulating energy metabolism.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Alterations of the microbiota, known as dysbiosis, can direct reactivity to self-antigens not only in the intestinal mucosa but also at the systemic level. Our laboratory previously reported gut dysbiosis, particularly lower abundance of bacteria in the family Lactobacillaceae, in lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, a model of systemic autoimmunity. Restoring the microbiota with a mix of 5 different Lactobacillus species (spp.), L. reuteri, L. oris, L. johnsonii, L. gasseri and L. rhamnosus, attenuated lupus-liked clinical signs, including splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. However, our understanding of the mechanism was limited. In this study, we first investigated the effects of individual species. Surprisingly, none of the species individually recapitulated the benefits of the mix. Instead, Lactobacillus spp. acted synergistically to attenuate splenomegaly and renal lymphadenopathy through secreted factors and a CX3CR1-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, oral administration of MRS broth exerted the same benefits likely through increasing the relative abundance of endogenous Lactobacillus spp. Mechanistically, we found increased percentages of FOXP3-negative type 1 regulatory T cells with administration of the mix in both spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. In addition, oral gavage of Lactobacillus spp. decreased the percentage of central memory T cells while increasing that of effector memory T cells in the lymphoid organs. Furthermore, a decreased percentage of double negative T cells was observed in the spleen with the mix. These results suggest that Lactobacillus spp. might act on T cells to attenuate splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Together, this study advances our understanding of how Lactobacillus spp. attenuate lupus in MRL/lpr mice. The synergistic action of these bacteria suggests that multiple probiotic bacteria in combination may dampen systemic autoimmunity and benefit lupus patients.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

However, the role of ILC2s in acute rejection after liver transplantation (LT) remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed the frequency, counts, and signature cytokines of ILC2s in liver transplant recipients by flow cytometric analysis and multiplex immunofluorescence assay. We also assessed the spatial distribution and correlation between hepatic ILC2s and Treg cells. The changes of ILC2s were dynamically monitored in the mouse LT model. We found that the frequencies of circulating ILC2s were comparable in liver transplant recipients with either rejection or non-rejection compared with the control group. The hepatic ILC2s counts were significantly increased in the rejection group than in the non-rejection and control groups, and a similar trend was observed for Treg cells. In the mouse LT model, allograft infiltrating ILC2s dramatically increased within 14 days post-transplant. The frequency of ILC2s in bone marrow significantly increased at 7 days post-transplant and rapidly decreased at 14 days after LT. Similarly, there was a significant increase in the frequency of splenic ILC2s within two weeks post-transplant. Multiplex immunofluorescence assay showed a close correlation between hepatic ILC2s and Treg cells by analyzing their spatial distribution and distance. In conclusion, the number of allograft infiltrating ILC2s was closely related to rejection after LT. Allograft infiltrating ILC2s may play inhibitory roles in posttransplant immune homeostasis, favoring resolution of liver allograft rejection by interacting with Treg cells or promoting the migration of Tregs cells into the liver allograft.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

The purpose of this research was to examine the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in HCC. We investigated the HCC TIME by integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk-tissue sequencing data to reveal the landscape of major immune cell types. Regulatory T(Treg) cells were found to be specifically distributed in the TIME of HCC. Several immune checkpoints, including TNFRSF4, TIGIT and CTLA4, were found to be uniquely overexpressed in Treg cells, and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway was enriched in Treg cells. We also discovered the presence of two NK-cell subsets with different cytotoxic capacities, one in an activated state with antitumor effects and another with an exhausted status. In addition, memory B cells in HCC were found to exist in a unique state, with high proliferation, low differentiation, and low activity, which was induced by overexpression of PRAP1 and activation of the MIF-CD74 axis. We revealed the TIME landscape in HCC, highlighting the heterogeneity of major immune cell types and their potential mechanisms in the formation of an immunosuppressive environment. Hence, blocking the formation of the TIME could be a useful therapeutic strategy for HCC.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Existing evidence indicates that the immune system plays an important role in the occurrence and development of keloid. However, there is still a lack of research on the immune-related signatures of keloid. Here we identified immune-related signatures in keloid and explored their pathological mechanisms. Transcriptomic datasets (GSE7890, GSE92566, and GSE44270) of keloid and normal skin tissues were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The overlap of differentially expressed genes and immune-related genes was considered as differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIGs). Functional analysis, expression, and distribution were applied to explore the function and characteristics of DEIGs, and the expression of these DEIGs in keloid and normal skin tissues was verified by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we conducted interactive network analysis and immune infiltration analysis to determine the therapeutic potential and immune correlation. We identified four DEIGs (LGR5, PTN, JAG1, and DKK1). In these datasets, only GSE7890 met the screening criteria. In the GSE7890 dataset, DKK1 and PTN were downregulated in keloid, whereas JAG1 and LGR5 were upregulated in keloid. In addition, we obtained the same conclusion through immunohistochemistry. Functional analysis indicated that these four DEIGs were mainly involved in stem cell, cell cycle, UV response, and therapy resistance. Through interactive network analysis, we found that these DEIGs were associated with drugs currently used to treat keloid, such as hydrocortisone, androstanolone, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, BHQ-880, and lecoleucovorin. Finally, many immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, resting memory CD4+ T cells, and M1 macrophages, were obtained by immune infiltration analysis. In conclusion, we identified four immune signaling molecules associated with keloid (LGR5, PTN, JAG1, and DKK1). These immune-related signaling molecules may be important modules in the pathogenesis of keloid. Additionally, we developed novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of this challenging disease.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Traditional treatments of SARC include nasal corticosteroids, antihistamines, and mast cell membrane stabilizers. Biological agents such as omalizumab have also been proved effective in the treatment of SARC. We aim to certify the preventative efficacy of omalizumab for SARC and explore its influence factors. Medical records of 64 SARC patients were retrospectively analyzed, and generalized linear models were used to analyze influence factors of efficacy of omalizumab. Compared with forepassed pollen season without omalizumab treatment, the combined symptom and medication score (CSMS) of ARC with pre-seasonal omalizumab was significantly lower (with omalizumab: 0.67[0.00,1.83], without omalizumab: 4.00[2.83,4.96], p<0.001, max score=6). Subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the influence factor of preventative efficacy of omalizumab. The CSMS with omalizumab treatment were not significantly different among different age, gender, dosage, number of injections, and injection date subgroups (p>0.05).

Increasing the proportion of this subset may lead to more effective therapies by improving CAR-T persistence; however, there is currently no standardized protocol for the effective generation of CAR-TSCM cells. Here we present a simplified protocol enabling efficient derivation of gene-modified TSCM cells: Stimulation of naïve CD8+ T cells with only soluble anti-CD3 antibody and culture with IL-7 and IL-15 was sufficient for derivation of CD8+ T cells harboring TSCM phenotypes and oligopotent capabilities. These in-vitro expanded TSCM cells were engineered with CARs targeting the HIV-1 envelope protein as well as the CD19 molecule and demonstrated effector activity both in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model.

"1176",35967431,"Protective role of Cav-1 in pneumolysin-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction.","Pneumolysin (PLY) is a bacterial pore forming toxin and primary virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumonia, a major cause of pneumonia. PLY binds cholesterol-rich domains of the endothelial cell (EC) plasma membrane resulting in pore assembly and increased intracellular (IC) Ca2+ levels that compromise endothelial barrier integrity. Caveolae are specialized plasmalemma microdomains of ECs enriched in cholesterol. We hypothesized that the abundance of cholesterol-rich domains in EC plasma membranes confers cellular susceptibility to PLY. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found increased PLY-induced IC Ca2+ following membrane cholesterol depletion. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is an essential structural protein of caveolae and its regulation by cholesterol levels suggested a possible role in EC barrier function. Indeed, Cav-1 and its scaffolding domain peptide protected the endothelial barrier from PLY-induced disruption. In loss of function experiments, Cav-1 was knocked-out using CRISPR-Cas9 or silenced in human lung microvascular ECs. Loss of Cav-1 significantly enhanced the ability of PLY to disrupt endothelial barrier integrity. Rescue experiments with re-expression of Cav-1 or its scaffolding domain peptide protected the EC barrier against PLY-induced barrier disruption. Dynamin-2 (DNM2) is known to regulate caveolar membrane endocytosis. Inhibition of endocytosis, with dynamin inhibitors or siDNM2 amplified PLY induced EC barrier dysfunction. These results suggest that Cav-1 protects the endothelial barrier against PLY by promoting endocytosis of damaged membrane, thus reducing calcium entry and PLY-dependent signaling.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Schistosomiasis has been a persistent problem in endemic areas as there is no vaccine available, currently used anti-helmintic medications do not prevent reinfection, and most concerning, drug resistance has been documented in laboratory and field isolates. Thus, alternative approaches to curtail this human disease are warranted. Understanding the immunobiology of the obligate intermediate host of these parasites, which include the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata, may facilitate the development of novel methods to stop or reduce transmission to humans. Molecules from the thioester-containing protein (TEP) superfamily have been shown to be involved in immunological functions in many animals including corals and humans. In this study we identified, characterized, and compared TEP transcripts and their expression upon S. mansoni exposure in resistant and susceptible strains of B. glabrata snails. Results showed the expression of 11 unique TEPs in B. glabrata snails. These transcripts present high sequence identity at the nucleotide and putative amino acid levels between susceptible and resistant strains. Further analysis revealed differences in several TEPs' constitutive expression levels between resistant and susceptible snail strains, with C3-1, C3-3, and CD109 having higher constitutive expression levels in the resistant (BS90) strain, whereas C3-2 and TEP-1 showed higher constitutive expression levels in the susceptible (NMRI) strain. Furthermore, TEP-specific response to S. mansoni miracidia exposure reiterated their differential expression, with resistant snails upregulating the expression of both TEP-4 and TEP-3 at 2 h and 48 h post-exposure, respectively.

Our research included retrospective studies and a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with cancer patients treated with ICIs and ATB, from the public database of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, clinical trials, and JAMA. The survival outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Meanwhile, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and subgroup analyses were performed to determine the concrete association between ATB use and the prognosis of cancer patients treated in ICIs. Our results revealed that ATB use was associated with poor survival outcomes, including OS (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.68-2.25, p <0.001) and PFS (HR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.53-2.19, p <0.001). The subgroup analysis learned about the association between ATB use and the prognosis of cancer patients with ICI treatment, including 5 cancer types, 3 kinds of ICI, 5 different ATP windows, broad-spectrum ATB class, and ECOG score. ATB treatment was associated with poor OS of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), esophageal cancer (EC), and melanoma (MEL) in patients treated in ICIs, while non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were associated with poor PFS. Meanwhile, it was strongly related to the ICI type and ATB window. Furthermore, it is firstly mentioned that the use of broad-spectrum ATB class was strongly associated with poor PFS. In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicated that ATB use was significantly associated with poor OS and PFS of cancer patients treated with ICI immunotherapy, especially for patients with ATB use in the period of (-60 days; +30 days) near the initiation of ICI treatment. Also, different cancer types and the ICI type can also impact the survival outcome. This first reveals the strong relationship between the broad-spectrum ATB class and poor PFS.

Functional validation studies were performed in vitro and in vivo including β-hexosaminidase release examination from mast cells and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) mouse model. We detected dramatically altered glycerophospholipids in CU patients compared with HCs. Phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) were increased, while phosphatidylcholine (PC) was reduced in CU patients. The reduction in PC was related to a high weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7), while PS was positively associated with the dermatology life quality index (DLQI). We also identified the differential lipid profiles between chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), symptomatic dermographism (SD), and CSU coexist with SD. CU patients were classified into two subtypes (subtype 1 and subtype 2) based on consensus clustering of lipid profiling. Compared with patients in subtype 2, patients in subtype 1 had elevated levels of PC (18:0e/18:2) and PE (38:2), and lower urticaria control test (UCT) scores indicated worse clinical efficiency of secondary generation H1 antihistamines treatment.

Many studies have demonstrated a close association of the higher density of intratumoral B cells with favorable outcomes in cancer patients. B cells can interact with T cells as well as follicular dendritic cells within tertiary lymphoid structures, where they undergo a series of biological events, including clonal expansion, somatic hypermutation, class switching, and tumor-specific antibody production, which may trigger antitumor humoral responses. After activation, B cells can function as effector cells via direct tumor-killing, antigen-presenting activity, and production of tumor-specific antibodies. At the other extreme, B cells can obtain inhibitory functions by relevant stimuli, converting to regulatory B cells, which serve as an immunosuppressive arm to tumor immunity.

We aim to characterize the role and relevance of histamine in CIndU. We systematically searched 3 electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Embase) for studies that reported increased serum or skin histamine concentration (direct evidence) or in vitro or ex vivo histamine release (indirect evidence) following trigger exposure.

The results of our review support that histamine has a key pathogenic role in the pathogenesis of all CIndUs, but it is not the sole mediator as evidenced by the often poor relationship between the level of histamine and severity of symptoms and the variable clinical efficacy of H1-antihistamines.

TLR4 and TLR7 were activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or imiquimod in the presence/absence of allopregnanolone or related neurosteroids and pro-inflammatory markers were detected by ELISA or western blotting. Cultured human monocyte-derived-macrophages exhibited typical morphology, a mixed immune profile of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers, with no sex difference at baseline. Allopregnanolone inhibited TLR4 activation in male and female donors, preventing LPS-induced elevations of TNF-α, MCP-1, pCREB and pSTAT1. In contrast, 3α,5α-THDOC and SGE-516 inhibited the TLR4 pathway activation in female, but not male donors. Allopregnanolone completely inhibited TLR7 activation by imiquimod, blocking IL-1-β, IL-6, pSTAT1 and pIRF7 elevations in females only. 3α,5α-THDOC and SGE-516 partially inhibited TLR7 activation, only in female donors. The results indicate that allopregnanolone inhibits TLR4 and TLR7 activation in cultured human macrophages resulting in diminished cytokine/chemokine production. Allopregnanolone inhibition of TLR4 activation was found in males and females, but inhibition of TLR7 signals exhibited specificity for female donors. 3α,5α-THDOC and SGE-516 inhibited TLR4 and TLR7 pathways only in females. These studies demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects of allopregnanolone in human macrophages for the first time and suggest that inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines may contribute to its therapeutic actions.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1185",35967447,"BSL2-compliant lethal mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern to evaluate therapeutics targeting the Spike protein.","Since first reported in 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly acquiring mutations, particularly in the spike protein, that can modulate pathogenicity, transmission and antibody evasion leading to successive waves of COVID19 infections despite an unprecedented mass vaccination necessitating continuous adaptation of therapeutics. Small animal models can facilitate understanding host-pathogen interactions, target selection for therapeutic drugs, and vaccine development, but availability and cost of studies in BSL3 facilities hinder progress. To generate a BSL2-compatible in vivo system that specifically recapitulates spike protein mediated disease we used replication competent, GFP tagged, recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus where the VSV glycoprotein was replaced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (rVSV-SARS2-S). We show that infection requires hACE2 and challenge of neonatal but not adult, K18-hACE2 transgenic mice (hACE2tg) leads to productive infection of the lungs and brains. Although disease progression was faster in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, infection with both viruses resulted in neuronal infection and encephalitis with increased expression of Interferon-stimulated Irf7, Bst2, Ifi294, as well as CxCL10, CCL5, CLC2, and LILRB4, and both models were uniformly lethal. Further, prophylactic treatment targeting the Spike protein (Receptor Binding Domain) with antibodies resulted in similar levels of protection from lethal infection against rVSV-SARS2-S and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Strikingly, challenge of neonatal hACE2tg mice with SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (SARS-CoV-2-α, -β, ϒ, or Δ) or the corresponding rVSV-SARS2-S viruses (rVSV-SARS2-Spike-α, rVSV-SARS2-Spike-β, rVSV-SARS2-Spike-ϒ or rVSV-SARS2-Spike-Δ) resulted in increased lethality, suggesting that the Spike protein plays a key role in determining the virulence of each variant. Thus, we propose that rVSV-SARS2-S virus can be used to understand the effect of changes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on infection and to evaluate existing or experimental therapeutics targeting spike protein of current or future VOC of SARS-CoV-2 under BSL-2 conditions.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

In this work, we assembled and evaluated an integrated experimental framework and analytical process to enable genome-wide scale discovery of ligand-receptors potentially used for cellular crosstalks, followed by targeted validation. We assessed the complementarity of four different technologies: single-cell RNA sequencing and Spatial transcriptomic (measuring over >20,000 genes), RNA In Situ Hybridization (RNAscope, measuring 4-12 genes) and Opal Polaris multiplex protein staining (4-9 proteins). To utilize the multimodal data, we implemented existing methods and also developed STRISH (Spatial TRanscriptomic In Situ Hybridization), a computational method that can automatically scan across the whole tissue section for local expression of gene (e.g. RNAscope data) and/or protein markers (e.g. Polaris data) to recapitulate an interaction landscape across the whole tissue. We evaluated the approach to discover and validate cell-cell interaction in situ through in-depth analysis of two types of cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which account for over 70% of cancer cases. We showed that inference of cell-cell interactions using scRNA-seq data can misdetect or detect false positive interactions. Spatial transcriptomics still suffers from misdetecting lowly expressed ligand-receptor interactions, but reduces false discovery. RNAscope and Polaris are sensitive methods for defining the location of potential ligand receptor interactions, and the STRISH program can determine the probability that local gene co-expression reflects true cell-cell interaction. We expect that the approach described here will be widely applied to discover and validate ligand receptor interaction in different types of solid cancer tumors.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1187",35967466,"Intestine epithelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles alleviate inflammation induced by Clostridioides difficile TcdB through the activity of TGF-β1.","Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been primarily associated with the toxin B (TcdB), one of the three known protein toxins secreted by C. difficile, which can activate the intestinal immune system and lead to pathological damage. Even though the biological functions of intestine epithelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles (I-Evs) have been well documented, the role of I-Evs in the process of CDI is still unknown. The protective effect of I-Evs against C. difficile TcdB was investigated both in cultured murine colon carcinoma MC38 cells and a mouse model used in this study. Mouse I-Evs with mean diameter ranging from 100 to 200 nm and a density of 1.09-1.17 g/mL were obtained and confirmed containing the Ev-associated specific surface markers CD63 and TSG101 as well as high level of TGF-β1. In MC38 cells, I-Evs were able to decrease the gene expression of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-22 induced by C. difficile TcdB, but to increase both the gene expression and protein levels of TGF-β1. I-Evs treatment via intraperitoneal administration alleviates C. difficile TcdB-induced local colon inflammation in mice and increased their survival rate from 50% up to 80%. Furthermore, I-Evs induced an increase in the proportion of CD4+Foxp3+Tregs in vitro and in vivo through a TGF-β1-dependent mechanism by activating the TGF-β1 pathway and prompting phosphorylation of the downstream proteins Smad 2/3. For the first time, our study demonstrated that I-Evs originated from intestine epithelial cells can alleviate inflammation induced by C. difficile TcdB both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, I-Evs might be potentially a novel endogenous candidate for effective treatment of CDI.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

However, there are several associated challenges, and some studies illustrate the limitations in elaborating educational technologies, called Design limitations. This aspect is responsible for unleashing various issues in the learning process, such as gender inequality, creating adverse effects on cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mediators, which opposes the fifth UN's Sustainable Development Goal. Therefore, many studies notice the harmful effects of stereotypes in educational technologies. These effects can be included in the design, like colors or other stereotyped elements, or how the activity is conducted. Based on this, the present study aimed to verify the predominance of color bias in educational technologies available on the WEB. This study developed a computational solution to calculate male and female color bias in the available educational technology web pages. The results suggest the prevalence of the development of educational technologies with a male color bias, with an imbalance among genders, without adequate customization for age groups. Furthermore, some environments, such as Computer Science, present a higher color bias for men when compared to women. Despite both scales being independent, results indicated interesting evidence of a substantial prevalence of colors associated with the male scale. According to the literature, this may be associated with dropout and lack of interest in female students, especially in sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics domains.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1189",35967515,"A comprehensive in silico exploration of the impacts of missense variants on two different conformations of human pirin protein.","Pirin, a member of the cupin superfamily, is an iron-binding non-heme protein. It acts as a coregulator of several transcription factors, especially the members of NFκB transcription factor family. Based on the redox state of its iron cofactor, it can assume two different conformations and thereby act as a redox sensor inside the nucleus. Previous studies suggested that pirin may be associated with cancer, inflammatory diseases as well as COVID-19 severities. Hence, it is important to explore the pathogenicity of its missense variants. In this study, we used a number of in silico tools to investigate the effects of missense variants of pirin on its structure, stability, metal cofactor binding affinity and interactions with partner proteins. In addition, we used protein dynamics simulation to elucidate the effects of selected variants on its dynamics. Furthermore, we calculated the frequencies of haplotypes containing pirin missense variants across five major super-populations (African, Admixed American, East Asian, European and South Asian). Among a total of 153 missense variants of pirin, 45 were uniformly predicted to be pathogenic. Of these, seven variants can be considered for further experimental studies. Variants R59P and L116P were predicted to significantly destabilize and damage pirin structure, substantially reduce its affinity to its binding partners and alter pirin residue fluctuation profile via changing the flexibility of several key residues. Additionally, variants R59Q, F78V, G98D, V151D and L220P were found to impact pirin structure and function in multiple ways. As no haplotype was identified to be harboring more than one missense variant, further interrogation of the individual effects of these seven missense variants is highly recommended. Pirin is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes and can play an important role in inflammatory responses. The variants predicted to be pathogenic in this study may thus contribute to a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of various inflammatory diseases. Future studies should be focused on clarifying if any of these variants can be used as disease biomarkers.

These atypical features may be confused with other etiologies causing a delay in diagnosis and management. We describe a young male patient who presented with neurological symptoms suggestive of PRES; however, the atypical radiological findings along with concomitant rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis led to a diagnostic dilemma. Repeat neuro-imaging after appropriate blood pressure control showed disappearance of the lesions confirming the diagnosis of PRES-SCI, and kidney biopsy showed advanced IgA nephropathy. Knowledge of atypical features of PRES is crucial amongst nephrologists as it is a common association with kidney disease and prompt identification and management avoid irreversible sequelae and unnecessary investigations.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Laparoscopic omentectomy is often undertaken as a salvage procedure in case of malfunctioning catheters. However, there is no randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the role of prophylactic laparoscopic omentectomy on catheter function. This pilot RCT was undertaken to evaluate the impact of laparoscopic omentectomy on the incidence of catheter malfunction. Consecutive patients were randomized into three groups: laparoscopic PDCI with omentectomy (Group A), laparoscopic PDCI without omentectomy (Group B) and open surgical PDCI (Group C). The primary outcome was the incidence of catheter malfunction at 6 weeks and 3 months. Forty-one patients completed follow-up, with 16, 11, and 14 patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. Incidence of catheter malfunction was 6.2%, 27.3%, and 14.3% in Groups A, B, and C, respectively, at 6 weeks and 6.2%, 36.4%, and 21.4% at 3 months, respectively.

Operating time was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in Group A. Laparoscopic omentectomy may be associated with a lower incidence of catheter malfunction, especially in patients with previously failed peritoneal dialysis catheter.

Our hypothesis is that for preterm infants <30 weeks with potential to develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is non-inferior to the nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) as primary respiratory support before minimal invasive surfactant administration (MISA). The NIV-MISA-RDS trial is planned as an unblinded, multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority trial at 14 tertiary neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in China. Eligible infants are preterm infants of 24-29+6 weeks of gestational age who have spontaneous breaths at birth and require primary NIV support for RDS. Infants are randomized 1:1 to treatment with either NCPAP or NIPPV once admitted into NICUs. If an infant presents progressively aggravated respiratory distress and is clinically diagnosed as having RDS, pulmonary surfactant will be supplemented by MISA in the first 2 h of life. The primary outcome is NIV treatment failure within 72 h after birth. With a specified non-inferiority margin of 10%, using a two-sided 95% CI and 80% power, the study requires 480 infants per group (in total 960 infants). Current evidence shows that NIV and MISA may be the most effective strategy for minimizing IMV in preterm infants with RDS. However, there are few large randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of NCPAP and NIPPV as the primary respiratory support after birth and before surfactant administration. We will conduct this trial to test the hypothesis that NCPAP is not inferior to NIPPV as the initial respiratory support in reducing the use of IMV in premature infants who have spontaneous breaths after birth and who do not require intubation in the first 2 h after birth.

We hypothesized that telesimulation training would improve pediatric shock recognition, process of care, and patient outcomes in both simulated and real patient settings. We conducted a prospective quasi-experimental interrupted time series cohort study over 9 months. We conducted 40 telesimulation sessions for 76 participants in teams of 3 or 4, utilizing the video telecommunication platform (Zoom©). Trained observers recorded time-critical interventions on real patients for the pediatric emergency teams composed of residents, fellows, and nurses. Data were collected on 332 pediatric patients in shock (72% of whom were in septic shock) before, during, and after the intervention. The data included the first hour time-critical intervention checklist, patient hemodynamic status at the end of the first hour, time for the resolution of shock, and team leadership skills in the emergency room. There was a significant improvement in the percent completion of tasks by the pediatric emergency team in simulated scenarios (69% in scenario 1 vs. 93% in scenario 2; p < 0.001).

We considered effects of endogenous, exogenous, and genetic factors on measured differences in vitamin D levels among children with JIA. Our findings are based on a study sample of 150 patients with various variants of JIA and 277 healthy children. The blood level of vitamin D was assessed by calcidiol level. The following factors were included in our analysis: age and sex; level of insolation in three regions of country (center, south, north); assessment of dietary intake of vitamin D; effect of prophylactic doses of cholecalciferol; a relationship between the TaqI, FokI, and BsmI polymorphisms of the VDR gene and serum 25(OH)D concentration. We identified a high frequency of low vitamin D among children with JIA, prevalence of 66%, with the medial level of vitamin D being within the range of insufficient vitamin D. We also show that the dietary intake of vitamin D by children with JIA is well below expected norms, and that prophylactic doses of vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol) at a dose of 500-1,000 IU/day and 1,500-2,000 IU/day do not meet the vitamin D needs of children with JIA.

Prophylactic administration of cholecalciferol and season of year play a determining role in the development of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1204",35967570,"Vaccination timeliness and associated factors among children aged 12-23 months in Debre Libanos district of North Shewa Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia.","Globally, vaccination is one of the most cost-effective interventions in promoting child survival, preventing 2-3 million child deaths annually from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). In Ethiopia, timely vaccination is stated as key to the prevention of unnecessary childhood mortality from measles, pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, and other VPDs. However, Ethiopia ranked fifth among the ten countries with the most unprotected children. Furthermore, previous vaccine timeliness studies produced widely disparate results. As a result, it was suggested that more research be conducted to investigate the potential factors behind the high proportion of untimely vaccination. Therefore, this study was intended to explore the association between different factors and the proportion of vaccination timeliness administered under the Expanded Program on Immunization in Debre Libanos district, Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed from 1 May to 30 May 2021 among children aged 12 to 23 months with their mother/caregiver, who had started vaccination and had vaccination cards in the Debre Libanos. Simple random sampling techniques and pretested semi-structured questionnaires were used for data collection. At last, a multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the vaccination timeliness. In this study, 413 children aged 12 to 23 months were interviewed with their mother/caregiver. Overall, 33.7% [95% CI (29.1-38.3)] of children received their vaccines timely. Having a female child [AOR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.58-5.35], mother/caregiver attending primary [AOR: 6.33, 95% CI: 2.66-15.06] and secondary/above education [AOR: 5.61, 95% CI: 2.41-13.04], sufficient vaccination knowledge [AOR: 3.46, 95% CI: 1.87-6.38], mother/caregiver with least hesitant [AOR: 3.35, 95% CI: 1.51-7.41] and middle hesitant [AOR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.05-3.58], utilization of ANC [AOR: 2.89, 95% CI: 1.32-6.33], and giving birth at health facility [AOR: 4.32, 95% CI: 1.95-9.59] were the factors independently associated with vaccination timeliness. In comparison to Ethiopia's existing vaccination coverage, the proportion of children immunized at the recommended time interval is low in the study district.

It is still unknown whether azygos vein preservation will increase the difficulty or time of operation and reduce the quality of anastomosis. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to explore the puzzle. Two researchers independently searched the databases. Randomized controlled trials were included if these studies applied thoracotomy to perform operations and compared the outcomes in patients with EA/TEF between azygos vein preservation groups and azygos vein ligation groups. The Jadad score was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the I 2 value. A fixed or random-effect model was applied regarding the I 2 value. Four studies involving 286 patients were included. The pooled estimates indicated that preservation of the azygos vein decreased the incidence of anatomic leakage with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 0.54 (95% CI 0.29-0.99, P = 0.05) and mortality with an RR of 0.51 (95% CI 0.29-0.90; P = 0.02). Preservation of the azygos vein might not require a longer operative time than ligation of the azygos vein. This research certifies that preservation of the azygos vein is able to reduce the prevalence of anastomotic leakage and mortality.","meta_analysis","christiaan","meta_analysis"

The objective of this study is to analyze the clinical course of patients attended during the first months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a third-level pediatric hospital. Design: prospective cohort study. Patients with viral respiratory disease or suspected cases of COVID-19 were evaluated at the Pediatric Hospital, National Medical Center XXI Century, Mexico City, from 21 March 2020 to 13 January 2021. Statistical analysis: Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used for comparisons; a logistic regression model was constructed to identify clinical or laboratory characteristics associated with critical disease. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 697 patients met the operational definition of viral respiratory disease or suspected cases of COVID-19 and underwent real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 testing. Patients with a positive result were included. Of the 181 patients (26%), 121 (66.8%) had mild disease and were treated as outpatients and 60 (33.1%) were hospitalized. A total of six patients met the criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Of the 60 inpatients, 65% were males, and 82% had one or more comorbidities. The main comorbidities were cancer (42%) and overweight (15%). The median hospital stay was 9 days. The inpatients had a higher frequency of fever, general malaise, dyspnea, chills, polypnea, and cyanosis than the outpatients (p < 0.05). Only 21.4% of the outpatients had one or more comorbidities, which were lower than in the hospitalized patients (p < 0.001). Laboratory data at admission were similar between critically ill and those with moderate and severe disease. The patients who developed pneumonia were at higher risk of critical disease, while older age was associated with a better prognosis. A total of 13 of the 60 inpatients died (mortality 7.1%). All but one had one or more comorbidities: four had cancer, four congenital heart disease, one chronic kidney disease and epilepsy, one Epstein-Barr virus-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, one obesity, and one diabetes mellitus. Hospital mortality is high, especially in children with comorbidities. Despite 2 years having passed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the epidemiological and clinical data on children are still helpful to improve their prognosis.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

However, the exact cell type contributing to metastasis remains elusive. Using a Rb1 L/L /Trp53 L/L mouse model, we identify the NCAMhiCD44lo/- subpopulation as the SCLC metastasizing cell (SMC), which is progressively transitioned from the non-metastasizing NCAMloCD44hi cell (non-SMC). Integrative chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling studies reveal the important role of the SWI/SNF complex, and knockout of its central component, Brg1, significantly inhibits such phenotypic transition and metastasis. Mechanistically, TAZ is silenced by the SWI/SNF complex during SCLC malignant progression, and its knockdown promotes SMC transition and metastasis. Importantly, ectopic TAZ expression reversely drives SMC-to-non-SMC transition and alleviates metastasis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses identify SMC as the dominant subpopulation in human SCLC metastasis, and immunostaining data show a positive correlation between TAZ and patient prognosis. These data uncover high SCLC plasticity and identify TAZ as the key molecular switch in orchestrating SCLC phenotypic transition and metastasis.","misc","christiaan","rodent"

Current strategies for boosting high-quality graphene growth, such as remote metal catalyzation, are limited by poor performance with respect to the release of metal catalysts and hence suffer from a problem with metal residues. Herein, we report an effective approach that utilizes a metal-containing species, copper acetate, to continuously supply copper clusters in a gaseous form to aid transfer-free growth of graphene over a wafer scale. The thus-derived graphene films were found to show reduced multilayer density and improved electrical performance and exhibited a carrier mobility of 8500 cm2 V-1 s-1. Furthermore, droplet-based hydrovoltaic electricity generator devices based on directly grown graphene were found to exhibit robust voltage output and long cyclic stability, in stark contrast to their counterparts based on transferred graphene, demonstrating the potential for emerging energy harvesting applications. The work presented here offers a promising solution to organize the metal catalytic booster toward transfer-free synthesis of high-quality graphene and enable smart energy generation.","misc","christiaan","misc"

However, few studies have investigated teachers' construction processes that form construction outcomes, which would help navigate the role of legislation in school discipline. This study contributes to a holistic picture of the neglected disciplinary rights that teachers construct in teaching practice and their underexplored attitude toward the law, using an interview-based constructionist method on twelve teachers of Lvliang city in a Chinese K-12 context. The findings suggest that the participants prefer to acquire discipline knowledge by interacting with multiple power relations in their local environment and that their knowledge is historically and culturally specific. Although the disciplinary right they construct is never static, balanced, or essentialised, the participants' constructions are commonly not in line with legal provisions or the aims of the law. Furthermore, school discipline legislation plays a silent role in empowering teachers to discipline students, but it is more visible in holding back teachers' use of corporal punishment. These findings illustrate the complexity of implementing school disciplinary law as a universal national policy.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The training consisted of being taken capture and put through a number of realistic and threatening scenarios, targeting survival strategies taught in the preceding week. Between scenarios, the trainees were held in a holding cell where they were monitored by a guard. The saliva samples were taken in conjunction with the scenarios. The whole training took place over a period of ~24 h. Cognitive performance was measured at baseline and after training. Three groups took part Group A (n = 20) was taken after 48 h of intense tasks leaving them in a poor resting state. Group B (n = 23) was well rested at CAC onset. Group C (n = 10) was part of a survival, evasion, resistance, and escape (SERE) instructor course. The CAC training was the same for all groups. Group A exhibited a high increase in cortisol during CAC, compared to baseline levels were multiple times as high as expected values. Group B exhibited elevated levels slightly lower than those of group A, they also dropped to normal levels during the latter part of the exercise. Group C displayed the least increase with only slightly elevated levels. CAC training is stressful and cortisol levels were elevated enough to satisfy the prerequisite for effective stress inoculation. No cognitive performance drop could be identified; however, several participants froze during the exercise due to intensive stress.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

Its course is explained in part by psychosocial variables such as emotional distress, coping strategies, or perceived control. Thus, to reduce fatigue, psychosocial interventions appear to be relevant. In some cancers, Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT) reduce fatigue. Hypnosis is also used as a complementary therapy to reduce the side effects of cancer. While CBT requires specific training often reserved for psychologists, hypnosis has the advantage of being increasingly practiced by caregivers and is therefore less expensive (Montgomery et al., 2007). On the other hand, CBT and hypnosis remain understudied in the CRC, do not focus on the symptom of fatigue and in Europe such programs have never been evaluated. Implementing an intervention in a healthcare setting is complex (e.g., economic and practical aspects) and recruiting participants can be challenging. The primary objective will therefore be to study the feasibility of two standardized interventions (hypnosis and CBT) that aim to reduce fatigue in patients with CRCm treated in a French cancer center. A prospective, single-center, randomized interventional feasibility study, using mixed methods (both quantitative and qualitative). A total of 60 patients will be allocated to each intervention group [Hypnosis (n = 30) and CBT (n = 30)]. Participants will be randomized into two parallel groups (ratio 1:1). Both programs will consist of 6 weekly sessions focusing on the CRF management over a period of 6 weeks. Trained therapists will conduct the program combining 3 face-to-face sessions and 3 online sessions. The feasibility and experience of interventions will be evaluated by the outcome variables, including the adhesion rate, the reasons for acceptability, relevance or non-adherence, the satisfaction, the fatigue evolution (with ecological momentary assessments), and the quality of life. All questionnaires will be self-assessment using an online application from the cancer center. Results will highlight the barriers/facilitators to the implementation of the program and the relevance of the program to the patients, and will be used to generate hypotheses for a randomized control trial.

Only the idiosyncratic return variance can decrease future short-term or contemporaneous stock liquidity. Idiosyncratic factors are more important than systematic ones for contemporaneous and future stock liquidity. The predictive power of the determinants decreases with the forecast length. Economic policy uncertainty (EPU) can affect sensitivity of stock liquidity to contemporaneous determinants.

The roles of need for belonging (NTB) as a mediator and identification with one's group as a moderator of this relationship were examined. Perceived social support was also examined as both a potential moderator and mediator. We also included a measure of perceived in-group inclusion in the host society, the Circle of Ingroup Inclusion (CII), to examine its influence on the relationship between discrimination and wellbeing. Three types of coping styles-active constructive coping, passive constructive coping, and destructive coping-were controlled for in the analysis. Results showed that participants' educational level, socioeconomic status, and different coping styles predicted wellbeing; however, discrimination was the strongest (negative) predictor of wellbeing. Social support was both a moderator and mediator of the relationship between discrimination and wellbeing, suggesting that perceived social support not only buffers the negative effect of discrimination on wellbeing, but also partially explains the negative association between discrimination and wellbeing. NTB was not a significant mediator. Identification with one's ethnic group and perceived membership in one's group also did not affect the relationship. The results suggest that it is important to consider social support based on interpersonal relationships among members of minority groups in Japanese society.

There are two implicit theories on the malleability of one's ability: entity theory and incremental theory. They constrain and regulate people's understanding and responses to an individual's behavior, leading to different social cognitive patterns and behavioral responses. Resilience is a positive adaptation in highly stressful situations that represents mechanisms for coping with and transcending difficult experiences, i.e., a person's ability to successfully adapt to change, resist the adverse effects of stressors, avoid significant dysfunction, and be chronically affected by considered a protective factor for mental health. Although previous studies showed that individuals' implicit theories are associated with resilience, this relationship has received little attention in the nursing population. It is unclear which variables may contribute to explaining the relationship between implicit theories and resilience. Therefore, the current study aims to deeply explore the relationship between implicit theories and the resilience of Chinese nurses. In addition, we also seek to demonstrate the chain mediating effects of grit and meaning in life on this relationship. We surveyed 709 Chinese nurses through online questionnaires using the self-made demographic questionnaire, the Implicit Theories Scale, the Short Grit Scale, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. After controlling for demographic variables such as age, gender, educational background, marital status, professional title, and working years, the results reveal positive associations between Chinese nurses' implicit theories and their resilience, and grit and meaning in life play a partial mediating role in this relationship, respectively. Furthermore, grit and meaning in life play a chain mediating role between implicit theories and resilience. These findings contribute to understanding the psychological impact mechanism of implicit theories on nurses' resilience and provide a theoretical basis for nursing managers to formulate strategies to improve nurses' psychological resilience.","misc","christiaan","misc"

To preserve long-term and sustained consumer loyalty, retailers must continually improve the customer experiences. This study presents a framework for online retailing in a digital environment called the Online Customer Experience-Engagement Context model in the presence of value co-creation (VCC). Data was gathered from 189 people who purchased products online. For additional analysis, testing the hypothesis, and model construction, SPSS 26 and Smart-PLS were used. The data was then evaluated further using descriptive statistics, path analysis, measurement, and structural model. The findings show that the online customer experience (measured as shopping environment, shopping procedure, staff service experience, and product experience) substantially influenced customer engagement, which improved customer loyalty. The VCC strengthened the link between online customer experience and customer engagement. It suggests that including consumers in co-creating a delightful online customer experience from time to time may be a valuable strategy for online retailers to increase customer engagement and loyalty. To create an overarching outcome, information integration theory (IIT), multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT), and the attitude-behavior-context theory (ABC) theories are converged to explain the proposed model in the study.","misc","christiaan","misc"

In order to investigate the correlation between college students' English writing self-efficacy and English writing psychological anxiety, we conducted a questionnaire survey on 595 current college students who were not majoring in English at a university in China, and used SPSS 25.0 software to make an empirical analysis of the collected data. The results showed that college students' English writing self-efficacy was at a moderate level, and they lacked self-confidence in their English writing skills and tended to complete writing tasks; college students generally had a moderate level of psychological anxiety in English writing, among which avoidance behavior was the most significant; college students' English writing self-efficacy was significantly negatively related to English writing psychological anxiety. English writing self-efficacy can reduce psychological anxiety level by enhancing college students' English writing motivation. Therefore, we suggest that we should set up English writing courses based on the process teaching method, change college students' English writing psychology in teaching, set reasonable writing goals, mobilize their enthusiasm and motivation in English writing, reduce college students' writing anxiety, and enhance their self-confidence in English writing.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Data were collected between November 15 and December 14, 2021, and three attitudes were included, namely, the negative influence on daily life, concerns of infection risk, and prediction of the ending of the pandemic. The majority of people perceived that daily life was at least somewhat negatively influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, and they worried at least once a week about infection risk. After the emergence of the omicron variant, the perceived negative influence and concern of infection risk decreased slightly while the prediction of ending increased significantly. People who were infected by COVID-19 perceived more negative influence and more concern of infection risk, but were more optimistic about the ending of the pandemic. People who did not get a vaccine perceived less negative influence and less concern of infection risk, but were more pessimistic about the ending of the pandemic. The attitudes varied significantly by individual and contextual characteristics. The emergence of omicron significantly increased people's predicted ending time of the pandemic but did not change people's perception of the pandemic's negative influence on daily life and concern of infection risk.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1227",35967640,"The impact of criminal law regulation-based business environment optimization on entrepreneurial spirit and enterprise development.","The purpose is to explore the impact of the business environment optimization by Criminal Law Regulation (CLR) on Entrepreneurial Spirit (ES) and Enterprise Development (ED) and to provide a reference for subsequent related research. Based on this, this work first makes a detailed analysis of the business environment and CLR. Second, the research hypotheses are put forward, and the conceptual model is proposed. At the same time, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) is designed to analyze the business environment, ES, and ED, and their relationships. Finally, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) is constructed and the CLR-optimized business environment is used as the intermediary variable to explore the impact of the business environment on ES and ED. Then, 200 QSs (recovering 192 valid ones) are distributed to investigate entrepreneurs' attitudes toward ES and ED in different regions. Statistical analysis and independent t-tests are performed on the survey results to judge the relationship between variables. The results of empirical analysis show that (1) The significance coefficient P of ES and ED is 0.005 < 0.01, and the scores of ES and ED of large enterprises are 132.7864 and 142.3243, respectively, which are the highest. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the ED. (2) The influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ES is 0.60, and the influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ED is 0.75. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation plays a positive role in the development of ES. CLR-optimized business regulation plays a regulating role between ES and ED. (3) CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the formation of ES. The policy enlightenment of this work mainly has three points. First, optimizing the business environment can stimulate and protect ES, thus improving the quality of economic growth. All regions should promote mass entrepreneurship and innovation and high-quality economic development by improving the convergence of economic policies and building a legal and market-oriented business environment. Second, all regions should implement dynamic and differentiated policies to optimize the business environment's spatial pattern in Chinese cities. Third, there is a need to further strengthen the construction of new infrastructure through cutting-edge information technologies, such as Fifth Generation (5G) mobile communication, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1228",35967642,"Using Spiritual Connections to Cope With Stress and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic.","During the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, stress and anxiety were pervasive among the masses due to high morbidity and mortality. Besides the fear of coronavirus was also particularly driven by social media. Many people started to look for faith and spiritual connections to gain comfort. The role of spiritual ties and religious beliefs in relation to coping with pandemic stress has acquired the attention of researchers in some parts of the world. This cross-sectional survey aimed at assessing the intensity of stress and anxiety symptoms experienced by people and how much they were alleviated by employing spiritual connections. The study sample comprises 795 respondents with 52% males and 48% females living in Saudi Arabia. The brief online study questionnaire collected data about background variables, anxiety and stress scale from DASS-21, and items from the WHOQOL (SRBP) instrument assessed the use of spiritual beliefs to cope. Multiple regression models were tested to determine the role of spiritual connections after adjusting demographic variables. Results illustrated that after adjusting for gender and age, participants' anxiety symptoms decreased by (β = -0.27; p = 0.000) units with each unit increase in the use of spiritual connections, and participants' stress symptoms reduce by (β = -0.36; p = 0.000) units with each unit increase in coping with spirituality. Additionally, females' risk to experience anxiety and stress symptoms was more than males [(β = 0.88; p = 0.01) and (β = 0.92; p = 0.000)], respectively. An increase in age decreases the likelihood of experiencing anxiety symptoms and stress symptoms by (β = -0.75; p = 0.02) and (β = -0.11; p = 0.000) units, respectively. Findings support the protective role of spiritual connections despite small beta coefficients. The social and cultural context in Saudi Arabia favors deep-rooted connections with spirituality and faith. Our findings support the fact that the reliance on spiritual connections helped older people to deal with exaggerated fear during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduces the risk of experiencing anxiety and stress symptoms. Females and younger participants were relatively vulnerable to developing these symptoms. We discussed these findings considering some recent studies that reported similar relationships and made recommendations for future research.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1229",35967644,"Assessing the Satisfaction and Acceptability of an Online Parent Coaching Intervention: A Mixed-Methods Approach.","Parent-mediated intervention (PMI) has been studied in promoting skill acquisition or behavior change in the children with autism spectrum disorder. Most studies emphasize on the improvement of child's core symptoms or maladaptive behaviors, making parental perceived competence and self-efficacy secondary. Yet, the evaluations of intervention implementation are under-reported, especially when translating such interventions into a new population or context. This research investigated the intervention implementation of a 12-week parent coaching intervention which was delivered through telehealth and tailored to Chinese population. The intervention was based on the Parent-mediated Early Start Denver Model with culturally adapted lectures, manuals, and demonstration and commentary videos. This study aimed to evaluate the intervention implementation by assessing parents' satisfaction, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with two telehealth conditions: self-directed and web+group therapy. Parents in the self-directed condition received intervention individually through the online learning platform. The web+group therapy condition navigated the same program with weekly 1.5-h group coaching sessions via videoconferencing. This mixed-methods study used a concurrent convergent design to evaluate the intervention implementation at post-intervention. The quantitative data was collected from the Program Evaluation Survey and the qualitative data was collected from five focus groups. Parents in self-directed group reported significantly lower scores in total perceived competence than parents in web+group therapy condition, while there was no group difference on the total self-efficacy. Tailored feedback, demonstration and commentary videos, peer commenting, live coaching, and guided reflection were the top-five acceptable telehealth strategies that were strongly endorsed by parents. Family centered care, home-based intervention, strategies relative to daily activities, the remote learning platform, and the program-based community were elements that parents considered when evaluating the program's appropriateness. Parent modeling, step-by-step instructions, and tailored feedback were key components in making intervention strategies feasible for parents to implement at home. Findings indicate the application of telehealth was acceptable, appropriate, and feasible for Chinese parents. Group-based parent coaching intervention via videoconferencing could be a promising home-based service model to increase parental perceived competence. A large-scale RCT is needed to investigate the effectiveness of group-based PMI via telehealth.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"
"1230",35967647,"The Effects of Teacher Feedback and Automated Feedback on Cognitive and Psychological Aspects of Foreign Language Writing: A Mixed-Methods Research.","Feedback plays a crucial role in the writing processes. However, in the literature on foreign language (FL) writing, there is a dearth of studies that compare the effects of teacher feedback and automated feedback on both cognitive and psychological aspects of FL writing. To fill this gap, the current study compared the effects of teacher feedback and automated feedback on both revision quality and writing proficiency development (i.e., the cognitive aspects), and perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the feedback (i.e., the psychological aspects) in English writing among English learners as an FL (EFLs) in China. It also investigated students' perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the two types of feedback. The study adopted a mixed-methods design. The quantitative method collected the data through (1) a pre-test and a post-test, which measured the participants' English writing proficiency development; (2) a writing task, which received either teacher feedback or automated feedback; and (3) a close-ended questionnaire, which examined students' perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the feedback. The qualitative method collected the data through an open-ended questionnaire, which examined the participants' perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of teacher feedback or automated feedback depending on the type of feedback they received. Chinese university EFLs in two English classes (n = 35 in each class) taught by the same English teacher participated in the study: one class received teacher feedback while the other received automated feedback using Pigaiwang. While the students in the two classes did not differ significantly on the pre-test of students' writing proficiency, students who received teacher feedback scored significantly higher on revision than those who received automated feedback. Students in the teacher feedback class also had significantly higher ratings on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the feedback than those in the automated feedback class. However, students in the automated feedback class obtained significantly higher scores on the post-test of the writing proficiency. The qualitative results identified three themes of strengths and two themes of weaknesses for the teacher feedback and the automated feedback, respectively. The results suggest that while teacher feedback has a more positive effect on the psychological aspect of FL writing, automated feedback may be more effective in developing FL writing proficiency in the long run.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Self-administered questionnaires were used for collecting data from 367 respondents with prior experience in visiting the general practice clinics in Malaysia. SmartPLS statistical tool was used to test the underlying hypotheses. The results revealed that ambiance, service delivery, interior decor, and cleanliness had a significant influence on patients' trust and satisfaction while the exterior design is neither associated with satisfaction nor trust. Patients' satisfaction and trust had a higher significant effect on their repatronage intention, willingness to pay for a premium healthcare service, and engagement in word-of-mouth for healthcare services. In practice, both the service delivery and ambiance features of the healthcare services environment might be optimized by GP clinics. This research provides significant insights from the patients' perspective toward the GP clinics' healthcare services environment.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effect of bank employees' health beliefs about COVID-19 on knowledge sharing mediated by their self-efficacy. From the perspective of social cognitive theory and the health belief model, this study investigates whether employees' perception of susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 affects formal as well as informal knowledge sharing through knowledge sharing self-efficacy. A sample of 407 bank employees (200 women and 207 men) in China was used for the study. The formulated hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping. The results showed that employees' perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 significantly undermines formal and informal knowledge sharing self-efficacy. However, there was no significant difference in the extent of its indirect effects on formal and informal knowledge sharing. Further, employees' perceived severity of COVID-19 had no effect on knowledge sharing self-efficacy and on formal and informal knowledge sharing, which could have resulted from the COVID-19 outbreak in China.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Most psychological treatments have shown limited effectiveness on anxiety and depression in these patients. This study evaluates the feasibility of the attention training technique (ATT) in CHD patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Five consecutive CHD patients with significant depression and anxiety symptoms with Hospital Anxiety and Depression rating scale (HADS) -anxiety or -depression subscale score > 8 received 6 weekly group-sessions of ATT in an open trial. Outcomes included feasibility and symptoms measured by HADS, at baseline, post-treatment and at 6 months follow-up. We also assessed psychiatric diagnoses, type D personality, insomnia, worry, and rumination. The sample comprised five men with a mean age of 59.9 (SD 4.4) years. Four of the patients attended all six sessions, and one patient attended all but one session. Mean HADS-A scores at baseline, post-treatment, and follow-up were 9.4 (SD 3.0), 4.2 (SD 3.0), and 4.0 (SD 2.5), and for HADS-D 8.6 (SD 3.3), 3.0 (SD 3.7), and 1.6 (SD 1.5), respectively. The results showed clinically significant changes in anxiety, depression, psychiatric disorders, insomnia, worry, and rumination. Statistically significant changes were found from pre- to post-treatment scores for HADS-A and worry, which were maintained at follow-up, and HADS-D scores significantly decreased from pre-treatment to 6-months follow-up. ATT in a group format appears to be a feasible stand-alone metacognitive treatment for CHD patients. An adequately powered randomized controlled trial is warranted.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Electronic databases searches (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Ebsco) for relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals were conducted, and eligibility criteria were based on the PICOS model in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies were considered as follows: (a) highly trained and elite adult (>18 years) women's soccer players; (b) continuous (minimum 1-week duration) TL monitoring in the context of the team routine; (c) TL collected from entire training session. Methodological qualitative assessments and risk of bias criteria were used for judging the studies. A total of 1,163 studies were identified, and 16 were included. The selected studies were fully screened to extract the population characteristics; the number of players; a type of study design; region where the study was performed; the main findings. Accumulated external TL (ETL) during the pre-season was positively correlated to enhanced adaptations in intermittent exercise capacity. Daily ETL was negatively correlated to next-day self-reported fatigue and muscle soreness. Daily internal TL (ITL) was negatively correlated to post-session sleep duration and sleep efficiency. One study showed that higher accumulated player load and total distance were associated with injury. Information about TL during training sessions in women soccer players is very sparse, and it is currently very difficult to consider evidence-based practices for training sessions in highly trained and elite adult women soccer players. Moreover, the dose-response relationships between TL and training outcome (e.g., fatigue, training adaptations and injuries) need to be further explored to understand the optimal training stimulus to enhance performance outcomes while preserving player health.","systematic_review","christiaan","systematic_review"

The BRG may be modulated by participants' subjective familiarity with words as previous studies found smaller regional activations in the brain as they become proficient. It can be assumed that visual recognition of words with high subjective familiarity indicates skilled performance in visual recognition. Thus, this study examined the subjective familiarity effect of visual words on the BRG during lateralized lexical decision performances. It showed that the significant BRG of response times was only observed in the most familiar word condition (F4 level); on the other hand, accuracy results revealed the significant BRGs in all the subjective familiarity levels (F1, F2, F3, and F4 levels). These results suggest that the bilateral presentation of identical words with higher subjective familiarity facilitates the recognition led by cooperative interactions between cerebral hemispheres. Therefore, the subjective familiarity with visual words modulates the efficiency of hemispheric interactions in visual word recognition.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The study includes participants aged between 12 and 16 years old (M = 13.99; SD = 1.352). Of these, 738 were male (49.9%) and 740 were female (50.1%). A correlational study was carried out using online tools with suitable psychometrics parameters (content-construct validity and reliability). The first one was a scale that measured social abilities, and the second one evaluated racist or xenophobic cyberbullying, differentiating the victim and aggressor profiles. The results indicated five main findings: (1) generally, the participants analyzed present all their social abilities; (2) for the most part, these participants do not normally experience cyberbullying; (3) a positive correlation exists between the majority of social abilities analyzed and the cybervictim profile. It was also observed a negative correlation between the social ability associated with the ability of making requests and this profile; (4) there is a positive correlation among the six social abilities analyzed and the cyberaggressor profile; (5) the racist or xenophobic cyberbullying are driven not only by the absence of social abilities, but in some cases, they are also driven by socio-demographic variables (i.e., age and gender). Likewise, this work shows how the absence of some social abilities in some participants involve racist or xenophobic experiences as victims and as aggressors, which may be of interest for the analysis of teenagers' behavior in intercultural contexts, as well as according to age and gender. More transcultural research need to be carried out to know the global perspective of the link between social abilities and the different profiles of racist and xenophobic cyberbullying, framed in the context of social psychology and studies of mass communication.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

It uses data from family firms that have issued A-shares from 2008 to 2018. They used pooled OLS regression for data analysis and Tobit regression for robustness checks. This study classifies family firm types into two categories, namely, the lone-controller family firms (LCFFs) and the multi-controller family firms (MCFFs), with each being further classified as excess or no excess voting rights. Both LCFFs without excess voting rights and MCFFs with excess voting rights have the ability and willingness toward R&D investment. LCFFs with excess voting rights and MCFFs without excess voting rights only have the ability but low willingness to invest in R&D. The study also establishes that Chinese family-controlled firms are heterogeneous toward risky investment. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to differentiate Chinese family firms by their unique ownership structure characteristics in investigating the effect of the family firm structure on R&D investment. The study is a novel attempt to test the willingness and ability framework of LCFFs and MCFFs. Previous studies based on agency theory have tacitly assumed that ability and willingness exist in family-controlled firms.

We systematically reviewed studies of the cognitive training of episodic memory in healthy elderly individuals and elderly individuals with clinical conditions. We systematically searched the PubMed, PsycNET, Web of Science, and SciELO databases using the descriptors Episodic Memory AND Training AND Elderly OR Aging OR Dementia in English and translated into Portuguese.

The main results indicated effectiveness with regard to different forms of the cognitive training of episodic memory. Episodic memory training among the elderly can mitigate the negative effects of cognitive decline in dementia and healthy subjects promoting impacts at social, psychological, and economic levels. Although it is a widely studied topic, further empirical studies on the utility of episodic memory training in healthy elderly individuals and elderly individuals with clinical conditions are still needed.","systematic_review","christiaan","systematic_review"

Response time was assessed using ASAYAR software, problem-solving skills (PSS) were measured using the Hepner Petersen Problem Solving Questionnaire (PSI), and cognitive emotion regulation strategies were assessed using the Garnfsky Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson's r correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression analysis were applied using SPSS 14.0. The results of our study showed that the total mean score for problem-solving skills was 136.84 (14.65) (range, 175-107 points). Multiple linear regression indicated that refocusing on planning, positive evaluation, stress management courses, delays and their causes, positive refocusing, catastrophizing, and acceptance were effective predictors of problem-solving skills in emergency personnel, accounting for 54% of the total variances. This study is one of the first studies in this field. Based on our findings, individuals who consider their emotions and feelings when solving problems are better able to use the process of thinking and problem-solving skills. Therefore, by training people in the field of emotional regulation skills, the skills to solve problems technicians can be increased.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

It is key to well-being and human development. From infancy to adulthood, human interactions ceaselessly contribute to the flourishing or impairment of intersubjectivity. In this work, we first describe intersubjectivity as a hallmark of quality dyadic processes. Then, using parent-child relationship as an example, we propose a dyadic active inference model to elucidate an inverse relation between stress and intersubjectivity. We postulate that impaired intersubjectivity is a manifestation of underlying problems of deficient relational benevolence, misattributing another person's intentions (over-mentalizing), and neglecting the effects of one's own actions on the other person (under-coupling). These problems can exacerbate stress due to excessive variational free energy in a person's active inference engine when that person feels threatened and holds on to his/her invalid (mis)beliefs. In support of this dyadic model, we briefly describe relevant neuroimaging literature to elucidate brain networks underlying the effects of an intersubjectivity-oriented parenting intervention on parenting stress. Using the active inference dyadic model, we identified critical interventional strategies necessary to rectify these problems and hereby developed a coding system in reference to these strategies. In a theory-guided quantitative review, we used this coding system to code 35 clinical trials of parenting interventions published between 2016 and 2020, based on PubMed database, to predict their efficacy for reducing parenting stress. The results of this theory-guided analysis corroborated our hypothesis that parenting intervention can effectively reduce parenting stress if the intervention is designed to mitigate the problems of deficient relational benevolence, under-coupling, and over-mentalizing. We integrated our work with several dyadic concepts identified in the literature. Finally, inspired by Arya Nagarjuna's Buddhist Madhyamaka Philosophy, we described abstract expressions of Dependent Origination as a relational worldview to reflect on the normality, impairment, and rehabilitation of intersubjectivity.","misc","christiaan","misc"

There have been no studies which investigated the relationship of childhood sensory processing and integration and related motor performance (sensori-motor) patterns identified using an Ayres Sensory Integration® (ASI) frame of reference and later QOL of those children as adults. This longitudinal follow-up study examined this relationship. Adult QOL was also examined in relation to current adult sensori-motor patterns. Fifty-three adults who received occupational therapy services as children, were identified as having sensori-motor difficulties at that time and completed a sensory history and a quality-of-life measure as adults participated. Measures included the OTA the Koomar Center Sensory History (SXHX), Adult/Adolescent Sensory History (ASH), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF). MANCOVA found that Total childhood sensori-motor scores had a small relationship to Physical Health QOL as adults that approached significance. Pearson Correlations found that adults with childhood sensori-motor challenges who report sensori-motor challenges as adults had a moderate significant relationship among overall sensori-motor functioning and Physical Health (r = -0.56, p = 0.018). Visual (r = -0.76, p = 0.001), movement (vestibular; r = -0.48, p = 0.042) and tactile processing (r = -0.63, p = 0.008) had moderate to large significant relationships with Physical Health. Visual processing (r = -0.54, p = 0.024) was also significantly related to Psychological Health. Motor Coordination trended to significance for Physical Health (r = -0.42) and Psychological Health (r = -0.41). Conversely, adults who reported typical sensori-motor scores as adults, despite childhood sensori-motor challenges, had a good QOL. Furthermore, similar to previous research, there was a relationship between current visual, movement (vestibular) and tactile (touch) sensory processing and adult Physical and Psychological Health. A multivariate linear regression found Sensory Discrimination and Modulation accounted for one-quarter of the variance in QOL in adults with only Discrimination being statistically significant. Therefore, it is important to consider childhood sensori-motor function as well as adult functioning when examining QOL. Further, heretofore unexamined Sensory Discrimination was found to play a role in adult QOL.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

In a first step (N = 56) two modified (action-oriented) short-forms were developed. An extension of time perspectives (past, present, future) should also enrich the scale by enhancing the accuracy of self-reports. Study 1 (N = 183) then examined the psychometric properties for each time perspective. Study 2 (N = 27) was a 6-day diary study to identify the reliability of within- and between-person differences in vitality over time and working days with responses recorded three times per day. The exploratory factor analysis from study 1 revealed a three-factor solution with three items each. Test-retest reliability was moderate for the past and future time perspective and less stable for state subjective vitality. The modified German Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS-GM) showed divergent validity with fatigue, negative affect, and optimism, and convergent but distinguishable validity with life satisfaction, positive affect, and perceived self-efficacy. High reliability for daily vitality measures (with lower vitality rates in the morning) was found in study 2, but no substantial variation was found between working days and days off. The SVS-GM shows good psychometric properties in different settings and provides researchers with a 3-item (for cross-sectional or longitudinal studies) and 1-item (for short screenings) version to measure subjective vitality in German-speaking populations.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The study sample comprised 824 third-to-eighth-grade students [255 males (31%) and 569 females (69%)]. Around 10% of the sample (82) had special educational needs (SEN). Students' perceived inclusion levels and academic self-concept were examined with the Arabic version of the Perceptions of Inclusion Questionnaire (PIQ-S-AR). Students' ratings of inclusive practices in their classroom were examined using the Arabic version of the Inclusive Teaching Practices Scale (ITPS). SEN students expressed lower perceived social inclusion, emotional inclusion, and academic self-concept in comparison with non-SEN students. Moreover, high levels of inclusive teaching practices strongly predicted students' perceived emotional inclusion, social inclusion, and academic self-concept. The results of the study supported the importance of school-level inclusive teaching practices and their relation to students' school experiences. It also highlighted the need for schools and teachers to work towards improved school-level inclusion experiences for SEN students.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

The Moderating Effect of Travel Anxiety on Digital Tourism Behavior in Extended UTAUT2 and TTF Models.","Digital tourism has developed rapidly, especially in museums. However, as people become increasingly familiar with digital museums, their use intentions and behavior have changed. Taking the Digital Palace Museum in China as an example, applying the PLS-SEM method, this study uncovers visitors' use intentions and actual use behavior for digital museums by integrating the new UTAUT model (UTAUT2) and TTF model (TTF under social distancing) and introduces the PATS (Pandemic Anxiety Travel Scale) model to reveal how pandemic anxiety promotes the transformation of use intentions into use behavior more easily. The results show that performance expectations, hedonic motivations, habits, and task-technology-fit positively affect use intentions for digital museums. However, the price-saving orientation negatively affects use intentions. Pandemic anxiety moderates the effect of use intentions on actual behavior. When travel anxiety is relatively high, use intentions have a greater effect on use behavior for digital museums. The results reveal the influencing factors on use intentions of digital museums and the moderating effect of pandemic anxiety on the relation between use intentions and actual behavior.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This study focuses on the interplay between corporate social responsibility perceptions and pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) in response to experts' call for research on the micro-foundations of corporate social responsibility. In addition, it reveals the mechanism underpinning how perceived CSR shapes pro-environmental behaviour in an understudied developing context. Empirically, a qualitative multiple-case research design is utilised by selecting three business schools from Peshawar, Pakistan. Fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior management and faculty to collect data. Besides primary data, a qualitative documentary review is used to enhance the research. Data analysis is done through the thematic network technique. Plantation, cleanliness, waste reduction, and energy conservation are the environmental aspects of CSR as regarded by employees. In addition, perceived CSR shapes pro-environmental behaviour via environmental knowledge and awareness, eco-civic sense, environmental values, personality traits, religious perspective, and perceived organisational support for the environment. This study provides original additions to the CSR literature by suggesting eco-civic sensibility and religious perspective as new CSR drivers for pro-environmental conduct. Incorporating stakeholder salience into the context of the present study also advances CSR research. The findings are also valuable for management to make the CSR agenda of business schools more strategic, comprehensive, and centred on the priorities of salient stakeholders.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (EBSCO) databases were searched for studies, the search ended on 7 July 2021. Thirteen randomized controlled trials of remotely delivered intervention compared with usual care, brief contact, or no intervention for loneliness were included. A random-effects model measured estimation of loneliness reduction. Furthermore, standardized mean differences (SMDs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), publication bias, and heterogeneity were calculated. Subgroup analysis was used to explore the factors that might affect the treatment effects. The evidence of remotely delivered intervention on loneliness reduction was certain (SMD = -0.41 [95% CI, -0.70 to -0.13]). Media subgroup analysis supported the effectiveness of intervention delivered by video call (SMD = -0.54 [95% CI, -0.83 to -0.25]); treatment strategy subgroup analysis found evidence to support the effectiveness of increasing social support and maladaptive social cognition treatment strategy (SMD = -0.47 [95% CI, -0.77 to -0.18] and SMD = -1.04 [95% CI, -1.98 to -0.10], respectively); participants subgroup analysis shown the effectiveness of intervention for older adults living in LTC and social isolation (SMD = -1.40 [95% CI, -2.43 to -0.36] and SMD = -0.55 [95% CI, -0.74 to -0.36], respectively); group format subgroup analysis testified the effectiveness of intervention carried out in individual format (SMD = -0.39 [95% CI, -0.71 to -0.07]); measurement time points subgroup analysis found the positive effect of intervention at 3 months and 3 to 6 months stage (SMD = -0.33 [95% CI, -0.52 to -0.14] and SMD = -0.32 [95% CI, -0.57 to -0.07], respectively). Significant publication bias was detected (p < 0.05), and the heterogeneity of the studies was substantial.

Using data from the 2016 China Labor Force Dynamic Survey (CLDS), we explore the influence of farming experience on urban residents' entrepreneurial decisions at the theoretical and empirical levels. A Probit model with instrumental variables method was used to analyze the influence of farming experience on urban residents' entrepreneurial decisions, while a mediating effect model was used to test its channels of action. The results show that: (1) farming experience can contribute to the entrepreneurial decision of urban residents relative to those without experience in farming. To overcome possible endogeneity issues, an Eprobit model based on the estimation of instrumental variables was used for testing. (2) Heterogeneity tests based on age, city type, and physical capital found that this effect was more significant in urban residents with non-capital cities, middle-aged groups, and high-material capital. (3) Farming experience indirectly drives entrepreneurial decisions through the mediating role of promoting positive personality traits, such as optimism and mutual aid consciousness. Therefore, the farming experience has a positive effect on urban residents' entrepreneurial decisions and helps to understand the deeper influence of micro-individual characteristics on entrepreneurial decisions in the urbanization process.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The existing research in Chinese language literature in relation to Foreign Language (CFL) teachers' identity shift is principally in relation to the change of social, cultural, and institutional contexts. Built on the current literature, this research asks: How might teachers' self-images or self-conceptualizations be renegotiated when they are located within their own mainstream cultural and educational system, yet comprised of students from various cultural backgrounds? The data were collected from a group of CFL teachers in a South China university. The research found that students' backgrounds largely impacted on, and led to, the teachers' dichotomous relational identities, but did not dramatically change the teachers' perception on what or how much subject knowledge to be possessed to make an ideal CFL teacher. This attribute of their identity was sustained even though the teaching content was modified at a practical level in response to groups' differences. Further, the CFL teachers' pedagogical identity remained stable with only minor modifications when teaching ingroups and outgroups of students.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1254",35967734,"Metonymy Processing in Chinese: A Linguistic Context-Sensitive Eye-Tracking Preliminary Study.","Current cognitively oriented research on metaphor proposes that understanding metaphorical expressions is a process of building embodied simulations, which are constrained by past and present bodily experiences. However, it has also been shown that metaphor processing is also constrained by the linguistic context but, to our knowledge, there is no comparable work in the domain of metonymy. As an initial attempt to fill this gap, the present study uses eye-tracking experimentation to explore this aspect of Chinese metonymy processing. It complements previous work on how the length of preceding linguistic context influences metonymic processing by focusing on: (1) the contextual information of both the preceding target words; (2) the immediate spillover after the target words; and (3) whether the logical relationship between the preceding contextual information and the target word is strong or weak (a 2 × 2 between-subject experiment with target words of literal/metonymy and logic of strong/weak). Results show that readers take longer to arrive at a literal interpretation than at a metonymic one when the preceding information is in a weak logic relationship with target words, although this disparity can disappear when the logic is strong. Another finding is that both the preceding and the spillover contextual information contribute to metonymy processing when the spillover information does more to the metonymy than it does to the literal meaning. This study further complements cognitive and pragmatic approaches to metonymy, which are centered on its conceptual nature and its role in interpretation, by drawing attention to how the components of sentences contribute to the metonymic processing of target words. Based on an experiment, a contextual model of Chinese metonymy processing is proposed.","misc","christiaan","misc"

For this study, we used two transgenic mouse models of HCC induced by protooncogenes, MYC, and MET. Biochemical data have shown that tumors induced by MYC have increased levels of glutamine metabolism compared to those induced by MET. One-hour dynamic [18F]FGln PET data were acquired and reconstructed for fasted MYC mice (n = 11 tumors from 7 animals), fasted MET mice (n = 8 tumors from 6 animals), fasted FVBN controls (n = 8 normal liver regions from 6 animals), nonfasted MYC mice (n = 16 tumors from 6 animals), and nonfasted FVBN controls (n = 8 normal liver regions from 3 animals). The influx rate constants (K 1) using the one-tissue compartment model were derived for each tumor with the left ventricular blood pool input function. Influx rate constants were significantly higher for MYC tumors (K 1 = 0.374 ± 0.133) than for MET tumors (K 1 = 0.141 ± 0.058) under fasting conditions (P = 0.0002). Rate constants were also significantly lower for MET tumors (K 1 = 0.141 ± 0.135) than normal livers (K 1 = 0.332 ± 0.179) under fasting conditions (P = 0.0123). Fasting conditions tested for MYC tumors and normal livers did not result in any significant difference with P values > 0.005. Higher influx rate constants corresponded to elevated levels of glutamine metabolism as determined by biochemical assays. The data showed that there is a distinctive difference in glutamine metabolism between MYC and MET tumors. Our study has demonstrated the potential of [18F]FGln PET imaging as a tool to assess glutamine metabolism in HCC tumors in vivo with a caution that it may not be able to clearly distinguish HCC tumors from normal liver tissue.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Recently, alternative classification models such as the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) proposed to assess traits to predict clinically-relevant outcomes. The current study directly compared personality traits and past diagnoses as predictors of future mental health and functioning in three independent, prospective samples. Regression analyses found that personality traits significantly predicted future first onsets of psychiatric disorders (ΔR2=06-.15), symptom chronicity (ΔR2=.03-.06), and functioning (ΔR2=.02-.07), beyond past and current psychiatric diagnoses. Conversely, past psychiatric diagnoses did not provide an incremental prediction of outcomes when personality traits and other concurrent predictors were already included in the model. Overall, personality traits predicted a variety of outcomes in diverse settings, beyond diagnoses. Past diagnoses were generally not informative about future outcomes when personality was considered. Together, these findings support the added value of personality traits assessment in case formulation, consistent with HiTOP model.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

The objective of this study was to compare 2 distinct sequential BRD treatment protocols each consisting of a metaphylactic antimicrobial plus 2 potential subsequent as-needed treatment antimicrobials. Heifers at high-risk for BRD (n = 1000; initial BW = 229 kg ± 1.6) purchased from sale barns in the southeastern U.S. were transported to a contract research feedlot in Nebraska and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental groups (10 blocks of 100 animals each; 50 per treatment group). Experimental groups consisted of: (1) tulathromycin metaphylaxis (2.5 mg/kg) followed by ceftiofur crystalline free acid (6.6 mg/kg) and danofloxacin (8 mg/kg) for subsequent first and second as-needed BRD treatment, respectively (TCD) or (2) tildipirosin metaphylaxis (4 mg/kg) followed by florfenicol-flunixin meglumine (40 mg/kg florfenicol; 2.2 mg/kg flunixin meglumine) and enrofloxacin (12.5 mg/kg) for subsequent first and second as-needed BRD treatment, respectively (TFFE). Following expiration of the 7-d PMI, calves that showed signs of clinical BRD were pulled and examined to determine if treatment was necessary based on a clinical attitude score (CAS). Heifers with a CAS of 1 accompanied by ≥40°C rectal temperature, and all heifers with a CAS ≥ 2 regardless of rectal temperature, received the appropriate first-treatment antimicrobial. Upon relapse, following expiration of the post-treatment interval (PTI), heifers received the appropriate second-treatment antimicrobial. In the first 90 d, calves in the TFFE experimental group received more first-treatments than calves in the TCD experimental group (P = 0.054) and resulted in 50% greater mortality (P < 0.043) relative to the TCD heifers. From d 0 to closeout, first-treatment morbidity as well as mortality were greater in TFFE relative to TCD (P ≤ 0.032). Growth performance did not differ between treatments in the first 90 d; however, ADG was greater (P = 0.033) and G:F improved (P = 0.014) at closeout in TCD versus TFFE on a deads-in basis.

Childhood is a crucial period for body growth and development. However, it is unknown whether adherence to a plant-based diet is related to a healthy body composition in children. We aimed to assess the relationship between a plant-based diet and body composition in children. A total of 452 Chinese children aged 6-9 years old participated in this cross-sectional study. Lean mass (LM), fat mass, and fat mass percentage (FMP) were assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. An age- and sex-specific abdominal FMP ≥85th percentile was defined as abdominal obesity. Handgrip strength was measured using a hydraulic hand dynamometer. A validated 79-item food frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary information. Overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI) scores were calculated. After adjusting for potential covariates, a higher hPDI score (per 10-score increment) was associated with a higher LM in the android area (0.038 kg, 3.2%), gynoid area (0.048 kg, 1.9%), and trunk (0.102 kg, 1.2%) and with a lower FMP (1.18%) in the android area. In contrast, a higher uPDI score (per 10-score increment) was associated with a lower LM in the trunk (0.091 kg, 1.1%) and android area (0.023 kg, 1.9%) and with a higher FMP (0.74%) in the android area. No significant associations were observed between the overall PDI and body composition or abdominal obesity. After stratifying by sex, higher (vs. lower) hPDI scores was associated with lower abdominal obesity risk in girls and higher handgrip strength in boys. In conclusion, in this cross-sectional study, we found that stronger adherence to a healthful plant-based diet, and less adherence to an unhealthful plant-based diet was associated with better body composition in Chinese omnivorous children aged 6-9 years old. Our results highlight the need to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy plant foods within investigating how to obtain a healthy body composition in children.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

This study aimed to evaluate the benefits of Lactobacillus plantarum (LP)-derived postbiotics on ameliorating Salmonella-induced neurological dysfunctions. Mice were pretreated with LP postbiotics (heat-killed bacteria or the metabolites) or active bacteria, and then challenged with Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (ST). Results showed that LP postbiotics, particularly the metabolites, effectively prevented ST infection in mice, as evidenced by the inhibited weight loss, bacterial translocation, and tissue damages. The LP postbiotics markedly suppressed brain injuries and neuroinflammation (the decreased interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, and the increased IL-4 and IL-10). Behavior tests indicated that LP postbiotics, especially the metabolites, protected mice from ST-induced anxiety and depressive-like behaviors and cognitive impairment. A significant modulation of neuroactive molecules (5-hydroxytryptamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dopamine, acetylcholine, and neuropeptide Y) was also found by LP postbiotic pretreatment. Microbiome analysis revealed that LP postbiotics optimized the cecal microbial composition by increasing Helicobacter, Lactobacillus and Dubosiella, and decreasing Mucispirillum, norank_f_Oscillospiraceae, and Eubacterium_siraeum_group. Moreover, LP postbiotics inhibited the reduction of short-chain fatty acids caused by ST infection. Pearson's correlation assays further confirmed the strong relationship of LP postbiotics-mediated benefits and gut microbiota. This study highlights the effectiveness of postbiotics and provide a promising strategy for preventing infection-induced brain disorders by targeting gut-brain axis.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

However, comprehensive systematic reviews on the effect of the MeDi diet on the cognitive decline are limited. We investigated whether adherence to the MeDi diet could lower the risk of the cognitive disorder or improve cognitive function in older adults. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to June 2021. Cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The effect sizes were estimated as log risk ratios and standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The Newcastle-Ottawa score and Cochrane Collaboration's tool were used to assess the risk of bias in cohort studies and RCTs, respectively. Of the 1,687 screened studies, 31 cohort studies and five RCTs met the eligibility criteria for qualitative analysis; 26 cohort studies and two RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. In the cohort studies, high adherence to the MeDi diet was associated with lower risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [risk ratio (RR) = 0.75 (0.66-0.86)], and Alzheimer's disease (AD) [RR = 0.71 (0.56-0.89)]. In the RCTs, high adherence to the MeDi diet was associated with better episodic [SMD = 0.20 (0.09-0.30)] and working memories [SMD = 0.17 (0.01-0.32)] than lowest group. Adherence to the MeDi diet may reduce the risk of MCI and AD. However, other associations with cognitive outcomes (global cognition, working memory, and episodic memory) remain open to interpretation. Overall, the MeDi diet is recommended to prevent or delay cognitive disorders and improve cognitive function. Further, long-term RCTs are warranted to strengthen the evidence.

In vitro starch digestibility, in vitro protein digestibility of wholemeal flour, total flavonoids content, and total phenolics content of digestive juice were used to evaluate the bioaccessibility, and a significant variation (p < 0.05) was noted. Results showed that steam explosion enhanced the gastric protein digestibility ranged from 5.67 to 6.92% and the intestinal protein digestibility ranged from 16.77 to 49.12%. Steam-exploded wholemeal flour (0.5 MPa, 5 min) had the highest protein digestibility and rapidly digestible starch content. Compared with native flour, steam explosion (0.5 MPa, 5 min) contributed to a 0.72-fold and 0.33-fold increment of total flavonoids content and total phenolics content in digestible juice. Chemical changes of wholemeal flour, induced by steam explosion, caused the changes in the solvent retention capacity, rheological property of wholemeal flour, and altered the falling number (and liquefaction number). An increasing tendency to solid-like behavior and the gel strength of wholemeal flour was significantly enhanced by the steam explosion at 0.5 MPa for 5 min, while the gluten was not weakened.

Fruits harvested <25, 25-50, 50-75, and 75-100% degree of fullness were classified as highly immature (stage 1), immature (stage 2), semi-mature (stage 3), and fully mature (stage 4), respectively. Results showed that chebulagic acid, geraniin, chebulinic acid, castalagin, punicalagin, and gallic acid continuously decreased during fruit maturity, while elaeocarpusin, helioscopin B, corilagin, 3,4,6-tri-O-galloyl-S-glucose, and ellagic acid increased at the beginning of fruit growth (from stage 1 to 2), but decreased when the fruits reached their full maturity (stage 4). The levels of hydrolysable tannins and phenolic acids in fully mature fruits (stage 4) were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) lower than that in their immature counterparts (stages 1 and 2). Total phenolic content (TPC) and DPPH antioxidant radical-scavenging activity did not vary significantly between different maturity stages. Pearson's correlation coefficient test indicated that TPC and DPPH positively (p ≤ 0.05) correlate with most of the studied tannin compounds. Sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose), total soluble solid content, and titratable acidity increased during the fruit development.

The molecular weight of the peptides was below 3,000 Da. Heptapeptides to decapeptides were the main peptides in the fermentation mycelia of S. rugosoannulata. More than 50% of the peptides had salty and umami taste characteristics, and the long-chain peptides (decapeptides to 24 peptides) also played an essential role in the pleasant taste characteristics of mycelium. In the salty and umami peptide of S. rugosoannulata, the distribution of non-polar hydrophobic amino acids and polar-uncharged amino acids accounted for a relatively high proportion, and the proportion of polar-uncharged amino acids further increased, with the extension of the peptide chain. P, F, I, l, V, G, S, T, and D were the amino acids with a high proportion in the peptides. The taste peptides can bind to more than 60% of the active amino acid residues in the cavity-binding domain of the T1R1/T1R3 receptors. Hydrogen bond interaction was the primary mode of interaction between the peptides and the receptor. The first and second amino acid residues (such as S, V, E, K, G, and A) at the C-terminal and N-terminal of the peptides were easy to bind to T1R1/T1R3 receptors.

However, research on the role of OT in obesity prevention and potential mechanisms is still limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the modulatory effects of OT intervention on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and gut microbiota dysbiosis using an obese mouse model. Our results showed that 8-week OT supplementation with 93.94% polyphenols significantly decreased body weight gain, adipose tissue mass, and serum levels of triglyceride (2.60 mmol/L), cholesterol (5.49 mmol/L), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.61 mmol/L) in HFD-fed mice. Meanwhile, OT intervention was observed to improve fat accumulation, hepatic damage, glucose intolerance, and endotoxemia and alleviate inflammation by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory factors. OT also upregulated the expression of genes including Srebf1, Ppara, Lxra, Pgc1a, and Hsl and downregulated the expression of genes including Leptin, Il-6, and Il-1b.

In a previous report, we demonstrated the metabolic cross-feeding of lactate and identified keystone species specified for lactate utilization in fecal samples of 40 healthy infants. We present here the extension of our longitudinal study for the period from 6 months to 2 years, with a focus on the colonization of functional groups involved in lactate metabolism and butyrate production. We captured the dynamic changes of the gut microbiota and reported a switch in the predominant lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, from Veillonella producing propionate in the first year to Anaerobutyrycum hallii producing butyrate in the second year of life. The significant increase in butyrate producers and fecal butyrate concentration was also pinpointed to the weaning period between 6 and 10 months. Correlation analyses further suggested, for the first time, the metabolic cross-feeding of hydrogen in infants. In conclusion, our longitudinal study of 40 Swiss infants provides important insights into the colonization of functional groups involved in lactate metabolism and butyrate production in the first 2 years of life.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Therefore, early prevention of brain tumors is the key to reducing mortality due to brain tumors. This review aims to quantitatively evaluate the association between vitamins and brain tumors by meta-analysis. We searched articles on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases from inception to 19 December 2021. According to heterogeneity, the fixed-effects model or random-effects model was selected to obtain the relative risk of the merger. Based on the methods described by Greenland and Longnecker, we explored the dose-response relationship between vitamins and the risk of brain tumors. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were also used for the analysis. The study reviewed 23 articles, including 1,347,426 controls and 6,449 brain tumor patients. This study included vitamin intake and circulating concentration. For intake, it mainly included vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin E, β-carotene, and folate. For circulating concentrations, it mainly included vitamin E and vitamin D in the serum (25-hydroxyvitamin D and α-tocopherol). For vitamin intake, compared with the lowest intakes, the highest intakes of vitamin C (RR = 0.81, 95%CI:0.66-0.99, I 2 = 54.7%, P for heterogeneity = 0.007), β-carotene (RR = 0.78, 95%CI:0.66-0.93, I 2 = 0, P for heterogeneity = 0.460), and folate (RR = 0.66, 95%CI:0.55-0.80, I 2 = 0, P for heterogeneity = 0.661) significantly reduced the risk of brain tumors. For serum vitamins, compared with the lowest concentrations, the highest concentrations of serum α-tocopherol (RR = 0.61, 95%CI:0.44-0.86, I 2 = 0, P for heterogeneity = 0.656) significantly reduced the risk of brain tumors. The results of the dose-response relationship showed that increasing the intake of 100 μg folate per day reduced the risk of brain tumors by 7% (P -nonlinearity = 0.534, RR = 0.93, 95%CI:0.90-0.96). Our analysis suggests that the intake of vitamin C, β-carotene, and folate can reduce the risk of brain tumors, while high serum α-tocopherol concentration also has a protective effect on brain tumors. Therefore, vitamins may provide new ideas for the prevention of brain tumors. PROSPERO, identifier CRD42022300683.","meta_analysis","christiaan","meta_analysis"

While most NP models were developed to assess individual foods, the Ajinomoto Group Nutrient Profiling System (ANPS) was developed to assess the overall nutritional value of cooked dishes that are culturally specific to Japan. Based on the national dietary recommendations and nutritional surveys, target values were created for 13 dish categories, while considering the combinations of meal units. For the ANPS, the four evaluating elements were protein and vegetables, which should be encouraged, and sodium and saturated fatty acids, which should be limited. The ANPS algorithm for dishes was the sum of the scores of individual elements, with a maximum of 10 points per serving. The sum of scores was then multiplied by 2.5 to convert to the 100-point scale. Convergent validity was tested using the nutrient-rich food index (NRF) score of 6.3. In total, 1,089 popular Japanese dishes were evaluated using the ANPS, and the median score of ANPS was 70.0 points (interquartile range, 55-78.8), and the average score was 67.7 (standard deviation, 16.5) points. Since salt intake is a major health risk in Japan, this tool was designed to evaluate sodium content with high sensitivity, and low-salt dishes significantly improved sodium and ANPS scores compared with regular dishes. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the total score of NRF 6.3 and ANPS in 1,089 dishes was r = 0.452 (p < 0.0001). This newly developed ANPS could be used to evaluate culture-specific cooked dishes per serving size. It can determine the nutritional values of dishes, with a high sensitivity to sodium content, a major Japanese nutritional issue. Further research is needed to determine the accuracy and usefulness of the ANPS as a system that would lead to changes in eating behavior nationwide.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The modified version of the Food Standard Agency Nutrient Profiling System Dietary Index (FSAm-NPS DI) underpinning the Nutri-Score front-of-pack label has been used in public health strategies to address the deleterious consequences of poor diets. This study aimed to assess the association between the FSAm-NPS DI and some CVD risk factors including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, plasma glucose levels, triglyceride levels, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline and after 1 year of follow-up using a 143-item validated semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Dietary indices based on FSAm-NPS applied at an individual level were computed to characterize the diet quality of 5,921 participants aged 55-75 years with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome from the PREDIMED-plus cohort. Associations between the FSAm-NPS DI and CVD risk factors were assessed using linear regression models. Compared to participants with a higher nutritional quality of diet (measured by a lower FSAm-NPS DI at baseline or a decrease in FSAm-NPS DI after 1 year), those participants with a lower nutritional quality of diet (higher FSAm-NPS DI or an increase in score) showed a significant increase in the levels of plasma glucose, triglycerides, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and waist circumference (β coefficient [95% confidence interval]; P for trend) (1.67 [0.43, 2.90]; <0.001; 6.27 [2.46, 10.09]; <0.001; 0.56 [0.08, 1.05]; 0.001; 0.51 [0.41, 0.60]; <0.001; 1.19 [0.89, 1.50]; <0.001, respectively). No significant associations in relation to changes in HDL and LDL-cholesterol nor with systolic blood pressure were shown. This prospective cohort study suggests that the consumption of food items with a higher FSAm-NPS DI is associated with increased levels of several major risk factors for CVD including adiposity, fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, and diastolic blood pressure. However, results must be cautiously interpreted because no significant prospective associations were identified for critical CVD risk factors, such as HDL and LDL-cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Dietary lipids are the main source of brain lipids and thus contribute to the brain lipidome. Human milk is the only source of a dietary lipids for exclusively breastfed infant. Notably, it contains milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) enriched in polar lipids (PL). While early life is a key for early brain development, the interplay between dietary intake of polar lipids and spatial dynamics of lipid distribution during brain development is poorly understood. Here, we carried out an exploratory study to assess the early postnatal temporal profiling of brain lipidome between postnatal day (PND) 7 and PND 50 using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization as a mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) in an in vivo preclinical model. We also assessed the effect of chronic supplementation with PL extracted from alpha-lactalbumin-enriched whey protein concentrate (WPC) containing 10% lipids, including major lipid classes found in the brain (37% phospholipids and 15% sphingomyelin). MALDI-MSI of the spatial and temporal accretion of lipid species during brain development showed that the brain lipidome is changing heterogeneously along time during brain development. In addition, increases in 400+ PL supplement-dependent lipids were observed. PL supplementation had significant spatial and temporal effect on specific fatty esters, glycerophosphocholines, glycerophosphoethanolamines, and phosphosphingolipids. Interestingly, the average levels of these lipids per brain area tended to be constant in various brain structures across the age groups, paralleling the general brain growth. In contrast, other lipids, such as cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol, diacylglycerophosphates, phosphocholines, specific ether-phosphoethanolamines, phosphosphingolipids, glycerophosphoinositols, and glycerophosphoserines showed clear age-dependent changes uncoupled from the general brain growth. These results suggest that the dietary PL supplementation may preferentially provide the building blocks for the general brain growth during development. Our findings add to the understanding of brain-nutrient relations, their temporospatial dynamics, and potential impact on neurodevelopment.","rodent","christiaan","misc"

Brown adipose tissue (BAT), an important heat source within the body, promotes metabolic health through fat consumption. Therefore, the induction of white fat browning may improve lipid metabolism. Currently, the specific roles of circRNA in BAT and white adipose tissue (WAT) remain elusive. Herein, we conducted circRNA expression profiling of mouse BAT and WAT using RNA-seq. We identified a total of 12,183 circRNAs, including 165 upregulated and 79 downregulated circRNAs between BAT and WAT. Differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs were associated with the mitochondrion, mitochondrial part, mitochondrial inner membrane, mitochondrial envelope, therefore, these circRNAs may affect the thermogenesis and lipid metabolism of BAT. Moreover, DE circRNAs were enriched in browning- and thermogenesis-related pathways, including AMPK and HIF-1 signaling. In addition, a novel circRNA, circOgdh, was found to be highly expressed in BAT, formed by back-splicing of the third and fourth exons of the Ogdh gene, and exhibited higher stability than linear Ogdh. circOgdh was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm and could sponge miR-34a-5p, upregulating the expression of Atgl, a key lipolysis gene, which enhanced brown adipocyte lipolysis and suppressed lipid droplet accumulation. Our findings offer in-depth knowledge of the modulatory functions of circRNAs in BAT adipogenesis.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were used to search articles in English-language journals. The intervention effect was expressed using risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcome measures, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The chi-square test and I-square test were used to test heterogeneity among studies. Four studies were eventually included in this meta-analysis. Compared with NOD, HEN has a favorable impact on postoperative body mass index (BMI) (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.09-1.30, P = 0.02), lean body mass (LBM) (WMD = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.04-1.48, P = 0.04), and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) (WMD = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.02-0.58, P = 0.03).

Although the COVID-19 vaccine is currently available, the latest variant of the virus, Omicron, spreads more easily than earlier strains, and its mortality rate is still high in patients with chronic diseases, especially cancer patients. So, identifying a novel compound for COVID-19 treatment could help reduce the lethal rate of the viral infection in patients with cancer. This study applied network pharmacology and systematic bioinformatics analysis to determine the possible use of curcumol for treating colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) in patients infected with COVID-19. Our results showed that COVID-19 and COAD in patients shared a cluster of genes commonly deregulated by curcumol. The clinical pathological analyses demonstrated that the expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit delta (GABRD) was associated with the patients' hazard ratio. More importantly, the high expression of GABRD was associated with poor survival rates and the late stages of COAD in patients. The network pharmacology result identified seven-core targets, including solute carrier family 6 member 3, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit pi, butyrylcholinesterase, cytochrome P450 3A4, 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, progesterone receptor, and GABRD of curcumol for treating patients with COVID-19 and COAD. The bioinformatic analysis further highlighted their importance in the biological processes and molecular functions in gland development, inflammation, retinol, and steroid metabolism. The findings of this study suggest that curcumol could be an alternative compound for treating patients with COVID-19 and COAD.","misc","christiaan","misc"

To assess the effectiveness of the intervention following intragastric injection of various dosages of LBLF (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg⋅bw), obese model mice developed via a high-fat diet were utilized. Treatment for LBLF may decrease body weight gain, Lee's index, serum lipids levels, oxidative stress levels, and hepatic lipids levels. It may also enhance fecal lipids excretion and improve glucose tolerance. Additionally, LBLF therapy significantly restored gut dysfunction brought on by a high-fat diet by boosting gut bacterial diversities and altering the composition of the gut bacterial community by elevating probiotics and reducing harmful bacteria.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

However, most of the previously studied interventions target individual decisions and are not directed to changing consumers' underlying perception of unhealthy food. Here, we investigate how a healthy eating call-first-person narrative by a health expert-affects individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) for sugar-free and sugar-containing food products. Participants performed two blocks of a bidding task, in which they had to bid on sweets labeled either as sugar- free or as sugar-containing. In-between the two blocks, half of the participants listened to a narrative by a dietary specialist emphasizing the health risks of sugar consumption, whereas the remaining participants listened to a control narrative irrelevant to food choices. We demonstrate that the health expert's narrative decreased individuals' WTP for sugar-containing food, but did not modulate their WTP for sugar- free food. Overall, our findings confirm that consumers may conform to healthy eating calls by rather devaluating unhealthy food products than by increasing the value of healthy ones. This paves the way for an avenue of innovative marketing strategies to support individuals in their food choices.","misc","christiaan","misc"

After 28 weeks of continuous feeding, serums, livers, and lungs were collected for targeted free sterols quantification, biochemical tests, lipid profile detection, and RNA-seq analysis. Compared with the CS group, 2% PS supplementation significantly increased campesterol concentrations and its ratio to cholesterol in the serum, liver, and lung of mice, with cholestanol concentrations and its ratio to cholesterol decreased. Total cholesterol (TC) levels were reduced in the serum of the PS group (p < 0.05), with the triglyceride (TG) levels unchanged. In response to the decreased circulating cholesterol concentration, the expression of endogenous cholesterol synthesis genes was upregulated in the liver, but caused no obvious lipid accumulation and inflammatory cell infiltration. However, for peripheral tissues, long-term PS-fed mice exhibited diminished cholesterol synthesis, fatty acid transport, and oxidation in the lung.

The results revealed that IMF significantly affected meat color, total muscle fiber numbers, and muscle fiber types in Tan sheep. Widely-targeted metabolomic analysis showed that amino acids were the main differential flavor precursors between lambs with different IMF content. Importantly, the comparison of fatty acid profiles revealed that saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids are beneficial for IMF deposition. Furthermore, integrated analysis between metabolome and transcriptome indicated that MME is a key gene resulting in the reduction of amino acids in lambs with high IMF content; and the joint analysis between fatty acid profiles and transcript profiles showed that ADIPOQ, FABP4, PLIN1, PPARGC1A, SLC2A1 accelerated IMF deposition through positive regulation of saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids metabolism. These results revealed key changes in meat quality affected by IMF content and the corresponding genetic mechanism, which may provide a new insight for understanding the IMF differential deposition and for improving meat quality in Tan sheep.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Certain honey types have well-established bioactive properties including antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. In addition, honey contains non-digestible carbohydrates in the form of oligosaccharides, and there is increasing evidence from in vitro, animal, and pilot human studies that some kinds of honey have prebiotic activity. Prebiotics are foods or compounds, such as non-digestible carbohydrates, that are used to promote specific, favorable changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota plays a critical role in human health and well-being, with disturbances to the balance of these organisms linked to gut inflammation and the development and progression of numerous conditions, such as colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and mental health issues. Consequently, there is increasing interest in manipulating the gut microbiota to a more favorable balance as a way of improving health by dietary means. Current research suggests that certain kinds of honey can reduce the presence of infection-causing bacteria in the gut including Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Clostridiodes difficile, while simultaneously stimulating the growth of potentially beneficial species, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. In this paper, we review the current and growing evidence that shows the prebiotic potential of honey to promote healthy gut function, regulate the microbial communities in the gut, and reduce infection and inflammation. We outline gaps in knowledge and explore the potential of honey as a viable option to promote or re-engineer a healthy gut microbiome.","misc","christiaan","misc"

However, the extent of DO on the intestinal contents microbiota in mice fed with a high-fat diet still remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored the role of intestinal contents microbiota in the regulation of adverse effects caused by high-fat diet by DO from the perspective of intestinal microecology. Twenty-four mice were randomly distributed into the normal saline-treated basal diet (bcn), normal saline-treated high-fat diet (bmn), 2.37 g kg-1 days-1 DO traditional decoction-treated high-fat diet (bdn) and 1.19 g kg-1 days-1 lipid-lowering decoction-treated high-fat diet (bjn) groups for 40 days. Subsequently, we assessed the changes in body weight, serum total cholesterol (TC), total triacylglycerol (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and the characteristics of intestinal contents microbiota. Results demonstrated that DO exerted the modulating effect on the changes in body weight, TG, TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels. Besides, DO decreased the richness and diversity of intestinal contents microbiota, and altered the structure as a whole. Dominant bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, varied significantly and statistically. Moreover, DO influenced the carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolic functions. Furthermore, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira presented varying degrees of inhibition/promotion of TG, TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C.

Results showed that the contents of selenium in hen serum and eggs were increased under DCH feeding. Subsequently, DCH also promotes the antioxidant capacity and immunity of laying hens through the increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) by ELISA detection. Finally, production performance and egg quality were further graded by monitoring the product condition and scoring the indexes of egg quality, which also displayed that DCH as a feed additive significantly improved the egg quality by enhancing yolk color, eggshell thickness, and egg shape index.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Nevertheless, the effect of intravenous (IV) vitamin C for the treatment of sepsis remains controversial. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of IV vitamin C in patients with sepsis or septic shock. Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) were searched from inception through May 25, 2022 for randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of IV vitamin C treatment in patients with sepsis. The primary outcome was short-term mortality, and secondary outcomes including the duration of vasopressor, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score after vitamin C treatment. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the type of disease, dose and duration of IV vitamin C. A total of 10 studies were included, with a total sample of 755 septic patients. The IV vitamin C was associated with a significant reduction in the short-term mortality (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37-0.69, I 2 = 0%) and duration of vasopressor (MD -27.88, 95% CI -49.84 to -5.92, I 2 = 95%). The length of ICU stay (MD -0.68, 95% CI -2.13 to 0.78, I 2 = 74%) and SOFA score (MD -0.05, 95% CI -1.69 to 1.58, I 2 = 86%) were not significantly different between two groups. In patients with sepsis or septic shock, the IV vitamin C reduced the short-term mortality rate and duration of vasopressor, with no effect on the length of ICU stay and SOFA score. Further trials are required to explore the optimal dosage and duration of IV vitamin C. https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2022-6-0013/, identifier INPLASY202260013.","meta_analysis","christiaan","meta_analysis"

At least 20% of children and adolescents in Latin America are overweight or obese. However, little is known regarding the cardiovascular risk of young children living in the region. This paper aims to identify associations between socio-demographics, adiposity, and dietary intake with cardiometabolic risk among children between 6- and 8-years old living in urban and rural Andean regions of Ecuador. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 267 children attending elementary schools between February and August 2018. Sociodemographic data were collected using a structured interview. Bodyweight, height, and waist circumference were measured in duplicate; blood samples were taken after overnight fasting to determine blood lipids, hepatic enzymes, and adipokines; food intake data was assessed by two 24-h recalls administered to the guardians. Associations between cardiometabolic risk (i.e., blood lipids, hepatic enzymes, and adipokines) with sociodemographic characteristics, dietary intake, and waist circumference were tested using multiple hierarchical regression models. Twenty-nine percent of the children were overweight or obese, 12% had low HDL levels, and over 18% had high levels of LDL and triglycerides. Children living in the urban region had lower levels of HDL (β-4.07 mg/dL; 95% CI: -7.00; -1.15; P = 0.007) but higher levels of LDL cholesterol (β 8.52 mg/dL; 95% CI: 1.38; 15.66; P = 0.019). Hepatic enzymes were also higher among urban children (SGOT: β% 22.13; 95% CI: 17.33; 26.93; P < 0.001; SGPT: β 0.84 U/L; 95% CI: 0.09; 1.59; P = 0.028). Leptin blood levels were higher (β% 29.27; 95% CI: 3.57; 54.97; P = 0.026), meanwhile adiponectin plasma concentrations were lower among urban children (β%-103.24; 95% CI: -58.9; -147.58; P = < 0.001). Fiber intake was inversely associated with total cholesterol (β-9.27 mg/dL; 95% CI -18.09; -0.45; P = 0.040) and LDL cholesterol blood levels (β-9.99 mg/dL; 95% CI: -18.22; -1.75; P = 0.018). Our findings demonstrate that young children are at high cardiovascular risk; if no actions are taken, the burden of non-communicable diseases will be substantial. The differences in risk between rural and urban areas are evident; urbanization might predispose children to a different reality and, in most cases, result in poor habits.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1287",35967819,"The leaves of the seasoning plant Litsea cubeba inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome and ameliorate dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice.","The intracellular sensor NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome controls caspase-1 activity and the maturation and release of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. The NLRP3 inflammasome has attracted the attention of the pharmaceutical industry because it promotes the pathogenesis of many diseases, making it a promising target for drug development. Litsea cubeba (Lour.) is a plant traditionally used as a seasoning in Taiwan and in other Asian countries. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory activity of the leaves of L. cubeba against the NLRP3 inflammasome. We found that the ethanol extract of L. cubeba leaves (MLE) inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages by reducing caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. MLE reduced pyroptosis in macrophages and inhibited the release of NLRP3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). In a mechanistic study, MLE reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and preserved mitochondrial integrity, which led to reduced mitochondrial DNA release into the cytosol. MLE did not reduce the expression levels of NLRP3, IL-1β precursor or TNF-α in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. These results indicated that MLE inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome by suppressing the activation signals of the NLRP3 inflammasome but not by reducing the priming signal induced by LPS. In addition, oral administration of MLE (20-80 mg/kg) ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a mouse model. Notably, mice that received MLE (1 and 2 g/kg) daily for 7 days did not exhibit visible side effects. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis found that α-Terpinyl acetate (27.2%) and 1,8-Cineole (17.7%) were the major compounds in MLE. These results indicated that L. cubeba leaves have the potential to be a nutraceutical for preventing and improving NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"
"1288",35967820,"Dietary adaptation for weight loss maintenance at Yale (DAWLY): Protocol and predictions for a randomized controlled trial.","Current therapies for obesity treatment are effective at producing short-term weight loss, but weight loss maintenance remains a significant challenge. Here we investigate the impact of pre-intervention dietary fat intake on the efficacy of a dietary supplement to support weight loss maintenance. Preclinical work demonstrates that a vagal afferent pathway critical for sensing dietary lipids is blunted by a high-fat diet (HFD), resulting in a reduced preference for a low-fat emulsion and severe blunting of the dopamine (DA) response to the gastric infusion of lipids. Infusion of the gut lipid messenger oleoylethanolamide (OEA), which is also depleted by HFD, immediately reverses this DA blunting and restores preference for the low-fat emulsion. Studies of OEA supplementation for weight loss in humans have had limited success. Given the strong effect of HFD on this pathway, we designed a study to test whether the efficacy of OEA as a weight loss treatment is related to pre-intervention habitual intake of dietary fat. We employed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 100 adults with overweight/obesity (OW/OB) were randomized to receive either OEA or placebo daily for 16 months. Following a baseline evaluation of diet, metabolic health, adiposity, and brain response to a palatable an energy dense food, participants in both groups underwent a 4-month behavioral weight loss intervention (LEARN®) followed by a 1-year maintenance period. The study aims are to (1) determine if pre-intervention dietary fat intake moderates the ability of OEA to improve weight loss and weight loss maintenance after a gold standard behavioral weight loss treatment; (2) identify biomarkers that predict outcome and optimize a stratification strategy; and (3) test a model underlying OEA's effectiveness. Focusing on interventions that target the gut-brain axis is supported by mounting evidence for the role of gut-brain signaling in food choice and the modulation of this circuit by diet. If successful, this work will provide support for targeting the gut-brain pathway for weight loss maintenance using a precision medicine approach that is easy and inexpensive to implement.

With the increasing incidence of C-sections worldwide, there is a need for precise characterization of neonatal gut microbiota to understand how to restore microbial imbalance after C-section. After birth, gut microbiota development is shaped by various factors, especially the infant's diet and antibiotic exposure. Concerning diet, current research has proposed that breastfeeding can restore the characteristic gut microbiome after C-section. In this systematic review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the current literature on the effect of breastfeeding on gut microbiota development after C-section delivery in the first 3 months of life. The retrieved data from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were evaluated according to the PICO/PECO strategy. Quality assessment was conducted by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. After critical selection, we identified 14 out of 4,628 studies for the evaluation of the impact of the diet after C-section delivery. The results demonstrate consistent evidence that C-section and affiliated intrapartum antibiotic exposure affect Bacteroidetes abundance and the incapacity of breastfeeding to reverse their reduction. Furthermore, exclusive breastfeeding shows a positive effect on Actinobacteria and Bifidobacteria restoration over the 3 months after birth. None of the included studies detected any significant changes in Lactobacillus abundance in breastfed infants after C-section. C-section and intrapartum antibiotic exposure influence an infant's gut microbiota by depletion of Bacteroides, regardless of the infant's diet in the first 3 months of life. Even though breastfeeding increases the presence of Bifidobacteria, further research with proper feeding classification is needed to prove the restoration effect on some taxa in infants after C-section.

"1290",35967843,"Antibiotic and antifungal use in pediatric leukemia and lymphoma patients are associated with increasing opportunistic pathogens and decreasing bacteria responsible for activities that enhance colonic defense.","Due to decreased immunity, both antibiotics and antifungals are regularly used in pediatric hematologic-cancer patients as a means to prevent severe infections and febrile neutropenia. The general effect of antibiotics on the human gut microbiome is profound, yielding decreased diversity and changes in community structure. However, the specific effect on pediatric oncology patients is not well-studied. The effect of antifungal use is even less understood, having been studied only in mouse models. Because the composition of the gut microbiome is associated with regulation of hematopoiesis, immune function and gastrointestinal integrity, changes within the patient gut can have implications for the clinical management of hematologic malignancies. The pediatric population is particularly challenging because the composition of the microbiome is age dependent, with some of the most pronounced changes occurring in the first three years of life. We investigated how antibiotic and antifungal use shapes the taxonomic composition of the stool microbiome in pediatric patients with leukemia and lymphoma, as inferred from both 16S rRNA and metagenome data. Associations with age, antibiotic use and antifungal use were investigated using multiple analysis methods. In addition, multivariable differential abundance was used to identify and assess specific taxa that were associated with multiple variables. Both antibiotics and antifungals were linked to a general decline in diversity in stool samples, which included a decrease in relative abundance in butyrate producers that play a critical role in host gut physiology (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Anaerostipes, Dorea, Blautia),. Furthermore, antifungal use was associated with a significant increase in relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens. Collectively, these findings have important implications for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma patients. Butyrate is important for gastrointestinal integrity; it inhibits inflammation, reinforces colonic defense, mucosal immunity. and decreases oxidative stress. The routine use of broad-spectrum anti-infectives in pediatric oncology patients could simultaneously contribute to a decline in gastrointestinal integrity and colonic defense while promoting increases in opportunistic pathogens within the patient gut. Because the gut microbiome has been linked to both short-term clinical outcomes, and longer-lasting health effects, systematic characterization of the gut microbiome in pediatric patients during, and beyond, treatment is warranted.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The FtsZ protein is a bacterial tubulin homolog required for cell division in most species, including E. coli. Several agents that block cell division have been shown to mislocalise FtsZ, including the bacteriophage λ-encoded Kil peptide, resulting in defective cell division and a filamentous phenotype, making FtsZ an attractive target for antimicrobials. In this study, we have used an in vitro meningitis model system for studying the effect of bacteriophages on FtsZ using fluorescent E. coli EV36/FtsZ-mCherry and K12/FtsZ-mNeon strains. We show localisation of FtsZ to the bacterial cell midbody as a single ring during normal growth conditions, and mislocalisation of FtsZ producing filamentous multi-ringed bacterial cells upon addition of the known inhibitor Kil peptide. We also show that when bacteriophages K1F-GFP and T7-mCherry were applied to their respective host strains, these phages can inhibit FtsZ and block bacterial cell division leading to a filamentous multi-ringed phenotype, potentially delaying lysis and increasing progeny number. This occurs in the exponential growth phase, as actively dividing hosts are needed. We present that ZapA protein is needed for phage inhibition by showing a phenotype recovery with a ZapA mutant strain, and we show that FtsI protein is also mislocalised upon phage infection. Finally, we show that the T7 peptide gp0.4 is responsible for the inhibition of FtsZ in K12 strains by observing a phenotype recovery with a T7Δ0.4 mutant.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Its pathogenesis remains unclear, and it is associated with extremely low rates of cure and complete remission. It is vital to study the pathogenesis of depression to develop effective treatments. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of depression in rats. Thirty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to model depression, and CUMS+FMT. For the CUMS and CUMS+FMT groups, after CUMS intervention (four weeks), the rats were given normal saline or FMT (once/week for three weeks), respectively. Behavior, colonic motility, 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, and untargeted metabolomics on fecal samples were compared between the three rat groups. The following markers were analyzed: 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus; glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the serum; and GLP-1, GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) levels in colonic tissues. FMT improved symptoms of depression and colonic motility in rats exposed to CUMS. The expression levels of 5-HT, GABA, BDNF, and other biochemical indices, significantly differed among the three groups. Meanwhile, the intestinal microbiota in the CUMS+FMT group was more similar to that of the control group with a total of 13 different fecal metabolites. FMT exerted antidepressant effects on CUMS-induced depression in rats, and the mechanism involved various neurotransmitters, inflammatory factors, neurotrophic factors, and glucagon-like peptides.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

In order to investigate the role of gut microbiota in anti-infection against SARS-CoV-2, we established a high-throughput in vitro screening system for COVID-19 therapeutics by targeting the endoribonuclease (Nsp15). We also evaluated the activity inhibition of the target by substances of intestinal origin, using a mouse model in an attempt to explore the interactions between gut microbiota and SARS-CoV-2. The results unexpectedly revealed that antibiotic treatment induced the appearance of substances with Nsp15 activity inhibition in the intestine of mice. Comprehensive analysis based on functional profiling of the fecal metagenomes and endoribonuclease assay of antibiotic-enriched bacteria and metabolites demonstrated that the Nsp15 inhibitors were the primary bile acids that accumulated in the gut as a result of antibiotic-induced deficiency of bile acid metabolizing microbes. This study provides a new perspective on the development of COVID-19 therapeutics using primary bile acids.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

We found that the plasmid sequence and restriction proteins affected horizontal gene transfer, and confirmed the anti-restriction and anti-methylation activities of ArdA and KlcA during transformation and transduction. Among the three anti-restriction proteins, ArdA shows stronger anti-restriction and anti-methylation effects, and KlcAHS was weaker. KlcA shows anti-methylation only during transformation.

In order to deepen the understanding of the structure of the STC gut microbiota and the relationship between the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, we first used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to evaluate the gut microbiota in 30 STC patients and 30 healthy subjects. The α-diversity of the STC group was changed to a certain degree, and the β-diversity was significantly different, which indicated that the composition of the gut microbiota of STC patients was inconsistent with healthy subjects. Among them, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Desulfovibrionaceae, and Ruminiclostridium were significantly upregulated, while Subdoligranulum was significantly downregulated. The metabolomics showed that different metabolites between the STC and the control group were involved in the process of bile acids and lipid metabolism, including taurocholate, taurochenodeoxycholate, taurine, deoxycholic acid, cyclohexylsulfamate, cholic acid, chenodeoxycholate, arachidonic acid, and 4-pyridoxic acid. We found that the colon histomorphology of STC patients was significantly disrupted, and TGR5 and FXR were significantly downregulated. The differences in metabolites were related to changes in the abundance of specific bacteria and patients' intestinal dysfunction. Analysis of the fecal genomics and metabolomics enabled separation of the STC from controls based on random forest model prediction [STC vs. control (14 gut microbiota and metabolite biomarkers)-Sensitivity: 1, Specificity: 0.877].

The ability to form biofilms supports this highly selective pathogenic potential. In vitro studies essentially relying on phenotypic assays and genetic approaches have provided a detailed picture of the molecular events contributing to biofilm assembly. A major limitation in these studies is the use of synthetic growth media, which significantly differs from the environmental conditions S. epidermidis encounters during host invasion. Building on evidence showing that growth in serum substantially affects S. epidermidis gene expression profiles and phenotypes, the major aim of this study was to develop and characterize a growth medium mimicking synovial fluid, thereby facilitating research addressing specific aspects related to PJI. Using fresh human plasma, a protocol was established allowing for the large-scale production of a medium that by biochemical analysis matches key characteristics of synovial fluid and therefore is referred to as artificial synovial fluid (ASF). By analysis of biofilm-positive, polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA)-producing S. epidermidis 1457 and its isogenic, PIA- and biofilm-negative mutant 1457-M10, evidence is provided that the presence of ASF induces cluster formation in S. epidermidis 1457 and mutant 1457-M10. Consistent with the aggregative properties, both strains formed multilayered biofilms when analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. In parallel to the phenotypic findings, expression analysis after growth in ASF found upregulation of genes encoding for intercellular adhesins (icaA, aap, and embp) as well as atlE, encoding for the major cell wall autolysin being responsible for eDNA release. In contrast, growth in ASF was associated with reduced expression of the master regulator agr. Collectively, these results indicate that ASF induces expression profiles that are able to support intercellular adhesion in both PIA-positive and PIA-negative S. epidermidis. Given the observation that ASF overall induced biofilm formation in a collection of S. epidermidis isolates from PJI, the results strongly support the idea of using growth media mimicking host environments. ASF may play an important role in future studies related to the pathogenesis of S. epidermidis PJI.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The virulence plasmids have emerged as the predominant vehicles carrying the major pathogenic determinants of hypermucoviscosity and hypervirulence phenotypes. In the present study, we characterized a novel virulence plasmid in AP8555, an ST23 hvKP strain, which induced a metastatic infection and fatal septic shock in a critically ill patient. The serum killing assay, the quantitative biofilm formation assay, the G.mellonella infection model, and the mouse lethality assay demonstrated that AP8555 was almost as virulent as the hvKP strain NUTH-K2044. The plasmid pAP855 could be conjugated to Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ATCC700603 and E. coli J53 at a frequency of 7.2× 10-5 and 8.7× 10-7, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis confirmed that the plasmid was novel, clustered to the incompatibility type of IncHI1B/IncFIB/IncFII and presented high similarity to the pK2044 plasmid. In contrast, a 130-kb large-fragment insertion was observed on the plasmid, which introduced a genetic hybrid zone with multiple conjugation-related genes of type IV secretion systems (T4SS) and CcdAB toxin-antitoxin systems (TAS) to the plasmid. In the transconjugants, the presence of pAP855 had a negative impact on bacterial fitness, but enhancing the virulence-associated phenotypes. In vitro evolution experiments showed that pAP855 in the transconjugants could not be stably inherited after 10 days of passage. Our study not only reports a novel hybrid plasmid but also highlights the putative pathway of conjugative virulence plasmid formation and evolution by means of genetic rearrangement through sequence insertion. These findings indicate that structural versatility could contribute to the dissemination of cointegrate virulence plasmid, although the plasmid incurred a fitness cost. Therefore, continuous monitoring the acquisition of conjugative virulence plasmids may have critical value for plasmid research and increase awareness of hvKP.","misc","christiaan","misc"

From inception to July 24, 2021, relevant records were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The quality of studies was determined using the QUADAS-2 tool. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve for NAAT's diagnostic performance were evaluated using an HSROC model. Eight studies comprising 424 samples evaluated NAAT accuracy for Staphylococcus aureus (SA) identification, while four studies comprising 317 samples evaluated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) identification.

The I 2 statistical scores for MRSA and SA identification sensitivity were 13.7% and 74.9%, respectively, indicating mild to substantial heterogeneity. PCR was frequently used among NAA tests, and its diagnostic accuracy coincided well with the overall summary estimates. A meta-regression and subgroup analysis of country, setting, study design, patient selection, and sample condition could not explain the heterogeneity (meta-regression P = 0.66, P = 0.46, P = 0.98, P = 0.68, and P = 0.79, respectively) in diagnostic effectiveness. Our study suggested that the diagnostic accuracy of NAA tests is currently inadequate to substitute culture as a principal screening test.

TOA is an important, life-threatening disease, and it has become more common in recent years, posing a major health risk to women. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents are necessary to cover the most likely pathogens because the pathogens that cause TOA are polymicrobial. However, the response rate of antibiotic treatment is about 70%, whereas one-third of patients have poor clinical consequences and they require drainage or surgery. Rising antimicrobial resistance serves as a significant reason for the unsatisfactory medical outcomes. It is important to study the antibiotic resistance mechanism of TOA pathogens in solving the problems of multi-drug resistant strains. This paper focuses on the most common pathogenic bacteria isolated from TOA specimens and discusses the emerging trends and epidemiology of resistant Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and gram-positive anaerobic cocci. Besides that, new methods that aim to solve the antibiotic resistance of related pathogens are discussed, such as CRISPR, nanoparticles, bacteriophages, antimicrobial peptides, and pathogen-specific monoclonal antibodies. Through this review, we hope to reveal the current situation of antibiotic resistance of common TOA pathogens, relevant mechanisms, and possible antibacterial strategies, providing references for the clinical treatment of drug-resistant pathogens.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The same holds true for the experimental leishmaniasis induced by L. major in C57BL/6 mice where residual parasites persist after spontaneous clinical cure and induce sustainable memory immune responses and resistance to reinfection. Whether residual parasites also persist in scars of cured HCL caused by L. major is still unknown. Cutaneous scars from 53 volunteers with healed HCL caused by L. major were biopsied and the tissue sample homogenates were analyzed for residual parasites by four methods: i) microscope detection of amastigotes, ii) parasite culture by inoculation on biphasic medium, iii) inoculation of tissue exctracts to the footpad of BALB/c mice, an inbred strain highly susceptible to L. major, and iv) amplification of parasite kDNA by a highly sensitive real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Our results show that the scars of healed lesions of HCL caused by L. major do not contain detectable residual parasites, suggesting that this form likely induces a sterile cure at least within the scars. This feature contrasts with other Leishmania species causing chronic, diffuse, or recidivating forms of leishmaniasis where parasites do persist in healed lesions. The possibility that alternative mechanisms to parasite persistence are needed to boost and maintain long-term immunity to L. major, should be taken into consideration in vaccine development against L. major infection.","misc","christiaan","rodent"

RPA combined with lateral flow strips (LFS) can rapidly amplify and visually detect the target gene within 20 min. The whole detection process can be controlled within 30-60 min by rapid sample pre-treatment. In this study, RPA-LFS was used to amplify the internal transcribed spacer region 2 gene of C. glabrata.

RPA-LFS was performed on 23 common clinical pathogens to determine the specificity of the assay system. The RPA-LFS system specifically detected C. glabrata without cross-reaction with other fungi or bacteria. Gradient dilutions of the template were tested to explore the lower limit of detection of this detection system and to determine the sensitivity of the assay. The sensitivity was 10 CFU/µL, without interference from genomic DNA of other species. The RPA-LFS and qPCR assays were performed on 227 clinical samples to evaluate the detection performance of the RPA-LFS system. Eighty-five samples were identified as C. glabrata, representing a detection rate of 37.5%. The results were consistent with qPCR and conventional culture methods. The collective findings indicate a reliable molecular diagnostic method for the detection of C. glabrata, and to meet the urgent need for rapid, specific, sensitive, and portable clinical field-testing.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1302",35967866,"Biofilm formation and antibiotic sensitivity in Elizabethkingia anophelis.","Elizabethkingia anophelis has recently gained global attention and is emerging as a cause of life-threatening nosocomial infections. The present study aimed to investigate the association between antimicrobial resistance and the ability to form biofilm among E. anophelis isolated from hospitalized patients in China. Over 10 years, a total of 197 non-duplicate E. anophelis strains were collected. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the standard agar dilution method as a reference assay according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The biofilm formation ability was assessed using a culture microtiter plate method, which was determined using a crystal violet assay. Culture plate results were cross-checked by scanning electron microscopy imaging analysis. Among the 197 isolates, all were multidrug-resistant, and 20 were extensively drug-resistant. Clinical E. anophelis showed high resistance to current antibiotics, and 99% of the isolates were resistant to at least seven antibiotics. The resistance rate for aztreonam, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefepime, and tetracycline was high as 100%, 99%, 99%, 99%, 99%, 95%, and 90%, respectively. However, the isolates exhibited the highest susceptibility to minocycline (100%), doxycycline (96%), and rifampin (94%). The biofilm formation results revealed that all strains could form biofilm. Among them, the proportions of strong, medium, and weak biofilm-forming strains were 41%, 42%, and 17%, respectively. Furthermore, the strains forming strong or moderate biofilm presented a statistically significant higher resistance than the weak formers (p < 0.05), especially for piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Although E. anophelis was notoriously resistant to large antibiotics, minocycline, doxycycline, and rifampin showed potent activity against this pathogen. The data in the present report revealed a positive association between biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance, which will provide a foundation for improved therapeutic strategies against E. anophelis infections in the future.","misc","christiaan","misc"

However, the effects of different T. gondii genotypes on the gut microbiota of rats remain unclear. In this study, acute and chronic T. gondii infection in Fischer 344 rats was induced artificially by intraperitoneal injection of tachyzoites PYS (Chinese 1 ToxoDB#9) and PRU (Type II). Fecal 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was employed to analyze the gut microbiota structure at different stages of infection, and to compare the effects of infection by two T. gondii genotypes. Our results suggested that the infection led to structural changes of gut microbiota in rats. At the acute infection stage, the microbiota diversity increased, while both diversity and abundance of beneficial bacteria decreased at the chronic infection stage. The differences of microbiota structure were caused by strains of different genotypes. However, the diversity changes were consistent. This study demonstrates that the gut microbiota plays an important role in T. gondii infection in rats. The data will improve our understanding of the association between T. gondii infection and gut microbiota in rodents.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

The heterogeneous nature of DC subsets follows their altered functions by interacting with other immune cells, Mtb, and its products, enhancing host defense mechanisms or facilitating pathogen evasion. Thus, a better understanding of the immune responses initiated, promoted, and amplified or inhibited by DCs in Mtb infection is an essential step in developing anti-tuberculosis (TB) control measures, such as host-directed adjunctive therapy and anti-TB vaccines. This review summarizes the recent advances in salient DC subsets, including their phenotypic classification, cytokine profiles, functional alterations according to disease stages and environments, and consequent TB outcomes. A comprehensive overview of the role of DCs from various perspectives enables a deeper understanding of TB pathogenesis and could be useful in developing DC-based vaccines and immunotherapies.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Lactobacillus adheres to the vaginal epithelium and can competitively antagonize the colonization of pathogens. The factors produced by Lactobacillus, such as bacteriocin and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), can inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms and maintain the low pH environment of the vagina. Probiotics play an important role in maintaining the stability of vaginal microenvironment, improving immune defense and blocking the progression of cervical cancer.

It is estimated that at least 14,000 people die every year of CD. Since vaccines are not available, chemotherapy remains of pivotal relevance. About 30% of the treated patients cannot complete the therapy because of severe adverse reactions. Thus, the search for novel drugs is required. Here we tested the benznidazole (BZ) combination with the repositioned drug disulfiram (DSF) and its derivative diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) upon Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro and in vivo. DETC-BZ combination was synergistic diminishing epimastigote proliferation and enhancing selective indexes up to over 10-fold. DETC was effective upon amastigotes of the BZ- partially resistant Y and the BZ-resistant Colombiana strains. The combination reduced proliferation even using low concentrations (e.g., 2.5 µM). Scanning electron microscopy revealed membrane discontinuities and cell body volume reduction. Transmission electron microscopy revealed remarkable enlargement of endoplasmic reticulum cisternae besides, dilated mitochondria with decreased electron density and disorganized kinetoplast DNA. At advanced stages, the cytoplasm vacuolation apparently impaired compartmentation. The fluorescent probe H2-DCFDA indicates the increased production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced lipid peroxidation in parasites incubated with DETC. The biochemical measurement indicates the downmodulation of thiol expression. DETC inhibited superoxide dismutase activity on parasites was more pronounced than in infected mice. In order to approach the DETC effects on intracellular infection, peritoneal macrophages were infected with Colombiana trypomastigotes. DETC addition diminished parasite numbers and the DETC-BZ combination was effective, despite the low concentrations used. In the murine infection, the combination significantly enhanced animal survival, decreasing parasitemia over BZ. Histopathology revealed that low doses of BZ-treated animals presented myocardial amastigote, not observed in combination-treated animals. The picrosirius collagen staining showed reduced myocardial fibrosis. Aminotransferase de aspartate, Aminotransferase de alanine, Creatine kinase, and urea plasma levels demonstrated that the combination was non-toxic. As DSF and DETC can reduce the toxicity of other drugs and resistance phenotypes, such a combination may be safe and effective.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"
"1308",35967896,"Horse odor exploration behavior is influenced by pregnancy and age.","In spite of a highly developed olfactory apparatus of horses, implying a high adaptive value, research on equine olfaction is sparse. Our limited knowledge on equine olfaction poses a risk that horse behavior does not match human expectations, as horses might react fearful when exposed to certain odors, which humans do not consider as frightening. The benefit of acquiring more knowledge of equine olfaction is therefore twofold; (1) it can aid the understanding of horse behavior and hence reduce the risk of dangerous situations, and (2) there may be unexplored potential of using odors in several practical situations where humans interact with horses. This study investigated behavior and olfactory sensitivity of 35 Icelandic horses who were presented with four odors: peppermint, orange, lavender and cedar wood in a Habituation/Dishabituation paradigm. The response variables were sniffing duration per presentation and behavioral reaction (licking, biting, snorting, and backing), and data were analyzed for potential effects of age, sex and pregnancy. Results showed that habituation occurred between successive odor presentations (1st vs. 2nd and 2nd vs. 3rd presentations: P < 0.001), and dishabituation occurred when a new odor was presented (1st vs. 3rd presentations: P < 0.001). Horses were thus able to detect and distinguish between all four odors, but expressed significantly longer sniffing duration when exposed to peppermint (peppermint vs. orange, lavender and cedar wood: P < 0.001). More horses expressed licking when presented to peppermint compared to cedar wood and lavender (P = 0.0068). Pregnant mares sniffed odors less than non-pregnant mares (P = 0.030), young horses (age 0-5 years) sniffed cedar wood for longer than old horses (P = 0.030), whereas sex had no effect (P > 0.050). The results show that horses' odor exploration behavior and interest in odors varies with age and pregnancy and that horses naïve to the taste of a substrate, may be able to link smell with taste, which has not been described before. These results can aid our understanding of horses' behavioral reactions to odors, and in the future, it may be possible to relate these to the physiology and health of horses.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Effects on mental health and interoceptive awareness.","Universal exercise recommendations for adults neglect individual preferences, changing constraints, and their potential impact on associated health benefits. A recent proposal suggests replacing the standardized World Health Organisation (WHO) exercise recommendations for healthy adults by co-designed interventions where individuals participate actively in the decisions about the selected physical activities and the effort regulation. This study contrasts the effects on mental health and interoceptive awareness of a co-designed and co-adapted exercise intervention with an exercise program based on the WHO recommendations for healthy adults. Twenty healthy adults (10 men and 10 women, 40-55 y.o.) participated voluntarily in the research. They were randomly assigned to a co-designed exercise intervention (CoD group) and a prescribed exercise program (WHO group). Supervised online by specialized personal trainers, both programs lasted 9 weeks and were equivalent in volume and intensity. The effects of the exercise intervention were tested through personal interviews, questionnaires (DASS-21 and MAIA) and a cardiorespiratory exercise test. Intragroup differences (pre-post) were assessed using the Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test and intergroup differences through Student's t-tests. Effect sizes were calculated through Cohen's d. Interviews were analyzed through thematic analysis. Eleven participants completed the intervention (CoD = 8, WHO = 5). Both groups improved, but non significantly, their cardiorespiratory testing results, and no differences were found between them post-intervention. Mental health was only enhanced in the CoD group (p < 0.001), and interoceptive awareness improved in seven of the eight scales in the CoD group (p < 0.001) and only in 3 scales in the WHO group (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the co-designed intervention was more effective for developing mental health, interoceptive awareness, autonomy, and exercise self-regulation than the WHO-based exercise program.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"

One of the major challenges toward their use as drugs is their low thermostability, which impacts both efficacy as well as manufacturing and delivery. To aid the design of thermally more stable mutants, consensus sequence-based method has been widely used. These methods typically have a success rate of about 50% with maximum melting temperature increment ranging from 10 to 32°C. To improve the prediction performance, we have developed a new and fast MAbs specific method by adding a 3D structural layer to the consensus sequence method. This is done by analyzing the close-by residue pairs which are conserved in >800 MAbs' 3D structures. Combining consensus sequence and structural residue pair covariance methods, we developed an in-house application for predicting human MAb thermostability to guide protein engineers to design stable molecules. Major advantage of this structural level assessment is in significantly reducing the false positives by almost half from the consensus sequence method alone. This application has shown success in designing MAb engineering panels in multiple biologics programs. Our data science-based method shows impacts in Mab engineering.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We collected behavioural data (n = 318 h) using all occurrence of some behaviours and ad libitum sampling methods, as well as faecal (n = 54) and anogenital scent (n = 35) samples of the breeding female. We measured sex hormone levels using enzyme immunoassay technique and investigated the volatile component of odour signals using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We observed sexual and aggressive behaviours occasionally during the breeding period. Our regression analysis showed that only period significantly predicted rates of female anogenital scent-marking, whereby the female performed anogenital scent-marking more frequently during the breeding rather than the non-breeding period. In contrast, female hormone levels did not significantly explain variation in rates of neither male nor female olfactory, sexual and affiliative behaviours, suggesting that individuals' behaviour alone is not an effective indicator of the ovulation window. The volatile chemical profile of anogenital odour secretions changed over the study, with four compounds distinguishing the fertile window during the breeding period.

Similarly, there is an interest in using CBD, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) or cannabinoid-rich hemp products in the treatment of idiopathic epilepsy in dogs. We aimed to examine a small cohort in a pilot investigation using a CBD and CBDA-rich hemp product for the treatment of refractory epileptic seizures in dogs. Fourteen dogs were examined in a 24-week randomized cross-over study being provided placebo or CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract treatment at 2 mg/kg orally every 12 h for each 12-week arm of the study. Serum chemistry, complete blood counts, serum anti-seizure medication (ASM) concentrations and epileptic seizure frequency were followed over both arms of the cross-over trial. Results demonstrated that besides a mild increase in alkaline phosphatase, there were no alterations observed on routine bloodwork at 2, 6, and 12 weeks during either arm of the study. Epileptic seizure frequency decreased across the population from a mean of 8.0 ± 4.8 during placebo treatment to 5.0 ± 3.6 with CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract (P = 0.02). In addition, epileptic seizure event days over the 12 weeks of CBD/CBDA-rich hemp treatment were 4.1 ± 3.4, which was significantly different than during the 12 weeks of placebo treatment (5.8 ± 3.1; P =0.02). The number of dogs with a 50% reduction in epileptic activity while on treatment were 6/14, whereas 0/14 had reductions of 50% or greater while on the placebo (P = 0.02). No differences were observed in serum zonisamide, phenobarbital or bromide concentrations while on the treatment across groups. Adverse events were minimal, but included somnolence (3/14) and transient increases in ataxia (4/14) during CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract treatment; this was not significantly different from placebo. This further indicates that providing CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract during refractory epilepsy (only partially responsive to ASM), in conjunction with other ASM appears safe. Based on this information, the use of 2 mg/kg every 12 h of a CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract can have benefits in reducing the incidence of epileptic seizures, when used concurrently with other ASMs.","misc","christiaan","randomized_trial"

This model was developed from theoretical inputs from three fundamental disciplines for understanding interspecies interactions: neuroscience, psychology and ethology, with the objective of providing a transdisciplinary approach on which field professionals and researchers can build and collaborate. Seminal works in affective neuroscience offer a common basis between humans and animals and, as such, can be applied to the study of interspecies interactions from a One Health-One Welfare perspective. On the one hand, Jaak Panksepp's research revealed that primary/basic emotions originate in the deep subcortical regions of the brain and are shared by all mammals, including humans. On the other hand, several works in the field of neuroscience show that the basic physiological state is largely determined by the perception of safety. Thus, emotional expression reflects the state of an individual's permanent adaptation to ever-changing environmental demands. Based on this evidence and over 5 years of action research using grounded theory, alternating between research and practice, the IMHAI proposes a systemic approach to the study of primary-process emotional affects during interspecies social interactions, through the processes of emotional transfer, embodied communication and interactive emotional regulation. IMHAI aims to generate new hypotheses and predictions on affective behavior and interspecies communication. Application of such a model should promote risk prevention and the establishment of positive links between humans and animals thereby contributing to their respective wellbeing.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We conducted initial scoping searches to broadly define types of animal health practices relevant for smallholders in LMICs and formulated search terms. A scoping review protocol was designed and registered. A systematic literature search will be conducted using electronic databases including CAB Abstract, Scopus, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science Core Collection. Gray literature will be searched from AGRIS and Standards for Supporting Agricultural Livelihoods in Emergencies. Articles in English, pertaining to the animal health practices considered highly relevant will be considered eligible for inclusion. Articles will be screened at two stages by two independent reviewers; screening of titles, abstracts, and keywords, followed by full-article screening. The first reviewer will review 100% of the articles at both stages. The second reviewer will review a random sample of 20% of the articles at both stages. Any disagreements will be resolved using inputs from the third reviewer. A thematic analysis will be conducted to catalog contexts and mechanisms for adoption and discussed under a realist framework. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying the adoption of animal health practices by livestock smallholders in LMICs is crucial for successful implementation of interventions including those which are based on a One Health approach. This review will identify the extent of this knowledge across disciplines and inform future research priorities for the design of effective and feasible interventions which can contribute toward Sustainable Development Goal 2.

The dog was subjected to basic clinical examination, hemato-biochemistry test, and radiographic examination before rhinoscopy. Rhinoscopy was performed with Karl Storz's 5-mm video-otoscope under general anesthesia. Leech infestation in the nasal cavity was found to be the cause of the epistaxis under rhinoscopic examination. The endoscopic guided retrieval of the leech from both the nostrils was successfully done with help of grasping forceps without any major complication. The video-otoscope-guided retrieval of nasal leeches was quite convenient and also provide the exact localization of the nasal leech.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This study analyzed how age binning and targeted sampling in serological surveillance affect the width of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the estimated force of infection (FOI) of infectious diseases. We indicate that the optimal target population with the narrowest 95% CI differs depending on the expected FOI using computer simulations and mathematical models. In addition, our findings show that we can substantially reduce the number of animals required to infer transmission risk by tailoring targeted, age-based sampling to specific epidemiological situations.","misc","christiaan","misc"

It was necessary to develop a sensitive and specific diagnostic method to detect PCV4 in clinical samples, so in this study, a multienzyme isothermal rapid amplification (MIRA) assay was developed for the rapid detection of PCV4 and evaluated for sensitivity, specificity and applicability. It was used to detect the conserved Cap gene of PCV4, operated at 41°C and completed in 20 min. With the screening of MIRA primer-probe combination, it could detect as low as 101 copies of PCV4 DNA per reaction and was highly specific, with no cross-reaction with other pathogens. Further assessment with clinical samples showed that the developed MIRA assay had good correlation with real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of PCV4. The developed MIRA assay will be a valuable tool for the detection of the novel PCV4 in clinical samples due to its high sensitivity and specificity, simplicity of operation and short testing time.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Fewer across-breed variations in horse gut microbial diversity have been illustrated. In this article, the gut microbiota of Thoroughbred, Mongolian, and Hybrid horses [first filial generation (F1) of Mongolian (maternal) and Thoroughbred (paternal)] were studied by second-generation high-throughput sequencing technology. Differences in gut microbiota composition and function between breeds were determined using diversity and functional prediction analysis. The alpha diversity analysis showed that Thoroughbred horses had a more abundant and diverse gut microbiota, while the diversity of gut microbiota in Hybrid horses was intermediate between Thoroughbred and Mongolian horses. Subsequent cluster analysis showed that Hybrid horses have a microbiota composition more similar to Mongolian horses. LEfSe analysis revealed that the bacterial biomarkers for Thoroughbred horses at the family level were Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, Fibrobacteraceae, p_251_o5, Lactobacillaceae, and uncultured_bacterium_o_WCHB1_41; the bacterial biomarker for Mongolian horses was Planococcaceae; and the bacterial biomarkers for Hybrid horses were Moraxellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Ruminococcaceae. The functional prediction results indicated that the metabolic pathways differ significantly between the breeds. Regarding metabolism, the Hybrid horses had the lowest proportion of the carbohydrate metabolic pathways, while the energy metabolic pathway had the highest proportion. The abundance ratios of the remaining eight metabolic pathways in Hybrid horses were between Thoroughbred and Mongolian horses. In conclusion, the results of this study showed an association between horse breeds and gut microbiota.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1328",35968026,"Veterinary Guidelines for Electrochemotherapy of Superficial Tumors.","Electrochemotherapy (ECT) consists in the application of electric pulses to increase chemotherapeutic drug intake (bleomycin, cisplatin, or calcium) into the tumor cells. It has become a very valuable treatment option in veterinary oncology. It is an effective and safe treatment modality, which is not only beneficial as a palliative treatment, but also for a curative approach. Performing the treatment adequately will ensure the best results possible, in the minimum number of sessions, and reduce complications. Usually, only one session is enough to achieve excellent results, but the treatment can be repeated. Several sessions can be necessary in the case of incompletely treated or very extended lesions, as well as in the occurrence of new lesions. ECT is effective for superficial or oral tumors of any histology that are accessible to the electrodes. Intravenous bleomycin is the preferred drug and route of administration, leaving other ways of administration and drugs for selected cases. The guidelines presented here are destined to veterinarians who want to develop their understanding of the basis of ECT and wish to perform it adequately and effectively. In this paper, we also discuss common problems and how to solve them, and we include practical tips to improve the treatment results based on common questions and mistakes of beginner users.","misc","christiaan","protocol"

AI can help ensure sustainable production in agriculture by enhancing agricultural operations and decision-making. Recommendations about soil condition and pesticides or automatic devices for milking and apple picking are examples of AI applications in digital agriculture. Although AI offers many benefits in farming, AI systems may raise ethical issues and risks that should be assessed and proactively managed. Poor design and configuration of intelligent systems may impose harm and unintended consequences on digital agriculture. Invasion of farmers' privacy, damaging animal welfare due to robotic technologies, and lack of accountability for issues resulting from the use of AI tools are only some examples of ethical challenges in digital agriculture. This paper examines the ethical challenges of the use of AI in agriculture in six categories including fairness, transparency, accountability, sustainability, privacy, and robustness. This study further provides recommendations for agriculture technology providers (ATPs) and policymakers on how to proactively mitigate ethical issues that may arise from the use of AI in farming. These recommendations cover a wide range of ethical considerations, such as addressing farmers' privacy concerns, ensuring reliable AI performance, enhancing sustainability in AI systems, and reducing AI bias.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Eating raw fish and/or undercooked fish, raw vegetables, and drinking untreated water from Thac Ba lake in Yen Bai province were identified as FZTi risk behaviors. The occurrence of these risky habits can be explained by the lack of knowledge on FZTi, poor economic conditions and typical social features of local people. The current knowledge of local people in regard to safe eating practices is poor. They keep performing unsafe practices, which lead to infection with FZTi; therefore, an integrated control of FZTi is essential.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

As demonstrated by the dramatic worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, adequate vaccine coverage against infectious diseases is essential towards the preservation and function of virtually every aspect of our society. While the determinants of vaccine hesitancy and pandemic concern have been widely investigated, conflicting evidence exists with regards to their association with education levels and political views. This study aimed to investigate whether science literacy levels and standpoint on social and economic matters are associated with different levels of vaccine confidence and COVID-19 concern. An online survey was circulated amongst participants recruited via convenience sampling, and data were analysed using non-parametric statistical tests. The survey (n = 389) highlighted that participants who studied Science at General Certificate of Secondary Education level have a lower vaccine confidence than those with both lower and higher levels of science education. Participants with neutral/centrist political views expressed lower confidence than those with a libertarian social stance or a left-wing economic stance. A higher concern with the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with lower levels of science education, libertarian social views, and left-wing economic views. The present study provides novel insight on the educational and political factors associated with vaccine hesitancy and pandemic concern within a British population sample.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Policy analysis involves a wide range of methods, techniques, and tools in a way to reach awareness of the impacts of the developed and implemented policies. Whereas policy analysis in developed countries has a long history, in developing countries, it is instead in its first developing stages. Our paper aimed to collect systematically the studies using health policy triangle framework in doing analysis in one of the health policy issues in the Eastern Mediterranean region organization. To conduct our literature search, ISI/Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Global Health Database, Scopus, as well as Google Scholar from 2003 up to June 2020 were systematically mined. To evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies, the Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist was used. We selected 30 studies, conducted between 2011 and 2020. According to the findings of these studies, in the Eastern Mediterranean region, organization region, and the role of evidence-based research in policy-making has been repeatedly emphasized, but its use in health program decision-making has been limited, and health research systems in Eastern Mediterranean region organization are still under scrutiny. There is still a gap between evidence-based research in health systems and its use in policy-making. Based on the present systematic review, studies based on policy analysis should focus on all the elements of health policies and provide evidence to inform decisions that can strengthen health systems, improve health and improve existing inequalities.","systematic_review","christiaan","systematic_review"

Through a retrospective analysis of 2012, 2015 and 2017 PPS of HAIs performed in a tertiary academic hospital in Italy, we developed a model to predict the risk of HAI. Following ECDC protocol we surveyed 1382 patients across three years. Bivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between HAI and several variables. Those statistically significant were included in a stepwise multiple regression model. The goodness of fit of the latter model was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, ultimately constructing a probability curve to estimate the risk of developing HAIs. Three variables resulted statistically significant in the stepwise logistic regression model: length of stay (OR 1.03; 95% CI: 1.02-1.05), devices breaking the skin (i.e. peripheral or central vascular catheter, OR 4.38; 95% CI: 1.52-12.63), urinary catheter (OR 4.71; 95% CI: 2.78-7.98). PPSs are a convenient and reliable source of data to develop HAIs prediction models. The differences found between our results and previously published studies suggest the need of developing hospital-specific databases and predictive models for HAIs.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Members of the DUF1644 family, the domains of unknown function 1644 motif are predicted to play an essential regulatory role in response to abiotic stress. However, the specific molecular mechanisms of most members of this family remain elusive. Here, we report that the OsSIDP301 (stress-induced DUF1644 protein) was induced by salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA). We found that overexpression of OsSIDP301 (OE) in plants conferred salt hypersensitivity and reduced grain size, whereas plants with OsSIDP301 RNA interference (RNAi) exhibited salt tolerance and increased grain size in rice. OsSIDP301 determines salt stress tolerance by modulating genes involved in the salt-response and ABA signaling pathways. Further studies suggest that OsSIDP301 regulates grain size by influencing cell expansion in spikelet hulls. Moreover, OsSIDP301 interacts with OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1), which positively regulates grain size in rice. Our findings reveal that OsSIDP301 functions as a negative regulator of salt stress and grain size, and repressing its expression represents a promising strategy for improving salt stress tolerance and yield in rice.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1340",35968084,"Subcellular trafficking and post-translational modification regulate PIN polarity in plants.","Auxin regulates plant growth and tropism responses. As a phytohormone, auxin is transported between its synthesis sites and action sites. Most natural auxin moves between cells via a polar transport system that is mediated by PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin exporters. The asymmetrically localized PINs usually determine the directionality of intercellular auxin flow. Different internal cues and external stimuli modulate PIN polar distribution and activity at multiple levels, including transcription, protein stability, subcellular trafficking, and post-translational modification, and thereby regulate auxin-distribution-dependent development. Thus, the different regulation levels of PIN polarity constitute a complex network. For example, the post-translational modification of PINs can affect the subcellular trafficking of PINs. In this review, we focus on subcellular trafficking and post-translational modification of PINs to summarize recent progress in understanding PIN polarity.","misc","christiaan","misc"

However, some wetland plants including rice can germinate under submerged conditions. It has long been hypothesized that the first elongating shoot tissue, the coleoptile, acts as a snorkel to acquire atmospheric oxygen (O2) to initiate the first leaf elongation and seminal root emergence. Here, we obtained direct evidence for this hypothesis by visualizing the spatiotemporal O2 dynamics during submerged germination in rice using a planar O2 optode system. In parallel with the O2 imaging, we tracked the anatomical development of shoot and root tissues in real-time using an automated flatbed scanner. Three hours after the coleoptile tip reached the water surface, O2 levels around the embryo transiently increased. At this time, the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an enzyme critical for anaerobic metabolism, was significantly reduced, and the coleorhiza covering the seminal roots in the embryo was broken. Approximately 10 h after the transient burst in O2, seminal roots emerged. A transient O2 burst around the embryo was shown to be essential for seminal root emergence during submerged rice germination. The parallel application of a planar O2 optode system and automated scanning system can be a powerful tool for examining how environmental conditions affect germination in rice and other plants.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The wild tomato relative Solanum galapagense accession LA1141 demonstrates the ability to tolerate deficit irrigation, making it a potential resource for crop improvement. Accessing traits from LA1141 through introgression may improve the response of cultivated tomatoes grown in water-limited environments. Canopy temperature is a proxy for physiological traits which are challenging to measure efficiently and may be related to water deficit tolerance. We optimized phenotypic evaluation based on variance partitioning and further show that objective phenotyping methods coupled with genomic prediction lead to gain under selection for water deficit tolerance. The objectives of this work were to improve phenotyping workflows for measuring canopy temperature, mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from LA1141 that contribute to water deficit tolerance and comparing selection strategies. The phenotypic variance attributed to genetic causes for canopy temperature was higher when estimated from thermal images relative to estimates based on an infrared thermometer. Composite interval mapping using BC2S3 families, genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphisms, suggested that accession LA1141 contributed alleles that lower canopy temperature and increase plant turgor under water deficit. QTLs for lower canopy temperature were mapped to chromosomes 1 and 6 and explained between 6.6 and 9.5% of the total phenotypic variance. QTLs for higher leaf turgor were detected on chromosomes 5 and 7 and explained between 6.8 and 9.1% of the variance. We advanced tolerant BC2S3 families to the BC2S5 generation using selection indices based on phenotypic values and genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs). Phenotypic, genomic, and combined selection strategies demonstrated gain under selection and improved performance compared to randomly advanced BC2S5 progenies. Leaf turgor, canopy temperature, stomatal conductance, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were evaluated and compared in BC2S5 progenies grown under deficit irrigation. Progenies co-selected for phenotypic values and GEBVs wilted less, had significantly lower canopy temperature, higher stomatal conductance, and lower VPD than randomly advanced lines. The fruit size of water deficit tolerant selections was small compared to the recurrent parent. However, lines with acceptable yield, canopy width, and quality parameters were recovered. These results suggest that we can create selection indices to improve water deficit tolerance in a recurrent parent background, and additional crossing and evaluation are warranted.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1343",35968094,"Analyzing the effect of ion binding to the membrane-surface on regulating the light-induced transthylakoid electric potential (ΔΨm).","The transthylakoid membrane potential (ΔΨm) is essential because it can drive the ATP synthesis through the CF0-CF1 type of ATP-synthase in chloroplasts as an energetic equivalent similar to ΔpH. In addition, a high fraction of proton motive force (PMF) stored as the ΔΨm component is physiologically important in the acclimation of photosynthesis to environmental stresses. It has been shown that ΔΨm is the sum of the Donnan potential difference (ΔΨdn) and the diffusion potential difference (ΔΨd). Specifically, ΔΨdn, ΔΨd, and ΔΨm are strongly associated with the ionic activities near the membrane surface, particularly, the extent of ion binding to the charged/neutral sites adjacent to the membrane surface. However, an in-depth analysis of the effect of altered cationic binding to the membrane surface on adjusting the transthylakoid electric potentials (ΔΨdn, ΔΨd, and ΔΨm) is still missing. This lack of a mechanistic understanding is due to the experimental difficulty of closely observing cations binding to the membrane surface in vivo. In this work, a computer model was proposed to investigate the transthylakoid electric phenomena in the chloroplast focusing on the interaction between cations and the negative charges close to the membrane surface. By employing the model, we simulated the membrane potential and consequently, the measured ECS traces, proxing the ΔΨm, were well described by the computing results on continuous illumination followed by a dark-adapted period. Moreover, the computing data clarified the components of transthylakoid membrane potential, unraveled the functional consequences of altered cationic attachment to the membrane surface on adjusting the transthylakoid electric potential, and further revealed the key role played by Donnan potential in regulating the energization of the thylakoid membrane. The current model for calculating electric potentials can function as a preliminary network for the further development into a more detailed theoretical model by which multiple important variables involved in photosynthesis can be explored.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The intensity of drying during desiccation eminently affected the formation of emblings (i.e., seedlings developed from somatic embryos). Compared to non-desiccated embryos, the germination capacity of embryos desiccated at 100% relative humidity was about three times higher, but the reduction of relative humidity to 95 and 90% had a negative effect on the subsequent embryo development. The water loss observed in these embryos did not lead to an increase in lipid peroxidation, as shown by malondialdehyde levels. Another metabolic pathway in plants that mediates a response to abiotic stresses is directed toward the biosynthesis of polyamines (PAs). The activities of PA biosynthetic enzymes increased steadily in embryos during desiccation at 100% relative humidity, whereas they decreased at lower humidity. The total content of free PAs in the embryos gradually decreased throughout desiccation. The increase in free putrescine (Put) and perchloric acid-insoluble Put conjugates was observed in embryos desiccated at lower humidity. These changes were accompanied to some extent by the transcription of the genes for the PA biosynthesis enzymes. Desiccation at 100% relative humidity increased the activity of the cell wall-modifying enzymes β-1,3-glucanases and chitinases; the activities of these enzymes were also significantly suppressed at reduced humidity. The same pattern was observed in the transcription of some β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase genes. Desiccation treatments triggered metabolic processes that responded to water availability, suggesting an active response of the embryo to the reduction in humidity. A positive effect was demonstrated only for desiccation at high relative humidity. Some of the physiological characteristics described can be used as markers of inappropriate relative humidity during somatic embryo desiccation.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Pathogenicity of X. euvesicatoria depends on a type III secretion (T3S) system which translocates effector proteins into plant cells and is associated with an extracellular pilus and a translocon in the plant plasma membrane. Effector protein translocation is activated by the cytoplasmic T3S chaperone HpaB which presumably targets effectors to the T3S system. We previously reported that HpaB is controlled by the translocated regulator HpaA which binds to and inactivates HpaB during the assembly of the T3S system. In the present study, we show that translocation of HpaA depends on the T3S substrate specificity switch protein HpaC and likely occurs after pilus and translocon assembly. Translocation of HpaA requires the presence of a translocation motif (TrM) in the N-terminal region. The TrM consists of an arginine-and proline-rich amino acid sequence and is also essential for the in vivo function of HpaA. Mutation of the TrM allowed the translocation of HpaA in hpaB mutant strains but not in the wild-type strain, suggesting that the recognition of the TrM depends on HpaB. Strikingly, the contribution of HpaB to the TrM-dependent translocation of HpaA was independent of the presence of the C-terminal HpaB-binding site in HpaA. We propose that HpaB generates a recognition site for the TrM at the T3S system and thus restricts the access to the secretion channel to effector proteins. Possible docking sites for HpaA at the T3S system were identified by in vivo and in vitro interaction studies and include the ATPase HrcN and components of the predicted cytoplasmic sorting platform of the T3S system. Notably, the TrM interfered with the efficient interaction of HpaA with several T3S system components, suggesting that it prevents premature binding of HpaA. Taken together, our data highlight a yet unknown contribution of the TrM and HpaB to substrate recognition and suggest that the TrM increases the binding specificity between HpaA and T3S system components.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The damage intensity of Spodoptera exigua at the seedling stage of quinoa fluctuates with the crop's biological cycle and the environmental changes throughout the growing season. In this study, we used independently selected quinoa seedling resistant and susceptible cultivars to investigate the difference between insect resistance and insect susceptibility of quinoa at the seedling stage. Samples were collected when Spodoptera exigua 45 days after planting the seedlings, and broad targeted metabolomics studies were conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry combined with transcriptomic co-analysis. The metabolomic and genomic analyses of the insect-resistant and insect-susceptible quinoa groups revealed a total of 159 differential metabolites and were functionally annotated to 2334 differential genes involved in 128 pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. In total, 14 metabolites and 22 genes were identified as key factors for the differential accumulation of insect-resistant metabolites in quinoa seedlings. Among them, gene-LOC110694254, gene-LOC110682669, and gene-LOC110732988 were positively correlated with choline. The expression of gene-LOC110729518 and gene-LOC110723164, which were notably higher in the resistant cultivars than in the susceptible cultivars, and the accumulations of the corresponding metabolites were also significantly higher in insect-resistant cultivars. These results elucidate the regulatory mechanism between insect resistance genes and metabolite accumulation in quinoa seedlings, and can provide a basis for the breeding and identification of new insect-resistant quinoa cultivars as well as for screening potential regulatory metabolites of quinoa insect-resistant target genes.","misc","christiaan","misc"

For in vitro tests, the scales were spread on microscope slides, hand pollinated, and incubated. Pollen germination was evaluated with the stereomicroscope and the tube growth was explored with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The in vivo tests were carried out by sprinkling the stigmas of the Crocus plants with Silica gel scales and immediately after having pollinated them by hand, the plants were incubated. Three hours later, the stigmas were removed and treated for observation with SEM. In vitro the pollen of both species germinated on Silica gel with percentages similar to those of the in vivo and in vitro controls, accumulating fibrillary material at the interface. The tubes grew perpendicular to the surface of the scales, trying to penetrate the scales to the point of flattening with the apex. On Crocus stigmas sprinkled with Silica gel scales, pollen developed tubes that grew to the scales rather than penetrating the papillae. The results underline the close interaction of pollen with nanoporous artificial material, so much so that its pollen tubes are attracted to the Silica scales more than to the stigma papillae that arises from a mechanism of natural selection.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Anthocyanins are naturally occurring plant pigments that have antioxidants activity and play important role in plant defense against abiotic and biotic stresses. In the present study, drought induced effects on plants were investigated in hydroponically grown seedlings of green stem (GS) and purple stem (PS) genotypes of B. napus. The results of this study showed that the major function of anthocyanins accumulation during drought was to enhance the antioxidant capability and stress tolerance in B. napus plants. Our results showed that drought significantly inhibited the plant growth in terms of decreased biomass accumulation in both genotypes, although marked decline was observed in GS genotype. The reduction in photosynthetic attributes was more noticeable in the GS genotype, whereas the PS genotype showed better performance under drought stress. Under stressful conditions, both the genotype showed excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as higher levels of antioxidant enzymes activities. Under drought conditions, the GS genotype showed apparent damages on chloroplast deformation like in thylakoid membrane and grana structural distortion and fewer starch grains and bigger plastoglobuli. Moreover, during drought stress, the PS genotype exhibited maximum expression levels of anthocyanins biosynthesis genes and antioxidant enzymes accompanied by higher stress tolerance relative to GS genotype. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that GS genotype found more sensitive to drought stress than the PS genotype. Furthermore this research paper also provides practical guidance for plant biologists who are developing stress-tolerant crops by using anthocyanin biosynthesis or regulatory genes.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The objective of this study was to have a comprehensive evaluation of the response to aluminum stress in olive tree at germplasm, metabolome, and transcriptome levels. In this experiment, seedlings of 97 olive germplasm with 1.0-3.0 cm roots and two leaves were treated with 50 μM Al3+ (pH = 5.0). By factor analysis of the traits of defoliation rate, rooting rate, length of extended root, and length of new root, 97 germplasm were classified into five different groups according to their diverse responses to aluminum stress: 5 highly resistant (5.15%), 30 moderately resistant (30.93%), 31 general (31.96%), 23 moderately sensitive (23.71%), and 8 highly sensitive (8.25%) germplasm. The three most sensitive and three most resistant germplasm were further used for metabolome and transcriptome analysis. Exposed to aluminum stress, 96 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs)/4,845 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 66 DAMs/2,752 DEGs were identified in highly sensitive and resistant germplasm, respectively. Using multi-omics technology, the pathways and related DAMs/DEGs involved in cell wall/cytoplasm receptors, reactive oxygen species balance, hormone induction, synthesis of organic acids, Al3+ transport, and synthesis of metabolites were identified to mainly regulate the response to aluminum stress in olive. This study provides a theoretical guide and prior germplasm and genes for further genetic improvement of aluminum tolerance in the olive tree.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Improving stalk strength is an effective way to improve lodging. The maize inbred line Jing2416 (J2416) was an elite germplasm in maize breeding which had strong stalk mechanical strength. To explore the characteristics its stalk strength, we conducted physiological, metabolic and transcriptomic analyses of J2416 and its parents Jing24 (J24) and 5237. At the kernel dent stage, the stalk rind penetrometer strength of J2416 was significantly higher than those of its two parents in multiple environments. The rind thickness, sclerenchyma tissue thickness, and cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents of J2416 were significantly higher than those of its parents. Based on the significant differences between J2416 and 5237, we detected metabolites and gene transcripts showing differences in abundance between these two materials. A total of 212 (68.60%) metabolites and 2287 (43.34%) genes were up-regulated in J2416 compared with 5237. The phenylpropanoid and glycan synthesis/metabolism pathways were enriched in metabolites and genes that were up-regulated in J2416. Twenty-eight of the up-regulated genes in J2416 were involved in lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose synthesis pathways.

"1352",35968131,"Yield gap analysis of rainfed alfalfa in the United States.","The United States (US) is the largest alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) producer in the world. More than 44% of the US alfalfa is produced under rainfed conditions, although it requires a relatively high amount of water compared to major field crops. Considering that yield and production of rainfed alfalfa have been relatively stagnant in the country for decades, there is a need to better understand the magnitude of yield loss due to water limitation and how far from yield potential current yields are. In this context, the main objective of this study was to estimate the current yield gap of rainfed alfalfa in the US. We collected 10 year (2009-2018) county-level government-reported yield and weather data from 393 counties within 12 major US rainfed alfalfa producing states and delineated alfalfa growing season using probabilistic approaches based on temperature thresholds for crop development. We then calculated county-level growing season rainfall (GSR), which was plotted against county-level yield to determine attainable yield (Ya) using frontier function analysis, and water-limited potential yield (Yw) using boundary function analysis. Average and potential water use efficiencies (WUE) were estimated, and associated yield gap referring to attainable (YGa) or water-limited yields (YGw) were calculated. Finally, we used conditional inference trees (CIT) to identify major weather-related yield-limiting factors to alfalfa forage yield. The frontier model predicted a mean Ya of 9.6 ± 1.5 Mg ha-1 and an associated optimum GSR of 670 mm, resulting in a mean YGa of 34%. The boundary function suggested a mean Yw of 15.3 ± 3 Mg ha-1 at the mean GSR of 672 ± 153 mm, resulting in a mean yield gap of 58%. The potential alfalfa WUE was 30 kg ha-1 mm-1 with associated minimum water losses of 24% of mean GSR, which was three times greater than the mean WUE of 10 kg ha-1 mm-1. The CIT suggested that GSR and minimum temperature in the season were the main yield-limiting weather variables in rainfed alfalfa production in the US. Our study also revealed that alfalfa was only limited by water availability in 21% of the environments. Thus, future research on management practices to narrow yield gaps at current levels of water supply is necessary.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Here, we aimed to assemble genomes of C. edulis and C. indica at the chromosome level to generate a reference genome for the Cannaceae family. We also comparatively analyzed the genomes of C. edulis and C. indica and examined the molecular mechanisms responsible for the remarkable differences in plant characteristics in C. edulis varieties. Our results indicated that genome-wide duplication events had recently occurred in C. edulis and C. indica. The comparative analysis of the genomes of C. edulis and C. indica revealed that C. edulis exhibited a remarkable level of replication of genes in the starch and sucrose metabolic pathways, especially during sucrose hydrolysis. This finding is consistent with the fact that the starch content of the C. edulis tuber is higher than that of C. indica. Simplified genome re-sequencing revealed the population structure of 241 C. edulis genes, and a genome-wide association study of leaf traits revealed the location of key genes related to leaf color and morphology.

"1354",35968135,"Effects of water levels on plant traits and nitrogen use efficiency in monoculture and intercropped artificial grasslands.","Water availability is the main factor affecting the forage productivity of artificial grasslands, particularly in semi-arid regions. Generally, intercropping of gramineous grass and leguminous grass can achieve high productivity. However, how different water availability levels affect the productivity of intercropping system remains unclear. Here, we conducted a 3-year (2015-2017) study by manipulating the water conditions (CK equivalent to the annual precipitation, +50% treatment equivalent to 50% increase over the average precipitation, and -50% treatment equivalent to 50% decrease over the average precipitation) to explore the responses of plant traits, nitrogen use efficiency, and biomass of the monoculture of Medicago sativa (a leguminous grass, M.s), monoculture of Elymus nutans (a gramineous grass, E.n), and intercropping of M.s and E.n in a semi-arid region in Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that the biomass obtained by intercropping of M.s and E.n decreased by 24.4% in -50% treatment compared to the CK treatment, while that of the monoculture of M.s decreased by 34.4% under the -50% treatment compared to the CK treatment. However, there was no significant difference in the biomass between intercropping artificial grassland and monoculture M. sativa under +50% treatment. Compared to monoculture, M.s can obtain more nitrogen by biological nitrogen fixation and decrease the proportion of nitrogen absorbed from soils under intercropping in the same water conditions. Under the intercropping system, the proportions of nitrogen absorbed from soils by M.s were 87.4%, 85.1, and 76.9% in -50%, CK, and +50% treatments, respectively. Under monoculture, these proportions were 91.9, 89.3, and 82.3% in -50%, CK, and +50% treatments, respectively. Plant trait, but not soil nitrogen content, was the main regulator for the productivity responses to water level changes. Our results highlight that intercropping can achieve higher productivity in both dry and wet conditions. Therefore, considering the fluctuating rainfall events in the future, it might be useful to alter the proportions of intercropped forage species in an artificial grassland to obtain optimal productivity by reducing the limitations of nitrogen availability. However, the economic viability of intercropping M. sativa and E. nutans should be evaluated in the future.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Variable illumination conditions and different occlusion states are some of the essential issues that must be addressed for the accurate detection and localization of citrus in the orchard environment. In this paper, a novel method for the detection and localization of mature citrus using improved You Only Look Once (YOLO) v5s with binocular vision is proposed. First, a new loss function (polarity binary cross-entropy with logit loss) for YOLO v5s is designed to calculate the loss value of class probability and objectness score, so that a large penalty for false and missing detection is applied during the training process. Second, to recover the missing depth information caused by randomly overlapping background participants, Cr-Cb chromatic mapping, the Otsu thresholding algorithm, and morphological processing are successively used to extract the complete shape of the citrus, and the kriging method is applied to obtain the best linear unbiased estimator for the missing depth value. Finally, the citrus spatial position and posture information are obtained according to the camera imaging model and the geometric features of the citrus. The experimental results show that the recall rates of citrus detection under non-uniform illumination conditions, weak illumination, and well illumination are 99.55%, 98.47%, and 98.48%, respectively, approximately 2-9% higher than those of the original YOLO v5s network. The average error of the distance between the citrus fruit and the camera is 3.98 mm, and the average errors of the citrus diameters in the 3D direction are less than 2.75 mm. The average detection time per frame is 78.96 ms. The results indicate that our method can detect and localize citrus fruits in the complex environment of orchards with high accuracy and speed.

Cadmium (Cd) affects the quality of S. miltiorrhiza, posing serious threats to human health. To reveal the metabolic mechanisms of S. miltiorrhiza's resistance to Cd stress, metabolite changes in S. miltiorrhiza roots treated with 0 (CK), 25 (T1), 50 (T2) and 100 (T3) mg kg-1 Cd by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were investigated. A total of 305 metabolites were identified, and most of them were amino acids, organic acids and fatty acids, which contributed to the discrimination of CK from the Cd-treated groups. Among them, S. miltiorrhiza mainly upregulated o-tyrosine, chorismate and eudesmic acid in resistance to 25 mg kg-1 Cd; DL-tryptophan, L-aspartic acid, L-proline and chorismite in resistance to 50 mg kg-1 Cd; and L-proline, L-serine, L-histidine, eudesmic acid, and rosmarinic acid in resistance to 100 mg kg-1 Cd.

Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, isoquinoline alkaloid, betalain, aminoacyl-tRNA, and tyrosine metabolism were the significantly enriched metabolic pathways and the most important pathways involved in the Cd resistance of S. miltiorrhiza. These data elucidated the crucial metabolic mechanisms involved in S. miltiorrhiza Cd resistance and the crucial metabolites that could be used to improve resistance to Cd stress in medicinal plant breeding.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1357",35968143,"The primary function of Six5 of Fusarium oxysporum is to facilitate Avr2 activity by together manipulating the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata.","Pathogens produce effector proteins to manipulate their hosts. While most effectors act autonomously, some fungal effectors act in pairs and rely on each other for function. During the colonization of the plant vasculature, the root-infecting fungus Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) produces 14 so-called Secreted in Xylem (SIX) effectors. Two of these effector genes, Avr2 (Six3) and Six5, form a gene pair on the pathogenicity chromosome of the tomato-infecting Fo strain. Avr2 has been shown to suppress plant defense responses and is required for full pathogenicity. Although Six5 and Avr2 together manipulate the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata to facilitate cell-to-cell movement of Avr2, it is unclear whether Six5 has additional functions as well. To investigate the role of Six5, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing Six5. Notably, increased susceptibility during the early stages of infection was observed in these Six5 lines, but only to Fo strains expressing Avr2 and not to wild-type Arabidopsis-infecting Fo strains lacking this effector gene. Furthermore, neither PAMP-triggered defense responses, such as ROS accumulation and callose deposition upon treatment with Flg22, necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like protein (NLP), or chitosan, nor susceptibility to other plant pathogens, such as the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae or the fungus Verticilium dahlia, were affected by Six5 expression. Further investigation of the ability of the Avr2/Six5 effector pair to manipulate plasmodesmata (PD) revealed that it not only permits cell-to-cell movement of Avr2, but also facilitates the movement of two additional effectors, Six6 and Six8. Moreover, although Avr2/Six5 expands the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata (i.e., gating) to permit the movement of a 2xFP fusion protein (53 kDa), a larger variant, 3xFP protein (80 kDa), did not move to the neighboring cells. The PD manipulation mechanism employed by Avr2/Six5 did not involve alteration of callose homeostasis in these structures. In conclusion, the primary function of Six5 appears to function together with Avr2 to increase the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata by an unknown mechanism to facilitate cell-to-cell movement of Fo effectors.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The Sclerotinia disease (SD) caused by the soil-borne fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating disease affecting most oil crops such as Brassica napus. Here, we identified 130 legume lectin (LegLu) genes in B. napus, which could be phylogenetically classified into seven clusters. The BnLegLu gene family has been significantly expanded since the whole-genome duplication (WGD) or segmental duplication. Gene structure and conserved motif analysis suggested that the BnLegLu genes were well conserved in each cluster. Moreover, relative to those genes only containing the legume lectin domain in cluster VI-VII, the genes in cluster I-V harbored a transmembrane domain and a kinase domain linked to the legume lectin domain in the C terminus. The expression of most BnLegLu genes was relatively low in various tissues. Thirty-five BnLegLu genes were responsive to abiotic stress, and 40 BnLegLu genes were strongly induced by S. sclerotiorum, with a most significant up-regulation of 715-fold, indicating their functional roles in SD resistance. Four BnLegLu genes were located in the candidate regions of genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) results which resulted from a worldwide rapeseed population consisting of 324 accessions associated with SD. Among them, the positive role of BnLegLus-16 in SD resistance was validated by transient expression in tobacco leaves.

In this study, the yield of this anticancer agent in Taxus baccata cell suspensions was improved 11-fold after elicitation with coronatine (COR) compared to the untreated cells, and 18-fold when co-supplemented with methyl-β-cyclodextrins (β-CDs). In the dual treatment, the release of taxanes from the producer cells was greatly enhanced, with 81.6% of the total taxane content being found in the medium at the end of the experiment. The experimental conditions that caused the highest PTX production also induced its maximum excretion, and increased the expression of taxane biosynthetic genes, especially the flux-limiting BAPT and DBTNBT. The application of COR, which activates PTX biosynthesis, together with β - CDs, which form inclusion complexes with PTX and related taxanes, is evidently an efficient strategy for enhancing PTX production and release to the culture medium. Due to the recently described role of lipid droplets (LDs) in the trafficking and accumulation of hydrophobic taxanes in Taxus spp. cell cultures, the structure, number and taxane storage capacity of these organelles was also studied. In elicited cultures, the number of LDs increased and they mainly accumulated taxanes with a side chain, especially PTX. Thus, PTX constituted up to 50-70% of the total taxanes found in LDs throughout the experiment in the COR + β - CD-treated cultures.

The Halo-tolerant Bacillus thuringiensis PM25 demonstrated distinct salinity tolerance and enhance plant growth-promoting activities under salinity stress. Antibiotic-resistant Iturin C (ItuC) and bio-surfactant-producing (sfp and srfAA) genes that confer biotic and abiotic stresses were also amplified in B. thuringiensis PM25. Under salinity stress, the physiological and molecular processes were followed by the over-expression of stress-related genes (APX and SOD) in B. thuringiensis PM25. The results detected that B. thuringiensis PM25 inoculation substantially improved phenotypic traits, chlorophyll content, radical scavenging capability, and relative water content under salinity stress. Under salinity stress, the inoculation of B. thuringiensis PM25 significantly increased antioxidant enzyme levels in inoculated maize as compared to uninoculated plants. In addition, B. thuringiensis PM25-inoculation dramatically increased soluble sugars, proteins, total phenols, and flavonoids in maize as compared to uninoculated plants. The inoculation of B. thuringiensis PM25 significantly reduced oxidative burst in inoculated maize under salinity stress, compared to uninoculated plants.

In this study, 40 EgrGLK genes in the Eucalyptus grandis genome were identified and divided into seven groups based on the gene structure and motif composition. The EgrGLK genes were mapped to 11 chromosomes and the distribution of genes on chromosome was uneven. Phylogenetic analysis of GLK proteins between E. grandis and other species provided information for the high evolutionary conservation of GLK genes among different species. Prediction of cis-regulatory elements indicated that the EgrGLK genes were involved in development, light response, and hormone response. Based on the finding that the content of chlorophyll in mature leaves was the highest, and leaf chlorophyll content of triploid Eucalyptus urophylla was higher than that of the diploid control, EgrGLK expression pattern in leaves of triploid and diploid E. urophylla was examined by means of transcriptome analysis. Differential expression of EgrGLK genes in leaves of E. urophylla of different ploidies was consistent with the trend in chlorophyll content. To further explore the relationship between EgrGLK expression and chlorophyll synthesis, co-expression networks were generated, which indicated that EgrGLK genes may have a positive regulatory relationship with chlorophyll synthesis. In addition, three EgrGLK genes that may play an important role in chlorophyll synthesis were identified in the co-expression networks. And the prediction of miRNAs targeting EgrGLK genes showed that miRNAs might play an important role in the regulation of EgrGLK gene expression.

We present a detailed analysis of in situ observations of O3 and NO x to (1) disentangle the main processes propelling O3 formation such as precursor emissions and meteorology and (2) quantify the impact of NO x reductions and (3) estimate the effect of climate warming. The temperature sensitivity of surface O3 production is assessed separately for NO x and VOC limited regimes. The temperature sensitivity of ozone increases with temperature in spring and summer. On average, the evaluated absolute values of the sensitivities are a factor of 2.5 larger in summer than in spring. The analysis of ambient O3 burdens during hot summers indicates that rising temperatures in a warming climate might largely offset the benefit of future emission reductions. MAX-DOAS formaldehyde (HCHO) measurements in Vienna from 2017 to 2019 are used as a proxy for VOC emissions. The seasonal and the temperature dependence of the observed HCHO mixing ratios indicate that biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) are the dominant source of hydrocarbons in the urban setting during the ozone season. The result agrees well with VOC emission estimates that show BVOCs to be the dominant VOC source in Austria since the early 2000s. Accordingly, anthropogenic NO x emission reductions remain, outside of urban cores, the most effective instrument for policymakers to lower surface ozone concentrations in the short term.","misc","christiaan","misc"

As residential PV enters more risk-averse customer segments, broader deployment of residential PV depends on overcoming both financial and informational barriers to adoption. Fast-changing residential PV technologies and associated policies means there is both lack of information and often misinformation among customers-gaps that are addressed effectively with local, trusted information networks, especially for big-ticket items such as residential PV. Here, we use an extensively validated agent-based model of residential PV adoption to analyze the effectiveness of different information intervention designs in spurring PV diffusion. We show that intervention designs are effective when they balance long-distance connections and local reinforcement, matching the intervention to both the informational needs of potential adopters and the structure of the underlying network.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1366",35968274,"Tension-type headache and low back pain reconsidered.","The natural history and clinical course of tension-type headache and non-specific low back pain are reconsidered. By closer examination, these two conditions appear to share several specific clinical features. Both are muscular pain conditions along the spine, they have a preponderance in women, they may occur spontaneously or follow a trivial traumatic incident, and they both have a high risk of chronicity. The affected muscles are tender with tender points. EMG indicates diffuse hyperactivity and abnormal activation pattern, and motor control of the affected muscles and adjacent muscle groups is discoordinated. These shared features suggest analogous pathophysiology involving the neuromotor control of affected and adjacent muscle groups in the cervical and lumbar regions, respectively. As recently suggested for the whiplash disease, we suggest the term spinal dyssynergia for this specific pattern of pathology. This suggestion provides a new perspective for the understanding of these diseases by placing their cause within the central nervous system and not in the spine or spinal musculature. This perspective warrants further clinical, neurophysiological, and neuropharmacological studies of this 'family' of common yet poorly understood clinical muscular pain conditions along the spine.","misc","christiaan","misc"

However, data are limited for the effect of comorbid AF on procedural and clinical outcomes of acute basilar artery occlusion (ABAO) after MT. This study aimed to investigate the effect of atrial fibrillation on outcomes after MT and long-term ischemic recurrence in patients with ABAO. We performed a registered study of the Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion Study (BASILAR, which is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, http://www.chictr.org.cn; ChiCTR1800014759) from January 2014 to May 2019, which included 647 patients who underwent MT for ABAO, 136 of whom had comorbid AF. Prospectively defined baseline characteristics, procedural outcomes, and clinical outcomes were reported and compared. On multivariate analysis, AF predicted a shorter puncture-to-recanalization time, higher first-pass effect rate, and lower incidence of angioplasty and/or stenting (p < 0.01). AF had no effect on intracranial hemorrhage incidence [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.093; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.451-2.652], 90-day functional outcomes (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.915; 95% CI, 0.588-1.424), or mortality (aOR, 0.851; 95% CI, 0.491-1.475) after MT. The main findings were robust in the subgroup and 1-year follow-up analyses. Comorbid AF was the remaining predictor of ischemic recurrence (aOR, 4.076; 95% CI, 1.137-14.612). The study revealed no significant difference in the safety and efficacy of MT for ABAO regardless of whether patients had comorbid AF. However, a higher proportion of patients with AF experienced ischemic recurrence within 1 year after MT.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Fatigue is one of the most common and disabling symptom of MS. It interferes with daily activities on the level of cognition and motor endurance. Motor fatigue can either result from lesions in cortical networks or motor pathways (primary fatigue) or it may be a consequence of detraining with subsequent adaptions of muscle and autonomic function. Programmed exercise interventions are used frequently to increase physical fitness in MS-patients. Studies investigating the effects of training on aerobic capacity, objective endurance and perceived fatigability have yielded heterogenous results, most likely due to the heterogeneity of interventions and patients, but probably also due to the non-uniform pathophysiology of fatigability among MS-patients. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the pathophysiology of motor fatigability with special reference to the basic exercise physiology that underlies our understanding of both pathogenesis and treatment interventions.","misc","christiaan","misc"

PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically reviewed. The primary outcomes were the success rate and the access-related complications of deploying FD via TRA. Meta-analysis was performed using a random or fixed effect model based on heterogeneity. And the publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42021244448. Data from 8 studies met inclusion criteria (250 non-duplicated patients). The success rate was 93% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.98; I 2 = 61.05%; p = 0.01). The access-related complications rate was 1% (95% CI 0-0.03; I 2 = 0.00%; p < 0.01). The mainly access-related complications included radial artery spasm (85.7%) and radial artery occlusion (14.3%). The TRA convert to transfemoral approach (TFA) was 7% (95% CI 0.02-0.14; I 2 = 61.05%; p = 0.01). Although TFA is still the main access for FD in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, the TRA also has a higher success rate and lower access-related complications rate. With the improvement of future experience and equipment, the TRA may become the main access for FD which has more advantages.

We retrospectively analyzed neurological ICU patients from November 2018 to November 2021. We used 3-month mortality as the outcome. Prediction models were created using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based on QEEG parameters, APACHEII score, and clinically relevant features. Additionally, we compared our best models with APACHEII score and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The DeLong test was carried out to compare the ROC curves in different models. A total of 110 patients were included and divided into a training set (n=80) and a validation set (n = 30). The best performing model had an AUC of 0.85 in the training set and an AUC of 0.82 in the validation set, which were better than that of GCS (training set 0.64, validation set 0.61). Models in which we selected only the 4 best QEEG parameters had an AUC of 0.77 in the training set and an AUC of 0.71 in the validation set, which were similar to that of APACHEII (training set 0.75, validation set 0.73).

Seventy-four stroke patients and 237 healthy controls were prospectively included. We measured urinary epinephrine (E), noradrenaline (NE), dopamine (DA) and cortisol (F) on days 1, 3, and 5 after stroke onset and plasma F, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyrotropin (TSH), prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth hormone (GH). The correlation between these hormone levels and 90-day prognosis was analyzed, their value in assessing prognosis was compared with lesion volume and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and their correlation with conventional clinical variables was assessed. Levels of F, 24-h urinary free cortisol(UFC), E, NE, DA, and GH on days 1, 3, and 5 were significantly higher in stroke patients than in controls (P < 0.01), while ACTH and TSH decreased, gradually approaching normal within 5 days of onset. Levels of E, NE, F, and 24-h UFC were proportional to severity, and all gradually decreased within 5 days of onset in patients with a good prognosis and gradually increased or remained high in those with a poor prognosis. After adjustment for age, sex, NIHSS, or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, F > 13.6 μg/dL, ACTH > 22.02 pg/mL and NE > 123.5 μg/ 24 h were identified as risk factors for a poor prognosis 90 days after stroke (P < 0.05). The combination of F, ACTH, NE, white blood cell count (WBC), glucose (Glu), and hemoglobin (Hb) was significantly more accurate than lesion volume (AUC: 0.931 vs. 0.694 P = 0.019) and NIHSS score (AUC: 0.931 vs. 0.746 P = 0.034) in predicting poor prognosis of stroke 1 day after onset.

Blood samples were collected from a cubital vein and CGRP plasma levels measured using ELISA. CGRP levels varied significantly between the subjects at baseline (15.48-1,889.31 pg/ml) but were neither associated with socio-demographic data nor with headache/migraine frequency or intensity collected before hypoxic exposure. CGRP levels during hypoxia fluctuated around baseline and increased with prolonged hypoxia but did not differ significantly in subjects with migraine or headache compared to those without. However, subjects experiencing migraine without aura showed significantly higher levels than those with aura. Ictal CGRP levels were increased in females, in subjects with a negative family history regarding headaches, in those older than 30 years of age or with a recent headache attack before the experiment (p < 0.05).

Three online databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase) were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials. A total of 45 studies (combined n = 2064) were included. Random effects model was used for meta-analysis and effect size was reported as standardized mean difference (SMD). rTMS was effective in improving fine motor function in stroke patients (SMD, 0.38; 95% CI 0.19-0.58; P = 0). On subgroup analyses, for post-stroke functional improvement of the upper extremity, bilateral hemisphere stimulation was more effective than unilateral stimulation during the acute phase of stroke, and a regimen of 20 rTMS sessions produced greater improvement than <20 sessions. In the subacute phase of stroke, affected hemispheric stimulation with a 40-session rTMS regimen was superior to unaffected hemispheric stimulation or bilateral hemispheric stimulation with <40 sessions. Unaffected site stimulation with a 10-session rTMS regimen produced significant improvement in the chronic phase compared to affected side stimulation and bilateral stimulation with >10 rTMS sessions. For the rTMS stimulation method, both TBS and rTMS were found to be significantly more effective in the acute phase of stroke, but TBS was more effective than rTMS. However, rTMS was found to be more effective than TBS stimulation in patients in the subacute and chronic phases of stroke. rTMS significantly improved upper limb and fine function in the short term (0-1-month post-intervention) and medium term (2-5 months), but not for upper limb function in the long term (6 months+). The results should be interpreted with caution due to significant heterogeneity. This updated meta-analysis provides robust evidence of the efficacy of rTMS treatment in improving upper extremity and fine function during various phases of stroke. https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2022-5-0121/, identifier: INPLASY202250121.","meta_analysis","christiaan","meta_analysis"

We rated markers of cSVD (white matter hyperintensities, enlarged perivascular spaces, lacunes and cerebral microbleeds) and calculated the composite score as a measure of the total cSVD burden. Perihematomal edema formation was measured using the edema extension distance (EED). We assessed the association between the cSVD burden and the EED using a multivariable linear regression model adjusting for age, (log-transformed) ICH volume, ICH location (lobar vs. non-lobar), and interval between symptom onset and MRI. We included 85 patients (mean age 63.5 years, 75.3% male). Median interval between symptom onset and MRI imaging was 6 days (IQR 1-19).

Brain regions activated by ST36 acupuncture were systematically evaluated and subjected to seed-based d mapping meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted on control procedures, manual acupuncture, electrical acupuncture (EA), and acupuncture-specific activations. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the effects of needle retention time on brain activities following ST36 acupuncture stimulation. The activated brain regions were further decoded and mapped on large-scale functional networks to further decipher the clinical relevance of acupuncturing at ST36. A total of sixteen studies, involving a total of 401 right-handed healthy participants, that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included in the present meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncturing on ST36 positively activates the opercular part of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG.R), left superior temporal gyrus (STG.L), and right median cingulate/paracingulate gyri (MCG.R) regions. Needle retention time in an acupuncture session positively correlates with the activation of the left olfactory cortex, as shown in meta-regression analysis. Subgroup analysis revealed that EA stimulation may be a source of heterogeneity in the pooled results. Functional network mappings showed that the activated areas were mapped to the auditory network and salience network. Further functional decoding analysis showed that acupuncture on ST36 was associated with pain, secondary somatosensory, sound and language processing, and mood regulation. Acupuncture at ST36 in healthy individuals positively activates the opercular part of IFG.R, STG.L, and MCG.R. The left olfactory cortex may exhibit positive needle retention time-dependent activities.

To fully understand the importance of this post-transcriptional modification in HCC, a thorough investigation that combines different patterns of RNA methylation is urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the regulators of the three most common types of RNA methylation: m6A, N1-methyladenosine (m1A) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C). Based on the genomic and proteomic data, we constructed a classifier consisting of seven RNA methylation regulators. This classifier performed well and robustly predicted the prognosis of HCC patients. By analysis using this classifier, we found that the primary bile acid biosynthesis pathway was mostly downregulated in high-risk HCC patients. Furthermore, we found that the gene expression patterns regulated by several bile acids were similar to those regulated by some well-defined anti-tumor compounds, indicating that bile acid metabolism plays a crucial role in the progression of HCC, and the related metabolites can be used as the potential agents for HCC treatments. Moreover, our study revealed a crosstalk between RNA methylation and bile acid regulators, demonstrating a novel mechanism of the downregulation of bile acid metabolism in HCC and providing new insights into how RNA methylation regulators affect the oncogenesis of HCC.","misc","christiaan","misc"

However, only a subset of patients initially benefits from these inhibitors, and increasing clinical experience indicates that in a substantial proportion of initial responders, lethal secondary resistance ultimately develops months or years later. In this paper we evaluated combination therapy with a Phase 1 oncolytic adenovirus called AdAPT-001, armed with a TGF-β trap that binds to and neutralizes the immunosuppressive cytokine, TGF-β, and a checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD-L1, in PD-L1 resistant tumors. The study, which was performed in an immunocompetent syngeneic ADS-12 mouse model, demonstrated that the combination of AdAPT-001 with PD-L1 blockade reversed PD-L1 resistance, potentially representing a future paradigm shift for patients that are primarily or secondarily resistant to checkpoint inhibitors.","rodent","christiaan","misc"
"1386",35968326,"Overexpression of glucocorticoid receptor promotes the poor progression and induces cisplatin resistance through p38 MAP kinase in cervical cancer patients.","Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is activated by synthetic glucocorticoid or endogenous cortisol which were released by the physical and psychosocial stress, and recent studies reported that it is involved in tumor initiation and metastasis in various solid cancers. However, role of GR in cervical cancer has not been elucidated yet. Therefore, here we aim to unveil the role of GR in cervical cancer with cervical cancer clinical specimen and cervical cancer cell lines. We found that overexpression of GR was associated with poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients. Also, GR knockdown in cervical cancer cell lines showed diminished proliferation, invasion and EMT properties. Besides, we found that GR was positively associated with FoxP3 expression, and combination of GR and FoxP3 overexpression revealed as more reliable biomarker for poor prognosis and poor response to chemotherapy of cervical cancer patient than GR alone. Moreover, FACS-based Annexin-V/PI double staining and cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) showed that siGR enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis, which was mediated by p38 MAP kinase. Collectively, our findings established that the combination of high GR and FoxP3 was associated with cervical cancer progression and platinum resistance, suggesting a potential predictive biomarker for clinical management in patients with cervical cancer.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1387",35968330,"Early increase of plasma soluble VEGFR-2 is associated with clinical benefit from second-line treatment of paclitaxel and ramucirumab in advanced gastric cancer.","Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel is considered the standard of care in the second-line treatment of gastric carcinoma (GC). The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), VEGF-D, and circulating soluble VEGF receptor-2 (sVEGFR-2) as possible markers of resistance or response to ramucirumab administered with paclitaxel in pretreated metastatic GC patients. Plasma samples were collected at different time points (on days 1 and 15 of the first 3 cycles, at best radiologic response and at disease progression). VEGF-A, VEGF-D and sVEGFR-2 were analysed by ELISA. Correlations of biomarker baseline levels or dynamic changes with outcome measures were assessed. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint of the study. Forty-one patients were enrolled. VEGF-A and VEGF-D, but not sVEGFR-2, values significantly increased during treatment compared to baseline (P < 0.001). A positive correlation between VEGF-A and sVEGFR-2 at cycle 2 was found (P=0.045). At univariate analysis, higher baseline levels of VEGF-A were associated with worse OS (P=0.015). Early increase of sVEGFR-2 levels after the first treatment cycle was the only factor associated with longer PFS (6.6 vs. 3.6 months, P=0.049) and OS (18.6 vs. 5.2 months, P=0.008). Significance of sVEGFR-2 early increase was retained at multivariate analysis for OS (HR 0.32; 95% CI 0.12-0.91; P=0.032). The reported results confirmed the prognostic role of baseline VEGF-A and, with the limitations of the limited sample size and the lack of a control arm, suggested that the early increase of sVEGFR-2 after 1 cycle of treatment could be a potential predictive biomarker of benefit from second-line ramucirumab plus paclitaxel in GC.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1388",35968331,"CDC20 is a novel biomarker for improved clinical predictions in epithelial ovarian cancer.","Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), a common tumor of the female reproductive system, ranks first in fatalities among gynecological malignancies. Most patients find tumors at late stage and have extremely poor prognoses, which necessitates improvements in early detection. This study applied bioinformatic methods to identify potential biomarkers of EOC. First, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and hub genes, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The network of hub genes was analyzed using GeneMANIA, and an analysis of biological processes was constructed with BINGO. Lastly, hub genes were analyzed for EOC-related oncology using the Oncomine and TCGA databases, and the cBioPortal online platform. Overall, cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) was identified as a key gene in EOC. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to silence CDC20 to explore its effects on EOC cell proliferation, apoptosis and SRY-related HMG-box 2 (SOX2) expression. DEGs were enriched in pathways related to cell cycle signaling, cancer, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, Wnt signaling and P53 signaling. Analysis revealed high expression of CDC20 in EOC tissues and a correlation with histology and tumor grade. CDC20 levels are highest in serous adenocarcinoma, when compared to ovarian clear cell carcinoma, ovarian endometrioid carcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma. High CDC20 expression within the tumor is associated with poor EOC prognosis. After silencing CDC20, EOC cell proliferation and migration decreased, apoptosis increased, and SOX2 expression decreased. In conclusion, CDC20 is likely a key biomarker of EOC and may act as an upstream regulator of SOX2 to mediate the SOX2 signaling in the progression of EOC. Future application of CDC20 analysis to early detection may improve prognosis, and it has the potential to be a therapeutic target.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Compared to 2D laparoscopy, 3D laparoscopy provides better depth perception of the surgical field and hand-eye coordination to achieve better outcomes. We compared the performance of 2D and 3D laparoscopy on preserving urogenital and anorectal function in TME+ANP surgery for rectal cancer using propensity-score matching. Data were collected from consecutive male patients who underwent 3D or 2D laparoscopic TME+ANP for primary RC at our institution between March 2012 and December 2020. The primary outcome was sexual and urinary function 1 year after surgery. A total of 450 male patients were eligible. After 1:1 matching, 146 cases were included in each group for analysis. One year after surgery, the prevalence of sexual dysfunction (International Index of Erectile Function score <26) was 8.22% in the 3D laparoscopic group and 44.52% in the 2D laparoscopic group, respectively (P=0.000) and a significant difference in the incidence of urinary retention was observed (n=3 and 24, respectively (P=0.000)). Moreover, blood loss, operative time, duration of hospital stay, and the time to first flatus in the 3D laparoscopic group were significantly less than in the 2D laparoscopic group. In conclusion, 3D laparoscopic TME is associated with lower incidences of postoperative sexual and urinary dysfunction than 2D laparoscopic TME for rectal cancer in male patients.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

These patients are treated with selective ER down regulators (SERDs) such as the ERα antagonist fulvestrant. Previous studies show that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors downregulate ERα and since some dietary derived short chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate and acetate) exhibit HDAC inhibitory activity we investigated their effects as SERDs in MCF-7 and T47D cells expressing wild-type and mutant ERα-D538G and ERα-Y537S. The SCFAs exhibited SERD-like activity in both cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant ERα. The results for propionate and butyrate correlated with parallel induction of histone acetylation and this was also observed for the HDAC inhibitors Panobinostat, Vorinostat and Entinostat which also downregulated wild-type and mutant ERα and induced histone acetylation. Although acetate induced ERα degradation the mechanisms may be independent of the HDAC inhibitory activity of this compound. These results suggest that high fibre diets that induce formation of SCFAs may have some clinical efficacy for treating ER-positive endocrine resistant breast cancer patients and this is currently being investigated.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Systemic inflammation participates in the development and progression of cancer; therefore, inflammatory and/or immunological response markers such as the neutrophil/lymphocyte index (NLI) can aid us in predicting the poor results of our interventions. The purpose of our study was to determine the impact of an NLI of ≥2.6 as a predictor of early postsurgical complications. By means of a prospective cohort, we analyzed 158 patients with CRC who were submitted to elective surgery with a later 30-day follow-up. We found that the preoperatory NLI of ≥2.6 obtained an odds ratio (OR) = 2.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-4.36) as a prognostic factor of early postsurgical complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification scale, which represents a low prognostic impact due to its predictive yield with low accuracy, which is the opposite of what other reports have previously published.

In the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for effective therapeutics and vaccine development. According to recent studies, disulfiram can act as a potent SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibitor by targeting multiple SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins to inhibit viral polyprotein cleavage and RNA replication. Currently, disulfiram is under evaluation in phase II clinical trials to treat COVID-19. With more and more variants of the SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, it becomes critical to know whether disulfiram can also inhibit viral entry into host cells for various variants and replication inhibition. Here, molecular and cellular biology assays demonstrated that disulfiram could interrupt viral spike protein binding with its receptor ACE2. By using the viral pseudo-particles (Vpps) of SARS-CoV-2, disulfiram also showed the potent activity to block viral entry in a cell-based assay against Vpps of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. We further established a live virus model system to support the anti-viral entry activity of disulfiram with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Molecular docking revealed how disulfiram hindered the binding between the ACE2 and wild-type or mutated spike proteins. Thus, our results indicate that disulfiram has the capability to block viral entry activity of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Together with its known anti-replication of SARS-CoV-2, disulfiram may serve as an effective therapy against different SARS-CoV-2 variants.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1393",35968343,"Gentian violet induces apoptosis and ferroptosis via modulating p53 and MDM2 in hepatocellular carcinoma.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancies with limited curative options and poor prognosis. Gentian violet (GV) has recently been found to have anti-tumor properties with promising clinical applications. However, its anti-tumor effect and the underlying functional mechanisms in HCC have not been investigated. In this study, we found that GV induced ferroptosis and apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner in vitro, and significantly attenuated the growth of HCC in vivo. Both ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostain-1 (Fer-1) and apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-KFM (Z-VAD) partially attenuated GV-induced growth-inhibitory effects, while combined treatment of Fer-1 and Z-VAD completely abolished GV's activities. Increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected after GV treatment. Interestingly, GV elevated the expression levels of both p53 and its negative regulator MDM2, which was dependent on the expression of the dehydrogenase/reductase protein Hep27. Simultaneously silencing both the MDM2 and p53 genes by siRNAs abolished ROS production and partially rescued the cell death induced by GV treatment. Our data demonstrate a GV-Hep27-MDM2-p53 signaling cascade that regulates ferroptosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, our findings provide insights into understanding the anti-tumor function of GV and present the basis of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HCC.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Patients with SVR had 1, 3, 5 and 10-year cumulative HCC incidence rates of 0.55%, 1.87%, 3.48% and 8.35%, respectively. A Cox proportional hazards model revealed that non-SVR (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-3.12, p = 0.008), diabetes mellitus (aHR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.25-3.55, p = 0.005), and fibrosis (FIB)-4 at the end of follow-up (EOF; aHR: 5.60, 95% CI: 2.97-10.57, p < 0.0001) were independent predictors of HCC. Risk score models based on the three predictors were developed to predict HCC according to aHR. In model 1, the 10-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 43.35% in patients at high risk (score 9-10), 25.48% in those at intermediate risk (score 6-8), and 4.06% in those at low risk (score 3-5) of HCC. In model 2, the 10-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 39.64% in patients at high risk (at least two risk predictors), 19.12% in those at intermediate risk (with one risk predictor), and 2.52% in those at low risk (without any risk predictors) of HCC.

Such cells play a key role in the initiation, development and migration of breast tumors. The properties of breast tumor stem cells are regulated by a range of intracellular and extracellular factors, including important signaling pathways, transcription factors, non-coding RNAs, and cytokines such as Hedgehog, Wnt, Notch, microRNA93, microRNA100, and IL-6. Tumor microenvironment (such as mesenchymal stem cells, macrophages and cytokines) plays an important role in the regulation of breast tumor stem cells. Using the keywords including breast cancer stem cells, signal pathway, chemotherapy tolerance, and non-coding RNA, triple negative breast cancer, inhibitors, this study retrieved the original articles and reviews published before October 3, 2021, from PubMed and WEB OF SCI database and this study performed a comprehensive review of them. After treatment, there is a correlation between the metastasis-prone nature and recurrence with breast cancer stem cells. The signaling pathway of breast cancer stem cells plays a significant role in activating the function of breast cancer cells, regulating the differentiation of breast cancer cells and controlling the division of breast cancer cells. This imbalance leads to the uncontrolled growth and development of breast cancer cells. Targeted therapy that blocks the corresponding pathway may become a new perspective for breast cancer treatment. In addition, corresponding therapeutic strategies can be used according to the expression characteristics of different molecular types of breast cancer stem cells. For ER-positive breast cancer, simultaneous endocrine therapy and targeted therapy of tumor stem cells may improve the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Trastuzumab therapy significantly reduces the risk of recurrence of HER2-positive breast cancer. For drug-resistant patients, combination therapy is required due to the different phenotypes of epithelial-mesenchymal transforming tumor stem cells. This study briefly reviews the research progress of breast cancer stem cell-related signaling pathways and their inhibitors, in order to provide a reference for breast cancer patients to obtain more effective clinical treatment.","misc","christiaan","systematic_review"

A total of 36 unresectable BTC patients treated with HAIC and PD-1 inhibitors between September 2019 and July 2021 were included in this study. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response, and adverse events (AEs) were investigated. Overall, 52.8% patients with advanced BTC were in stage IV, 23 patients who progressed after receiving PD-1 inhibitor had undergone HAIC, and 23 patients have received 2 or more lines of therapy. The median OS was 8.8 months (range: 4.0-24.0 months), and the median PFS was 3.7 months. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 11.5% and 76.9%, respectively. In the subgroup analysis, patients who treated with HAIC early without progression after immunotherapy were associated with a trend toward better OS (median 13.0 vs. 7.6 months; P = 0.004) and PFS (median 7.9 vs. 3.6 months; P = 0.09) compared to with HAIC with progression after PD-1 treatment. No treatment-related deaths occurred. A total of 44.4% of the patients experienced grade 3 or 4 AEs. We conclude that the combination of HAIC and PD-1 inhibitors is safe and effective.

Breast cancer is a major malignancy that is associated with dysregulation of the PI3K signaling pathway. PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss occur in every subtype of breast cancer. PI3K inhibitors are being evaluated in breast cancer after the success of an alpha isoform-specific PI3K inhibitor in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Some preclinical data indicate the potential for PI3K/mTOR targeting in combination with trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer with or without expression of the estrogen receptor. However, the role of this therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer with PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss remains unclear. We examined three HER2-positive, ER-negative breast cancer cell lines to determine the efficacy of a novel alpha isoform-specific PI3K inhibitor in combination with trastuzumab. The results indicated that this combination was effective in PIK3CA-mutant or PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of downstream proteins. PTEN loss by siRNA modulation in parental HER2-positive cancer cells with PI3K signaling pathway alterations could not confer resistance to alpelisib or GDC-0077 plus trastuzumab. We selected the CK-MB-1 cell line without alterations in the PI3K pathway to demonstrate that PI3K inhibitors plus trastuzumab represented a biomarker-specific treatment. In vivo effects of alpelisib plus trastuzumab were tested and confirmed in a mouse model, showing the combination strategy offered the best opportunity to achieve tumor volume reduction. With known safety profiles, this cytotoxic chemotherapy-free regimen warrants further attention as a biomarker-driven strategy for treating HER2-positive breast cancer.","misc","christiaan","misc"

One of the main challenges in myeloma therapy is acquired resistance to drugs. Several theories have been proposed to describe the mechanisms responsible for resistance to the most commonly used proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib. This study aimed to describe functional differences between sensitive myeloma cells (MM1S WT) and their daughter cell lines resistant to either bortezomib (MM1S/R BTZ) or carfilzomib (MM1S/R CFZ), as well as between both resistant cell lines. Bortezomib- and carfilzomib-resistant cell lines were successfully generated by continuous exposure to the drugs. When exposed to different drugs than during the resistance generation period, MM1S/R BTZ cells showed cross-resistance to carfilzomib, whereas MM1S/R CFZ cells were similarly sensitive to bortezomib as MM1S WT cells. Following proteomic profiling, unsupervised principal component analysis revealed that the MM1S/R BTZ and MM1S/R CFZ cell lines differed significantly from the MM1S WT cell line and from each other. Canonical pathway analysis showed similar pathways enriched in both comparisons - MM1S WT vs. MM1S/R CFZ and MM1S WT vs. MM1S/R BTZ. However, important differences were present in the statistical significance of particular pathways. Key alterations included the ubiquitin-proteasome system, metabolic pathways responsible for redox homeostasis and the unfolded protein response. In functional studies, both drugs continued to reduce chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity in resistant cells. However, the baseline activity of all three catalytic domains of the proteasome was higher in the resistant cells. Differences in generation of reactive oxygen species were identified in MM1S/R BTZ (decreased) and MM1S/CFZ cells (increased) in comparison to MM1S WT cells. Both baseline and drug-induced activity of the unfolded protein response were higher in resistant cells than in MM1S WT cells and included all three arms of this pathway: IRE1α/XBP1s, ATF6 and EIF2α/ATF4 (downstream effectors of PERK). In conclusion, contrary to some previous reports, resistant MM1S cells show upregulation of unfolded protein response activity, reflecting the heterogeneity of multiple myeloma and prompting further studies on the role of this pathway in resistance to proteasome inhibitors.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of the CX-DZ-II intelligent EA instrument for NPCS. A total of 164 patients with NPCS [mean age (SD), 49.48 (13.47) years] were randomly assigned to receive 8 sessions (over 2 weeks) EA of the intelligent electronic stimulator (CX-DZ-II) or the regular electronic stimulator (SDZ-II). The primary outcome was the change of the visual analog scale (VAS) from baseline to 2 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included mean scores of the VAS after each treatment in 1 week, responder rate, drug-usage rate of non-steroidal antipyretic analgesics (NSAAs), the occurrence rate of adverse events (AEs), proportions of apparatus with defect during treatment, and excellent rate of apparatus. The intelligent electronic stimulator (CX-DZ-II) was non-inferior to the regular electronic stimulator (SDZ-II) for changes from baseline in the VAS [3.36 vs. 3.23, with a difference of 0.17 (95% CI, -0.36 to 0.69), P < 0.025 for non-inferiority]. No between-group differences were found in outcomes of VAS in 1 week, overall responders, and drug-usage rate of NSAAs.

Chronic stroke lesions increase gradually due to the secondary neuroinflammation that occurs following acute ischemic neuronal degeneration. In this study, the ameliorating effect of a cytokine mixture consisting of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-3 was evaluated on ischemic brain injury using a rat stroke model prepared by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). The mixture reduced infarct volume and ameliorated ischemia-induced motor and cognitive dysfunctions. Sorted microglia cells from the ischemic hemisphere of rats administered the mixture showed reduced mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β at 3 days post-reperfusion. On flow cytometric analysis, the expression of CD86, a marker of pro-inflammatory type microglia, was suppressed, and the expression of CD163, a marker of tissue-repairing type microglia, was increased by the cytokine treatment. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry data showed that the cytokines increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in neurons in the ischemic lesion. Thus, the present study demonstrated that cytokine treatment markedly suppressed neurodegeneration during the chronic phase in the rat stroke model. The neuroprotective effects may be mediated by phenotypic changes of microglia that presumably lead to increased expression of Bcl-xL in ischemic lesions, while enhancing neuronal survival.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

However, the interpretation of imaging outcomes in terms of tissue pathology is still challenging. This study goes beyond the current interpretation of in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) by constructing multivariate models of quantitative tissue microstructure in status epilepticus (SE)-induced brain damage. We performed in vivo DTI and histology in rats at 79 days after SE and control animals. The analyses focused on the corpus callosum, hippocampal subfield CA3b, and layers V and VI of the parietal cortex. Comparison between control and SE rats indicated that a combination of microstructural tissue changes occurring after SE, such as cellularity, organization of myelinated axons, and/or morphology of astrocytes, affect DTI parameters. Subsequently, we constructed a multivariate regression model for explaining and predicting histological parameters based on DTI. The model revealed that DTI predicted well the organization of myelinated axons (cross-validated R = 0.876) and astrocyte processes (cross-validated R = 0.909) and possessed a predictive value for cell density (CD) (cross-validated R = 0.489). However, the morphology of astrocytes (cross-validated R > 0.05) was not well predicted. The inclusion of parameters from CA3b was necessary for modeling histopathology. Moreover, the multivariate DTI model explained better histological parameters than any univariate model. In conclusion, we demonstrate that combining several analytical and statistical tools can help interpret imaging outcomes to microstructural tissue changes, opening new avenues to improve the non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of brain tissue damage.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

However, the effects of product-background saturation combination on consumers' willingness to purchase products with different heaviness attributes (e.g., heaviness-positive products or heaviness-negative products) have not been conclusively determined. The current study demonstrated the effects of product-background saturation combination on product heaviness perception and its downstream consequences. Based on behavioral method, study 1 showed that a patch of color placed in a pale background (the saturation of the background is lower than the saturation of the color patch) was perceived as visually heavier than that in a colorful background (the saturation of the background is higher than the saturation of the color patch). Study 2 applied event-related potentials (ERPs) method to explore the underlying neural mechanisms of how the interactions between the presentation modes and the product types affect consumer decisions. Behaviorally, compared to the colorful background, the pale background would lead to a higher purchase rate for the heaviness-positive products, whereas the opposite results were found for the heaviness-negative products. Furthermore, for both the heaviness-positive and heaviness-negative products, a shorter reaction time would be observed in the pale background condition than in the colorful background condition. Neurophysiologically, the pale background would result in smaller N2 component and larger P3 component compared to the colorful background for the heaviness-positive products, while the reverse held for the heaviness-negative products. Smaller N2 component implies decreased perceptual conflicts and larger P3 component implies increased decision confidence, suggesting that e-retailers should present heaviness-positive products with pale backgrounds and heaviness-negative products with colorful backgrounds.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1404",35968373,"Computer-based musical interval training program for Cochlear implant users and listeners with no known hearing loss.","A musical interval is the difference in pitch between two sounds. The way that musical intervals are used in melodies relative to the tonal center of a key can strongly affect the emotion conveyed by the melody. The present study examines musical interval identification in people with no known hearing loss and in cochlear implant users. Pitch resolution varies widely among cochlear implant users with average resolution an order of magnitude worse than in normal hearing. The present study considers the effect of training on musical interval identification and tests for correlations between low-level psychophysics and higher-level musical abilities. The overarching hypothesis is that cochlear implant users are limited in their ability to identify musical intervals both by low-level access to frequency cues for pitch as well as higher-level mapping of the novel encoding of pitch that implants provide. Participants completed a 2-week, online interval identification training. The benchmark tests considered before and after interval identification training were pure tone detection thresholds, pure tone frequency discrimination, fundamental frequency discrimination, tonal and rhythm comparisons, and interval identification. The results indicate strong correlations between measures of pitch resolution with interval identification; however, only a small effect of training on interval identification was observed for the cochlear implant users. Discussion focuses on improving access to pitch cues for cochlear implant users and on improving auditory training for musical intervals.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Infra-slow Neurofeedback (ISF-NF) training is a recent development focusing on modulating cortical slow-wave activity to improve pain outcomes. A parallel, two-armed double-blinded, randomized sham-controlled, feasibility clinical trial aimed to determine the feasibility and safety of a novel electroencephalography-based infraslow fluctuation neurofeedback (EEG ISF-NF) training in people with KOA and determine the variability of clinical outcomes and EEG changes following NF training. Eligible participants attended nine 30-min ISF-NF training sessions involving three cortical regions linked to pain. Feasibility measures were monitored during the trial period. Pain and functional outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up after 2 weeks. Resting-state EEG was recorded at baseline and immediate post-intervention. Participants were middle-aged (61.7 ± 7.6 years), New Zealand European (90.5%), and mostly females (62%) with an average knee pain duration of 4 ± 3.4 years. The study achieved a retention rate of 91%, with 20/22 participants completing all the sessions. Participants rated high levels of acceptance and moderate to high levels of perceived effectiveness of the training. No serious adverse events were reported during the trial. Mean difference (95% CI) for clinical pain and function measures are as follows for pain severity [active: 0.89 ± 1.7 (-0.27 to 2.0); sham: 0.98 ± 1.1 (0.22-1.7)], pain interference [active: 0.75 ± 2.3 (-0.82 to 2.3); Sham: 0.89 ± 2.1 (-0.60 to 2.4)], pain unpleasantness [active: 2.6 ± 3.7 (0.17-5.1); sham: 2.8 ± 3 (0.62-5.0)] and physical function [active: 6.2 ± 13 (-2.6 to 15); sham: 1.6 ± 12 (-6.8 to 10)]. EEG sources demonstrated frequency-specific neuronal activity, functional connectivity, and ISF ratio changes following NF training. The findings of the study indicated that the ISF-NF training is a feasible, safe, and acceptable intervention for pain management in people with KOA, with high levels of perceived effectiveness. The study also reports the variability in clinical, brain activity, and connectivity changes following training.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"
"1406",35968377,"Combining electro- and magnetoencephalography data using directional archetypal analysis.","Metastable microstates in electro- and magnetoencephalographic (EEG and MEG) measurements are usually determined using modified k-means accounting for polarity invariant states. However, hard state assignment approaches assume that the brain traverses microstates in a discrete rather than continuous fashion. We present multimodal, multisubject directional archetypal analysis as a scale and polarity invariant extension to archetypal analysis using a loss function based on the Watson distribution. With this method, EEG/MEG microstates are modeled using subject- and modality-specific archetypes that are representative, distinct topographic maps between which the brain continuously traverses. Archetypes are specified as convex combinations of unit norm input data based on a shared generator matrix, thus assuming that the timing of neural responses to stimuli is consistent across subjects and modalities. The input data is reconstructed as convex combinations of archetypes using a subject- and modality-specific continuous archetypal mixing matrix. We showcase the model on synthetic data and an openly available face perception event-related potential data set with concurrently recorded EEG and MEG. In synthetic and unimodal experiments, we compare our model to conventional Euclidean multisubject archetypal analysis. We also contrast our model to a directional clustering model with discrete state assignments to highlight the advantages of modeling state trajectories rather than hard assignments. We find that our approach successfully models scale and polarity invariant data, such as microstates, accounting for intersubject and intermodal variability. The model is readily extendable to other modalities ensuring component correspondence while elucidating spatiotemporal signal variability.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1407",35968381,"The effect of photobiomodulation on the brain during wakefulness and sleep.","Over the last seventy years or so, many previous studies have shown that photobiomodulation, the use of red to near infrared light on body tissues, can improve central and peripheral neuronal function and survival in both health and in disease. These improvements are thought to arise principally from an impact of photobiomodulation on mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial mechanisms in a range of different cell types, including neurones. This impact has downstream effects on many stimulatory and protective genes. An often-neglected feature of nearly all of these improvements is that they have been induced during the state of wakefulness. Recent studies have shown that when applied during the state of sleep, photobiomodulation can also be of benefit, but in a different way, by improving the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and the clearance of toxic waste-products from the brain. In this review, we consider the potential differential effects of photobiomodulation dependent on the state of arousal. We speculate that the effects of photobiomodulation is on different cells and systems depending on whether it is applied during wakefulness or sleep, that it may follow a circadian rhythm. We speculate further that the arousal-dependent photobiomodulation effects are mediated principally through a biophoton - ultra-weak light emission - network of communication and repair across the brain.","misc","christiaan","misc"

One of the essential requirements for the digitization is to achieve accurate color reproduction. Taking the Imperial Chinese robes in the Qing Dynasty as an example, this study aims to develop a digital achieve system to digitize the robes using a high-end imaging system and accurately reproduce their color properties on a display. Currently, there has been very limited study focused on the color reproduction of silk fabrics or other textile materials. The conventional color management process using a traditional color chart, however, may not be suitable for the reproduction of silk fabrics because they have very high gloss. To address this difficulty, a unique Qianlong Palette color chart, consisting of 210 silk fabric samples, has been specifically produced for optimizing the color reproduction of silk fabrics and a color image reproduction system has been developed for the digitization and archiving of the clothing fabric for the royal court. Color characterization models using both the Qianlong Palette color chart and the traditional color chart, and different mapping methods, are compared and the model with highest accuracy used in a self-programmed interface for automatically processing textile images in the future. Finally, the digital archive system has been validated using six garments of silk fabric relics. The color differences after the color image reproduction are all less than 3.00ΔE* ab , indicating acceptable color reproduction of the system. The images after color reproduction have also been evaluated subjectively by experts from the museum and the results are considered satisfactory. Our results show that the newly designed Qianlong Palette color chart exhibits superior performance over the conventional color chart in effectively predicting the color of the silk fabrics. The self-programmed graphical user interface for image color management can serve as a powerful tool to truly reproduce the color of various silk fabric relics in museums in the future and digitally archive those valuable cultural relics for different uses.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Although several cognitive networks have been identified, consensus still cannot be achieved on the precise borders and distribution of involved brain regions for each network, due to the multifarious use of diverse brain atlases in different studies. To address the problem, the current study proposed a novel approach to generate a fused cognitive network with the optimal performance in discriminating cognitive states by using graph learning, following the synthesization of one cognitive network defined by different brain atlases, and the construction of a hierarchical framework comprised of one main version and other supplementary versions of the specific cognitive network. As a result, the proposed method demonstrated better results compared with other machine learning methods for recognizing cognitive states, which was revealed by analyzing an fMRI dataset related to the mental arithmetic task. Our findings suggest that the fused cognitive network provides the potential to develop new mind decoding approaches.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Electroacupuncture (EA) has been recognized as a cognitive stimulation for its effects on memory disorder, but whether different brain regions or neural circuits contribute to memory recovery in AD remains unknown. Here, we found that memory deficit was ameliorated in 3×Tg-AD mice with EA-treatment, as shown by the increased number of exploring and time spent in the novel object. In addition, reduced locomotor activity was observed in 3×Tg-AD mice, but no significant alteration was seen in the EA-treated mice. Based on the functional magnetic resonance imaging, the regional spontaneous activity alterations of 3×Tg-AD were mainly concentrated in the accumbens nucleus, auditory cortex, caudate putamen, entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus, insular cortex, subiculum, temporal cortex, visual cortex, and so on. While EA-treatment prevented the chaos of brain activity in parts of the above regions, such as the auditory cortex, EC, hippocampus, subiculum, and temporal cortex. And then we used the whole-cell voltage-clamp recording to reveal the neurotransmission in the hippocampus, and found that EA-treatment reversed the synaptic spontaneous release. Since the hippocampus receives most of the projections of the EC, the hippocampus-EC circuit is one of the neural circuits related to memory impairment. We further applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tracking and functional connectivity, and found that hypo-connected between the hippocampus and EC with EA-treatment. These data indicate that the hippocampus-EC connectivity is responsible for the recognition memory deficit in the AD mice with EA-treatment, and provide novel insight into potential therapies for memory loss in AD.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Many studies focused on vitamin D as a stroke risk factor, but only a few focused on its serum level as a predictor of stroke initial clinical severity and recovery with inconsistent results. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between serum vitamin D levels and stroke clinical severity at admission and functional independence and disability at discharge in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective cohort study of adult ischemic stroke patients who had their vitamin D tested and admitted within 7 days of exhibiting stroke symptoms at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Based on vitamin D level, the patients were categorized into normal [25(OH)D serum level ≥ 75 nmol/L], insufficient [25(OH)D serum level is 50-75 nmol/L], and deficient [25(OH)D serum level ≤ 50 nmol/L]. The primary outcome was to assess the vitamin D serum level of ischemic stroke patients' clinical severity at admission and functional independence at discharge. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was used to assess the clinical severity, whereas the modified Rankin scale (mRS) was used to assess functional independence and disability. The study included 294 stroke patients, out of 774, who were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean age of the participants was 68.2 ± 13.4 years, and 49.3% were male. The patients' distribution among the three groups based on their vitamin D levels is: normal (n = 35, 11.9%), insufficient (n = 66, 22.5%), and deficient (n = 196, 65.6%). After adjusting for potential covariates, regression analysis found a significant inverse relationship of NIHSS based on 25(OH)D serum level (beta coefficient: -0.04, SE: 0.01, p = 0.003). Patients with deficient serum vitamin D level also had significantly higher odds of worse functional independence in mRS score [OR: 2.41, 95%CI: (1.13-5.16), p = 0.023] when compared to participants with normal vitamin D level. Low vitamin D levels were associated with higher severity of stroke at admission and poor functional independence and disability at discharge in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Further randomized clinical and interventional studies are required to confirm our findings.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1412",35968392,"Stress Affects Central Compensation of Neural Responses to Cochlear Synaptopathy in a cGMP-Dependent Way.","In light of the increasing evidence supporting a link between hearing loss and dementia, it is critical to gain a better understanding of the nature of this relationship. We have previously observed that following cochlear synaptopathy, the temporal auditory processing (e.g., auditory steady state responses, ASSRs), is sustained when reduced auditory input is centrally compensated. This central compensation process was linked to elevated hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). We further observed that, independently of age, central responsiveness to cochlear synaptopathy can differ, resulting in either a low or high capacity to compensate for the reduced auditory input. Lower central compensation resulted in poorer temporal auditory processing, reduced hippocampal LTP, and decreased recruitment of activity-dependent brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in hippocampal regions (low compensators). Higher central compensation capacity resulted in better temporal auditory processing, higher LTP responses, and increased activity-dependent BDNF expression in hippocampal regions. Here, we aimed to identify modifying factors that are potentially responsible for these different central responses. Strikingly, a poorer central compensation capacity was linked to lower corticosterone levels in comparison to those of high compensators. High compensators responded to repeated placebo injections with elevated blood corticosterone levels, reduced auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave I amplitude, reduced inner hair cell (IHC) ribbon number, diminished temporal processing, reduced LTP responses, and decreased activity-dependent hippocampal BDNF expression. In contrast, the same stress exposure through injection did not elevate blood corticosterone levels in low compensators, nor did it reduce IHC ribbons, ABR wave I amplitude, ASSR, LTP, or BDNF expression as seen in high compensators. Interestingly, in high compensators, the stress-induced responses, such as a decline in ABR wave I amplitude, ASSR, LTP, and BDNF could be restored through the memory-enhancing drug phosphodiesterase 9A inhibitor (PDE9i). In contrast, the same treatment did not improve these aspects in low compensators. Thus, central compensation of age-dependent cochlear synaptopathy is a glucocorticoid and cyclic guanosine-monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent neuronal mechanism that fails upon a blunted stress response.","rodent","christiaan","misc"
"1413",35968393,"Multitarget high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation improves response inhibition more than single-target high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation in healthy participants.","Prior studies have focused on single-target anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) or pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) to improve response inhibition in healthy individuals. However, the results are contradictory and the effect of multitarget anodal stimulation over both brain regions has never been investigated. The present study aimed to investigate the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of different forms of anodal high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) on improving response inhibition, including HD-tDCS over the rIFG or pre-SMA and multitarget HD-tDCS over both areas. Ninety-two healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive single-session (20 min) anodal HD-tDCS over rIFG + pre-SMA, rIFG, pre-SMA, or sham stimulation. Before and immediately after tDCS intervention, participants completed a stop-signal task (SST) and a go/nogo task (GNG). Their cortical activity was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the go/nogo task. The results showed multitarget stimulation produced a significant reduction in stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) relative to baseline. The pre-to-post SSRT change was not significant for rIFG, pre-SMA, or sham stimulation. Further analyses revealed multitarget HD-tDCS significantly decreased SSRT in both the high-performance and low-performance subgroups compared with the rIFG condition which decreased SSRT only in the low-performance subgroup. Only the multitarget condition significantly improved neural efficiency as indexed by lower △oxy-Hb after stimulation. In conclusion, the present study provides important preliminary evidence that multitarget HD-tDCS is a promising avenue to improve stimulation efficacy, establishing a more effective montage to enhance response inhibition relative to the commonly used single-target stimulation.","misc","christiaan","randomized_trial"

All consecutive patients undergoing the uniportal VATS wedge resection between January 2019 and March 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty consecutive patients in Group A underwent the uniportal VATS wedge resection without intraoperative intercostal nerve block. The other 20 consecutive patients in Group B underwent the uniportal VATS wedge resection with intraoperative intercostal nerve block. The numeric pain rating scale (NRS) scores were recorded at 1, 12, and 24 h, postoperatively. The number of opioid consumption was also recorded until the time to chest tube removal. There was no difference between groups with regard to sex, age, chest tube duration, length of stay, operative time, laterality time, and diagnosis. There was a significant difference in postoperative NRS scores at 1 h (P = 0.001) and 12 h (P = 0.022) between the groups. The opioid consumption was significantly in Group B lower than those in Group A (P = 0.025).

However, its effects on systemic inflammation and glucocorticoid responsiveness in OSA patients with asthma are largely unknown. To examine the potential role of CPAP therapy in reducing systemic inflammation and improving glucocorticoid responsiveness in asthmatic patients with OSA. A case-control study was conducted at the respiratory and sleep clinics involving patients with OSA and patients with asthma and OSA. The levels of inflammatory asthma biomarkers (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-17A, IL-8, IL-2, and interferon-γ [IFN-γ]), and glucocorticoid receptors (GR)-α and GR-β, were determined to compare systemic inflammation and glucocorticoid responsiveness between pre- and post-1-month CPAP treatment in both groups. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare inflammatory biomarkers before and after CPAP therapy. P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The analysis was performed using SPSS. Recruited patients (n = 47), 51% (n = 24) had OSA and 49% (n = 23), had OSA with asthma. Interestingly, the blood levels of IL-17 and IL-8 were significantly decreased post-CPAP therapy in OSA patients, whereas IL-4, IL-17, and IFN-γ were significantly reduced post-CPAP treatment in OSA patients with asthma. Remarkably, CPAP therapy improved glucocorticoid responsiveness in asthmatic patients with OSA, but not in the OSA group and an increase in the GR-α/GR-β ratio was noted post-CPAP therapy. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy improved responsiveness to glucocorticoid treatment and demonstrated a suppressive effect on proinflammatory cytokines in asthmatics with OSA.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

All patients underwent thin-layer computed tomography examination before the operation, and then 3D reconstruction was performed with Mimics 20.0 software. The radian and curvature of the pectus bar were designed according to the reconstructed images. Afterward, the images were imported into the light-curing 3D printer in STL format for slice printing. Hence that the personalized operation scheme, including the size of the pectus bar and the surgical approach, can be made according to the 3D printed model. The thoracoscopic-assisted Nuss operation was completed by bilateral incisions. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative hospitalization were counted and analyzed. The satisfaction of the surgery was evaluated according to the Haller index and the most posterior sternal compression sternovertebral distance. The surgeries were successfully completed in 10 patients without a transfer to open procedure. The average operation time was (56 ± 8.76) min, the intraoperative blood loss was (23.5 ± 11.07) mL, and the postoperative hospitalization was (7.2 ± 0.92) d. There were no serious complications or death during the perioperative period. Compared with the data before the operation, the most posterior sternal compression sternovertebral distance was larger, and the Haller index was lower, the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). 3D reconstruction technology combined with 3D printing, which can be used before operation, contributes to the operator performing thoracoscopic-assisted Nuss operation safely and effectively, which has productive clinical application value for the treatment of pectus excavatum.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

The distribution of defined daily costs (DDCs) of valaciclovir and famciclovir were analyzed, and trends in the median DDCs were identified. A total of 132,911 prescriptions from 49 hospitals located in six major areas of China were included in the analysis. The yearly prescriptions containing antivirals increased from 8,819 in 2010 to 16,361 in 2019. The percentage of prescriptions for patients aged 65 years and above also increased (27.7% in 2010 to 31.0% in 2019), and the number of prescriptions for females was higher than those for males (P < 0.001). The average cost of antivirals per prescription decreased; thus, the yearly cost showed no increasing trend. The main prescribed antivirals were valaciclovir and famciclovir, which progressively increased in prescriptions. The use of acyclovir decreased during the study period. Prescriptions containing topical formulations, acyclovir and penciclovir, both increased. The DDCs of valaciclovir and famciclovir decreased dramatically. The use of antivirals has increased over the decade, while the cost has not. Antiviral treatments adhere well to recent recommendations, except for the use of topical antivirals.

We collected COVID-19 patient data from the Korean public health authorities and estimated the incubation period by fitting three different distributions, including log-normal, gamma, and Weibull distributions, after stratification by gender and age groups. To identify any temporal impact on the incubation period, we divided the study period into two different epidemic periods (Period-1: 19 January-19 April 2020 and Period-2: 20 April-16 October 2020), and assessed for any differences.

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the HCV reinfection rate after successful treatment of HIV-1 coinfected MSM populations. Bibliographic databases were searched and a random-effect model was utilized to calculate the pooled HCV reinfection rate. Sub-group and meta-regression were used to explore heterogeneity among selected studies. A funnel plot and Egger's regression test were performed to estimate the publication bias. Sixteen studies with 9,017.2 person-years (PY) follow-up were included. The overall HCV reinfection rate following successful treatment among HIV-1-infected MSM was 5.27/100 PY (95% CI, 3.98, 6.96). Lower reinfection rates were observed in developed parts of Europe (5.28/100 PY; 95% CI, 3.73, 6.84) and North America (3.92/100 PY; 95% CI, 1.67, 6.17). Reinfection rates among people with HCV test intervals of fewer than 6 months (7.59/100 PY; 95% CI: 5.15, 10.03) were significantly higher than those with more than 6 months test interval (2.88/100 PY; 95% CI: 2.26, 3.50), with an adjusted RR of 1.86 (95% CI, 1.06, 3.13). The adjusted study factors explained 91.03% the of studies' heterogeneity. HCV reinfection rate was high in successfully treated MSM who were coinfected with HIV-1. A shorter HCV test interval may help to explore more HCV reinfections. HCV reinfection rate studies from HIV-1 coinfected MSM in underdeveloped countries are urgently needed.

Poor occupational safety practices could contribute to loss of lives of janitors and the general public. However, there are no detailed investigations on occupational safety practices of janitors involved in different settings, such as universities where there are crowds of people. In addition, although observation is recognized as a better tool to investigate occupational safety practices, previous studies mainly employed self-administered questionnaires and/or face-to-face interviews as data collection mechanisms. Therefore, this study aimed to assess occupational safety practices to prevent COVID-19 transmission and associated factors among Ethiopian University janitors using an observation tool and a self-administered questionnaire. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 410 janitors of Bule Hora University (Ethiopia) from November to December, 2021. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the independent factors associated with occupational safety practices. Occupational safety practices for COVID-19 were good only among 53.9% of the janitors. Training on COVID-19 prevention measures (AOR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.57-4.37), availability of policy and protocol in the work place (AOR = 5.46; 95% CI: 3.57-8.36), and availability of soap/bleach (AOR = 2.71; 95% CI: 1.64-4.46) were found to significantly increase the likelihood of occupational safety of the janitors. A significant proportion of the janitors had poor occupational safety practices. Therefore, an adequate supply of PPE and regular training and awareness creation on COVID-19 should be strengthened. Close follow-up and regular supervision of safety procedures should also be conducted as controlling strategies.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

The study was conducted in a tertiary eye hospital in Tianjin, China from March-April 2021. Four hundred twenty-eight DE patients were tested with the Ocular Surface Disease Index, Short Healthy Anxiety Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive statistics was used to assess the difference between DE with depression or anxiety among different groups. And multiple linear regression was used to explore factors that influence anxiety and depression in DE patients. The incidence rates of anxiety and depression among DE patients during COVID-19 were 27.34 and 26.87%, respectively. The proportion with comorbid anxiety and depression was 24.30%. Patients' education level (t = -3.001, P < 0.05; t = -3.631, P < 0.05), course of disease (t = 2.341, P < 0.05; t = 2.444, P < 0.05), health anxiety (t = 3.015, P < 0.05; t = 2.731, P < 0.05), and subjective sleep quality (t = 3.610, P < 0.05; t = 4.203, P < 0.05) had certain influences on anxiety and depression. The results showed that subjective symptoms of DE patients were related to depression and anxiety. Higher education, shorter disease duration, lower health anxiety levels, and better subjective sleep quality were associated with the reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms in DE patients. These findings could be deemed beneficial to the treatment and prevention of DE during the COVID-19 epidemic.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Patients suffering from this disease often have poor psychological well-being due to emotional stress. Baduanjin exercises, a traditional Chinese mind-body exercise, are used in the management of type 2 diabetes, especially for mental health. However, the effect of Baduanjin exercises on psychological well-being of patients with type 2 diabetes maintains controversial. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effects on psychological well-being of Baduanjin exercises for type 2 diabetes. Six electronic databases were searched from their inception to March 2022 for randomized controlled trials of Baduanjin exercises for type 2 diabetes. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality based on PEDro scale. The subgroup analysis was conducted based on different control interventions. The Cochran Q statistic and I 2 were applied to assess the heterogeneity. Twenty-seven studies between 2005 and 2019 were included in our review. Most of them exceeded the cutoff score 6 based on the PEDro scale. In psychological well-being, the aggregated results indicated that Baduanjin exercises showed positive effects in psychological well-being (SMD, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.36; p < 0.00001), depression (SMD, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.97; p = 0.03), anxiety (SMD, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.46; p = 0.003), and mental health (SMD, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.02; p < 0.00001).

Recent years effective chemotherapy have improved the 5-year survival in osteosarcoma patients to up to 60%-70%. Still, there is a lack of novel therapeutic strategies to enhance further survival. Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of pretreatment inflammatory-based parameters, including PLT, NLR, and SII, as prognostic indicators of survival in pediatric osteosarcoma patients. A total of 86 pediatric osteosarcoma patients between 2012 and 2021 in the Department of Orthopedics or tumor Surgery of Children's Hospital affiliated to Chongqing Medical University were retrospectively analyzed. The clinicopathological variables and systematic inflammatory biomarkers, including NLR, PLR and SII, was performed by the A Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Cox proportional risk regression model. According to the results of multivariate analysis, a prognostic nomogram was generated, and the concordance index (C-index) was calculated to predict the performance of the established nomogram. The survival curve was plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis showed that TNM stage, tumor size, NLR value, PLR value, SII value, neutrophil count and platelet count were related to CSS (p < 0.05). According to multivariate analysis, only TNM stage (p = 0.006) and SII values (p = 0.015) were associated with poor prognosis.To further predict survival in pediatric osteosarcoma patients, multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to predict cancer-specific survival at 1, 3 and 5 years. And constructed a nomogram model to predict children's CSS. The C-index of the nomogram is 0.776 (95%CI, 0.776-0.910), indicating that the model has good accuracy. Preoperative SII and TNM staging are independent prognostic markers for pediatric osteosarcoma patients. SII may be used in conjunction with TNM staging for individualized treatment of pediatric osteosarcoma patients in future clinical work.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

We included 30 children with DSD and 30 age- and gender-matched children without DSD as the control group. All the children and their parents completed the scales of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Children over 8 years old (n = 22) completed the Screen Scale for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), the Depression Self-rating Scale for Children (DSRSC), and the Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran-own memories of parental rearing practices in childhood. DSD children had significantly higher somatic anxiety, mental anxiety, and total anxiety scores than the control group (p < 0.001). The scores of the SCARED, anxiety, and depression subscales of DSD children were higher than those of control children (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). The correlation analysis showed that the score of generalized anxiety was positively related to age and entertainment. The regression analysis showed that age was a major factor that affected generalized anxiety in DSD children, and neuroticism was a major factor of anxiety disorder and separation anxiety in DSD children. Children with DSD have obvious anxiety problems, which are associated with family environmental factors (entertainment, success, and conflicts) and age. It is important to focus emphasis on emotional stability in children with DSD for detecting anxiety-related emotional disorders early.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

"1431",35968459,"Occupational Exposure to Poorly Soluble Low Toxicity Particles and Cardiac Disease: A Look at Carbon Black and Titanium Dioxide.","Environmental particulate exposure and the potential risk to people with various types of cardiac diseases, most notably cardiovascular disease, have aroused scientific and regulatory interest worldwide. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between exposure to airborne environmental particulate matter (PM) and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). The associations reported, however, are complex and may not involve a direct role for PM, since air pollutants are diverse and highly correlated. This study examines the potential role of occupational exposure to two types of particles, namely, manufactured carbon black (CB) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), on the risk of cardiovascular disease. To address the risk of cardiovascular disease from exposure to carbon black and titanium dioxide, as reflective of poorly soluble low toxicity particles, we reviewed the published cohort mortality studies of occupational exposure to carbon black and titanium dioxide. Mortality studies of carbon black have been conducted in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Five mortality studies related to workers involved in the manufacture of titanium dioxide in the United States and Europe have also been conducted. In addition, a meta-analysis of the three-carbon black mortality studies was performed. In the random-effects meta-analysis, full cohort meta-SMRs were 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79-1.29) for heart disease; 1.02 (95% CI: 0.80-1.30) for ischemic heart disease; and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.74-1.59) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality. A small but imprecise increased AMI mortality risk was suggested for cumulative exposure by a meta-HR = 1.10 per 100 mg/m3-years (95% CI: 0.92-1.31) but not for lugged exposures, that is, for recent exposures. Results of five cohort mortality studies of titanium dioxide workers in the United States and Europe showed no excess in all heart disease or cardiovascular disease. In the most recent study in the United States, an internal analysis, that is, within the cohort itself, with no lag time, showed that the exposure group 15-35 mg/m3-years yielded a significantly increased risk for heart disease; however, there was no evidence of increasing risk with increasing exposure for any of the exposure categories. In contrast to environmental studies, the results of cohort mortality studies do not demonstrate that airborne occupational exposure to carbon black and titanium dioxide particulates increases cardiovascular disease mortality. The lack of a relationship between carbon black and titanium dioxide and CVD mortality suggests that the associations reported in air pollution studies may not be driven by the particulate component.","meta_analysis","christiaan","meta_analysis"

Publicly available epidemiological data ranging from 3 February 2021 to 30 September 2021 were used to construct GAMLSS models that explain the beneficial effect of up to two doses of vaccination on the following COVID-19-related outcomes: new cases per day, daily active cases, daily occupied ICU beds and daily deaths. Administered first and second vaccine doses, and the statistical interaction between the two, are strong, statistically significant predictors for COVID-19-related new cases per day (R2 = 0.847), daily active cases (R2 = 0.903), ICU hospitalizations (R2 = 0.767), and deaths (R2 = 0.827). Our models stress the importance of completing vaccination schedules to reduce the adverse outcomes during the pandemic. Future work will continue to assess the influence of vaccines, including booster doses, as the pandemic progresses, and new variants emerge. This work highlights the importance of attaining full (two-dose) vaccination status and reinforces the notion that a second dose provides increased non-additive protection. The trends we observed may also support the inclusion of booster doses in vaccination plans.

The global, regional, and national sex-specific YLD numbers, crude YLD rates, and age-standardized YLD rates of NPB-related moderate and severe vision loss and blindness were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The Wilcoxon test and linear regression were used to investigate the relationship between sex difference in age-standardized YLD rates and the Human Development Index (HDI). Between 1990 and 2019, the gender disparity in age-standardized YLD rates for NPB-related vision impairment remained stable, increasing from 10.2 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 6.7-14.6] to 10.4 (95% UI 6.9-15.0) for men and 10.3 (95% UI 6.8-14.7) to 10.7 (95% UI 7.2-15.1) for women, with women consistently having higher age-standardized YLD rates. Between the ages of 25 and 75, women had higher YLD rates than males, with the biggest disparity in the 60-64 age group.

The structure of the ANN model was designed considering various input parameters, namely patient weight, patient size, body mass index, mean CTDI volume, scanning length, kVp, mAs, exposure time per rotation, and pitch factor. The aforementioned examination details of 551 abdominal CT scans were used as retrospective data. Different types of learning algorithms such as Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian and Scaled-Conjugate Gradient were checked in terms of the accuracy of the training data. The R-value representing the correlation coefficient for the real system and system output is given as 0.925, 0.785, and 0.854 for the Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian, and Scaled-Conjugate Gradient algorithms, respectively. The findings showed that the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm comprehensively detects DLP values for abdominal CT examinations. It can be a helpful approach to simplify CT quality assurance. It can be concluded that outcomes of this novel artificial intelligence method can be used for high accuracy DLP estimations before the abdominal CT examinations, where the radiation-related risk factors are high or risk evaluation of multiple CT scans is needed for patients in terms of ALARA. Likewise, it can be concluded that artificial learning methods are powerful tools and can be used for different types of radiation-related risk assessments for quality assurance in diagnostic radiology.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Understanding public support for this policy calls for effective and efficient methods of monitoring public opinion on social distancing. Twitter analysis has been suggested as a cheaper and faster-responding alternative to traditional survey methods. The current empirical evidence is mixed in terms of the correspondence between the two methods. We aim to compare the two methods in the context of monitoring the Dutch public's opinion on social distancing. For this comparison, we quantified the temporal and spatial variations in public opinion and their sensitivities to critical events using data from both Dutch Twitter users and respondents from a longitudinal survey. A longitudinal survey on a representative Dutch sample (n = 1,200) was conducted between July and November 2020 to measure opinions on social distancing weekly. From the same period, near 100,000 Dutch tweets were categorized as supporting or rejecting social distancing based on a model trained with annotated data. Average stances for the 12 Dutch provinces and over the 20 weeks were computed from the two data sources and were compared through visualizations and statistical analyses. Both data sources suggested strong support for social distancing, but public opinion was much more varied among tweets than survey responses. Both data sources showed an increase in public support for social distancing over time, and a strong temporal correspondence between them was found for most of the provinces. In addition, the survey but not Twitter data revealed structured differences among the 12 provinces, while the two data sources did not correspond much spatially. Finally, stances estimated from tweets were more sensitive to critical events happened during the study period. Our findings indicate consistencies between Twitter data analysis and survey methods in describing the overall stance on social distancing and temporal trends. The lack of spatial correspondence may imply limitations in the data collections and calls for surveys with larger regional samples. For public health management, Twitter analysis can be used to complement survey methods, especially for capturing public's reactivities to critical events amid the current pandemic.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We also explored the impact of (1) screening only, (2) screening plus expedited partner therapy, and (3) screening plus partner testing. Change of chlamydia prevalence before and after implementing the different strategies. The cost-effectiveness analysis reports total direct cost from a health provider perspective, the QALYs gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). In comparing the effects of universal screening only and targeted screening of the high-risk population, the mean prevalence during the 10th year of intervention was 2.75 ± 0.30% and 2.35 ± 0.21%, respectively (compared with 3.24 ± 0.30% and 3.35 ± 0.21% before the interventions, respectively). The addition of contact tracing to the latter targeted screening scenario reduces the mean prevalence during the 10th year of intervention to 1.48 ± 0.13% (compared with 3.31 ± 0.33% at baseline) in the best-case of testing before treatment and maximal contact-tracing effectiveness (40%). Overall, the most effective scenarios were those for which interventions focused on the high-risk population defined by the number of partners, with contact tracing included. The ICER for targeted screening with contact tracing at 20% and 40% efficiency was $4,634 and $7,219 per QALY gained, respectively (10-year time horizon). Expedited partner therapy did not significantly impact overall chlamydia prevalence and caused overtreatment. Our study suggests that targeted screening with strengthened contact tracing efforts is the most cost-effective strategy to reduce the prevalence of chlamydia in Hong Kong.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Participants in the non-yoga group were randomized to a 3-min Isha practice or a comparator group asked to perform 15-min of daily reading. Participants completed a series of web-based surveys (REDCap) at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks. These surveys include validated scales and objective questions on COVID-19 infection and medical history. The validated questionnaires assess for: perceived stress (PSS), mood states [anxiety and depression (PHQ-4), joy (DPES-Joy subscale)], mindfulness attention and awareness (MAAS), resilience (BRS), mental wellbeing (WEMWBS) and recovery from traumatic event (PTGI). Weekly activity diaries were employed as a tool for collecting compliance information from study participants. Perceived stress scale scores were identified as primary outcome for this study. The median Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score for the yoga practitioners compared to the active and placebo comparators was significantly lower at all time-points: baseline: 11 [IQR 7-15] vs. 16 [IQR 12-21] in both the active and placebo comparators (p < 0.0001); 6 weeks: 9 [IQR 6-13] vs. 12 [IQR 8-17] in the active comparator and 14 [IQR 9-18] in the placebo comparator (p < 0.0001); and 12 weeks: 9 [IQR 5-13] vs. 11.5 [IQR 8-16] in the active comparators and 13 [IQR 8-17] in the placebo comparator (p < 0.0001). Among the randomized participants that were compliant for the full 12 weeks, the active comparators had significantly lower median PSS scores than the placebo comparators 12 weeks [10 (IQR 5-14) vs. 13 (IQR 8-17), p = 0.017].

The virulence of the initial COVID-19 surge in Spain and the urgency for rapid evidence constrained early studies in their capacity to inform mental health programs accurately. Here, we used a qualitative research design to describe relevant mental health problems among frontline HCWs and explore their association with determinants and consequences and their implications for the design and implementation of mental health programs. Following the Programme Design, Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation (DIME) protocol, we used a two-step qualitative research design to interview frontline HCWs, mental health experts, administrators, and service planners in Spain. We used Free List (FL) interviews to identify problems experienced by frontline HCWs and Key informant (KI) interviews to describe them and explore their determinants and consequences, as well as the strategies considered useful to overcome these problems. We used a thematic analysis approach to analyze the interview outputs and framed our results into a five-level social-ecological model (intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public health). We recruited 75 FL and 22 KI interviewees, roughly balanced in age and gender. We detected 56 themes during the FL interviews and explored the following themes in the KI interviews: fear of infection, psychological distress, stress, moral distress, and interpersonal conflicts among coworkers. We found that interviewees reported perceived causes and consequences across problems at all levels (intrapersonal to public health). Although several mental health strategies were implemented (especially at an intrapersonal and interpersonal level), most mental health needs remained unmet, especially at the organizational, community, and public policy levels. In keeping with available quantitative evidence, our findings show that mental health problems are still relevant for frontline HCWs 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic and that many reported causes of these problems are modifiable. Based on this, we offer specific recommendations to design and implement mental health strategies and recommend using transdiagnostic, low-intensity, scalable psychological interventions contextually adapted and tailored for HCWs.","misc","christiaan","protocol"

A better understanding of the burden of CO poisoning is essential for improving its management. A systematic analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019 was conducted. Following the general analytical strategy used in the GBD Study 2019, the sex- and age-specific incidence and mortality rates of CO poisoning and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to CO poisoning in China were analyzed. Estimated average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) in age-standardized rates were calculated by joinpoint regression analysis. The effects of age, period and cohort on the incidence of CO poisoning and DALYs due to CO poisoning were estimated by an age-period-cohort model. The age-standardized incidence and mortality rates as well as DALYs of CO poisoning per 100,000 population were estimated to be 21.82 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 15.05-29.98], 0.93 (95% UI: 0.63-1.11), and 40.92 (95% UI: 28.43-47.85), respectively, in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the AAPCs in the age-standardized incidence significantly increased in both males and females, while the age-standardized mortality rates and DALYs significantly decreased in both males and females. The incidence of CO poisoning peaked in individuals aged 15-19 years. Males had a higher burden of CO poisoning than females. The age effect showed that the relative risks (RRs) of incident CO poisoning decreased with age among males and females and that individuals aged 15-24 years had the highest RRs. The RRs of incident CO poisoning increased with time. The cohort effect showed that the incidence increased in successive birth cohorts. The incidence of CO poisoning in China increased from 1990 to 2019. More attention should be given to improving the burden of CO poisoning in Chinese adolescents. The results of this study can be used by health authorities to inform preventative measures to reduce the burden of CO poisoning.","misc","christiaan","systematic_review"

The lack of resources to deal with a shock limits the capacity to protect the population, exposing them to a greater risk of infection and mortality. There is an urgent need to improve health policy to reduce corruption in the health sector during times of crisis. This article aims to propose a prepare and response strategy to address corruption during times of health crises. We first explore the inherent characteristics of health systems that make them vulnerable to corruption and present the different faces corrupt practices take. We then explain why anticipatory governance is fundamental in addressing corruption in health systems and draw upon examples of corruption during COVID-19. Finally, we conclude by proposing that anticipatory governance could decrease the impact of corruption during health crises by increasing the availability of resources required to improve the population's health.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) and EQ-5D scores were measured preoperatively. At 6-8 years follow-up, these scores were repeated and TSK scores were also measured. According to the TSK, patients were divided into two groups for further comparisons and analysis: without kinesiophobia (TSK-score ≤ 36) and with kinesiophobia (TSK-score >36). There were 99 patients (61.5%) with no kinesiophobia (TSK score ≤ 36, TSK mean 28.4, SD 4.7) and 62 patients (38.5%) with kinesiophobia (TSK score > 36, TSK mean 42.8, SD 5.3). Patients with and without kinesiophobia were not statistically different regarding age, sex or body mass index. (P = 0.20, P = 0.99, P = 0.22, respectively). In the group with no kinesiophobia, the mean 6-8 years WOMAC was 12.4 (SD 15.6), while the absolute delta (Δ) value between preoperative and 6-8 years WOMAC was 46.2 (SD 20.4), compared to the group with kinesiophobia where the mean 6-8 years WOMAC was 32.2 (SD 23.4), while the absolute delta (Δ) value between preoperative and 6-8 years WOMAC was 32.3 (SD 25.5): both P < 0.001. The group with no kinesiophobia had a mean 6-8 years EQ-5D of 0.81 (SD 0.22), while the absolute delta (Δ) value between preoperative and 6-8 years EQ-5D was 0.44 (SD 0.26), compared to the group with kinesiophobia where the mean 6-8 years EQ-5D was 0.57 (SD 0.23), while the absolute delta (Δ) value between preoperative and 6-8 years EQ-5D was 0.33 (SD 0.26): P < 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively.

Thirty lumbar laminectomized adult rats were randomly assigned to three groups. The control group received normal saline, the HCA group received HA-CMC-alginate gel, and the HA group received pure HA gel soaked over the dura of the laminectomized area before closing the surgical wound. All rats were housed for eight weeks, then epidural fibrosis (EF) was histologically graded. In addition, the fibroblast and inflammatory cell density were computerized for evaluation. The mean fibroblast densities were 32.03 × 102 ± 488, 13.22 × 102 ± 200, and 14.52 × 102 ± 368 cell/mm2 in the control, HCA, and HA groups, respectively. The mean inflammatory cell density was 30.74 × 102 ± 459, 5.90 × 102 ± 129, and 11.08 × 102 ± 282 cell/mm2 in the control, HCA, and HA groups, respectively.

Patients were divided into two groups: Group PE (Planned excision; n=345) and group UE (Unplanned excision; n=145). Two groups were compared in terms of local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and overall survival (OS). Local recurrences effects over MFS and OS were also analyzed. There were 26 (17.9%) local recurrences in the UE group and 30 (8.7%) local recurrences in the PE group (P=0.005). There was no difference in MFS and OS between study groups (P=0.278 and P=0.848, respectively). Five years MFS rates of UE and PE groups were 76.4% and 73.6%, and five-year OS rates of UE and PE groups were 70.3% and 73.9%, respectively (P=0.417, P=0.656). Patients with local recurrence had a 1.96 times higher risk of metastasis than patients without local recurrence (P=0.008). Patients with local recurrence had 1.65 times higher risk of mortality than patients without local recurrence (P=0.047).

A retrospective review of six patients undergoing surgical procedures for metastatic uLMS over seven years was conducted at a single center. All patients were reviewed for their primary malignancy and characteristics of bone metastasis during follow-up. Clinical presentation of bone metastasis, modality, and the type of treatment related to musculoskeletal involvement were also analyzed. The visual analog pain scale (VAS) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status scale were used pre-and postoperatively to evaluate the patient-reported outcome. Four patients had solitary bone metastases, whereas multiple bone metastases were diagnosed in two. Of those who had solitary bone metastasis, all of them were treated with wide resection. One of the two patients with multiple bone metastases was also treated with wide resection, and the other was treated with intralesional curettage. Four patients died from primary disease, and two were alive without evidence of disease recurrence. The median survival time following a diagnosis of bone metastasis was 15.0 months (95% CI, 0.6 to 29.4 months). The mean VAS scores for all six patients improved. However, the improvement in ECOG performance status was seen in only four patients. Although the prognosis of uLMS patients with bone metastasis seems poor, wide resection of the solitary bone metastasis may help prolong the overall survival. Performing orthopedic surgeries for the bone metastasis from uLMS in case of intractable pain after palliative radiotherapy, impending or pathological fracture, or solitary disease has been shown to decrease the pain significantly and improve the performance status in the majority.

This neurodegenerative process is triggered by the deposition of protein aggregates in the brain, which are mainly constituted of α-synuclein. Several studies have indicated that neuroinflammation is required to develop the neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease. Notably, the neuroinflammatory process involves microglial activation as well as the infiltration of peripheral T cells into the substantia nigra (SN). This work analyzes a mouse model of Parkinson's disease that recapitulates microglial activation, T-cell infiltration into the SN, the neurodegeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, and motor impairment. This mouse model of Parkinson's disease is induced by the stereotaxic delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors encoding the human wild-type α-synuclein (AAV-hαSyn) into the SN. The correct delivery of viral vectors into the SN was confirmed using control vectors encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). Afterward, how the dose of AAV-hαSyn administered in the SN affected the extent of hαSyn expression, the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons, and motor impairment were evaluated. Moreover, the dynamics of hαSyn expression, microglial activation, and T-cell infiltration were determined throughout the time course of disease development. Thus, this study provides critical time points that may be useful for targeting synuclein pathology and neuroinflammation in this preclinical model of Parkinson's disease.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

After the illuminator has been calibrated using an external measuring system, it allows one to adjust the intensity of the lighting to the needs of the observed process. This lighting system was utilized to image antimicrobial photodynamic therapy phenomena, which are currently the subject of intense research. The sample was prepared by spotting a suspension of bacteria on a carbon, graphene, or silicon nitride substrate, blotting the excess solution, spotting the photosensitizer solution, blotting the excess liquid again, and then assembling the liquid cell with a second substrate or graphene film. The process of the imaging experiment itself includes choosing the right place for observation with the use of low magnification and a minimum dose of electrons, and then cyclical activation of the light source to capture subsequent images at specified intervals with the minimum amount of electrons necessary. The electron dose of each exposure and the time and intensity of lighting used need to be carefully recorded due to the complexity of the observed phenomena as, at the same time, the process is both light- and electron-driven. After the actual experiment is performed, additional control observations must be made, in which the same doses of electrons are used but without additional light influence and smaller doses of electrons are used for higher doses of light. This makes it possible to distinguish light-induced microstructural effects from those caused by electrons in both the fields of life and materials science.","misc","christiaan","protocol"

Symptoms include recurrent and intrusive thoughts, sleep disturbance, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, and reckless or destructive behavior. Given the complex and heterogeneous nature of the disease, animal models for PTSD-like symptomatology are of increasing interest to the field of PTSD research. Because resilience to PTSD-like symptomatology is an important epidemiologic aspect of PTSD, animal models that resolve vulnerable and resilient animals are of particular value. Due to the complex nature of the PTSD phenotype and the potential overlaps between PTSD-like behavior and behaviors associated with other stress-induced psychopathologies such as anxiety or depression, animal models that utilize multiple readouts for PTSD-like behavior are also of increasing value. We utilize a paradigm developed by Lebow et al. 2012 for the induction and identification of PTSD-like symptomatology in mice. This paradigm utilizes inescapable electric foot shock, administered in two decontextualized sessions over two consecutive days. Stressed mice perform four behavioral tests - dark/light transfer, marble burying, acoustic startle, and home cage activity - to generate five behavioral readouts of PTSD-like behavior: % risk assessment (%RA), % marbles buried (%MB), % prepulse inhibition (%PPI), latency to peak startle amplitude (LPSA), and % light phase activity (%LPA). PTSD-like symptomatology is characterized by decreased %RA, increased %MB, decreased %PPI, decreased LPSA, and increased %LPA. The 20% of animals displaying the most PTSD-like behavior in each test are awarded a certain number of points depending on the test, and animals scoring sufficient points are designated as PTSD-like, while animals scoring no points are designated PTSD-resilient. This paradigm identifies PTSD-like behavior in ~15% of animals, a rate comparable to that observed in humans.

However, the precise standards for probiotic administration in alleviating colitis remain undefined. Most analysis methods rely on limited diversity and abundance of gut microorganisms. Therefore, observational studies cannot establish causation. In this study, we applied antibiotic-induced pseudo-germ-free mice to investigate the role of gut microbiota in regulating the probiotic effects of Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. This process allows for evaluating the bidirectional regulating effect of B. cereus supplementation on health and provides stable and reproducible results. Here, the detailed protocols for B. cereus cultivation, gavage operation, stool collection, and antibiotic clearance treatment on colitis mice are provided. The optimization methods are also applicable for other chronic inflammatory-associated disorders. The results showed that B. cereus administration decreased body weight loss, colon length shortening, disease activity index, and histopathological scores. However, treatment with antibiotics suppressed the positive effect of B. cereus on colitis. These results indicate that gut microbiota are needed for the alleviating effects of B. cereus on colitis. Therefore, exploring the beneficial effects of probiotics in this research is a promising approach for developing novel treatment strategies for alleviating the symptoms of chronic inflammatory-associated disorders.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Before CCI-ION surgery, rats were trained in an orofacial pain assessment device (OPAD) to drink sweetened condensed milk while making facial contact with the metal spiked bars and lick-tube. In this assay, rats can choose between receiving milk as a positive reinforcer or escaping an aversive mechanical stimulus that is produced by a vertical row of small pyramid-shaped spikes on each side of the reward access hole. Following 2 weeks of training in the OPAD and before the CCI-ION surgery, baseline mechanical sensitivity data were recorded for 5 days for each rat during a 10 min testing session. During a session, the operant system automatically records the number of reward bottle activations (licks) and facial contacts, contact duration, and latency to the first lick, among other measures. Following baseline measurements, rats underwent either CCI-ION or sham surgery. In this protocol, mechanical hypersensitivity was quantified by measuring the number of licks, latency to the first lick, the number of contacts, and the ratio of licks to facial contacts (L/F). The data showed that CCI-ION resulted in a significant decrease in the number of licks and the L/F ratio and an increase in the latency to the first lick, indicating mechanical hypersensitivity. These data support the use of operant-based pain assays to assess mechanical pain sensitivity in preclinical pain research.","rodent","christiaan","protocol"
"1463",35969084,"Determining Intestinal Permeability using Lucifer Yellow in an Apical-Out Enteroid Model.","Enteroids are an emerging research tool in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). They are traditionally grown in the basolateral-out (BO) conformation, where the apical surface of the epithelial cell faces the inner lumen. In this model, access to the luminal surface of enteroids for treatment and experimentation is challenging, which limits the ability to study host-pathogen interactions. To circumvent this, a neonatal apical-out (AO) model for necrotizing enterocolitis was created. Since intestinal epithelial cell permeability changes are pathognomonic for NEC, this protocol outlines using lucifer yellow (LY) as a marker of paracellular permeability. LY traverses the intestinal epithelial barrier via all three major paracellular pathways: pore, leak, and unrestricted. Using LY in an AO model allows for a broader study of permeability in NEC. Following IRB approval and parental consent, surgical samples of intestinal tissue were collected from human preterm neonates. Intestinal stem cells were harvested via crypt isolation and used to grow enteroids. Enteroids were grown to maturity and then transformed AO or left in BO conformation. These were either not treated (control) or were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subjected to hypoxic conditions for the induction of in vitro NEC. LY was used to assess for permeability. Immunofluorescent staining of the apical protein zonula occludens-1 and basolateral protein β-catenin confirmed AO conformation. Both AO and BO enteroids treated with LPS and hypoxia demonstrated significantly increased paracellular permeability compared to controls. Both AO and BO enteroids showed increased uptake of LY into the lumen of the treated enteroids compared to controls. The utilization of LY in an AO enteroid model allows for the investigation of all three major pathways of paracellular permeability. It additionally allows for the investigation of host-pathogen interactions and how this may affect permeability compared to the BO enteroid model.","misc","christiaan","protocol"

Valuable insights into carcinogenesis have been provided by studies using these models. Cell lines have provided an understanding of the deregulation of molecular signaling associated with breast tumorigenesis, while rodent models are widely used to study cellular and molecular characteristics of breast cancer in vivo. The establishment of 3D cultures of breast epithelial and cancerous cells aids in bridging the gap between in vivo and in vitro models by mimicking the in vivo conditions in vitro. This model can be used to understand the deregulation of complex molecular signaling events and the cellular characteristics during breast carcinogenesis. Here, a 3D culture system is modified to study a phospholipid mediator-induced (Platelet Activating Factor, PAF) transformation. Immunomodulators and other secreted molecules play a major role in tumor initiation and progression in the breast. In the present study, 3D acinar cultures of breast epithelial cells are exposed to PAF exhibited transformation characteristics such as loss of polarity and altered cellular characteristics. This 3D culture system will assist in shedding light on genetic and/or epigenetic perturbations induced by various small molecule entities in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, this system will also provide a platform for the identification of novel as well as known genes that may be involved in the process of transformation.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1465",35969093,"Measuring Skeletal Muscle Thermogenesis in Mice and Rats.","Skeletal muscle thermogenesis provides a potential avenue for better understanding metabolic homeostasis and the mechanisms underlying energy expenditure. Surprisingly little evidence is available to link the neural, myocellular, and molecular mechanisms of thermogenesis directly to measurable changes in muscle temperature. This paper describes a method in which temperature transponders are utilized to retrieve direct measurements of mouse and rat skeletal muscle temperature. Remote transponders are surgically implanted within the muscle of mice and rats, and the animals are given time to recover. Mice and rats must then be repeatedly habituated to the testing environment and procedure. Changes in muscle temperature are measured in response to pharmacological or contextual stimuli in the home cage. Muscle temperature can also be measured during prescribed physical activity (i.e., treadmill walking at a constant speed) to factor out changes in activity as contributors to the changes in muscle temperature induced by these stimuli. This method has been successfully used to elucidate mechanisms underlying muscle thermogenic control at the level of the brain, sympathetic nervous system, and skeletal muscle. Provided are demonstrations of this success using predator odor (PO; ferret odor) as a contextual stimulus and injections of oxytocin (Oxt) as a pharmacological stimulus, where predator odor induces muscle thermogenesis, and Oxt suppresses muscle temperature. Thus, these datasets display the efficacy of this method in detecting rapid changes in muscle temperature.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Because of the similarities between Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian intestinal cells, as well as the power of the C. elegans system, this host has emerged as a model system to study host intestine-microbe interactions in vivo. While it is possible to observe some aspects of these interactions with bright-field microscopy, it is difficult to accurately classify microbes and characterize the extent of colonization or infection without more precise tools. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be used as a tool to identify and visualize microbes in nematodes from the wild or to experimentally characterize and quantify infection in nematodes infected with microbes in the lab. FISH probes, labeling the highly abundant small subunit ribosomal RNA, produce a bright signal for bacteria and microsporidian cells. Probes designed to target conserved regions of ribosomal RNA common to many species can detect a broad range of microbes, whereas targeting divergent regions of the ribosomal RNA is useful for narrower detection. Similarly, probes can be designed to label viral RNA. A protocol for RNA FISH staining with either paraformaldehyde (PFA) or acetone fixation is presented. PFA fixation is ideal for nematodes associated with bacteria, microsporidia, and viruses, whereas acetone fixation is necessary for the visualization of microsporida spores. Animals were first washed and fixed in paraformaldehyde or acetone. After fixation, FISH probes were incubated with samples to allow for the hybridization of probes to the desired target. The animals were again washed and then examined on microscope slides or using automated approaches. Overall, this FISH protocol enables detection, identification, and quantification of the microbes that inhabit the C. elegans intestine, including microbes for which there are no genetic tools available.","misc","christiaan","protocol"
"1467",35969099,"Reconstitution of Septin Assembly at Membranes to Study Biophysical Properties and Functions.","Most cells can sense and change their shape to carry out fundamental cell processes. In many eukaryotes, the septin cytoskeleton is an integral component in coordinating shape changes like cytokinesis, polarized growth, and migration. Septins are filament-forming proteins that assemble to form diverse higher-order structures and, in many cases, are found in different areas of the plasma membrane, most notably in regions of micron-scale positive curvature. Monitoring the process of septin assembly in vivo is hindered by the limitations of light microscopy in cells, as well as the complexity of interactions with both membranes and cytoskeletal elements, making it difficult to quantify septin dynamics in living systems. Fortunately, there has been substantial progress in the past decade in reconstituting the septin cytoskeleton in a cell-free system to dissect the mechanisms controlling septin assembly at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The core steps of septin assembly include septin heterooligomer association and dissociation with the membrane, polymerization into filaments, and the formation of higher-order structures through interactions between filaments. Here, we present three methods to observe septin assembly in different contexts: planar bilayers, spherical supports, and rod supports. These methods can be used to determine the biophysical parameters of septins at different stages of assembly: as single octamers binding the membrane, as filaments, and as assemblies of filaments. We use these parameters paired with measurements of curvature sampling and preferential adsorption to understand how curvature sensing operates at a variety of length and time scales.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Existing clinical and performance-based IADL assessments are not feasible for integration into clinical medicine. Virtual reality (VR) is a powerful yet underutilized tool that could advance the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disease. An impediment to the adoption and scaling of VR in clinical neurology is VR-related sickness resulting from sensory inconsistencies between the visual and vestibular systems (i.e., locomotion problem). The Cleveland Clinic Virtual Reality Shopping (CC-VRS) platform attempts to solve the locomotion problem by coupling an omnidirectional treadmill with high-resolution VR content, enabling the user to physically navigate a virtual grocery store to simulate shopping. The CC-VRS consists of Basic and Complex shopping experiences; both require walking 150 m and retrieving five items. The Complex experience has additional scenarios that increase the cognitive and motor demands of the task to better represent the continuum of activities associated with real-world shopping. The CC-VRS platform provides objective and quantitative biomechanical and cognitive outcomes related to the user's IADL performance. Initial data indicate that the CC-VRS results in minimal VR-sickness and is feasible and tolerable for older adults and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The considerations underlying the development, design, and hardware and software technology are reviewed, and initial models of integration into primary care and neurology are provided.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Treatment failure is mainly due to the invasiveness of GBM cells, which speaks for the need for a better understanding of GBM motile properties. To investigate the molecular mechanism supporting GBM invasion, new physiological models enabling in-depth characterization of protein dynamics during invasion are required. These observations would pave the way to the discovery of novel targets to block tumor infiltration and improve patient outcomes. This paper reports how an orthotopic xenograft of GBM cells in the zebrafish brain permits subcellular intravital live imaging. Focusing on microtubules (MTs), we describe a procedure for MT labeling in GBM cells, microinjecting GBM cells in the transparent brain of 3 days post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae, intravital imaging of MTs in the disseminating xenografts, altering MT dynamics to assess their role during GBM invasion, and analyzing the acquired data.","misc","christiaan","misc"

In the present study, we describe a procedure that can be used to evaluate PA levels using an actigraphic device and software. Furthermore, since hip-worn devices are known to reduce compliance, we attempted to assess the agreement between hip-worn and wrist-worn device data. Collectively, our results indicate that these devices are suitable for measuring PA and leisure time physical activity (LTPA) levels. Together with subjective questionnaires, both hip-worn and wrist-worn devices are highly suitable for evaluating PA in Chinese children undergoing table tennis training in clubs.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Data obtained from blood donors (BDs) tested for HEV-RNA between 2015 and 2021 were used to assess the most efficient nucleic acid testing (NAT) strategy. Viral loads (VLs) and the plasma volume of blood components, as well as an HEV-RNA dose of 3.85 log IU as the infectious threshold and an assay with a 95% limit of detection (LOD) at 17 IU/mL, were used to assess the proportion of: (i) HEV-RNA-positive BDs that would remain undetected; and (ii) blood components associated with these undetected BDs with an HEV-RNA dose >3.85 log IU, considering 4 NAT options (Individual testing [ID], MP-6, MP-12, and MP-24). Of the 510,118 BDs collected during the study period, 510 (0.10%) were HEV-RNA-positive. Based on measurable VLs available in 388 cases, 1%, 15.2%, 21.8%, and 32.6% of BDs would theoretically pass undetected due to a VL below the LOD of ID, MP-6, MP-12, and MP-24 testing, respectively. All BDs associated with a potentially infectious blood component would be detected with ID-NAT while 13% of them would be undetected with MP-6, 19.6% with MP-12, and 30.4% with MP-24 depending on the plasma volume. No red blood cell (RBC) components with an HEV-RNA dose >3.85 log IU would enter the blood supply, regardless of the NAT strategy used. A highly sensitive ID-NAT would ensure maximum safety. However, an MP-based strategy can be considered given that: (i) the risk of transmission is closely related to the plasma volume of blood components; (ii) RBC are the most commonly transfused components and have a low plasma content; and (iii) HEV-RNA doses transmitting infection exceed 4 log IU. To minimise the potential risk associated with apheresis platelet components and fresh frozen plasma, less than 12 donations should be pooled using an NAT assay with a LOD of approximately 20 IU/mL.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Sows weighing 208.5 ± 18.34kg and their neonates were used. From day 114 of gestation to 21st day of lactation(weaning), ten multiparous sows (n = 5/treatment) (Landrace x Yorkshire) were assigned randomly into one of two treatments: CON (basal diet) and TRT (CON + 0.05% SA). There was no significant difference in the body weight, backfat thickness, backfat loss, and body condition score in SA treated sows compared to sows fed the CON diet. However, the bodyweight of sow was dramatically reduced by an average of 16kg from farrowing to weaning time. The dietary inclusion of SA in the sow diet slightly improved the survival rate (p = 0.065) and showed a higher body weight (p = 0.009) in piglets. However, there was no significant difference in red blood cell, Fe, Hematocrit, and Hb concentrations between CON and TRT sows' groups, but the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) was significantly reduced in sows from the TRT group compared with the CON group from the beginning to weaning. The outcome of this trial shows that dietary addition of SA on sows diet from early lactation could increase the birth weight and TIBC of neonates at the end of the trial.","misc","christiaan","randomized_trial"

Thus, the plasma concentration of DA might be used as a biomarker for the behavioral characteristics of horses. The behavioral characteristics of horses vary depending on the breed, age, and sex. Moreover, the DA receptor genotypes are also related to horse behaviors. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the DA concentration variations of horse plasma by breed, age, sex, or genotype of its receptor. The horses were divided by breed into Thoroughbred (n = 13), Pony (n = 9), Warmblood (n = 4), and Haflinger (n = 5). The age variable was divided into three different groups: post-pubertal (2-5 years, n = 6), adult (6-13 years, n = 19), and aged horses (15-24 years, n = 6). The sex variable was divided into geldings (n = 8) and mares (n = 23). Approximately 10 mL of blood was collected, and an ELISA kit was used to measure the plasma concentration of DA. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to identify the genetic variation in the DA D4 receptor gene (DRD4). SPSS statistical software was used for statistical analysis. The DA concentrations in geldings were significantly lower than those in mares. There was no significant difference in DA concentrations among breed and age groups. Horses with the GG and GA genotypes had significantly higher plasma concentrations of DA compared to horses with the AA genotype for the G292A gene. Briefly, the plasma concentration of DA varied depending on the sex and genotype of G292A. These factors should be considered when the concentration of DA is used as a biomarker for the behavioral characteristics of horses. In conclusion, the DA concentration or DRD4 genotype of horse plasma has the potential to be used as a biomarker that can predict the behavioral characteristics of horses.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This study investigated the effects of different broiler ages and feed ingredients on AID and SID of AA in corn and soybean meal (SBM). Four hundred and eighty (age = 7 d; initial body weight [BW] = 173.4 ± 12.65 g) and 192 (age = 18 d; initial BW = 772.2 ± 62.13 g) birds were allocated to three dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design with eight replicate cages per treatment. Two diets were formulated based on corn or SBM as the sole source of AA in the diet. A nitrogen-free diet was also formulated to measure basal endogenous losses of AA. Experimental diets were given for 3 and 4 days in Exps. 1 and 2, respectively. An interaction was observed (p < 0.05) between the age of birds and the type of ingredient for the AID of most AA, except for methionine, valine, cysteine (Cys), and tyrosine; however, the effects of age and type of ingredients were diminished in the SID of AA, except for histidine, isoleucine, leucine (Leu), phenylalanine, alanine (Ala), and glutamic acid (Glu). The AID of AA, except for Leu and Cys and the SID of AA, except for Leu, Ala, Glu, and Pro in SBM were greater (p < 0.05) than in corn. As the age of birds increased from 10 to 22 d, digestibility of all AA increased (p < 0.05), regardless of the expression of AA digestibility (i.e., AID and SID). In conclusion, the AID and SID of AA in both corn and SBM increased with increasing age, and the AID and SID of AA in SBM were greater than in corn.","misc","christiaan","rodent"

The experimental data encompasses Cauchy stress-stretch (σ-λ) curves obtained across a 10,000-fold range of stretch rates (λ˙), from quasi-static (λ˙= 0.001 s-1) to upper-range of physiological (λ˙= 12.4 s-1) deformation rates. The analysis of the data elicits two important trends: (i) the mechanical behaviour of the aortic valve across the tested rates is rate-dependent, with specimens becoming stiffer by increasing rate; and (ii) there appears to be a plateau in the rate-effects on the σ-λ curves; i.e. the rate-effects approach an asymptote with increase in the stretch rate λ˙. Guided by these empirical observations, we devise our new Wv function and demonstrate that the well-known form of the dissipation function commonly used in the literature is a special case of our proposed Wv. The ensuing model is then compared against the experimental σ-λ curves and is shown to provide favourable predictions. An important advantage of the employed modelling framework is that it allows the incorporation of the rate of deformation, which is a direct experimental control parameter, as an explicit modelling variable. The application of the proposed model is thereby recommended for heart valves and other soft tissues that exhibit similar rate-dependent features.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The designed feedback input can be tolerant of limited stochastic fluctuations of control gains and be robust against potential errors caused by factors like round-off. By combining methods of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and free-weighting matrix, a delay-dependent output coupling feedback with stochastically occurring uncertainties is designed and linear-matrix-inequalities(LMIs)-based sufficient conditions for the exponential stabilization in mean square are derived.

Estrogen can protect the cardiovascular system, but its exact molecular mechanism is unknown. Here we report that 17β-estradiol (E2) suppressed vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation and inflammation. qRT-PCR and Western blot demonstrated that E2 decreased NF-κB p50 expression and reduced VSMCs proliferation and inflammation. Mechanistically, a dual luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested that KLF5 promoted NF-κB p50 expression by binding to the NF-κB p50 promoter, whereas E2 reduced the effect of KLF5 binding to the NF-κB p50 promoter and inhibited NF-κB p50 expression. Furthermore, a coimmunoprecipitation assay and immunofluorescence staining showed that the interaction between KLF5 and ERα increased in VSMCs treated with E2, which in turn decreased NF-κB p50 expression levels. Altogether, we reveal that E2 inhibits VSMCs proliferation and inflammation by reducing NF-κB expression induced by an increased interaction between KLF5 and ERα. These data provide further insights into how E2 inhibits vascular proliferation and inflammation.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution and determinants of stunting among children aged <5 y in Ethiopia. Geospatial and multilevel analysis of the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2019 data was done to investigate the spatial distribution and determinants of stunting among children aged <5 y in Ethiopia. The analysis included 5753 weighted children aged <5. Spatial autocorrelations analysis was done to assess the spatial dependency of stunting. Hot spot and cluster outlier analysis was used to observe the spatial clustering of stunting. Kriging interpolation was used to predict stunting in an unsampled area. A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted to identify determinants of stunting. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated and variables having a P < 0.05 were declared statistically significant. The national prevalence of stunting was 36.81% (95% CI, 35.48%-38.15%), with significant spatial variations across Ethiopia. Spatial clustering of stunting was detected in the northern, northwestern, northeastern, and southwestern parts of Ethiopia. Age and sex of the child, birth interval, birth type, household wealth status, maternal education, region, and community-level illiteracy were factors significantly associated with stunting. Stunting significantly varies across Ethiopia, with the highest prevalence in Northern Ethiopia. Older age, poor family wealth, maternal illiteracy, and community illiteracy level were the significant determinants of stunting in children aged <5 y in this study.

In this study, we investigate the use of caffeine administration as a possible means of pharmacological management for hydrocephalus. A total of 76 three-day-old mice pups from 10 dams were divided into four groups: hydrocephalus was induced in the pups in two groups by intracisternal injection of kaolin suspension, and their dams were given either caffeine (50 mg/kg by gavage) or water daily for 21 days; the dams in the other 2 (non-hydrocephalic) groups similarly had either caffeine or water; the pups received caffeine administered via lactation. Developmental neurobehavioral tests were performed until day 21, when the pups were sacrificed. Their brains were removed and processed for Cresyl and Golgi staining; both quantitative and qualitative analyses were then carried out. Improved developmental motor activities and reflexes were observed in the hydrocephalus + caffeine-treated pups. Caffeine administration was associated with reduced cell death and increased dendritic arborization of the neurons in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum of hydrocephalic mice pups. Caffeine administration appears to have promise as an adjunct in hydrocephalus management, and its use needs to be further explored.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

FISH from lymphocytes verified 45,X in 47/52 original cases, whereas 4/52 had 45,X/46,XX and 1/52 45,X/47,XYY mosaicism. The 45,X cell line fraction was higher in FISH from lymphocytes compared to classical karyotyping (median 86.4% versus 70.0%; p<0.001), while there was no difference for FISH from buccal or rear-tongue smear cells. The mean 45,X cell line fraction was more abundant in patients with several of the characteristic phenotypic signs compared to patients without them (p<0.01), but the predictive power was insufficient. FISH analysis confirmed the findings of classical karyotyping; only a few 45,X monosomy cases were reclassified as mosaics. The 45,X cell line fraction did not show clinically meaningful prediction of the phenotype. FISH analysis of buccal or rear-tongue epithelial cells may be a non-inferior, less invasive alternative to classical karyotyping.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

A convergent mixed-methods design. Online survey that launched in April 2020. A total of 185 pregnant women. For the quantitative strand, we measured adaptation to coping with stress using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. For the qualitative strand, we asked participants to describe the experience of being pregnant during the pandemic. The mean score on the Brief Resilient Coping Scale was 14.7, which indicated a medium-level resilient coper. Using Krippendorff's content analysis, we identified four themes: Robbed of Enjoying the Expected Pregnancy Experiences, Anxiety and Fear in the Face of a Pandemic Pregnancy, Heightened Source of Worry With Birth on the Horizon, and Choosing Hope. To meet the needs of pregnant women, perinatal nurses and other maternity care providers must understand the experience of pregnancy during times of upheaval, such as the onset of a global pandemic. Health care providers and nurses can help ensure ideal outcomes for pregnant women by recognizing the loss of the expected pregnancy experience, providing support through creative social outlets, and fostering hopeful optimism.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

However, it is unclear if significant regional variations exist in long-term outcomes after LT. To investigate potential differences, we performed a retrospective, comparative cohort analysis of adult patients undergoing deceased donor single or double LT in North America (NA) or Europe between January 2006 and December 2016. Data up to April 2019 were abstracted from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Thoracic Organ Registry. We compared overall survival (OS) between North American and European LT centers in a propensity score matched analysis. In 3,115 well-matched pairs, though 30-day survival was similar between groups (NA 96.2% vs Europe 95.4%, p = 0.116), 5-year survival was significantly higher in European patients (NA 60.1% vs Europe 70.3%, p < 0.001). This survival difference persisted in a sensitivity analysis excluding Canadian patients. Prior observations suggest that these disparities are at least partly related to better access to care via universal healthcare models prevalent in Europe. Future studies are warranted to confirm our findings and explore other causal mechanisms. It is likely that potential solutions will require concerted efforts from healthcare providers and policymakers.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

In this study, the authors compared the erector spinae plane (ESP) block having dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant with conventional pain management along with intravenous dexmedetomidine. Prospective randomized single-blinded trial. Tertiary care teaching hospital. All of the patients scheduled for elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with an ejection fraction of >45%. After obtaining institutional ethical committee approval, 130 patients were randomized into Group E and Group D. Group E patients received ESP block bilaterally with 25 mL of bupivacaine plus 0.5 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine. The patients in Group D received conventional intravenous analgesia, as well as a 0.7 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine bolus, followed by a 0.3 μg/kg dexmedetomidine infusion during surgery and continued postoperatively for 24 hours. Group E patients received 8 mL/h of bupivacaine infusion bilaterally for 24 hours. The primary outcome assessed was pain scores in the postoperative period. The secondary outcomes assessed were postoperative rescue analgesic consumption, time to first rescue analgesia, intraoperative fentanyl consumption, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Both groups were comparable in demographic characteristics. The postoperative pain scores from 4 hours to 12 hours were lower in Group E compared with Group D. The pain scores at 24 hours were not significantly different between groups. Postoperative fentanyl consumption in Group E (99.23 ± 50.19 μg) was significantly lower than in Group D (181.15 ± 82.92 μg), with a p value of 0.001. Time to first rescue analgesia was significantly longer in Group E, with a median score of 8 hours when compared with that of 4 hours in Group D, with a p value of 0.01. Intraoperative fentanyl consumption was significantly lower in Group E (392.15 ± 55.36 μg) compared with Group D (604.00 ± 131.87 μg; p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in the duration of mechanical ventilation in both groups.

The main aim of this study was to develop a protocol for pain control in the management of OSMF postoperatively. This was a prospective, parallel with active control, double-arm, triple-blinded, randomised control trial (RCT) with 48 OSMF patients, randomised into two groups - Group A (control, n = 25): received non-opioid analgesics (NSAIDs) and Group B (cases, n = 23): received transdermal fentanyl patches (TFP). Pain and interincisal opening were measured on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 15, and on the1st and 3rd postoperative months. Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed preoperatively, on the 15th day postoperatively, and 3rd month postoperatively, and compliance was documented postoperatively on the 9th day. The transdermal fentanyl patch was found to have statistically significantly more effect in controlling severe pain during active mouth opening exercises, and thus significantly increased the patients' compliance. Although there was increased mouth opening and QoL in the fentanyl group, the differences were statistically insignificant. Our study recommends the use of TFP for better pain control and compliance in postoperative OSMF patients.","randomized_trial","christiaan","protocol"

A comprehensive search was conducted to detect phase 2 and 3 RCTs comparing pharmacological interventions in patients with NASH. According to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations, primary outcomes included: 1) NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis; 2) At least 1-point reduction in fibrosis without worsening of NASH. Meta-analysis and meta-regressions were conducted on placebo arms, while network meta-analysis was performed on intervention arms. A total of 15 RCTs met the eligibility criteria. The meta-analysis on placebo arms showed a pooled estimate rate of 17% (95%C.I. 12%-23%;I2 = 86%; p < 0.01) for NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis and of 21% (95%C.I. 13%-31%;I2 = 84%; p < 0.01) for ≥1stage improvement of fibrosis without worsening of NASH. Phase 3 (vs Phase 2)RCTs, older age and higher AST levels were significantly associated with progression of liver disease by univariate meta-regression. At network meta-analysis, Semaglutide (P-score 0.906), Pioglitazione alone (score 0.890) and plus Vitamin E (0.826) had the highest probability of being ranked the most effective intervention for NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis, while Aldafermin (0.776), Lanifibranor (0.773) and Obeticholic acid (0.771) had the highest probability to achieve ≥1 stage of fibrosis improvement without worsening of NASH.

This study assessed 30-day point prevalence abstinence and patient satisfaction of TCS provided by pharmacists compared with primary care providers (PCPs) in a community health center. Secondary objectives assessed the number of encounters and time spent counseling and medications prescribed at each visit. Patients at the age of 18 years or older with tobacco use disorder and a new quit attempt were invited to complete a 9-question survey via e-mail, phone, and mail 7 months after their initial tobacco cessation visit. The survey assessed 30-day point prevalence abstinence and patient satisfaction. Chart reviews were conducted to assess time spent counseling and prescribing patterns. The response rate was 38.8% (50/129) overall, 43.9% in the pharmacist group and 36.3% in the PCP group. A 30-day point prevalence abstinence was reached by 22.2% (4/18) in the pharmacist group and 9.4% (3/32) in the PCP group (P = 0.23). Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the pharmacist group with regard to discussion around medications used to quit smoking (100% vs. 65.6%, P = 0.004), understanding how to properly use the medications (100% vs. 62.5%, P = 0.002), identifying behavioral changes to assist with quitting (94.4% vs. 65.6%, P = 0.036), and frequent follow-up visits (83.3% vs. 46.9%, P = 0.016). Pharmacists spent more time counseling patients and were more likely to prescribe dual nicotine replacement therapy and prescription medications. There was not a statistically significant difference in abstinence rates, and patient satisfaction with TCS provided by pharmacists and PCPs was high. Pharmacists provide a more intensive service by spending more time counseling patients and providing more follow-ups and are more likely to diversify medications prescribed to quit smoking.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

There is contradictory information about how to best manage these cases: pyeloplasty or nephrectomy? To systematically summarize the available evidence concerning the effects of pyeloplasty on the differential renal function of PFK in children with unilateral UPJO, highlighting the ongoing challenges in their definition, management, and long-term follow-up. In addition, we aim to verify potential predictors of renal functional recoverability that could help clinicians choose candidates for pyeloplasty. We searched several databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library CENTRAL until August 20, 2021, according to the PRISMA guidelines. The following concepts were searched: pediatric, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, UPJO, pyeloplasty, recovery, split renal function, and differential renal function. We enrolled studies where the PFK was defined as preoperative differential renal function (DRF) ≤30% by renal scintigraphy. Potential predictors of renal functional recoverability were assessed and compared among studies. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). 1499 citations perceived as relevant to screening were retrieved. After screening, 20 studies were included, comprising a total of 625 cases. The number of patients in each study varied between 5 and 84, while the average post-surgical follow-up duration ranged between 3 months and 180 months. The most significant preoperative predictive factor for postoperative functional recoverability was the baseline DRF, especially when antenatally diagnosed. The quality was considered average in a significant portion of included studies. A significant proportion of PFK showed an increase of DRF post-pyeloplasty. However, no consistent predictive factors for functional recoverability have yet been determined apart from preoperative DRF. Until further evidence appears, pyeloplasty should be considered a valid option in the armamentarium of UPJO management in PFK.","systematic_review","christiaan","systematic_review"

In this study, we aimed to externally validate a novel risk model for the IMDC-favorable risk group in patients with mRCC. The Turkish Oncology Group Kidney Cancer Consortium (TKCC) is a multicenter registry that includes 13 cancer centers in Turkey. As described by Schmidt et al., 3 parameters (ie, time from diagnosis to systemic therapy <3 vs. ≥3 years, Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] 80 vs. >80, and the presence of brain, liver, or bone metastasis) were used to divide the IMDC favorable risk group into 2 new categories: very favorable and favorable risk groups. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Time to treatment failure (TTF) and objective response rate (ORR) in the very favorable and favorable risk groups were the secondary endpoints. A total of 545 patients with mRCC from all IMDC risk groups and 112 patients from the favorable risk group were included in this study. According to the novel classification model, 44 (39.3%) and 68 (60.7%) patients with former favorable risk were categorized into very favorable and favorable risk groups, respectively.

Both developed and developing nations have been equally affected and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) resulted in the death of millions of people worldwide. The virus is undergoing mutations and is evolving into variants that are responsible for wave after wave. This study was carried out to assess the clinical outcomes of people infected with the novel virus during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Methods The study was carried out between November 2021 and January 2022 and included 100 consecutive patients attending the hospital attached to the BLDE (Deemed to be University) Shri B.M. Patil Medical College, Bijapur, Karnataka, South India. All patients included in the study returned a positive report in a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patient details collected included age, sex, cycle threshold (Ct) values for envelope (E)/nucleocapsid (N), and Orf1b (open reading frame 1b) genes, hospitalization status, vaccine status, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and final clinical outcome. The data were entered into Microsoft Office Excel sheets, and statistical inferences were drawn using SPSS 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Of the 100 patients included in the study, only 14 (14%) patients were vaccinated. The patient's mean age was 34.22±17.50. Among the vaccinated patients, the majority had taken COVISHIELD™ (85.71%) compared to COVAXIN® (14.29%). Only 14% of patients were symptomatic, and the mean Ct values among all the patients were 29.92±3.74 (E gene/N gene) and 27.6±4.78 (Orf1B gene). Eight (8%) patients were hospitalized, and all the patients recovered from the infection. Among the hospitalized patients, six (75%) were vaccinated. The mean age of the hospitalized patients was 43.8±14.25 years. The mean CRP, D-dimer, and IL-6 concentrations among the hospitalized patients were noted to be 22.375±16.58 mg/L, 654.325±577.24 ng/mL, and 5.075±2.15 ng/mL, respectively. Conclusion The study results demonstrate that despite unvaccinated status, most patients in the third wave had only suffered from asymptomatic infection. Moreover, people who developed a clinical infection and those who required hospitalization had an uneventful recovery irrespective of their vaccination status.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

During the six months preceding his presentation, he had experienced increasing shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia with profound anemia (hemoglobin level 2.8 g/dL) along with evidence of acute kidney injury and acute heart failure; the patient was presumed to have multiorgan failure due to profound anemia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed dyspoiesis suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). There were no cytogenetic abnormalities observed. However, the blood workup analysis found low copper and ceruloplasmin levels, whereas zinc levels were excessively elevated (257 mg/dL). Upon inquiry, the patient reported taking an over-the-counter zinc supplement of an unknown quantity for over a year. After two months of copper treatment, his blood count returned to normal. This case highlights a rare presentation of zinc-induced copper deficiency resulting in pancytopenia and severe anemia-related multiorgan failure.

There are few studies regarding STEMI admissions and outcomes during the ongoing pandemic after the initial lockdown. We aimed to study STEMI admissions and in-hospital outcomes after the COVID-19 lockdown period. Methods A retrospective single-center study was conducted, collecting data for all consecutive STEMI admissions from March 9th, (the first COVID-19 case) until April 30th, the corresponding period of 2020 total lockdown, for years 2019 and 2021. The control period was considered the year 2019 [pre-pandemic (PP)] and the study period was in 2021 [ongoing pandemic (OP)]. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to compare all-STEMI admissions, invasive procedures, and risk ratio (RR) 95% CI to compare the mortality and complications rate between the study and control period. Results The study included 217 STEMI patients admitted in 2019, and 234 patients during the 2021 period. The overall-STEMI admissions IRR is in a similar range during the 2021 OP compared to the 2019 PP period IRR=1.07 (95%CI 0.90-1.28). Similar invasive procedures were observed during OP compared to PP period, respectively for coronary-angiography IRR= 1.07; (0.87-1.31), for all-PCI [1.12 (0.92-1.35)], and primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) [1.09 (0.89-1.34)]. The STEMI death rate during OP compared to PP period was similar (7.3 vs. 7.4%), RR=1.01 (0.53-1.96), and a non-significant lower primary-PCI-death rate (4.0 vs 4.8%), RR= 0.83 (0.30-2.3)]. Conclusions After the initial reduction of admissions and invasive procedures in STEMI patients during the 2020 lockdown period and the increase of all-STEMI mortality, the number of hospitalizations, invasive procedures, and mortality returned to a similar range during OP compared to the PP period despite a highly incident ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1504",35971369,"Comparison of Early Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Suture Fixation Versus Tack Fixation of Mesh in Laparoscopic Transabdominal Preperitoneal (TAPP) Repair of Inguinal Hernia.","The advent of laparoscopic techniques in repairing inguinal hernia has significantly improved outcomes of inguinal hernia surgery. However, acute and chronic postoperative pain after fixation of mesh with tacks and the cost of tacking devices are major hindrances to the widespread use of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair in resource-poor settings. This study sought to introduce a method of mesh fixation that will reduce the cost of laparoscopic TAPP repair and might help reduce postoperative pain. To compare outcomes in the early postoperative period like pain, seroma, hematoma, urinary retention, and neuralgia after fixation with suture versus the tack fixation of mesh in laparoscopic TAPP repair of inguinal hernia.  Subjects and methods: This study was conducted from 1st June 2019 to 31st May 2020. A total of 144 patients between ages 18 and 60 years with an inguinal hernia on any side and having an American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score of I/II were included in this study. Patients with a recurrent hernia, large scrotal hernia, strangulated and obstructed hernias, ASA III and ASA IV, prostatism, and chronic cough were excluded. Seventy-two patients were in Group A (tack fixation group) while 72 were in Group B (suture fixation group). Separate investigators were assigned to collect pre-operative and post-operative data from both groups, recorded on specially designed proforma.  The age range was 18 to 60 years with a mean age of 46.53 years ±10.01 S.D in Group A and 46.19 ±9.58 S.D in Group B. In Group A 98.6% of patients were male, and 1.4% were females while in Group B 100% of patients were male. It was found that mean pain in Group A was 4.88 ±0.887 and 5.29± 0.777 at 6 hours and 24 hours respectively. Mean pain in group B was 3.43 ±0.962 and 4.11±0.703 at 6 hours and 24 hours respectively. Moreover, mean pain in Group B was significantly less than mean pain in Group A both at 6 hours and 24 hours intervals with a p-value < 0.001. The early postoperative complications were not significantly different in both groups.  Conclusion: In TAPP repair, suture fixation of mesh is less painful than tack fixation. However, there is no significant difference in the rate of other early postoperative outcomes like seroma, hematoma, urinary retention, and neuralgia. Further multicentric studies with a longer duration of follow-up are needed to validate our results.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1505",35971374,"An Integrative Comparative Study Between Digoxin and Amiodarone as an Emergency Treatment for Patients With Atrial Fibrillation With Evidence of Heart Failure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","The emergency treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) involves utilizing two strategies. The first strategy normally involves permitting the atrial fibrillation to persevere as the ventricular rate is controlled. The other method involves utilizing anti-arrhythmic drugs in cardioversion and attempting to maintain sinus rhythm. Different pharmacological treatments, including digoxin and amiodarone, have been used to manage AF. A literature review on amiodarone and digoxin in the treatment of AF among patients with heart failure (HF) has shown that both drugs have potential risks. Therefore, we are conducting this systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of amiodarone and digoxin in the treatment of AF among patients with evidence of HF. A literature search of relevant articles was conducted on six electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar) from 2000 to 2022. The search yielded seven studies that had met the inclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis of four studies showed that there was no significant difference in the reduction of heart rate after treatment with either amiodarone or digoxin (mean difference (MD): -5.44; 95% confidence interval (CI): -9.53 to -1.34; I2 = 25%; p = 0.26). On the other hand, the statistical analysis showed that amiodarone had a better effect on the conversion to sinus rhythm than digoxin (63% versus 35%, respectively). Based on evidence from our meta-analysis, the clinical effect of amiodarone and digoxin in the emergency treatment of AF on heart rate control was unclear. However, amiodarone has a significant impact on the restoration of sinus rhythm compared with digoxin and can be considered the first-line drug regimen in conversion to sinus rhythm for AF patients with evidence of heart failure. However, the use of amiodarone and digoxin is complicated by adverse events and all-cause mortality.","meta_analysis","christiaan","meta_analysis"

It has triggered populist reactions within nation states and helped to discredit the intermediary institutions (parties and parliaments) that connect democratic will-formation and joint decision-making. This rise of populism and its alignment with nationalism, in consequence, hampers joint decision-making in the international realm. We argue that representative democracies can overcome the negative spiral between technocratic intergovernmentalism and nationalist populism by mutually granting their citizens the right to elect representatives not only in their domestic parliament, but also in the parliaments of 'consociated democracies'. Such a system of horizontally expanded and overlapping national democracies can serve three functions: it re-empowers citizens in a world of cross-border flows, it curbs the self-destructive polarization of party systems and it facilitates cooperation among democracies within the European Union (EU) and beyond. Finally, we discuss three competing approaches: Liberal Multilateralism, Deliberative Transnationalism and Republican Intergovernmentalism. We point to common ground, but also show how our approach avoids their main pitfalls.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Accordingly, CPs with these characteristics can lead to differences in their properties owing to these structural differences, being promising for their use as potential molecular switches with diverse applications. Herein, we have synthesized four Zn(II) CPs bearing α-acetamidocinnamic acid (HACA) and 4,4'-bipyridine (4,4'-bipy). The reaction between Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, HACA, and 4,4'-bipy yields {[Zn(ACA)2(4,4'-bipy)]·EtOH} n (1), which was used for the formation of three CPs through dissolution-recrystallization structural transformations (DRSTs): {[Zn(ACA)2(4,4'-bipy)]·2MeOH} n (2), {[Zn2(μ-ACA)2(ACA)2(4,4'-bipy)]·2H2O} n (3), and {[Zn3(μ-ACA)6(4,4'-bipy)]·0.75CHCl3} n (4). The study of the four crystal structures revealed that their secondary building units (SBUs) comprise monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric arrangements linked by 4,4'-bipy ligands. The fundamental role of the utilized solvent and/or temperature, as well as their effect on the orientation of the amide moieties driving the formation of the different SBUs is discussed. Furthermore, the reversibility and interconversion between the four CPs have been assayed. Finally, their solid-state photoluminescence has evinced that the effect of the amide moieties not only predetermine a different SBU but also lead to a different emission in 4 compared with 1-3.","misc","christiaan","misc"

In each case the triaza ligands, L/LH, direct the formation of {Mn3} triangles with their N atoms preferentially bonding to the Jahn-Teller axes of the MnIII ions. Subsequent self-assembly is dependent on the anion of the Mn salt and the identity of the organic coligand employed-the terminally bonded imidazole and the chelating/bridging amino acid. The {Mn3} triangles fold up on themselves in 1, forming a wheel. However, the syn, syn-bridging carboxylates in 2 prevent this from happening, instead directing the formation of a linear rod. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements reveal competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions in both complexes, the exchange being somewhat weaker in 1 due to the presence of MnII ions.","misc","christiaan","misc"

A chart review was performed for all the patients with KC who underwent CXL in the last 7 years. Data were compared at baseline and at all follow-up examinations for uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BCVA), keratometry (K), central corneal thickness, and complications of CXL. Pre- and post-intervention values were compared for each group. P < 0.05 was statistically significant. After the treatment, there was a statistically greater improvement in UCVA in the conventional CXL (CCXL) group (49%) compared to the ACXL group (34%) (P = 0.028). The improvement in BCVA was similar between the groups (P = 0.060). Gain of two lines of UCVA and stability were comparable between groups (P = 0.078 and P = 0.060, respectively). The average flat K and steep K values fluctuated remarkably across different follow-up assessments in both the groups. At 3 months of follow-up, there was a statistically significantly faster return to baseline levels of flat and steep Ks in the CCXL group (P = 0.028 and P = 0.002, respectively). The findings of the current study confirm the efficacy and safety of accelerated high-fluence CXL compared to CCXL. Both protocols were effective in stabilizing KC at 9th-month and the last follow-up visit.

All patients underwent combined wavefront-guided transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (TPRK) and accelerated corneal collagen cross-linking (ACXL) after intracorneal ring segment (ICRS) implantation. Different measures will be evaluated at baseline, after ICRS implantation, and at one, 3, 6, and 12 months after combined (TPRK and ACXL). These measurements are uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), corneal indices based on Scheimpflug tomography, and higher-order aberrations (HOAs) based on (Sirius, Schwind) tomography. There were significant improvements in logMAR (UDVA and CDVA) and reduction in sphere, manifest cylinder, MRSE, maximal keratometry, and mean keratometry after ICRS implantation in the first stage. After TPRK and ACXL as the second stage, there were significant improvements in visual acuity of both logMAR UDVA and CDVA. Reduction in refractive outcomes, including MRSE, sphere, and manifest cylinder. All corneal indices including steep, flat, mean, and maximal keratometries had been decreased. Furthermore, there were significant improvements in the final root mean square, HOAs, and coma aberrations from baseline. In moderate KC, triple therapy of ICRS implantation followed by combined TPRK and ACXL appears to be a safe and effective approach. This approach provides an improvement in visual acuity, refraction, corneal indices, and HOAs. These improvements were maintained for 1 year postoperatively.

In this single-blind, randomized clinical trial, 104 patients diagnosed with complete ACJ dislocation type V were treated using Ethibond sutures with either the loop technique or the two holes in the clavicle technique. Horizontal changes in the ACJ were radiographically assessed in the lateral axial view, and shoulder function was evaluated by the Constant (CS) and Taft (TS) scores at intervals of 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The horizontal stability of the ACJ was better with the two-hole technique than the loop technique at all measurement times. CS and TS changes showed a significant upward trend over time with both techniques. The mean CS and TS at the final visit were 95.2 and 11.6 with the loop technique and 94 and 11.9 with the two-hole technique, respectively. The incidence of superficial infections caused by the subcutaneous pins was the same in the two groups.

There was no significant benefit of antibiotic treatment on complication rates (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95 per cent c.i. 0.41 to 1.04). Antibiotics had a reduced treatment efficacy compared with appendicectomy (RR 0.75, 95 per cent c.i. 0.63 to 0.89). Antibiotic treatment at 1 year was successful in 1016 of 1613 (62.9 per cent) participants. There was a six-fold increase in hospital readmissions within 1 year of enrolment in participants receiving antibiotic treatment (RR 6.28, 95 per cent c.i. 2.87 to 13.74). There was no difference in index admission LOS (mean difference 0.15 days (95 per cent c.i. -0.05 to 0.35)). Earlier optimism regarding the benefits of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis does not persist at the same level now that further, large trials have been included. If antibiotic treatment is to be offered routinely as first-line therapy, patients should be counselled appropriately.","meta_analysis","christiaan","meta_analysis"

The sub-Saharan region of Africa bears a disproportionate burden of infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS. Needle and syringe programs have been shown to be effective in preventing transmission of infections among injection drug users by providing them with sterile injection equipment. The programs may also serve as avenues for addressing other issues that affect injection drug users. This review will consider published and unpublished studies on needle and syringe programs as a method of preventing blood-borne infections among injection drug users in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, systematic reviews and text and opinion papers will be considered for inclusion in the review. The electronic databases to be searched include MEDLINE, African Journals Online (AJOL), CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Embase, and TRoPHI. We will search for studies in English with no date limit as well as sources of unpublished studies and gray literature (conference abstracts, theses, etc).

Images are often used within the inpatient, outpatient, and community settings to facilitate interdisciplinary transfer of care, objective wound assessments, and accurate treatment decisions. An ever-changing and ever-improving selection of image-capturing devices have been created and studied in recent years. To improve future chronic wound care programs, there is a need to explore how accurately clinicians can diagnose specific wound characteristics using these images, especially when these devices are operated in the clinical setting. Peer-reviewed studies and unpublished/gray literature comparing image-assisted with face-to-face modalities for chronic wound care will be included. Chronic wounds include, but are not limited to, diabetic foot ulcers, ischemic lower limb ulcers, and pressure ulcers. Studies will be excluded if they examine acute wounds or if the reference standard is not face-to-face assessment. A comprehensive search of multiple databases and gray literature sources (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Health Source, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ProQuest Central) will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.

"1526",35972064,"Fathers' experience of depression during the perinatal period: a qualitative systematic review.","The objective of this review was to understand fathers' experiences of depression in the perinatal period, including how they recognize their depression, the emotions they experience, the impact of depression on their relationships, and their help-seeking behaviors and support. Whilst the prevalence of perinatal depression in men is now estimated to be just below that in women, no current care pathways for affected men exclusively exist in the United Kingdom. However, evidence demonstrates that paternal depression has severe consequences, affecting men's relationships with their partners and infants, their parenting behaviors, and the well-being of their children. This demonstrates a need to focus on the paternal experience of depression during this stage of life. This review included qualitative studies that included biological fathers over the age of 18. The phenomena of interest was depression or mental distress in fathers within the context of the perinatal period. All qualitative designs were included in the study with a focus on lived experiences of fathers. Searches for existing systematic reviews were carried out in March 2021 and no similar protocols or completed reviews were identified. Seven databases were searched in August 2021: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest Sociology, ProQuest Dissertations and Thesis Global, and OpenGrey. Search limits included English language and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Two reviewers assessed methodological quality, a third reviewer was not required when assessing quality since no disagreements arose. A standardized data extraction tool was used to extract and synthesize data. Confidence in the findings was subsequently assessed. Nine papers were included after full-text review, which were considered relevant to the research questions and which focused on fathers' experiences (n = 138), although only two focused specifically on depression. The overall quality of the studies was moderate. Overall, 109 findings were collated into 22 categories producing six synthesized findings. These were: mental health literacy around paternal perinatal depression is poor amongst men; relationships are experienced as both comforting and distressing in the perinatal period; new fathers do experience depression, but this is avoided, normalized, or hidden; fathers feel judged about mental health difficulties and so are reluctant to disclose them; help-seeking in fathers is prevented by non-targeted support for dads; and all men have the potential to become depressed because fatherhood is challenging. The review found that fathers may experience depression and negative emotions around the time their child is born, including anger, irritability, and resentment of the child. Men found their relationship changes difficult, feeling that fatherhood did not seem real until the baby was born. There was a significant lack of father-focused support for men, who were aware of stigma and social expectations of them. Men were not keen to seek help for their feelings, in part due to prioritizing the needs of the mother (and child) as more important. There is a need for greater attention on paternal perinatal depression through research and practice. PROSPERO CRD42021245894.","systematic_review","christiaan","systematic_review"
"1527",35972083,"Comparison of Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Videoangiography vs Postoperative Catheter Angiography to Confirm Microsurgical Occlusion of Spinal Dorsal Intradural Arteriovenous Fistulas.","Dorsal intradural arteriovenous fistulas (DI-AVFs) represent 80% of spinal AVFs. Microsurgical clip occlusion is a durable treatment that uses preoperative and postoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as standard practice. Intraoperative indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-VA) is a valuable intraoperative adjunct in these cases. Intraoperative ICG-VA findings have not been compared with postoperative DSA findings. To assess the diagnostic value of intraoperative ICG-VA vs postoperative DSA for spinal DI-AVFs. A multi-institutional database of vascular malformations was queried for all surgically managed cases of DI-AVF. Patients with both intraoperative ICG-VA and postoperative DSA were included. Demographic and radiologic data, intraoperative findings, and surgical outcomes data were retrospectively analyzed. Forty-five patients with DI-AVF were identified (male sex, 32; mean age, 61.9 [range, 26-85] years). All DI-AVFs were treated with interruption of the fistula with clip occlusion of the draining vein. Intraoperative ICG-VA showed complete obliteration in all patients. Postoperative DSA was performed for 40 patients and confirmed complete obliteration in all patients. The negative predictive value of ICG-VA confirming complete occlusion of the DI-AVFs was 100%. Eighteen patients (47%) experienced clinical improvement, and 16 (42%) experienced no change in condition. ICG-VA is useful for intraoperative identification of DI-AVFs and confirmation of complete microsurgical occlusion. Correlation between intraoperative ICG-VA and postoperative DSA findings demonstrates the diagnostic power of ICG-VA. This finding suggests that postoperative DSA is unnecessary when intraoperative ICG-VA confirms complete occlusion of the DI-AVF, which will spare patients the procedural risk and cost of this invasive procedure.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

In deformity spine surgery, it has been primarily directed to the more precise placement of pedicle screws. However, AR may also be used to generate high fidelity three-dimensional (3D) spine models for cases of advanced deformity with existing instrumentation. We present a case in which an AR-generated 3D model was used to facilitate and expedite the removal of embedded instrumentation and guide the reduction of an overriding spondyloptotic deformity. A young adult with a remote history of a motor vehicle accident treated with long-segment posterior spinal stabilization presented with increasing back pain and difficulty sitting upright in a wheelchair. Imaging revealed pseudoarthrosis with multiple rod fractures resulting in an overriding spondyloptosis of T6 on T9. An AR-generated 3D model was useful in the intraoperative localization of rod breaks and other extensively embedded instrumentation. Real-time model thresholding expedited the safe explanation of the defunct system and correction of the spondyloptosis deformity. An AR-generated 3D model proved instrumental in a revision case of hardware failure and high-grade spinal deformity.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This is especially important for the direct aspiration technique because of the large aspiration catheters that can reach an inner diameter of 0.072 in. A strategy that strikes a balance between stable proximal vessel support and distal navigation for aspiration is conceptually attractive. To describe a series of transradial posterior circulation thrombectomy procedures in which the aspiration catheter served a dual role of guide support and clot aspiration in a coaxial configuration, thus obviating a larger guide catheter. Patients selected in the series underwent radial artery access and direct over-the-wire navigation of the aspiration catheter into the vertebral artery. With coaxial microcatheter navigation, the aspiration catheter reached distal enough to ingest the clot successfully. Along with clinical and angiographic data, imaging features such as angle of vertebral artery origin were calculated. Five patients underwent a stand-alone aspiration catheter technique for basilar artery occlusion through transradial access. All procedures resulted in thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 3 recanalization. The mean time to basilar artery recanalization was 10 minutes. No access site complications or vertebral artery dissection were noted. The mean subclavian artery-vertebral origin angle was 84.06° (range 78.2-90.2°). For patients selected properly based on vascular anatomy and a careful technique, a large bore aspiration catheter can fulfil a stand-alone dual-role, thus obviating the need for a guide catheter. This can potentially improve the technical feasibility and success of transradial vertebrobasilar thrombectomy.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

Time-trend, monocentric study on MSM living with HIV who underwent HPV test at anal site from 2015 to 2019. Anal swabs were processed by multiplex real-time PCR to detect HPV genotypes. Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess linear trend in HPV prevalence over time and logistic regression models to estimate risk factors. Of the 1352 MSM living with HIV, 168 (12%) were not infected by any HPV genotypes and only 6 were infected with a maximum of 6 genotypes; prevalence of HR-HPV genotypes or those included in the 9-valent vaccine remained stable over time. At multivariable analysis, the risk of carrying at least one genotype classified as HR or included in Gardasil-9 was associated with younger age (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) for age< 30 vs > 45 (95% confidence interval) 2.714 (1.484-4.961), p=0.001 and 1.868 (1.141-3.060), p<0.013, respectively) and a history of gonorrhea (aOR 2.118 (1.100-4.078), p=0.025 and 1.785 (1.056-3.018), p=0.031, respectively).

We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) platform using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model (AI-CNN model) to evaluate the quality of bowel preparation before colonoscopy. This was a colonoscopist-blinded, randomized study. Enrolled patients were randomized into an experimental group, in which our AI-CNN model was used to evaluate the quality of bowel preparation (AI-CNN group), or a control group, which performed self-evaluation per routine practice (Control group). The primary outcome was the consistency (homogeneity) between the results of the two methods. The secondary outcomes included the quality of bowel preparation according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), the polyp detection rate (PDR), and the adenoma detection rate (ADR). A total of 1,434 patients were enrolled (AI-CNN, n = 730; Control, n = 704). No significant difference was observed between the evaluation results (pass or not pass) of the groups in terms of the adequacy of bowel preparation as represented by BBPS scores. The mean BBPS scores, PDRs, and ADRs were similar between the groups. These results indicated that the AI-CNN model and routine practice were generally consistent in the evaluation of bowel preparation quality. However, the mean BBPS score of patients with pass results were signiﬁcantly higher in the AI-CNN group than in the Control group, indicating that the AI-CNN model may further improve the quality of bowel preparation in patients exhibiting adequate bowel preparation. The novel AI-CNN model, which demonstrated comparable outcomes to the routine practice, may serve as an alternative approach for evaluating bowel preparation quality before colonoscopy.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"

We therefore reviewed cases of tDSMs diagnosed on fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at our referral center to identify pre- and postnatal MRI imaging features associated with long-term outcomes. We searched our imaging database for fetal and postnatal MRI reports of tDSM cases. The electronic medical record was then reviewed for pre- and postnatal clinical data, including follow-up imaging. Neurological outcomes were characterized using the previously reported scale based on the Bicêtre Score. Imaging features association with outcome scores were compared using the Fisher exact test. Sixteen cases of tDMS diagnosed by fetal MRI with postnatal clinical follow-up were identified, 11 of whom underwent postnatal MRI. The majority of cases of tDSM (73%) decreased in size or resolved on postnatal follow-up study without treatment. Restricted diffusion and parenchymal hemorrhage on fetal MRI were the only imaging features identified significantly associated with unfavorable neurological outcome or death, present in two patients with poor outcomes (two of two) and only one with a normal outcome (one of 14) (P = 0.025). Findings of tDSM on fetal MRI most often regress and/or resolve with normal or mild neurological outcomes, with the most significant predictor of poor outcome being the presence of parenchymal injury on fetal MRI.

This is particularly true when choice architects attempt to change behavior that is collectively harmful but individually beneficial, such as dishonesty. Here, we introduce the concept of meta-nudging and illustrate its potential benefits in the context of promoting honesty. The meta-nudging approach implies that instead of nudging end-users directly, one would nudge them indirectly via social influencers. That is, one can arguably achieve better success by changing the behavior of those who have the ability to enforce other's behavior and norm adherence. We argue that this represents a promising new behavior change approach that helps overcome some of the challenges that the classical nudging approach has faced. We use the case of nudging honesty to develop the theoretical foundation of meta-nudging and discuss avenues for future work.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Data are from two British non-probability online surveys with: (i) emerging adults (16-24 years; n = 3,549; July/August 2019) and (ii) regular sports bettors (18+; n = 3,195; November 2020). Among current gamblers, logistic regressions examined whether reporting that gambling marketing had prompted unplanned spend (vs never) was associated with past-month marketing awareness, past-month receipt of direct marketing (e.g., e-mails), following gambling brands on social media, and problem gambling classification. Almost a third of current gamblers reported that marketing had prompted unplanned gambling spend (sports bettors: 31.2 %; emerging adults: 29.5 %). Escalated severity of problem gambling was associated with reporting that marketing had prompted unplanned spend in both samples, in particular those experiencing gambling problems compared to those experiencing no problems (sports bettors: ORAdj = 17.01, 95 % CI: 10.61-27.27; emerging adults: ORAdj = 11.67, 95 % CI: 6.43-21.12).

Biogen ONE™, an ongoing Canadian support program, facilitates access to DMF for patients with MS and maintains a database for the purposes of service provision. These data were utilized to assess adherence, persistence, discontinuations, and other outcomes between 2013 and 2021. This non-interventional, retrospective study examined real-world use of DMF prescribed to patients with MS in Canada who were enrolled in the program and received their first dose between April 1, 2013, and June 30, 2021. Follow-up visits and laboratory monitoring occurred based on local standards and per the Canadian product monograph. For adherence and persistence assessments, patients must have had DMF dispensed by specialty pharmacies. Data were collected at patient enrollment, program exit, and throughout the duration of the program. The primary objective was to assess treatment adherence rates to DMF. Secondary objectives included treatment persistence rates, reasons for discontinuation, absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs), and patient characteristics throughout the duration of the program. Overall, 12,608 DMF patients from the program were included between April 1, 2013, and June 30, 2021. At enrollment, mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 40.6 (10.7) years and mean (SD) Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was 2.2 (1.4). DMF was initiated as first-line DMT in 48.8% of patients. Of patients assessed (n = 6,848), 90.4% were adherent to DMF (based on medication possession ratio [MPR] ≥ 80%). Adherence (mean MPR) was marginally greater in DMT-naïve than switch patients, and in younger (< 40 years) than older (≥ 40 years) patients (both p < 0.001). Overall persistence on DMF at 24 months was 57.0%. Greater proportions of DMT-naïve patients persisted on DMF versus switch patients at all time points assessed. Persistence rates were comparable between female and male patients for up to 24 months, and between younger (< 40 years) and older (≥ 40 years) patients for up to 36 months. Older patients were more likely to discontinue for reasons related to lymphocytes (≥ 40 years, 16.1% vs. < 40 years, 6.1%) while efficacy reasons were reported with greater frequency in younger patients (≥ 40 years, 10.5% vs. < 40 years, 16.0%). Discontinuations due to gastrointestinal and flushing events occurred most frequently during the first month of treatment and decreased thereafter. Mean ALC decreased during the first year on treatment and subsequently plateaued. Over successive years, changes were observed in characteristics of patients starting on DMF, including decreases in EDSS score, age, and time since diagnosis. The proportion of DMT-naïve patients increased over the years (2013-2014, 26%-27%; 2018-2021, 62%-67%). High adherence was found in patients on DMF treatment within the Biogen support program with access to specialty pharmacies. The evolution of the patient population throughout the years suggests a shift towards earlier treatment. These real-world data may support the value of a support program in optimizing the management of patients on DMF treatment. Support programs provide personalized treatment monitoring, which can help minimize early discontinuations and improve adherence to treatment.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

The lesion locations, resected regions, and invasive exploration techniques were studied to assess their relationship with postoperative motor deficits. Forty-one patients were included. Twenty-three patients suffered from a transient motor deficit, and 2 had permanent disabilities after surgery. Six patients with lesions at the posterior bank of the precentral sulcus underwent resection, and 5 experienced short-term motor deficits. Two patients with lesions adjacent to the anterior part of the precentral gyrus, in whom the adjacent precentral gyrus was removed, experienced permanent motor deficits. Lesions located at the bottom of the central sulcus and invading the anterior bank of the central sulcus were observed in 3 patients. The patients did not experience permanent motor deficits after surgery. The anterior bank of the central sulcus is indispensable for motor function, and destruction of this region would inevitably cause motor deficits. The anterior bank of the precentral gyrus can also be removed without motor impairment if there is a preexisting epileptogenic lesion.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

We sought to evaluate participant engagement, perceived self-efficacy and website usage in a preliminary evaluation of My Kidneys My Health, a patient-facing eHealth tool in Canada. We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study of adults with CKD who were not on kidney replacement therapy and who had access to My Kidneys My Health for 8 weeks. Outcomes included acceptance (measured by the Technology Acceptance Model), self-efficacy (measured by the Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale [CDSES]) and website usage patterns (captured using Google Analytics). We analyzed participant interviews using qualitative content analysis. Twenty-nine participants with CKD completed baseline questionnaires, of whom 22 completed end-of-study questionnaires; data saturation was achieved with 15 telephone interviews. Acceptance was high, with more than 70% of participants agreeing or strongly agreeing that the website was easy to use and useful. Of the 22 who completed end-of-study questionnaires, 18 (82%) indicated they would recommend its use to others and 16 (73%) stated they would use the website in the future. Average scores for website satisfaction and look and feel were 7.7 (standard deviation [SD] 2.0) and 8.2 (SD 2.0) out of 10, respectively. The CDSES indicated that participants gained an increase in CKD information. Interviewed participants reported that the website offered valuable information and interactive tools for patients with early or newly diagnosed CKD, or for those experiencing changes in health status. Popular website pages and interactive features included Food and Diet, What is CKD, My Question List and the Depression Screener. Participants indicated that the My Kidneys My Health website provided accessible content and tools that may improve self-efficacy and support in CKD self-management. Further evaluation of the website's effectiveness in supporting self-management among a larger, more heterogenous population is warranted.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

We analyzed calls to the British Columbia poison centre to describe caller-declared exposures to kratom and the acute health effects of these exposures. For this descriptive analysis, we accessed electronic records, including transcriptions and extracted variables, of calls specifying kratom exposure managed by the BC Drug and Poison Information Centre (DPIC) from 2012 to 2019. We describe changes in case numbers, reasons for exposure, concurrent drug exposures and clinical outcomes over the study period. We identified 32 cases during the study period. In 23 cases (72%), the DPIC was consulted by a health care worker. Case numbers increased from 0 in 2012 to 9 in 2019. Numbers were highest for males in their 20s (n = 17, 53%). A total of 27 cases (84%) involved ingestion, with online distributors and local stores named as sources of procurement. A concurrent drug exposure was identified in 13 (41%) cases. There were no deaths; in 1 case, the exposed individual was intubated to manage agitation following kratom withdrawal. We observed a steady increase in kratom-related poison centre calls from 2012 to 2019, especially in young adult males. Rising call numbers may reflect increasing availability of kratom and may be a consequence of BC's opioid crisis, with kratom used by some to lessen symptoms of opioid withdrawal.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1544",35973711,"Transitioning to virtual ambulatory care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study of faculty and resident physician perspectives.","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a rapid shift from in-person to virtual care delivery for many medical specialties across Canada. The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of resident physicians and faculty related to teaching, learning and assessment during ambulatory virtual care encounters within the competency-based medical education model. In this qualitative phenomenological study, we recruited resident physicians (postgraduate year [PGY] 1-5 trainees) and faculty from the Departments of Surgery and Medicine at Queen's University, Ontario, via purposive sampling. Participants were not required to have exposure to virtual care. Interviews were conducted from September 2020 to March 2021 by 1 researcher, and 2 researchers conducted focus groups via Zoom to explore participants' experiences with the transition to virtual care. These were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim; qualitative data were analyzed thematically. There were 18 male and 19 female participants; 20 were resident physicians and 17 were faculty; 19 were from the Department of Surgery and 18 from the Department of Medicine. All faculty participants had participated in virtual care during ambulatory care; 2 PGY-1 residents in surgery had not actively participated in virtual care, although they had participated in clinics where faculty were using virtual care. The mean age of faculty participants was 38 (standard deviation [SD] 8.6) years, and the mean age of resident physicians was 29 (SD 5.4) years. Overall, 28 interviews and 4 focus groups (range 2-3 participants per group) were conducted, and 4 themes emerged: teaching and learning, assessment, logistical considerations, and suggestions. Barriers to teaching included the lack of direct observations and teaching time, and barriers to assessment included an absence of specific Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) and feedback focused on virtual care-related competencies. Logistical challenges included lack of technological infrastructure, insufficient private office space and administrative burdens. Both resident physicians and faculty did not foresee virtual care limiting resident physicians' ability to progress within competency-based medical education. Benefits of virtual care included increased accessibility to patients for follow-up visits, for disclosing patients' results and for out-of-town visits. Suggestions included faculty development, improved access to technology and space, educational guidelines for conducting virtual care encounters, and development of virtual care-specific competencies and EPAs. In the postgraduate program we studied, virtual care imposed substantial barriers on teaching, learning and assessment during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapting to new circumstances such as virtual care with suggestions from resident physicians and faculty may help to ensure the continuity of postgraduate medical education throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Aconitine was more toxic than veratrine, with an LD50 of 157 ng/mg compared to 376 ng/mg, on the pyrethroid-susceptible Orlando strain, but only aconitine showed significant resistance in the pyrethroid-resistant Puerto Rico strain (RR = 14.6 in topical application and 8.8 in larval bioassay). When applied in mixtures with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and NP, large synergism values were obtained on the Orlando strain. Aconitine + PBO mixture synergized NP 21.8-fold via topical adult application and 10.2-fold in larval bioassays, whereas veratrine + PBO synergized NP 5.3-fold via topical application and 30.5-fold in larval bioassays. Less synergism of NP was observed on the resistant Puerto Rico strain, with acontine + PBO synergizing NP only 4.1-fold in topical application (8-fold in larval bioassays) and veratrine + PBO synergizing NP 9.5-fold in topical application (13.3-fold in larval bioassays). When alkaloids were applied directly to the mosquito larval nervous system, veratrine was nearly equipotent on both strains, while aconitine was less active on pyrethroid-resistant nerve preparations (no block at 10 μM compared to block at 1 μM on the susceptible strain). The nerve blocking effect of NP was significantly synergized by both compounds on the pyrethroid-susceptible strain by about 10-fold, however only veratrine synergized NP block on the pyrethroid-resistant strain, also showing 10-fold synergism). These results highlight the potential of site II sodium channel activators as insecticides and their ability to synergize pyrethroids, which may extend the commercial lifetime of these chemistries so essential to public health vector control.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Horizontal transmission of plant viruses by aphids occurs during distinct feeding behavioral events, such as probing for non-persistent viruses or phloem feeding for persistent viruses. We employed toxicity bioassays and electrical penetration graph (EPG) methodology to compare toxicity and quantify changes to feeding behavior and toxicity of A. gossypii after exposure to commercialized aphicides. Commercialized aphicides containing flupyradifurone, sulfoxaflor, thiamethoxam, thiamethoxam + lambda cyhalothrin, and bifenthrin induced >90% aphid mortality within 4 h of exposure. Flupyradifurone was the most acutely toxic aphicide studied with an LT50 of 8.9 min after exposure, which was approximately 3-fold lower than bifenthrin and thiamethoxam + lambda cyhalothrin. This was supported by our EPG results that showed a significant reduction in the proportion of aphids that continued to probe on cotton 4 h after exposure to flonicamid, thiamethoxam, flupyradifurone, bifenthrin, and thiamethoxam + lambda cyhalothrin. The commercialized aphicides containing spirotetramat, flonicamid, thiamethoxam, flupyradifurone, bifenthrin, sulfoxaflor, and pymetrozine significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the time to first probe when compared to the untreated control. Lastly, E1 (phloem salivation) and E2 (phloem ingestion) waveforms were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced for flupyradifurone, flonicamid, thiamethoxam, sulfoxaflor, and thiamethoxam. These data provide a comparative study for the development of new aphicides aiming to induce acute lethality and reduce aphid transmission of plant viruses.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1547",35973767,"Knockdown of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase and chitin synthase A increases the insecticidal efficiency of Lufenuron to Spodoptera exigua.","Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) has been responsible for causing considerable and widespread agricultural losses worldwide. Owing to strong selective pressure, S. exigua showed increased resistance to Lufenuron (LUF). Consequently, RNA interference (RNAi)-based insecticides had more benefits than chemical insecticides. Therefore, to enhance the insecticidal activity of LUF to S. exigua, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate the impact of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) on S. exigua larval susceptibility to LUF. First, the transcriptome of S. exigua was sequenced following the treatment with LUF. By comparing the upregulated and downregulated GO enrichment, chitin binding and chitin metabolic processes were the significantly enriched pathways. According to transcriptome sequencing, 8 genes associated with chitin biosynthesis, 8 chitin degradation genes, and 17 cuticle protein genes were obtained. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP) and Chitin synthase A (CHSA) showed significantly downregulated expression after treatment with different sublethal doses of LUF. Downregulation of UAP increased mortality from 31.97% to 47.91% when the larvae were exposed to LUF. A significant increase in the mortality of S. exigua from 30.63% to 50.19% was observed following LUF administration after dsCHSA. In addition, the expression analysis of genes associated with chitin biosynthesis was significantly changed after LUF treatment, dsRNAs-RNAi, and their combination (LUF-dsRNAs). Significant differences were observed in the chitin content between the control group at 72 h after treatments. Results of the present study can help further elucidate the understanding of the combined effects of RNAi and LUF on S. exigua. Additionally, this research provides a suitable foundation for future studies with the aim to develop an efficient method of delivery for large-scale pest control in the fields.","misc","christiaan","misc"

However, the function of ATF2 in insects remains unknown. Here, we isolated the ATF2 gene from Apis cerana cerana (AccATF2) and found that AccATF2 was a main regulator of the honeybee response to oxidative stress. Our results showed that AccATF2 was highly expressed in the head, thorax and integument. AccATF2 was expressed throughout the development period of honeybees, and the highest AccATF2 transcript level was noted in brown-eyed pupae, indicating its indispensable roles in honeybee survival. Antioxidant function analysis showed that AccATF2 expression was markedly induced in response to oxidative stress caused by various environmental stresses. AccATF2 overexpression substantially enhanced the tolerance to oxidative stress of Escherichia coli cells compared with control cells. AccATF2 knockdown significantly increased the production of malondialdehyde (MDA), the transcription of antioxidant genes and the activity of antioxidant enzymes in honeybees, suggesting that AccATF2 knockdown resulted in oxidative damage to honeybees. Moreover, AccATF2 knockdown decreased honeybee resistance to oxidative stress caused by high temperature. Overall, AccATF2 plays an important role in maintaining redox homeostasis and protecting honeybees from oxidative stress caused by various environmental stimuli. Our discoveries add to a growing understanding of how honeybees cope with various adverse environmental conditions to ensure their survival.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1549",35973773,"Proteome analysis reveals the molecular basis of honeybee brain and midgut response to sulfoxaflor.","Sulfoxaflor is a widely used pesticide in agriculture. However, the molecular effects of sublethal sulfoxaflor on honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) remain elusive. Here, the effects of a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor (0.05 μg/bee) on the brain and midgut proteome response of the honeybee were investigated. Exposure to sublethal sulfoxaflor doses did not cause significant honeybee death, but it induced significant alterations in the brain and midgut proteomes. After sulfoxaflor challenge, 135 and 28 proteins were differentially regulated in the brain and midgut, respectively. The up-regulated proteins were mainly implicated in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter transport and drug metabolism processes, and included in particular enzymes of the citrate cycle and cellular respiration process, such as ATP citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunits, and NADH dehydrogenase. These findings suggest that honeybees enhance energy metabolism in the midgut and brain to resist sulfoxaflor challenge. Notably, treatment with sulfoxaflor resulted in a 6.8 times increase in expression levels of the major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJP1) in the brain, and knockdown of MRJP1 mRNA expression using RNA interference significantly decreased the survival rate, indicating that MRJP1 may play an important role in sulfoxaflor tolerance. Our data reveals that sulfoxaflor influences multiple processes related to both metabolism and the nervous system, and provides novel insights into the molecular basis of the honeybee brain and midgut response to sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Common symptoms at onset include lower back, abdominal or flank pain. Pain is frequently referred to the hip, to the groin and to the lateral regions of the leg, often with nocturnal exacerbations and not responding to position changes. The disease is commonly associated with signs of systemic inflammatory response (malaise, fever, and anorexia and weight loss). Glucocorticoids are considered the cornerstone of the therapy. The use of other immunosuppressive agents, including cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and biological agents such as rituximab, tocilizumab and infliximab have been reported as a valuable option mostly in case reports, cases series and small studies.

The group comprised 17 men and 3 women with the mean age of 49 years (range, 2178). Radiographs of the shoulder joint followed by CT examination, including 3D reconstructions, were performed in all patients. This documentation allowed assessment of the scapular fracture pattern and type of injury to the AC joint. AC dislocation was associated with a simple scapular fracture in 15 cases (7 fractures of the coracoid base, 4 fractures of the acromion or the lateral spine, 2 fractures of the scapular body, 1 fracture of the superior and 1 fracture of the inferior glenoid). In 5 cases AC dislocation accompanied multiple or complex scapular fractures (once a combination of a coracoid fracture and a fracture of the lateral scapular spine, once a combination of a fracture of the superior glenoid and of the acromion, 2 cases of a complex intraarticular fracture and 1 case of scapulothoracic dissociation). AC dislocation is relatively infrequent injury accompanying scapular fractures. It is most commonly associated with fractures of coracoid, acromion/lateral spine or superior glenoid.

In most cases, the condition is accompanied by associated traumas responsible for poor prognosis. Signs of diaphragmatic rupture are often masked by more serious manifestations of the associated trauma. The rupture is usually revealed by an X-ray of the chest or CT scan. However, a minor defect may be missed, especially if the patient is not indicated for urgent surgery. The authors present 2 case reports of patients treated for chronic diaphragmatic rupture at the Department of Surgery of the Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital in Pilsen between 01 January 2009 and 31 December 2021. The aim was to analyze the clinical data and to compare this data with literature. Both patients with the chronic diaphragmatic rupture were men in their productive age. The mechanism of their primary trauma was a traffic accident. In the first case, the rupture was diagnosed 6 years after the trauma. The second case was diagnosed 14 years after the primary trauma. The diaphragmatic rupture was present on the left side in the first case and on the right in the other. Both patients underwent suture of the diaphragmatic defect via thoracotomy. Unrecognized diaphragmatic rupture is a severe condition that can result in a life-threatening complication, namely incarceration of abdominal organs dislocated to the chest. It is necessary to keep this diagnosis in mind in patients with gastrointestinal or respiratory problems after a previous high-energy, blunt-force abdominal and thoracic injury, even many years after the trauma.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We conducted a retrospective study from January 1997 to June 2018 at Samsung Medical Center. A total of 50 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients who underwent total thyroidectomy + both central neck dissection (CND) + modified radical neck dissection (MRND) (unilateral or bilateral) was enrolled. The median follow-up duration was 60.8 months (range, 6.2-247 months). The mean age was 14.6 years, and the mean tumor size was 2.9 cm. Mean size of the largest metastatic LN was 1.5 cm. Mean value of central LNR was 0.6, and mean value of lateral LNR was 0.3. Largest metastatic LN size [HR = 2.0 (95% CI 1.0-4.0), p = 0.040] and lateral LNR [HR = 43.6 (95% CI 2.2-871.0), p = 0.014] were significant prognostic factors for recurrence.

Three groups of pubertal boys aged 13-15 years were recruited, including a control group (which included 13 untrained adolescents), a moderately trained group (which included 13 non-elite weightlifters, with four sessions of 2 hours per week) and a highly trained group (which included 13 elite weightlifters, with eight sessions of 2 hours per week). The three groups were paired for age and maturation index (using Tanner stages). Body composition, bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD were evaluated by dual-energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA). Physical performance variables (including weightlifting specific exercises, counter movement jump and squat jump) were measured using validated methods. Results showed that the values of BMD and physical performance variables were greater in the group of elite weightlifters compared to the group of non-elite weightlifters and the control group. In addition, the values of BMD and physical performance variables were higher in the group of the non-elite weightlifters compared to those of the control group. After adjusting for lean mass and squat jump, lumbar spine BMD, FN BMD, UL BMD and LL BMD remained significantly higher in the elite weightlifters' group compared to the two other groups.

However, the protective effect of VV ECMO on the lung, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are still unknown. We investigated the role of VV ECMO in preventing lung injury in vivo using a rat model. Additionally, the effects of Hippo/YAP signaling on alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2)-mediated alveolar epithelial recovery in VV ECMO rats were also investigated. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, RNA sequencing, lung injury, edema, and cytokine expression were evaluated. VV ECMO significantly improved severe hypoxemia, reduced lung edema, and inflammatory response, and altered alveolar epithelial function, as indicated by reduced protein concentrations in BALF. This was associated with Hippo/YAP signaling activation, according to RNA sequencing analysis. Furthermore, we discovered that after VV ECMO, AT2 cells proliferated and differentiated, and this increase in AT2 cell activity was correlated to the increased nuclear expression of YAP, which is critical for alveolar epithelial recovery from lung injury. During VV ECMO, verteporfin-induced YAP inhibition and the loss of the oxygenator delayed lung alveolar epithelial recovery and led to a prolonged inflammatory response. These findings suggest that VV ECMO protects against lung injury by activating the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. Strategies aimed at increasing YAP activity in AT2 cells could thus aid alveolar epithelial recovery, making VV ECMO easier for lung transplantation.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Peripheral vascular disease is growing in its burden and impact; however it is currently under researched, and there are a lack of strong, non-invasive therapeutic options for the clinicians. Carnosine is a dipeptide stored particularly in muscle and brain tissue, which exhibits a wide range of physiological activities, which may be beneficial as an adjunct treatment for peripheral vascular disease. Carnosine's strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiglycating actions may aid in the prevention of plaque formation, through protective actions on the vascular endothelium, and the inhibition of foam cells. Carnosine may also improve angiogenesis, exercise performance and vasodilatory response, while protecting from ischemic tissue injury. Carnosine may have a role as an adjunct treatment for peripheral vascular disease alongside typical exercise and surgical interventions, and may be used in high risk individuals to aid in the prevention of atherogenesis. This review identifies a beneficial role for carnosine supplementation in the management of patients with peripheral vascular disease, in conjunction with exercise and revascularization.

We find that the temporal evolution of the GPE data is accurately predicted by the WKE, with no adjustable parameters, for about two nonlinear kinetic times. Qualitative agreement between the GPE and the WKE persists also for longer times with some quantitative deviations that may be attributed to the combination of a breakdown of the theoretical assumptions underlying the WKE as well as numerical issues. Furthermore, we study how the wave statistics evolves toward Gaussianity in a timescale of the order of the kinetic time.

This has recently been shown [A. Gupta and D. Vincenzi, J. Fluid Mech. 870, 405 (2019)0022-112010.1017/jfm.2019.224; V. Dzanic et al., J. Fluid Mech. 937, A31 (2022)0022-112010.1017/jfm.2022.103] to introduce unphysical artifacts with a detrimental impact on simulations. In this Letter, we propose that artificial diffusion is limited to regions where stress gradients are steep instead of seeking the zero-diffusivity limit. Through the cellular forcing and four-roll mill problem, we demonstrate that this modified artificial diffusivity is devoid of unphysical artifacts, allowing all features of elastic turbulence to be retained. Results are found to conform with direct simulations, reducing the impact of artificial diffusivity from a qualitative scale to a quantitative scale while only requiring a fraction of the numerical resolution.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1562",35974499,"Non-Markovian thermal operations boosting the performance of quantum heat engines.","It is investigated whether non-Markovianity, i.e., the memory effects resulting from the coupling of the system to its environment, can be beneficial for the performance of quantum heat engines. Specifically, two physical models are considered. The first one is a well-known single-qubit Otto engine; the non-Markovian behavior is there implemented by replacing standard thermalization strokes with so-called extremal thermal operations which cannot be realized without the memory effects. The second one is a three-stroke engine in which the cycle consists of two extremal thermal operations and a single qubit rotation. It is shown that the non-Markovian Otto engine can generate more work-per-cycle for a given efficiency than its Markovian counterpart, whereas performance of both setups is superior to the three-stroke engine. Furthermore, both the non-Markovian Otto engine and the three-stroke engine can reduce the work fluctuations in comparison with the Markovian Otto engine, with their relative advantage depending on the performance target. This demonstrates the beneficial influence of non-Markovianity on both the average performance and the stability of operation of quantum heat engines.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1563",35974501,"Learning through atypical phase transitions in overparameterized neural networks.","Current deep neural networks are highly overparameterized (up to billions of connection weights) and nonlinear. Yet they can fit data almost perfectly through variants of gradient descent algorithms and achieve unexpected levels of prediction accuracy without overfitting. These are formidable results that defy predictions of statistical learning and pose conceptual challenges for nonconvex optimization. In this paper, we use methods from statistical physics of disordered systems to analytically study the computational fallout of overparameterization in nonconvex binary neural network models, trained on data generated from a structurally simpler but hidden network. As the number of connection weights increases, we follow the changes of the geometrical structure of different minima of the error loss function and relate them to learning and generalization performance. A first transition happens at the so-called interpolation point, when solutions begin to exist (perfect fitting becomes possible). This transition reflects the properties of typical solutions, which however are in sharp minima and hard to sample. After a gap, a second transition occurs, with the discontinuous appearance of a different kind of atypical structures: wide regions of the weight space that are particularly solution dense and have good generalization properties. The two kinds of solutions coexist, with the typical ones being exponentially more numerous, but empirically we find that efficient algorithms sample the atypical, rare ones. This suggests that the atypical phase transition is the relevant one for learning. The results of numerical tests with realistic networks on observables suggested by the theory are consistent with this scenario.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Active many-body systems usually break such symmetries intrinsically, on the particle level, so that their collective behavior is often more naturally interpreted as a result of information exchange. Here we study numerically how information spreads from a leader particle through an initially aligned flock, described by the Vicsek model without noise. In the low-speed limit of a static spin lattice, we find purely conductive spreading, reminiscent of heat transfer. Swarm motility and heterogeneity can break reciprocity and spin conservation. But what seems more consequential for the swarm response is that the dispersion relation acquires a significant convective contribution along the leader's direction of motion.","misc","christiaan","misc"

It is observed that introducing intermittency in the interaction term as a function of time or the system state predictably alters the dynamics of the constituent oscillators. Choosing the nature of the interaction, attractive or repulsive, allows for either suppression of oscillations or stimulation of activity. Two parameters Δ and τ, that reign the extent of interaction among subsystems, are introduced. They serve as a harness to access the entire range of possible behaviors from fixed points to chaos. For fixed values of system parameters and coupling strength, changing Δ and τ offers fine control over the dynamics of coupled subsystems. We show this experimentally using coupled Chua's circuits and elucidate their behavior for a range of coupling parameters through detailed numerical simulations.","misc","christiaan","misc"

In this paper, the evolution properties of collisions between RWs are studied numerically for two-component coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. We find that whether a second-order RW can be successfully excited strongly depends on the location and time of the first-order RWs encountered. Only when the highest peaks of two RWs meet at the same position at the same time, can the standard second-order RW be triggered and its structure is in good agreement with the exact solution. Further, we demonstrate that such results are also applicable to the collision of subordinate RWs. This paper not only reveals the collision properties of RWs, but also provides a feasible scheme to generate higher-order RWs for experimental realization.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1569",35974526,"Stress-free morphing by means of compatible distortions.","We study the morphing of three-dimensional objects within the framework of nonlinear elasticity with large distortions. A distortion field induces a target metric, and the configuration which is effectively realized by a material body is the one that minimizes the distance, measured through the elastic energy, between the target metric and the actual one. Morphing through distortions might have a paramount feature: the resulting configurations might be stress-free; if this is the case, the distortions field is called compatible. We maintain that the morphing through compatible distortions is a key strategy exploited by many soft biological materials, which can exhibit very large shape-change in response to distortions controlled by stimuli such as chemicals or temperature changes, while keeping their stress state almost null. Thus, the study of compatible distortions, and of the related shape-changes, is quite important. Here, we show a blueprint for stress-free morphing based on the notions of metric tensor and of Riemann curvature which can be used to design large morphing of three-dimensional objects.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We first validated the present DI-LBM through some classical benchmark problems, and then investigated the effect of electric field on the lateral migration of the particle in the Poiseuille flow. The numerical results show that the electric field has a significant influence on the particle migration. When an electric field in the vertical direction is applied to the charged particle initially located above the centerline of the channel, the equilibrium position of the particle would drop suddenly as the electric field is larger than a critical value. This is caused by the wall repulsion due to lubrication, the inertial lift related to shear slip, the lift owing to particle rotation, the lift due to the curvature of the undisturbed velocity profile, and the electric force. On the other hand, when an electric field in the horizontal direction is adopted, the equilibrium position of the particle would move toward the centerline of the channel with the increase of the electric field.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The swimming is due to a propulsion force, and the fluctuations are typically thermal in origin. We present a two-dimensional model where the fluctuations arise from nonthermal noise in a propelling force acting at a single point, such as that due to a flagellum. We take the overdamped limit and find several modifications to the traditional ABP model. Since the fluctuating force causes a fluctuating torque, the diffusion tensor describing the process has a coupling between translational and rotational degrees of freedom. An anisotropic particle also exhibits a mass-dependent noise-induced drift, which does not disappear in the overdamped limit. We show that these effects have measurable consequences for the long-time diffusivity of active particles, in particular adding a contribution that is independent of where the force acts.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This scenario provides a justifiable avenue to test the dilatation of the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT). Through a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we have shown how the Loschmidt echo, Fisher zero, and Dynamical topological order parameter (DTOP) transit from one to two dimensions. Owing to the introduced pseudomomentum, the derivative of the return rate does not always capture the DQPT well, but the Fisher zero and the DTOP can be treated as faithful indicators. A topology-independent parameter will also affect the occurrence of the DQPTs for quenches inside a given phase. Moreover, a comparison with the Haldane model owning the same phase diagram implies that a pair of fixed points will lead to different critical momentum distributions, thus different robustness, further reminding us that the correspondences between the equilibrium and dynamical phases transitions are multifarious.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We experimentally study bilayer strips as they swell and fold, and we propose a simple model to explain the emergence of ratchetlike behavior. Experiments and model predictions are then compared to simulations, which enable calculation of elastic energy during swelling. We investigate the dependence of this steplike behavior as a function of elastic boundary condition strength, strip length, and strip shape; interestingly, V-shape strips with the same boundary conditions fold smoothly.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Commonly, the transition statistics are power-law distributed, implying that quantum dots possess at least trivial memories. By investigating the temporal correlations in the blinking data, we demonstrate with high statistical confidence that there is nontrivial memory between the on and off brightness duration data of blinking quantum dots. We define nontrivial memory to be statistical complexity greater than one. We show that this memory cannot be discovered using the transition distribution. We show by simulation that this memory does not arise from standard data manipulations. Finally, we conclude that at least three physical mechanisms can explain the measured nontrivial memory: (1) storage of state information in the chemical structure of a quantum dot; (2) the existence of more than two intensity levels in a quantum dot; and (3) the overlap in the intensity distributions of the quantum dot states, which arises from fundamental photon statistics.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The attempt is motivated by a realization of Dyson's Coulomb gas in the context of quantum condensates. By starting with the time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg (LG) theory, the dynamics of the vortex gas is constructed, which is governed by the canonical equation of motion. The dynamics of point vortices is converted to the Langevin equation, which results in the generalized Fokker-Planck (GFP) (or Smolkovski) equation using the functional integral on the ansatz of the Gaussian white noise. The GFP, which possesses a non-Hermitian property, is characterized by two regimes called the overdamping and the underdamping regimes. In the overdamping regime, where the dissipation is much larger that the vortex strength, the GFP becomes the standard Fokker-Planck equation, which is transformed into the two-dimensional many-particle system. Several specific applications are given of the Fokker-Planck equation. An asymptotic limit of small diffusion is also discussed for the two-vortices system. The underdamping limit, for which the vortex charge is much larger than the dissipation, is briefly discussed.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Starting from the ground state, and considering chains of different numbers of dipoles, we introduce single site excitations with excess energy ΔK. The time evolution of the chaoticity of the system and the energy localization along the chain is analyzed by computing, up to a very long time, the statistical average of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent λ(t) and the participation ratio Π(t). For small ΔK, the evolution of λ(t) and Π(t) indicates that the system becomes chaotic at approximately the same time as Π(t) reaches a steady state. For the largest considered values of ΔK the system becomes chaotic at an extremely early stage in comparison with the energy relaxation times. We find that this fact is due to the presence of chaotic breathers that keep the system far from equipartition and ergodicity. Finally, we show numerically and analytically that the asymptotic values attained by the participation ratio Π(t) fairly correspond to thermal equilibrium.","misc","christiaan","misc"

One essential question is whether collective effects may help to carry enhancements over larger scales, when increasing the number of systems composing the working substance of the engine. Such enhancements may consider not only power and efficiency, that is, its performance, but, additionally, its constancy, that is, the stability of the engine with respect to unavoidable environmental fluctuations. We explore this issue by introducing a many-body quantum heat engine model composed by spin pairs working in continuous operation. We study how power, efficiency, and constancy scale with the number of spins composing the engine and introduce a well-defined macroscopic limit where analytical expressions are obtained. Our results predict power enhancements, in both finite-size and macroscopic cases, for a broad range of system parameters and temperatures, without compromising the engine efficiency, accompanied by coherence-enhanced constancy for finite sizes. We discuss these quantities in connection to thermodynamic uncertainty relations.","misc","christiaan","misc"

For the chosen experimental conditions, the emerging trajectories are orbital, and, more interestingly, they suggest the existence of bistability. A mathematical model incorporating the key experimental components is introduced. By means of numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, it is found that, in addition to the orbiting behavior, the sensor location could produce trapped or diffusive behaviors. Furthermore, the study reveals that stochastic perturbation and the eccentric location of the sensor are responsible for inducing bistability in the orbital trajectories, supporting experimental observations.","misc","christiaan","misc"

In HED matter, the electronic structure of individual atomic ions is influenced by a dense plasma environment, and one of the most significant phenomena is the ionization potential depression (IPD). Incorporation of the IPD effects is of great importance in accurate modeling of dense plasmas. All theoretical treatments of IPD so far have been based on the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, but its validity is questionable in ultrafast formation dynamics of dense plasmas, particularly when interacting with intense XFEL pulses. A treatment of transient IPD, based on an electronic-structure calculation of an atom in the presence of a plasma environment described by classical particles, has recently been proposed [Phys. Rev. E 103, 023203 (2021)2470-004510.1103/PhysRevE.103.023203], but its application to and impact on plasma dynamics simulations have not been investigated yet. In this work, we extend XMDYN, a hybrid quantum-classical approach combining Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics, by incorporating the proposed IPD treatment into plasma dynamics simulations. We demonstrate the importance of the IPD effects in theoretical modeling of aluminum dense plasmas by comparing two XMDYN simulations: one with electronic-structure calculations of isolated atoms (without IPD) and the other with those of atoms embedded in a plasma (with IPD). At equilibrium, the mean charge obtained in the plasma simulation with IPD is in good agreement with the full quantum-mechanical average-atom model. The present approach promises to be a reliable tool to simulate the creation and nonequilibrium evolution of dense plasmas induced by ultraintense and ultrashort XFEL pulses.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We have investigated pathways to enhance the diffusivity of spheroids in the binary mixture by manipulating the phase behavior of the system through varying the fraction of spheres in the binary mixture.

We then extended the range of size and mass by introducing artificial samaras, with discrete mass elements purposely designed to approximate the asymmetrical and nonuniform distribution of mass found with natural samaras. Based on the widened range, a fundamental nondimensional correlation of dynamic pressure and disc loading was generalized, where all stable autorotation descent profiles collapse to a single descent characteristic curve, irrespective of the size and mass of the natural and artificial samara's specimens. Results reveal that for stably autorotating (both natural and artificial) samaras, their terminal descent velocity (expressed as dynamic pressure) and disc loading attained equilibrium at a value that is inversely proportional to the coefficient of lift.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We propose that ambient electrons collected in photoemitting areas precipitate changes in the emission and reabsorption of photoelectrons inside microcavities between dust grains. This affects the charging, repulsion, and subsequent mobilization of the dust grains surrounding the microcavities. The magnetic field controls the movement of ambient electrons across the dusty surface, resulting in active and inactive regions of dust mobilization.

It overcomes to a large extent the problem of a nonuniform electric field, employs relatively small driving voltages, and allows K to be measured directly. It is shown that the dispersion relation based on the single-band birefringence model describes well both blue and isotropic liquid crystal phases. It is found that the experimental data indicate that the temperature-dependent coefficients in this relation have a simple linear form in the isotropic phase, which allows a general model for the temperature and wavelength dependence of the Kerr constant in the isotropic liquid crystal phase to be formulated.

This is achieved by mapping dynamical correlation functions of local operators acting at the boundary to a partition function with complex weights defined on a two-dimensional lattice with a helical topology. We evaluate this partition function in terms of transfer matrices, which allow for numerically treating system sizes far beyond what is accessible by exact diagonalization and whose spectral properties determine the asymptotic scaling of correlations. Combining analytical arguments with numerical results, we show that for impurities which remain unitary under partial transpose correlations are exponentially suppressed with system size in a particular scaling limit.

In this paper we examine the effect of screening in classical glass formers. These are made of point particles that interact via binary forces. Both inverse power law forces and Lennard-Jones interactions are examined, and it is shown that in both cases the elastic response can be strongly screened, in agreement with the novel theory.

Another task is inferring the origin of a disease, which is relatively difficult with current mathematical models. Such frameworks, across varying levels of complexity, are typically sensitive to input data on epidemic parameters, case counts, and mortality rates, which are generally noisy and incomplete. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a maximum entropy framework that fits epidemiological models, provides calibrated infection origin probabilities, and is robust to noise due to a prior belief model. Maximum entropy is agnostic to the parameters or model structure used and allows for flexible use when faced with sparse data conditions and incomplete knowledge in the dynamical phase of disease-spread, providing for more reliable modeling at early stages of outbreaks. We evaluate the performance of our model by predicting future disease trajectories based on simulated epidemiological data in synthetic graph networks and the real mobility network of New York State. In addition, unlike existing approaches, we demonstrate that the method can be used to infer the origin of the outbreak with accurate confidence. Indeed, despite the prevalent belief on the feasibility of contact-tracing being limited to the initial stages of an outbreak, we report the possibility of reconstructing early disease dynamics, including the epidemic seed, at advanced stages.","misc","christiaan","misc"

For the unstable configuration, Rayleigh-Taylor instability can be suppressed by the elasticity or mitigated by the viscosity, but without practically affecting the perturbation growth due to the geometrical convergence. However, the convergence effects manifest themselves in a manner somewhat different from the classical Bell-Plesset effect by making the process more sensitive to the media compressibility than in the case involving ideal media.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1596",35974615,"Effect of architecture disorder on the elastic response of two-dimensional lattice materials.","We examine how disordering joint position influences the linear elastic behavior of lattice materials via numerical simulations in two-dimensional beam networks. Three distinct initial crystalline geometries are selected as representative of mechanically isotropic materials with low connectivity, mechanically isotropic materials with high connectivity, and mechanically anisotropic materials with intermediate connectivity. Introducing disorder generates spatial fluctuations in the elasticity tensor at the local (joint) scale. Proper coarse-graining reveals a well-defined continuum-level scale elasticity tensor. Increasing disorder aids in making initially anisotropic materials more isotropic. The disorder impact on the material stiffness depends on the lattice connectivity: Increasing the disorder softens lattices with high connectivity and stiffens those with low connectivity, without modifying the scaling between elastic modulus and density (linear scaling for high connectivity and cubic scaling for low connectivity). Introducing disorder in lattices with intermediate fixed connectivity reveals both scaling: the linear scaling occurs for low density, the cubic one at high density, and the crossover density increases with disorder. Contrary to classical formulations, this work demonstrates that connectivity is not the sole parameter governing elastic modulus scaling. It offers a promising route to access novel mechanical properties in lattice materials via disordering the architectures.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1597",35974627,"Post-thermalization via information spreading in open quantum systems.","Thermalization in open systems coupled to macroscopic environments is usually analyzed from the perspective of relaxation of the reduced state of the system to the equilibrium state. Less emphasis is given to the change of the state of the bath. However, as previously shown for some specific models, during the thermalization the environment may undergo a nontrivial dynamics, indicated by the the change of its von Neumann entropy, at timescales even longer than the relaxation time of the system; here such a behavior is called post-thermalization. We provide a more detailed analysis of this phenomenon by simulating the full dynamics of a variety of systems together with their environment. In particular, the post-thermalization is qualitatively explained as a result of reconversion of the initially built up correlation between the system and the bath into the correlation between the degrees of freedom in the environment. We also present exemplary systems in which such a reconversion is suppressed due to non-Markovian dynamics or the presence of interactions.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This allows us to resolve the latent feature structure across a wide range of data regimes set by the number of recorded variables, observations, latent features, and the signal-to-noise ratio. We find a characteristic imprint of latent features in the distribution of correlations and eigenvalues and provide an analytic estimate for the boundary between signal and noise, even in the absence of a spectral gap.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1599",35974633,"Effects of time-varying habitat connectivity on metacommunity persistence.","Network structure or connectivity patterns are critical in determining collective dynamics among interacting species in ecosystems. Conventional research on species persistence in spatial populations has focused on static network structure, though most real network structures change in time, forming time-varying networks. This raises the question, in metacommunities, how does the pattern of synchrony vary with temporal evolution in the network structure. The synchronous dynamics among species are known to reduce metacommunity persistence. Here we consider a time-varying metacommunity small-world network consisting of a chaotic three-species food chain oscillator in each patch or node. The rate of change in the network connectivity is determined by the natural frequency or its subharmonics of the constituent oscillator to allow sufficient time for the evolution of species in between successive rewirings. We find that over a range of coupling strengths and rewiring periods, even higher rewiring probabilities drive a network from asynchrony towards synchrony. Moreover, in networks with a small rewiring period, an increase in average degree (more connected networks) pushes the asynchronous dynamics to synchrony. On the other hand, in networks with a low average degree, a higher rewiring period drives the synchronous dynamics to asynchrony resulting in increased species persistence. Our results also follow the calculation of synchronization time and are robust across other ecosystem models. Overall, our study opens the possibility of developing temporal connectivity strategies to increase species persistence in ecological networks.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1600",35974635,"Transition in collective motion decision making.","Collective decision making in a biological motion group requires fast and robust transmission of information. Typically, directional switching information propagation across the whole group obeys a linear dispersion law. However, conventional dynamic collective motion models, such as the Vicsek model and the Couzin model did not take into account ultrafast directional synchronous motions. In the present paper, a multiparticle model is proposed based on inertial spin self-propel action, which can provide adequate description of such group motion. By considering both spin mechanism and collision avoidance, the proposed self-propelled particle spin model can nicely describe collective motion with fast directional switching. By analyzing the order parameter of the group-velocity synchronization, a mechanism of group decision making is revealed, which is based on the difference between two clusters of divergent leaders, showing a transition from the compromising phase (i.e., following the group average) to the preferred phase (i.e., aligning to a leader cluster). The finding provides new insight to the decision-making process of followers when they face with divergent leaders in group motion.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1601",35974637,"Short-range and long-range correlations in driven dense colloidal mixtures in narrow pores.","The system of a driven dense colloid mixture in a tube with diameter comparable to particle size is modeled by a generalization of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) model. The generalization goes in two directions: relaxing the exclusion constraint by allowing several (but few) particles on a site and by considering two species of particles, which differ in size and transport coefficients. We calculate the nearest-neighbor correlations using a variant of the Kirkwood approximation and show by comparison with numerical simulations that the approximation provides quite accurate results. However, for long-range correlations, we show that the Kirkwood approximation is useless, as it predicts exponential decay of the density-density correlation function with distance, while simulation data indicate that the decay is algebraic. For the one-component system, we show that the decay is governed by a power law with universal exponent close to 2. In the two-component system, the correlation function behaves in a more complicated manner: Its sign oscillates but the envelope decays again very slowly and the decay is compatible with a power law with an exponent somewhat lower than 2. Therefore, our generalization of the ASEP belongs to a different universality class from the ensemble of generalized ASEP models which are mappable to zero-range processes.","misc","christiaan","misc"

It allows to describe any stochastic process intermittently terminated and restarted from a predefined random or nonrandom point. Our approach is based on stochastic differential equations called jump-diffusion models. It allows to analyze processes with resetting both, analytically and using Monte Carlo simulation methods. To depict the strength of our approach, we derive a number of fundamental properties of Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting, such as the Itô lemma, the moment-generating function, the characteristic function, the explicit form of the probability density function, moments of all orders, various forms of the Fokker-Planck equation, infinitesimal generator of the process, and its adjoint operator. Additionally, we extend the above results to the case of time-nonhomogeneous Poissonian resetting. This way we build a general framework for the analysis of any stochastic process with intermittent random resetting.","misc","christiaan","misc"

In contrast, semiflexible rings undergo transient trapping inside the pore space; the degree of trapping is inversely correlated with the increase in activity.

Certain active dimers show both chemotactic and antichemotactic behavior, depending on the strength of the activity. Our coarse-grained Fokker-Planck approach yields an effective potential, which we use to construct a nonequilibrium phase diagram that classifies the dimers according to their tactic behavior. Moreover, we show that for certain dimers a higher persistence of the motion is achieved similar to the effect of a steering wheel in macroscopic devices. This work could be useful for designing autonomous active colloidal structures which adjust their motion depending on the local activity gradients.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Data on quality of life and resource use for 613 patients, collected prospectively in the Therapeutic Interventions for Stones of the Ureter (TISU) randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN 92289221), were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of two care pathways, SWL and URS. A health provider (UK National Health Service) perspective was adopted to estimate the costs of the interventions and subsequent resource use. Quality-of-life data were calculated using a generic instrument, the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L. Results are expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The mean QALY difference (SWL vs URS) was -0.021 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.033 to -0.010) and the mean cost difference was -£809 (95% CI -£1061 to -£551). The QALY difference translated into approximately 10 more healthy days over the 6-month period for the patients on the URS care pathway. The probabaility that SWL is cost-effective is 79% at a society's willingness to pay (WTP) threshold for 1 QALY of £30,000 and 98% at a WTP threshold of £20,000. The SWL pathway results in lower QALYs than URS but costs less. The incremental cost per QALY is £39 118 cost saving per QALY lost, with a 79% probability that SWL would be considered cost-effective at a WTP threshold for 1 QALY of £30 000 and 98% at a WTP threshold of £20 000.

In general, the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters, the atomic positions and the atomic thermal vibrations is both anisotropic and nonlinear. Implemented here is a software package for precise and flexible calculation of structure factors for dynamical diffraction. α-Quartz is used as an example because it presents the challenges mentioned above and because it is being considered for use in high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy. The package is designed to be extended easily to other crystals by adding new material files, which are kept separate from the package's stable core. Python 3 was chosen as the language to allow the easy integration of this code into existing packages. The importance of a correct anisotropic treatment of the atomic thermal vibrations is demonstrated by comparison with an isotropic Debye model. Discrepancies between the two models can be as much as 5% for strong reflections and considerably larger (even to the level of 100%) for weak reflections.

Notably, the origin of natural pH gradients and how they have been incorporated in cellular systems is one of the most important questions in understanding the prebiotic origin of life. Herein, we have demonstrated a spatiotemporal pH gradient formation pattern on a hydrogel surface by employing two different enzymatic reactions, namely, the reactions of glucose oxidase (pH decreasing) and urease (pH increasing). We found here a generic pattern of spatiotemporal change in pH and proton transfer catalytic activity that was completely altered in a cationic gold nanoparticle containing hydrogel. In the absence of nanoparticles, the gradually generated macroscopic pH gradient slowly diminished with time, whereas the presence of nanoparticles helped to perpetuate the generated gradient effect. This behavior is due to the differential responsiveness of the interface of the cationic nanoparticle in temporally changing surroundings with increasing or decreasing pH or ionic contents. Moreover, the catalytic proton transfer ability of the nanoparticle showed a concerted kinetic response following the spatiotemporal pH dynamics in the gel matrix. Notably, this nanoparticle-driven spatiotemporally resolved gel matrix will find applicability in the area of the membrane-free generation and control of spatially segregated chemistry at the macroscopic scale.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Utilizing the rich electronic behaviour of these 1,3-N,S-chelated ruthenium species, we have established that a combination of redox-active ligands and metal-ligand cooperativity has a big influence on the multisite borane activation. For example, treatment of mer-2a-b with BH3·THF led to the isolation of fac-[PR3Ru{κ3-H,S,S'-(NH2BSBH2N)(S2C7H4)2}] (fac-3a: R = Cy and fac-3b: R = Ph) that captured boranes at both sites of the κ2-N,S-chelated ruthenacycles. The core structure of fac-3a and fac-3b consists of two five-membered ruthenacycles [RuBNCS] which are fused by one butterfly moiety [RuB2S]. Analogous fac-3c, [PPh3Ru{κ3-H,S,S'-(NH2BSBH2N)(SC5H4)2}], can also be synthesized from the reaction of BH3·THF with [PPh3{κ2-N,S-(SNC5H4)}{κ3-H,S,S'-BH2(SNH4C5)2}Ru], cis-fac-1c.

The electrons required for CO2 reduction are extracted from water in a reaction driven by light-induced charge separations in the Photosystem II reaction center and catalyzed by the CaMn4O5-cluster. This cyclic process involves five redox intermediates known as the S0-S4 states. In this study, we quantify the flash-induced turnover efficiency of each S state by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Measurements were performed in photosystem II membrane preparations from spinach in the presence of an exogenous electron acceptor at selected temperatures between -10 °C and +20 °C and at flash frequencies of 1.25, 5 and 10 Hz. The results show that at optimal conditions the turnover efficiencies are limited by reactions occurring in the water oxidizing complex, allowing the extraction of their S state dependence and correlating low efficiencies to structural changes and chemical events during the reaction cycle. At temperatures 10 °C and below, the highest efficiency (i.e. lowest miss parameter) was found for the S1 → S2 transition, while the S2 → S3 transition was least efficient (highest miss parameter) over the whole temperature range. These electron paramagnetic resonance results were confirmed by measurements of flash-induced oxygen release patterns in thylakoid membranes and are explained on the basis of S state dependent structural changes at the CaMn4O5-cluster that were determined recently by femtosecond X-ray crystallography.

In this work, we are able to prepare oligomeric aggregates of Aβ with uniform size and monomorphic structure. Our experimental design is to incubate Aβ peptides in reverse micelles (RMs) so that the peptides could aggregate only through a single nucleation process and the size of the oligomers is confined by the physical dimension of the reverse micelles. The hence obtained Aβ oligomers (AβOs) are 23 nm in diameter and they belong to the category of high molecular-weight (MW) oligomers. The solid-state NMR data revealed that Aβ40Os adopt the structural motif of β-loop-β but the chemical shifts manifested that they may be structurally different from low-MW AβOs and mature fibrils. From the thioflavin-T results, we found that high-MW Aβ42Os can accelerate the fibrillization of Aβ40 monomers. Our protocol allows performing cross-seeding experiments among oligomeric species. By comparing the chemical shifts of Aβ40Os cross seeded by Aβ42Os and those of Aβ40Os prepared in the absence of Aβ42Os, we observed that the chemical states of E11, K16, and E22 were altered, whereas the backbone conformation of the β-sheet region near the C-terminus was structurally invariant.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed to better understand DDIs. However, identifying key substructures that contribute most to the DDI prediction is a challenge for GNNs. In this study, we presented a substructure-aware graph neural network, a message passing neural network equipped with a novel substructure attention mechanism and a substructure-substructure interaction module (SSIM) for DDI prediction (SA-DDI). Specifically, the substructure attention was designed to capture size- and shape-adaptive substructures based on the chemical intuition that the sizes and shapes are often irregular for functional groups in molecules. DDIs are fundamentally caused by chemical substructure interactions. Thus, the SSIM was used to model the substructure-substructure interactions by highlighting important substructures while de-emphasizing the minor ones for DDI prediction. We evaluated our approach in two real-world datasets and compared the proposed method with the state-of-the-art DDI prediction models. The SA-DDI surpassed other approaches on the two datasets. Moreover, the visual interpretation results showed that the SA-DDI was sensitive to the structure information of drugs and was able to detect the key substructures for DDIs. These advantages demonstrated that the proposed method improved the generalization and interpretation capability of DDI prediction modeling.","misc","christiaan","misc"

"1627",35974839,"Stretchable and self-healable hydrogel artificial skin.","Hydrogels have emerged as promising materials for the construction of skin-like mechanical sensors. The common design of hydrogel-based artificial skin requires a dielectric sandwiched between two hydrogel layers for capacitive sensing. However, such a planar configuration limits the sensitivity, stretchability and self-healing properties. Here, we report the design of single-layer composite hydrogels with bulk capacitive junctions as mechanical sensors. We engineer dielectric peptide-coated graphene (PCG) to serve as homogenously dispersed electric double layers in hydrogels. Any mechanical motions that alter the microscopic distributions of PCG in the hydrogels can significantly change the overall capacitance. We use peptide self-assembly to render strong yet dynamic interfacial interactions between the hydrogel network and graphene. The resulting hydrogels can be stretched up to 77 times their original length and self-heal in a few minutes. The devices can effectively sense strain and pressure in both air and aqueous environments, providing tremendous opportunities for next-generation iontronics.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1628",35974841,"Correlation Between Pretreatment Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Expression as Prognostic Markers in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","Background The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at baseline treatment is an important marker of systemic inflammation, which is correlated with survival benefits in lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, and colorectal cancer. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is a biomarker with discording results regarding survival benefits in lung cancer. In our research, we studied the relationship between these two markers in patients with lung cancer. Methods Patients with stage I, II, III, and IV lung cancer (n = 80) were included in this retrospective study. The NLR baseline was recorded before the initiation of treatment. The NLR cut-off value was 4. PD-L1 expression was determined by immunohistochemical staining. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted to test their prognostic value. Results NLR proved to be a significant prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.002, Log Rank) with a mean PFS of 27.7 months for low NLR patients and 12.8 months for high NLR patients. It was also significant for overall survival (OS) (p=0.007, Log Rank) with a mean OS of 52 months for low NLR patients and 41.6 months for high NLR patients. The prognostic impact of PD-L1 expression on PFS and OS was not statistically significant with a mean PFS of 23.1 months for PD-L1-negative patients and 15.8 months for PD-L1-positive patients (p=0.422, Log Rank). Mean OS was 49 months for PD-L1-negative patients while for PD-L1-positive patients, it was 43.3 months (p=0.550 Log Rank). Regarding the correlation between PD-L1 expression and NLR value, PFS mean survival times were 13.1 months for PD-L1(+)/NLR>4, 15.1 months for PD-L1(-)/NLR>4, 16.4 months for PD-L1(+)/NLR<4 and 27.8 months for PD-L1(-)/NLR<4. This correlation between PFS and the combined PD-L1 and NLR prognostic factor was statistically relevant (p=0.04). For OS, the PD-L1/NLR combined prognostic factor was not statistically relevant (p=0.055). A mean PFS time of 27.8 months was reported for PD-L1(-)/NLR<4 group patients while for the other groups, the mean PFS was 14.9 months (p=0.045). In univariate analysis, the elevated NLR was significantly associated with a decreased PFS time (HR=2.31, 95% CI =1.323- 4.051, p=0.03) as well as OS (HR=3.555, 95% CI=1.310- 9.652, p=0.013). In multivariate analysis, NLR remained statistically significant for PFS (HR=2.160, 95% CI=1.148- 4.062, p=0.013) and OS (HR=4.364, 95% CI=1.474- 12.921, p=0.008) after adjusting for the factors of age, gender, tumor stage, lymph node stage, clinical stage, histology, and PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression was not a valid prognostic factor for progression or death in either univariate or multivariate analysis. We also stratified the disease control rate (DCR) depending on PD-L1/NLR combined factor expression. In the PD-L1(-)/NLR<4 group, we had the highest number of partial responses (PRs) and only one complete response (CR) compared to the other groups (p=0.006). Conclusions As the number of patients is limited in the present analysis, it is hypothesized that these two markers can be useful in dividing patients into two prognostic groups: the good prognostic group reunites PD-L1(+)/NLR<4 and PD-L1(-)/NLR<4 and the poor prognostic group reunites PD-L1(+)/NLR>4 and PD-L1(-)/NLR>4.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

"1630",35974849,"Monitoring Endocrine Complications of Immunotherapy: A Screening Tool.","Introduction The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer therapy in recent years. Immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies against checkpoint molecules, including programmed death (PD)-1, PD ligand (PD-L)1, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA)-4, has become a cornerstone in cancer therapy. However, due to the physiologic role of checkpoint molecules in preventing autoimmunity, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have emerged as frequent complications. As the use of immunotherapy increases, a better understanding of irAEs and screening tools for timely diagnosis and management are needed. Materials and methods We surveyed oncology providers at our institution with 10 questions assessing their knowledge, and comfort levels in diagnosing and managing endocrine irAEs. We created an endocrine clinic referral order specifically for oncology-related endocrinopathies and created a screening tool for diagnosing these endocrinopathies. We met with our oncology providers in three different hour-long sessions. A post-intervention survey was sent out six months after our initial meeting to assess changes in the participants' knowledge and comfort levels. We also reviewed the electronic medical records system for the number of new referrals to endocrinology clinic. Results A total of 27 (N) participants responded to the initial survey and 14 (n) responded to the subsequent survey six months later. Based on the initial survey, only a minority (26%) of respondents were comfortable diagnosing and managing (15%) immunotherapy-related adrenal dysfunction whereas more respondents were comfortable diagnosing (55%) and managing (56%) thyroid dysfunction. The majority (67%) of the respondents knew which immunotherapies commonly are implicated in hypophysitis but only 42% of them were aware of the next steps of its management. We noted a significant increase in self-reported comfort levels in diagnosing (p < 0.05) and managing (p < 0.05) adrenal disorders post-intervention. There was also a trend of improvement in participants' comfort levels regarding diagnosing and managing thyroid dysfunction, management of hypophysitis, and immunotherapies implicated in thyroid dysfunction but the changes did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant change in their knowledge regarding immunotherapies implicated in hypophysitis and natural history of thyroid dysfunction in this setting. In the six months following our intervention, 30% (n=21) of the patients referred to the endocrine clinic were for immune-related endocrinopathies compared to 19% (n=7) of patients over a similar duration before the intervention. Data on the time between referral and endocrinology appointment was available for 16 out of the 21 patients and the mean (±SD) time to endocrine clinic appointment was 2.66 (±1.95) weeks. Nine (43%) of the 21 referred patients were seen in endocrinology clinic within two weeks. Conclusions Although immune-related endocrinopathies are rarely fatal, they have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Endocrinopathies are typically manageable with prompt recognition and treatment. But the subtle and non-specific manifestations make the diagnostic process a challenge. Standardized and practical screening tools can help in diagnosing these adverse events promptly, seeking specialized care if needed and may also aid in reducing healthcare-related costs.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1631",35974850,"The Efficacy of Platelet-Rich Fibrin in the Management of Chronic Nonhealing Ulcers of the Lower Limb.","Introduction Nonhealing ulcers have a huge burden on the patient, by having high morbidity in terms of chronic pain, partial or complete loss of function, mental health issues, and social isolation, and can have a massive financial burden on the patient. Various novel therapies have been developed to treat nonhealing ulcers. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) has been developed in the recent era initially in the dental world for treating oral ulcers. Now, the role of PRF is strongly established in treating nonhealing ulcers. PRF has an aggregate of a myriad of growth factors and cytokines that stimulate healing of the wounds. In this study, we have compared the efficacy of PRF in treating nonhealing ulcers of the lower limb against normal saline dressings. Aims and objectives This study aims to determine the efficacy of platelet-rich fibrin over normal saline dressings in the treatment of nonhealing ulcers of the lower limb by comparing the percentage reduction in the surface area of wounds after treatment in both groups. Methods Fifty patients with nonhealing ulcers were selected and randomly divided into two groups with 25 patients in each group. Cases were treated with PRF dressings weekly for a period of six weeks. Controls were treated with normal saline dressings weekly for a period of six weeks. The percentage reduction in the size of the ulcer after treatment was recorded in both groups and compared. Patients of age 18-60 with nonhealing ulcers of the lower limb of >12 weeks duration have been included in the study. Patients having wounds with active infection, wound size > 35 cm2, uncontrolled diabetes, peripheral vascular disease with Ankle-Brachial Index < 0.9, osteomyelitis of the underlying bone, and immunocompromised state, and patients on antiplatelet drugs have been excluded from the study. Results The mean age of the patients included in the study was 42.88 ± 2.73 years. The mean initial surface of the wound​​​ was 14.95 ± 3.08 cm2 among cases and 13.28 ± 2.83 cm2 among controls. The mean surface area of the wound after six weeks was 1.59 ± 0.78 cm2 among cases and 11.08 ± 2.74 cm2 among controls. The mean percentage reduction in the wound size after six weeks of treatment was 89.3% among cases and is significantly higher than in the normal saline group (16.5%) (Mdn = 14.63, U = 23, p < 0.00001). Conclusion Platelet-rich fibrin is an emerging potential topical agent for the treatment of nonhealing ulcers of the lower limbs and is more effective than normal saline dressings and also has the advantage of being cost-effective.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"
"1632",35974851,"Reduction in Operating Room Airborne Particle Burden and Time-Dependent Contamination of Sterile Instrument Trays With the Use of a Novel Air Filtration System.","Introduction Postoperative infections represent a substantial burden to patients and healthcare systems. To improve patient care and reduce healthcare expenditures, interventions to reduce surgical infections must be employed. The crystalline C-band ultraviolet (UV-C) air filtration technology (Aerobiotix Inc., Miamisburg, OH, USA) has been designed to reduce airborne bioburden through high-quality filtration and germicidal irradiation. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of a novel UV-C air filtration device to reduce airborne particle counts and contamination of surgical instrument trays in an operating room (OR) setting. Materials and methods Thirty sterile instrument trays were opened in a positive-air-flow OR. The trays were randomly assigned to one of two groups (UV-C or control, n=15 per group). In the UV-C group, the UV-C filtration device was used and in the control, it was not. All trays were opened with the use of a sterile technique and left exposed in the OR for four hours. Air was sampled by a particle counter to measure the numbers of 5µm and 10µm particles. Culture specimens were obtained from the trays to assess for bacterial contamination. Outcome data were collected at 30-minute intervals for the duration of the four-hour study period. Results Use of the UV-C device resulted in statistically significant reductions in the numbers of 5µm (average of 64.9% reduction when compared with the control, p<0.001) and 10µm (average of 65.7% reduction when compared with the control, p<0.001)-sized particles detectable in the OR. There was no significant difference in the overall rates of contamination (33.3% in the control group vs. 26.7% in the UV-C group, p=1.0) or the time to contamination (mean survival of 114 minutes in the control group vs. 105 minutes in the UV-C group, p=0.72) of surgical instrument trays with the use of the UV-C device. Conclusions The results demonstrate that the UV-C filtration device can successfully reduce airborne bioburden in standard ORs, suggesting that it may have the potential to reduce the risk for wound and hardware infections. Further clinical trials are necessary to better determine the effect of this air filtration system on postoperative infection rates.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"
"1633",35974853,"Bigger Is Not Always Better: Effects of Electrocautery Setting on Tissue Injury in a Porcine Model.","Introduction Electrosurgery for dissection and hemostasis remains one of the foundational tools for the field of surgery as a whole. Monopolar cautery remains the most utilized modality for achieving the aforementioned goals. Given the prolonged history and pre-modern development of Bovie cautery, there remains a paucity of data regarding appropriate settings and intensity for various tissue types, procedures, or locales. As a result, utilized settings depend on precedent and personal preference. We aimed to determine the amount of secondary soft tissue injury by volume and depth beyond the electrocautery pen tip in the skin and subcutaneous tissue as well as skeletal muscle.  Methods Porcine samples were used for experimental testing using two testing types: 1) skin and subcutaneous tissue and 2) Skeletal muscle. Sample sizes were standardized at 1 cm3 cubes. For skin samples, tissue injury was created with either a scalpel or electrocautery pen on cut setting, and tested at intensities from 10 to 150 in increments of 10. Skeletal muscle samples were similarly tested using the electrocautery pen only in either a cut or coagulation setting. Samples were tested at incremental intensities from 10 to 120 for both settings. Electrocautery was tested for a period of five seconds with a continuous current. All samples were placed in formalin and underwent histologic staining with hematoxylin and eosin staining to be assessed for the extent of tissue injury in terms of depth, radius, and volume. The measurements were recorded in millimeters. Results For skin incision, there was a positive and significant correlation with respect to the radius (R=.73, p=0.006). When considering intensity with an interval of 10-70 there was a positive and significant correlation with respect to the radius, depth, and volume. The cold knife incision had no notable soft tissue injury beyond the depth of the incision. Regarding skeletal muscle, again, a significant and positive correlation between increasing monopolar settings was noted for both the coagulation and cut functions (R=.84, p=.0005; R=0.84, p=0.0006). A positive correlation was found between increasing cut intensity and volume of soft tissue injury (R=0.73, p=.008); this was not reflected in the coagulation setting. When limited to an intensity range of 10-60, a significant relationship was noted for depth, radius and volume (R=.95, p= <0.001; R=0.98, p= <.001; R=.92, p=.001). Conclusion In all samples, apart from the cold knife skin incision, additional soft tissue injury beyond the tip of the electrocautery pen was noted. Given our findings, recommendations include using the lowest setting required for the purposes of the given surgical case as well as minimizing electrocautery use for skin incisions given its association with a larger volume of tissue injury in comparison with a scalpel. Additionally, electrocautery should be used with care in, and around neurovascular structures as soft tissue injury did occur several millimeters beyond the tip of the electrocautery pen. Further study is needed to see if these patterns are similar in living animals as well as human tissue and whether they bear any clinical impact on surgical wound healing or other surgical complications.","misc","christiaan","rodent"

The spectrum of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 ranges from mild to life-threatening forms. Alteration of hepatic function in COVID-19 is multifactorial. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced hepatic dysfunction and the clinical outcome in patients infected with COVID-19. We methodically explored several electronic databases (PubMed, PubMed Central, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar) in April 2022 using focused words and terms of medical subject headings for appropriate studies. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for conducting our systematic review. Hepatic dysfunction was identified as elevation of liver function tests (LFTs) above the upper limit of normal. The clinical outcome was described as a combination of mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, and the need for mechanical ventilation (MV). The initial search yielded a total of 7187 studies. After elimination of duplicates, exclusion of studies based on irrelevant titles and abstracts, comprehensive analysis of full-text formats, and evaluation of quality, a total of 16 studies were eligible to be included in our systematic review. In the 16 selected studies, there were 23,962 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can negatively affect several organ systems by interacting with specific receptors widely expressed in the human body. A multifactorial etiology of hepatic dysfunction is observed in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with abnormal LFTs. Significantly higher mortality, ICU admissions, and requirement for MV are associated with LFT alterations. For this reason, patients infected with COVID-19 must have their hepatic function closely monitored.","systematic_review","christiaan","systematic_review"

The test medicine was given one hour preoperatively before the surgical removal. The pain was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale (VRS) scores preoperatively and at the third and 24th hours. The time required for escape analgesia was measured.  Results The mean VAS and VRS scores showed significant differences across the groups after 24 hours. The mean score was lowest for the patients taking piroxicam (1.30+1.95) and highest for patients taking tramadol + paracetamol (4.50+2.59). As far as escape analgesia is concerned piroxicam group was by far superior.

We aim to raise clinical awareness of this seldom diagnosed entity as a potential etiology for altered mental status in patients who present with supporting clinical features and elevated thyroid antibodies. While steroid responsiveness is deemed a typical presenting feature of this medical condition, our cases aim to describe two cases that required escalation of therapy to intravenous immunoglobulins, and ultimately, plasmapheresis therapy for improvement in their clinical status. Our patients had a dramatic improvement in their mentation within three to four sessions of plasmapheresis, improving rapidly toward their baseline.

Weight stigma is a significant barrier to delivering quality services and also impairs clinical progress. We intended to study the association of stigma with demographic and clinical variables in obese patients to identify the obstacles in treatment-seeking, so stigma could be adequately addressed to improve clinical outcomes. Methods This study was a retrospective chart review in a Bariatric clinic in a tertiary care hospital. The weight self-stigma questionnaire (WSSQ) was routinely used in the clinic. Demographic and clinical data were collected for 146 obese patients.  Results Female patients (73%) had higher stigma scores. The mean total stigma score was 41.6(SD 3.83), the total self-devaluation score was 21.88(SD 2.10), total fear of enacted stigma was 21.26(SD 2.33). Multivariate analysis revealed an association between stigma with multiple dysfunctional eating patterns like bingeing, overeating, and grazing (Adjusted aOR 3.86, 95% CI- 1.66-8.96) and psychiatric diagnosis (adjusted aOR 3.00, CI- 1.25-7.17). Conclusion This study found an association between stigma and certain clinical variables that maintain and worsen obesity and comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. This highlights the importance of an assessment of mental health and stigma in general practice when dealing with patients with obesity.

A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted on Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed Central using the key terms sellar and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data, including patient demographics, histology, treatments, and overall survival were extracted and analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank analysis were used to compare survival outcomes between different treatment regimens. Our literature search disclosed 123 publications. After prespecified exclusions, 41 patients with sellar AT/RT from 30 manuscripts were identified, and 38 were included in the final analysis. Including our patient, the median age was 44 (range: 20-70) with a substantial female predominance (94.7%). Collectively, patients who received combined chemoradiation therapy had a significantly increased overall survival compared to those who received single modality or no adjuvant therapies (median OS 27 vs. 1.25 months; p=0.0052). Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor in the sellar region carries a poor prognosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy were associated with significantly increased overall survival. Early consideration of neuro-oncology and radiation-oncology referral and management is likely beneficial in this patient population.

Asparagus racemosus, a common name for Shatavari, is a well-known herb that has been used as a galactagogue in traditional Indian culture. It is also referenced in Ayurvedic medicine. Despite multiple formulations available, palatability has been a concern always as Shatavari is very bitter. We have devised a palatable and nutritionally rich formulation of Shatavari with no artificial ingredients. To understand the efficacy, we have conducted this double-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effect of oral Shatavari formulation (Shavari Bar®) on breast milk output in postpartum women. Methods A prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at two centers in women with gestational age 37 weeks or more who intended to breastfeed. Hundred and four women were screened, of which 78 were randomized to receive either bar containing Shatavari and oats (n=39, study) or an identical placebo bar (n=39, control). All 78 women completed the study, 61 delivered by a lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS), and 17 had a full-term normal vaginal delivery. Time to first noticeable breast fullness was measured and expressed milk volume measurements were done 72 hours after delivery or after consumption of four bars, whichever was later using a standardized breast pump. Comparison between the two groups was analyzed using a t-test. Results Demography and baseline data of patients enrolled were similar in the two groups. The mean total milk volume expressed was higher (p=0.008) with Shavari (64.74 ml) compared to placebo (49.69 ml). The time to breast fullness was shorter (p=0.024) with Shavari (30.49 hours) compared to placebo (38.09 hours). No adverse events were noted in either of the study groups. Global assessment of the satisfaction of mothers with lactation, the well-being of the child, taste, and ease of use was better in the treatment arm than in the placebo arm. Conclusion The use of the Shavari bar can be an effective option in postpartum women to establish early lactation and build confidence in breastfeeding along with nonpharmacological intervention.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"
"1642",35974876,"Fatty Acid Taste Receptor GPR120 Activation by Arachidonic Acid, Eicosapentaenoic Acid, and Docosahexaenoic Acid in Chickens.","It has been reported that the supplementation of chicken diet with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) affects the qualities of eggs and meat. Previous studies have shown that a functional fatty acid taste receptor, G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120), is broadly expressed in chicken oral and gastrointestinal tissues, and chickens have a gustatory perception of oleic acid, which is a chicken GPR120 agonist. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of chicken GPR120 in response to PUFAs in chicken diets. Ca2+ imaging analyses revealed that chicken GPR120 was activated by AA, EPA, and DHA in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that chickens can detect PUFAs via GPR120 in the oral and gastrointestinal tissues, implying that chickens have a gustatory perception of PUFAs.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1643",35974877,"Identification of Ligands for Chicken Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 Channel and Chemosensory Perception of Herbal Compounds in Chickens.","The pungency induced by spices and herbs plays an important role in food choice and appetite, and it is suggested that adding spices and herbs to feed as natural alternatives to antibiotics has beneficial effects in poultry farming. However, our knowledge of the chemosensory perception of herbal compounds in chickens is limited. Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is involved in the sensory perception of various herbal compounds. Here, we performed calcium imaging and electrophysiological analyses using cells transiently expressing chicken TRPA1 (cTRPA1) and identified two novel cTRPA1 ligands-eugenol and thymol. In a behavioral assay, chickens responded to cTRPA1 ligands, including eugenol, thymol, cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol, and allyl isothiocyanate. These results provide evidence that chickens have a functional TRPA1 channel and chemosensory perception of various herbal compounds.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The aim of this research was to examine studies which were conducted on investigation of prevalence of quality of life among patients with Behcet's disease. A total of 13 articles were extracted from four main databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science from the onset of 2000 to January 2021. All studies published in English with the purpose of examining quality of life (QOL) among patients with BD or investigating its main determinants were included. Totally, 1137 BD patients participated in 13 studies. Based on random effect analysis, the total score of physical health-related QOL was 46.7 (95% CI=41.26 to 52.13) and the total score of mental health-related QOL was 49.01 (95% CI=43.83 to 54.18) representing a moderate level of QOL among BD patients. Furthermore, weighted effect size analyses showed a significant correlation between QOL and variables such as patients' age, gender, disease duration and depression (pvalue: 0.00). As the symptoms of BD worsen over time, patients confront with more severe body pain, mobility restrictions, and difficulties in chewing, eating, speaking and swallowing which negatively affect social interactions of patients and reduce their QOL. Furthermore, depression was proved to act as a deteriorating factor for Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) among BD patients. Thus, patients need to be psychologically supported by a specialized team and be informed during the course of treatment to gain useful information about the disease, treatment approaches and coping strategies.","meta_analysis","christiaan","meta_analysis"

The most important agent in this group is sulfur mustard (mustard gas) which is known as King of chemical warfare (CW) agents . Exposure to this agent, seriously causes damages in several organs, such as the eyes. This article reviews the ophthalmological aspects of sulfur mustard with reference of its management. A wide-ranging search in PubMed databases, Thomson Reuters and Scopus was done and different aspects of chemical properties of sulfur mustard, its mechanism of action and effects on eyes, clinical finding, diagnostic evaluation, initiate actions, pharmaceutical and surgical interventions was reported. Sulfur mustard can alkylate DNA and RNA strands and break down structures of protein and lipid of cell membrane. This may impair cell energy production, and leads to cell death. Exposure to sulfur mustard, therefore, causes such problems for organs, including irreversible damage to the eyes. Understanding the mechanism of the sulfur mustard effect and the early training in prevention injuries will cause fewer complications and damage to organs, including the eyes. Washing the eyes with tap water or eyewash solutions, using mydriatic drops, anti- inflammatory drugs, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and antibiotics may help to the management of poisoning. Surgical interventions including tarsorrhaphy, amniotic membrane transplantation, stem cell transplantation and corneal transplantation could reduce the harm to the victims.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Some side effects have been seen during these treatments, besides Helicobacter pylori becoming resistant to these antibiotics easily. According to some studies, there is a relationship between metformin and reduction in Helicobacter pylori infection. Thus, in this study, we determine the effects of metformin on Helicobacter pylori infection. We performed this assessment in a randomized, case-controlled way in the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infected outpatients and inpatients. In both groups (case group and control group), patients took two tablets for a two-week period. In the case group, the patients were given two metformin tablets (each containing 500mg of metformin (extended release) and in the control group, they were given two placebo tablets (each containing 500mg of white flour). We took h.pylori Ag stool test and rapid urease test to confirm the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. In this study, at first all the patients had positive h.pylori Ag stool test or positive rapid urease test. At the end of this study, the results of h.pylori Ag stool*- test presented that Helicobacter pylori infection was negative in 82.7% of the case group patients and 76% of control group patients which illustrates suppression of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, comparing to the control group (P=0.36), this difference was not statistically remarkable. According to these findings, it is stated that having metformin along with prescribed antibiotics can help decrease Helicobacter pylori infection.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"

Several studies showed effectiveness of inhaled morphine as a secondary treatment for the improvement of dyspnea. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the efficacy of low dose inhaled morphine for respiratory function improvement in patients who were exposed to the mustard gas. This study was designed as a cross-over double-blinded clinical trial. Patients exposed to mustard gas were randomly assigned into two groups: 1) received 0.4 mg of morphine by inhalation and 2) received 5 ml of normal saline serum as a placebo in the same manner. After a washout period of one week, the first group received the placebo and the second group received morphine for 5 days. Spirometric indices, expiratory flow peak, exercise test, severity of dyspnea, and quality of life were evaluated as respiratory function parameters. Data analysis was done using SPSS software Version 16. The mean maximum expiratory flow was significantly higher among cases who used morphine in comparison with the placebo group (p<0.05). Moreover, the severity of dyspnea, quality of life, and the frequency of coughing during the day were significantly improved among the recipients of morphine (p<0.05) while the spirometric indices and exercise tolerance tests were similar between the two groups (p>0.05), but the mean peak expiratory flow (PEFR) was significantly higher among the patients receiving morphine than the placebo patients (p<0.001). The use of inhaled morphine had a significant positive effect on the respiratory system of people exposed to mustard gas.

Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the serum phosphate level immediately after hemodialysis (HD) and its association with some clinical complications in CKD patients. The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 54 eligible CKD patients undergoing regular hemodialysis. Blood samples were taken, prior to the start and immediately after the end of hemodialysis to determine the serum levels of urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, PTH, blood sugar and albumin. Moreover, the clinical complications of patients including muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, weakness and inability to speak are assessed by a questionnaire, before and after HD. As we expected, the mean of serum creatinine, urea and phosphate levels significantly decreased after dialysis. Post-dialysis hypophosphatemia was graded as mild (3.5 > P ≥ 2.5 mg/dl), moderate (2.5 > P ≥ 1 mg/dl), and severe (<1 mg/dl) based on serum phosphate levels. The frequency of mild and moderate hypophosphatemia was 39.2% and 45.1 %, respectively. None of the participants had severe hypophosphatemia and 13.7% had normal phosphate levels. There was a significant correlation between post-dialysis hypophosphatemia and incidence of nausea and confusion after adjusting for confounding factors. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the possible association of some of the post-dialysis clinical complications with hypophosphatemia was investigated. Future large-scale studies are required to confirm the association of post-dialysis hypophosphatemia with clinical complications.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

For this purpose, the following interventional study was designed to investigate the effects of educational programs for students, as well as the changes in diet and physical activity on obesity and components of the metabolic syndrome. This study is part of an interventional research project (elementary school) conducted on all students of Sama schools in Zanjan and Abhar in three levels;elementary, middle and high school, including 1000 individuals in Zanjan (intervention group) and 1000 individuals (control group) in Abhar in 2011. Interventions were based on educating students, teachers and parents, changes in food services and physical activity. We primarily measured anthropometric indices, fasting blood sugar, lipid profiles and blood pressure and completed standard nutrition and physical activity questionnaires. Also, blood insulin levels were randomly measured in a number of students. Data analysis was done by SPSS software Version 16.0. Overall, 589 individuals (252 males, 337 females) entered the case group and 803 individuals (344 males, 459 females) entered the control group. After two years of intervention, the mean waist circumference (63.8±10.9) and diastolic BP (63.8±10.4) were significantly lower, however, the mean systolic BP (10.1.0±12.5), food score (25.0±5.0) and drinking score (12.1±2.3) were higher in the intervention group (p<0.001). Comparing the components of metabolic syndrome between the second year and at the time of recruitment within the intervention group, showed that although the number of overweight/obese individuals, individuals with hypertriglyceridemia and high LDL increased, while those with abdominal obesity, high BP, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance decreased (p<0.001). On the other hand, in the control group, the number of individuals with high BP increased significantly. The prevalence of abdominal obesity and hypertension, which are the two major components of metabolic syndrome, are much higher in our study than the other regions of the country.

Patients generally respond quickly and perfectly to standard antiepileptic drugs but lifelong medication is necessary. Sodium valproate is the drug of choice in most references but it has some adverse reactions and some patients cannot tolerate the complications. Because of the need for life long treatment in this young aged group particularly child bearing women, we aimed to analyze the efficacy of these drugs to determine which has better efficacy with lower adverse effects. In this double-blind clinical trial 102 patients suffering from juvenile myoclonic epilepsy were randomly divided to three groups and treated with valproate, levetiracetam or lamotrigine and followed for 12 months at specified intervals. Patients' mean age was 22.8 years and 28.4% of them were males and 71.6% were females. Effective terminal dose of sodium valproate, levetiracetam and lamotrigine were 1000, 1000 and 250mg, respectively. The rate of failure in controlling seizures and myoclonic jerks in lamotrigine group was meaningfully more than levetiracetam and sodium valproate (P=0.037).The general side effects of sodium valproate were much more; but there was not any significant difference between their effects on electroencephalogram (EEG) findings (P=0.81). Levetiracetam and sodium valproate have similar efficacy. But in the group of lamotrigine, rate of failure, myoclonus and drug adverse reactions were meaningfully more than sodium valproate and levetiracetam. According to our study, lamotrigine could not be a suitable treatment option for JME patients as a mono therapy. Levetiracetam can be a good alternative to sodium valproate, especially in women of childbearing age.","randomized_trial","christiaan","human_intervention"

Anthraquinone‎ content of the aqueous extract was 0.34% w/w. Oral LD50 was obtained more than 5000mg/kg. No abortions and newborn anomalies were observed in groups. The height and weight of the offspring were significantly reduced by the administration of 500, and 2000 mg/kg of extract compared to control. There was no significant change in maternal blood urea and creatinine. Higher concentration (2000mg/kg) led to ALT elevation. ALS levels decreased dose-dependency in treatment groups comparing to control. Histopathological findings showed significant lung vascular congestion, and hypertrophy of heart in group tween80, and significant hepatic parenchymal inflammation in tween80 and 2000mg/kg and 1000mg/kg groups.

The incidence of vascular anomalies shown by digital subtraction angiography has been reported to be 15%, and most cases have been reported to be spinal epidural arteriovenous fistulae. SEH has rarely been caused by venous congestion. We report a case of SEH in a 78-year-old male who presented to our emergency department with sudden-onset back pain, followed by complete paraplegia with bladder and rectal disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a dorsally placed extradural hematoma extending from T10 to L1. An urgent laminectomy from T11 to L2 was performed. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) performed 1 week after the operation showed compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery with dilation of the surrounding veins, including the spinal epidural venous plexus, at the same level as the hematoma. This was diagnosed as Nutcracker syndrome (NCS), which was consistent as a cause of SEH. The patient's symptoms gradually improved, and after 6 months, he regained normal strength in his lower extremities, but bladder and rectal disturbance remained and required intermittent self-catheterization. We chose conservative treatment for NCS, and SEH did not recur until the patient died of a cause unrelated to SEH or NCS. SEH could occur secondary to venous congestion including NCS. We emphasize the importance of investigating venous return to evaluate the etiology of SEH, which can be clearly visualized using CTA.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We asked EDGE participants to fill out a survey to collect network-specific data. Then, we developed a sociogram and calculated social network metrics based on region, type of organization, and professional career stage. The EDGE network had 103 unique connections, and each node, on average, was connected to two other nodes. Early professionals that work in Global North academic institutions were the most prevalent members and most efficiently connected with other members of the network. However, senior professionals from the Global South are key to bridging gaps between regions and across sectors. Early career professionals from the Global North and senior professionals from the Global South need to work in synergy to improve the connectedness of emerging women leaders around the world.","misc","christiaan","misc"

To identify the age of presentation for the birth dose vaccines, vaccine antigens received and factors associated with vaccination presentation by day one in Northern Nigeria. A descriptive cross-sectional study involving 1 952 mother-infant pairs enrolled from 5 different states in Northern Nigeria. Data was collected using a questionnaire including the socio-demographic, antenatal care (ANC), delivery details, birth dates, vaccination presentation and birth vaccine antigens received. Data analysis was done with the SPSS-21 software. The median age of the infants at presentation for birth vaccines was six (interquartile range 2-16) days. A total of 413 (21.2%) infants were brought by the day of birth (day 0) or the next day (Day one), while one-fifth (20.6%) presented after Day 28. The most frequently received antigen was the Bacille-Calmette-Guerin by 1 781 infants (91.2%), oral polio vaccine 1 703 (87.2%), and hepatitis B vaccine birth dose the lowest at 75.1% (1 565). The commonest reasons for delayed presentations were an ill baby (24.7%) and an ill mother (21.9%).Factors associated with presentation within Day one post-birth were hospital delivery (OR-1.67, 95% CI; 1.28-2.19), firstborn (OR-1.40; 95%CI; 1.02-1.93), Christianity (OR-2.14 95% CI; 1.63-2.81), and mother with tertiary education (OR-1.62, 95% CI; 1.05-2.48). Timely administration of the birth dose vaccines is low in Northern Nigeria. Furthermore, some babies do not get the required vaccines despite presenting for vaccination due to stockout. Strategies for early neonatal vaccination such as vaccination in hospital suites post-delivery and utilizing relatives/fathers to take the baby for vaccination when a mother is indisposed are imperative.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

A comparative study was performed using interviews with vector-borne disease experts from Beijing and the Netherlands and supplemented by literature. In Beijing, syndromic surveillance is a priority for the identification of suspected vector-borne disease cases. In the Netherlands, the main surveillance emphasis is on laboratory confirmed vector-borne disease cases. Vector-surveillance at potential points of entry and other high-risk locations is performed according to the International Health Regulation (2005) in both settings. Beijing controls invasive and native mosquitos, which is not the case in the Netherlands. In Beijing, vector surveillance is performed to measure mosquito density around hospitals, this is not observed in the Dutch setting. Health risks posed by ticks are a priority in urban areas in the Netherlands, and the public is educated in self-protection. In contrast, ticks seem to occur less often in Beijing's urban areas.

This cross-sectional analytical survey included data on older (≥ 60 years) HF patients obtained from the electronic medical record databases of secondary- and tertiary-care hospitals. The medication profiles of patients were assessed to examine whether they were prescribed any PIMHF after an HF diagnosis. For PIMHF detection, the HF-specific criteria, including 2014 St Vincent criteria, 2019 Beers criteria, and 2021 Thailand criteria were applied. The prevalence of PIMHF use was expressed as percentages. The associated factors were identified using a binary logistic regression analysis, expressed as the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). A total of 2,639 patients were included in the study. Thirty-two PIMHF were found to have been prescribed to these patients. The prevalence of PIMHF use identified by the ST Vincent criteria, the Beers criteria, the Thailand criteria, and the three combined criteria was 23.76%, 19.67%, 21.18%, and 25.16%, respectively. The factors associated with PIMHF use were secondary-care hospital (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.26-1.87), HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (aOR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.38-2.38), hypertension (HTN) (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.02-1.51), diabetes mellitus (DM) (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.10-1.75), chronic pulmonary diseases (CPD) (aOR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.56-2.80), and connective tissue diseases (CTD) (aOR = 5.10, 95% CI: 2.20-11.83). PIMHF are commonly used in Thai older HF patients. The factors associated with PIMHF use identified in this study include secondary-care hospital, HFpEF, HTN, DM, CPD, and CTD.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

The purpose of the present study was to identify potential pathogenic mutation leading to disease in a Chinese LVNC family. A 3-generation family affected by LVNC was recruited. Clinical assessments were performed on available family members, with clinical examination, ECG, echocardiography and cardiac MRI. The proband (I-2), the proband's daughter (II-1, affected) and mother (III-1, unaffected) were selected for WGS. Sanger sequencing were performed in all of the 4 surviving family members. Combined whole genome sequencing with linkage analysis identified a novel missense mutation in the giant protein obscurin (OBSCN NM_001098623, c.C19063T), as the only plausible disease-causing variant that segregates with disease among the four surviving individuals, with interrogation of the entire genome excluding other potential causes. This c.C19063T missense mutation resulted in p.R6355W in the encoded OBSCN protein. It affected a highly conserved residue in the C terminus of the obscurin-B-like isoform between the PH and STKc domains, which was predicted to affect the function of the protein by different bioinformatics tools. Here we present clinical and genetic evidence implicating the novel R6355W missense mutation in obscurin as the cause of familial LVNC. This expands the spectrum of obscurin's roles in cardiomyopathies. It furthermore highlights that rare obscurin missense variants, currently often ignored or left uninterpreted, should be considered to be relevant for cardiomyopathies and can be identiﬁed by the approach presented here. This study also provided new insights into the molecular basis of OBSCN mutation positive LVNC.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The present work aimed to obtain effective peroxidase mimetics (PO-like NZs), to characterize their morphological properties, estimate the kinetic parameters of NZs and evaluate the prospects of their application in analysis of ethanol.

The linear range for the proposed nPtCu-AO/alginate beads/TMB-based method is from 0.01 mM to 0.15 mM with a limit of detection of 3.3 μM ethanol. The method is used for the quantitative determination of ethanol in alcoholic beverages. The obtained results proved to be in a good correlation with the enzymatic reference method. These results highlight the potential of the nPtCu with PO-like activity in bioanalytical applications.

These novel compounds have a general formula [Cu(N-N)(Indo)]NO3, where Indo is deprotonated indomethacin and N-N is either bipyridine or phenanthroline with some methyl-substituted derivatives, belonging to the third generation of Casiopeinas®. Spectroscopic characterization suggests a square-based pyramid geometry and voltammetry experiments indicate that the redox potential is strongly dependent on the N-N ligand. All the presented compounds show high cytotoxic efficiency, and most of them exhibit higher efficacy compared to the well-known cisplatin drug and acetylacetonate analogs of the first generation. Computational calculations show that antiproliferative behavior can be directly related to the volume of the molecules. Besides, a chitosan (CS)-polyacrylamide (PNIPAAm) nanogel was synthesized and characterized to examine the encapsulation and release properties of the [Cu(4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(Indo)]NO3 compound.

The probe L exhibits a unique response with an off-on-type mode towards Hg2+ among other biologically relevant metal cations. The limit of detection (LOD) for probe L is 1.5 ppb. In addition, in the presence of Hg2+, the probe L shows a colorimetric response from colorless to pink. The recognition behavior of probe L towards Hg2+ has been investigated by 1H NMR titration experiments, Job's plot, and MS and IR analyses. As a result, the ligation between the probe and Hg2+ leads to the scission of the spirolactam bond of free L and the restoration of its conjugated structure, which can give rise to the fluorescence enhancement of the probe L. Besides, it also can be used as a sensitivity probe in living cells for Hg2+ sensing, which can meet various needs in genetic and environmental samples.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The present study demonstrates the fabrication of a graphene-based sensor for measuring the temperature and humidity of a metal body. The graphene sensor was fabricated by depositing a thin film of graphene nanoparticles between silver electrodes (separated by ∼50 μm) on a glass substrate. The graphene thin film was characterized by XRD, Raman spectroscopy and UV-vis techniques. The capacitance and resistance for both the relative humidity (in the range of 0-100% RH) and temperature (in the range of 230-310 K) were measured using an LCR meter at 1 kHz in a controlled chamber. The graphene-based sensor expressed high sensitivity with fast response and recovery times for both humidity and temperature with long stability and low hysteresis curves. The sensor was also tested on a metal body, which expressed a good response time. Moreover, the measured data of capacitance and resistance was analyzed with classical and neutrosophic analysis as an application of modern material statistics. It was observed that neutrosophic analysis is more flexible for analyzing the capacitance and resistance of the fabricated sensor.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The catalytic activity and selectivity of the new chiral catalysts were improved by adjusting the aperture of the MOF cavities. The hole size of the Zr-MOF was modulated by adding acid and replacing bridge ligands during synthesis. The difunctional chiral units of amino acid-thiourea are anchored onto the Zr-MOF by a mild synthesis method from an isothiocyanate intermediate which could effectively avoid the racemization of chiral moieties in the synthesis process. By means of specific surface area measurement (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD), it was confirmed that Zr-MOFs with different pore sizes were synthesized without breaking the basic octahedral structure of the MOF. Finally, good yields (up to 83%) and ee values (up to 73%) were achieved with the new heterogeneous catalysts in 48 hours for the aldol reaction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone. By contrast, using the catalyst support without modulating the synthesis, the yield (30%) and the ee-value (26%) were both low. Experiments have confirmed the important influence on the reaction selectivity of providing a suitable reaction environment by controlling the aperture of MOF cavities.","misc","christiaan","misc"

However, this is not the case under visible light, where it is necessary to combine titanium dioxide with other photosensitising nanomaterials. Unfortunately, most of the strategies aimed in this direction are chemically non-facile, energy-intensive, economically expensive, and not suitable for large-scale production. We herein describe a straightforward solvent-free approach for accessing visible-light-activated titanium-dioxide-based photocatalysts via the mechanochemical grinding of Degussa P25 with a second solid partner. Upon comparing several solid-material benchmarks, P25-graphene oxide is the best combination. The resulting material showed efficient performance for the adsorption and photodegradation of different dye pollutants, namely methylene blue, malachite green, Congo red, and methyl orange. The recorded performance was nearly comparable to that reached using sol-gel materials, with the ultimate advantage of being more sustainable and industrially scalable.

However, lack of understanding of the cocrystallization mechanism leads to inefficiency in cocrystal preparation. Therefore, studying the effects of solvent on cocrystal is of great importance for the efficient application of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20). In this paper, the effect of solvent on cocrystallization is investigated by the CL-20/HMX cocrystal/solvent cluster model, the CL-20/HMX/solvent mixture model, the CL-20/HMX cocrystal/solvent interface model combined with quantum chemistry and molecular dynamic methods. The authors find that the hydrogen bond between CL-20 and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) is the strongest and the binding energy of cocrystal and solvent molecules is the weakest in ethyl acetate (EA) solvent, indicating that CL-20 and HMX tend to be combined together and there is less hindrance by solvent molecules. Analysis of the CL-20/HMX/solvent mixture and mass density distribution studies show that the solvent effect has a great influence on the crystal faces and the cocrystallization rate of CL-20 and HMX is the highest in EA solvent. The XRD and SEM characterization results are consistent with the theoretical calculations. The present work on the effects of solvent on CL-20/HMX cocrystals is beneficial for understanding the mechanism of the growth of energetic cocrystal materials. It is helpful in selecting more suitable theoretical and experimental conditions and makes access to excellent cocrystals more efficient.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Two-dimensional materials such as graphene can be scrolled into one-dimensional fibers via simple sonication. Unfortunately, scrolling MXene nanosheets into fibers is quite challenging, especially Ti3C2T x composed of three layers of titanium atoms and two layers of carbon atoms. Herein, we report a new method to fabricate MXene fibers via ascorbic acid (AA) induced scrolling of Ti3C2T x nanosheets. An unusual AA-Ti3C2T x interaction is discovered in that intercalated AA molecules bind to and interact with the Ti3C2T x surface in the form of a hydrogen bonding-bonded assembly instead of as individual molecules, and a sheet-scrolling mechanism is proposed based on this interaction. The as-obtained MXene fibers exhibit a compact cross-section, and the diameter can be tailored from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers through tuning the MXene/AA ratio. Moreover, the storage modulus of the MXene-fiber sponge attains its maximum value of ∼1 MPa when a unique morphology comprising both fibers and not-yet-scrolled sheets is presented. This work offers a new strategy of fiber-shaping MXenes for applications in structural composites and flexible electronics.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The [RuII(terpy)(ampy)Cl]Cl (terpy = 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine, ampy = 2-(aminomethyl)pyridine) complex was employed as the catalyst. The reactions were studied in a water/ethanol mixture as a function of formate, catalyst, and NAD+ concentrations at 37 °C. The overall process was found to be 11 to 18 times slower than for the corresponding ethylenediamine (en) complex as the result of π-back bonding effects of the ampy ligand. The mechanistic studies revealed a complete set of reactions that accounted for the overall catalytic cycle based on a formate-induced hydride transfer reaction to form the reduced coenzyme, NADH. The geometries of the ruthenium(ii)-ampy complexes involved in the catalytic cycle and free energy changes for the main steps were predicted by DFT calculations. Similar calculations were also performed for the analogues ruthenium(ii)-en and ruthenium(ii)-bipy complexes (bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine). The DFT calculated energies show that both the solvent-formato exchange and the formato-hydrido conversion reactions have negative (favourable) energies to proceed spontaneously. The reactions involving the en complex have the more negative (favourable) reaction energies, followed by the ampy complex, in agreement with faster reactions for en complexes and slower reactions for bipy complexes than for ampy complexes.","misc","christiaan","misc"

To determine the precise N-glycan structure attached to Asn374, whether A2G2S2 is composed of the Neu5Acα2,3Gal or/and the Neu5Acα2,6Gal moiety, we synthesized key glycopeptides having one of the two putative isomers. Selective reaction monitoring assay using synthetic glycopeptides as calibration standards allowed top-down glycopeptidomics for the absolute quantitation of targeted label-free glycopeptides in a range from 313.3 to 697.5 nM in the complex tryptic digests derived from serum samples of RCC patients and healthy controls.

Data were pooled with random-effect model. Efficacy endpoints include first-pass pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), acute pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection, free from AF, and free from atrial tachycardia (AT) during follow-up. Safety endpoints include esophagus injury rate and major complication rate. Effectiveness endpoints include complete PVI rate, total procedure time, PVI time, and PVI radiofrequency ablation (PVI RF) time.

The novel chiral copper-catalysts, as well as oxazolidines alone (copper free), demonstrated excellent performances in asymmetric conjugate addition and allylic alkylation with high regio- and enantio-selectivities (up to 99% ee).","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1687",35975151,"An induced-fit model for asymmetric organocatalytic reactions: a case study of the activation of olefins via chiral Brønsted acid catalysts.","We elucidate the stereo-controlling factors of the asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of terminal olefins catalyzed by bulky Brønsted acids [Science 2018, 359 (6383), 1501-1505] using high-level electronic structure methods. The catalyst-substrate interaction is described using a dispersion-driven induced-fit model, in which the conformational changes of the catalyst and of the substrate in the transition states are governed to a large extent by London dispersion forces. The distortion energy of the catalyst is dominated by the change in the intramolecular dispersion interactions, while intermolecular catalyst-substrate dispersion interactions are the major stabilizing contribution in the transition state. This model provides a new general framework in which to discuss the stereoselectivity of transformations catalyzed by such confined organocatalysts.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1688",35975154,"Cyclometalated iridium-coumarin ratiometric oxygen sensors: improved signal resolution and tunable dynamic ranges.","In this work we introduce a new series of ratiometric oxygen sensors based on phosphorescent cyclometalated iridium centers partnered with organic coumarin fluorophores. Three different cyclometalating ligands and two different pyridyl-containing coumarin types were used to prepare six target complexes with tunable excited-state energies. Three of the complexes display dual emission, with fluorescence arising from the coumarin ligand, and phosphorescence from either the cyclometalated iridium center or the coumarin. These dual-emitting complexes function as ratiometric oxygen sensors, with the phosphorescence quenched under O2 while fluorescence is unaffected. The use of blue-fluorescent coumarins results in good signal resolution between fluorescence and phosphorescence. Moreover, the sensitivity and dynamic range, measured with Stern-Volmer analysis, can be tuned two orders of magnitude by virtue of our ability to synthetically control the triplet excited-state ordering. The complex with cyclometalated iridium 3MLCT phosphorescence operates under hyperoxic conditions, whereas the two complexes with coumarin-centered phosphorescence are sensitive to very low levels of O2 and function as hypoxic sensors.","misc","christiaan","misc"

However, current methods for their construction still suffer from a number of shortcomings. For instance, using a single modification technology to modulate the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) in integer increments while maintaining homogeneity and stability remains exceptionally challenging. Herein, we report a novel method for the generation of antibody conjugates with modular cargo loading from native antibodies. Our approach relies on a new class of disulfide rebridging linkers, which can react with eight cysteine residues, thereby effecting all-in-one bridging of all four interchain disulfides in an IgG1 antibody with a single linker molecule. Modification of the antibody with the linker in a 1 : 1 ratio enabled the modulation of cargo loading in a quick and selective manner through derivatization of the linker with varying numbers of payload attachment handles to allow for attachment of either 1, 2, 3 or 4 payloads (fluorescent dyes or cytotoxins). Assessment of the biological activity of these conjugates demonstrated their exceptional stability in human plasma and utility for cell-selective cytotoxin delivery or imaging/diagnostic applications.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Some epidemiologic studies have indicated that long-term metal exposures can modulate the levels of CRP and CAMs, but the associations between prenatal metal exposures and the levels of CRP and CAMs have yet to be studied more extensively. In this study, we assessed associations between maternal blood metal levels and CRP/CAMs among 617 pregnant women in the Puerto Rico PROTECT birth cohort. Blood samples were collected from participants at 16-20 (visit 1) and 24-28 (visit 3) weeks gestation. We measured concentrations of 11 metals using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). From the blood samples, CRP and CAMs intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) were also quantified using a customized Luminex assay. Linear-mixed effects models (LMEs) were used to regress CRP and CAMs on metals and included random intercepts for study participants to account for correlated repeated outcome measures. Fetal sex and visit effects were estimated using interaction terms between metal exposure variables and fetal sex, as well as visit indicators, respectively. We observed significant positive associations between nickel and CRP (Δ: 7.04, 95% CI = 0.75, 13.73) and between lead and VCAM (Δ: 4.57, 95% CI = 1.36, 7.89). The positive associations were mainly driven by mothers carrying male fetuses. We also observed various visit-specific associations. The significant associations between metals and CRP were predominantly driven by visit 3; however, the significant associations between metals and VCAM were mainly driven by visit 1. Certain maternal blood metal levels were significantly associated with CRP and CAMs and most of these associations were differentially driven by fetal sex, as well as by timing in pregnancy. Future studies should further explore metal-CRP/CAMs associations for a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of metal-induced adverse birth outcomes.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1692",35975176,"Comprehensive Analysis of Genomic and Expression Data Identified Potential Markers for Predicting Prognosis and Immune Response in CRC.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most prevalent type of malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. In the current study, we characterized the landscape of genomic alterations in CRC patients. Based on the results of whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified 31 significantly mutated genes. Among them, several genes including TP53, KRAS, APC, PI3KCA, and BRAF were reported as significantly mutated genes in previous studies. In the current study, the most frequently mutated gene was TP53, which encodes tumor suppressor p53, affecting approximately 60% of CRC patients. In addition, we performed the expression profiles of significantly mutated genes between the normal group and tumor groups and identified 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs); among them, CSMD3, DCHS2, LRP2, RYR2, and ZFHX4 were significantly negatively correlated with PFS. Moreover, consensus clustering analysis for CRC based on the expression of significantly somatic mutated genes was performed. In total, three subtypes of CRC were identified in CRC, including cluster1 (n = 453), cluster2 (n = 158), and cluster 3 (n = 9), based on expression level of significantly somatic mutated genes. Clinicopathological features analysis showed subtype C1 had the longest progression-free survival (PFS) with median time of 8.2 years, while subtypes C2 and C3 had 4.1 and 2.7 years of PFS, respectively. Moreover, we found three subtypes related to tumor infiltration depth, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. Immune infiltration analysis showed the tumor infiltration levels of B cell native, T cell CD8+, T cell CD4+ memory activated, T cell gamma delta, NK cell resting, macrophage M0, macrophage M2, myeloid dendritic cell activated, mast cell activated, and mast cell resting significantly changed among the three groups, demonstrating the three subgroups classified by 22 somatically significantly mutated genes had a high capacity to differentiate patients with different immune statuses, which is helpful for the prediction of immunotherapy response of CRC patients. Our findings could provide novel potential predictive indicators for CRC prognosis and therapy targets for CRC immunotherapy.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of fluazaindolizine, a new non-fumigant nematicide, in comparison with the fumigant nematicide 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) and non-fumigant nematicides fluopyram and oxamyl for (1) SRKN management, (2) impacts on free-living nematodes, and (3) sweet potato yield in field trials. Among all nematicides, 1,3-D at 84 kg/ha most consistently (2 of 3 years) managed SRKN soil populations and improved yield. Fluazaindolizine at 2.24 kg/ha and fluazindolizine at 1.12 kg/ha plus oxamyl at 2.14 kg/ha managed SRKN populations and improved yield in 1 of 3 years, whereas fluazaindolizine alone at 1.12 kg/ha only decreased SRKN populations. Fluopyram at 238 g/ha did not affect SRKN or yield. Nematicide application also had non-target effects on free-living nematodes with 1,3-D reducing abundances relative to untreated most frequently (2018 and 2020), but other nematicides also reducing free-living nematode abundances in 2020. In summary, 1,3-D is the most consistent option for SRKN control on sweet potato, but fluazaindolizine, oxamyl or combinations of the two products can also be effective.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The mechanisms and the origin of these disorders are not yet understood and thus far there is a lack of prophylactic measures for these disorders. The current study aims to estimate neuronal density in the prefrontal cortex and four hippocampal subf ields, i. e. СA1, СA2, СA3, and DG in Clstn2-KO mice as a genetic model of ASD. In addition, the level of neurogenesis was measured in the DG area of the hippocampus. This mouse strain was obtained by a knockout of the calsinthenin-2 gene (Clsnt2) in C57BL/6J mice; the latter (wild type) was used as controls. To estimate neuronal density, serial sections were prepared on a cryotome for the above-mentioned brain structures with the subsequent immunohistochemical labeling and confocal microscopy; the neuronal marker (anti-NeuN) was used as the primary antibody. In addition, neurogenesis was estimated in the DG region of the hippocampus; for this purpose, a primary antibody against doublecortin (anti-DCX) was used. In all cases Goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody. The density of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was lower in Clstn2-KO mice of both sexes as compared with controls. Moreover, in males of both strains, neuronal density in this region was lower as compared to females. Besides, the differences between males and females were revealed in two other hippocampal regions. In the CA2 region, a lower density of neurons was observed in males of both strains, and in the CA3 region, a lower density of neurons was also observed in males as compared to females but only in C57BL/6J mice. No difference between the studied groups was revealed in neurogenesis, nor was it in neuronal density in the prefrontal cortex or DG hippocampal region. Our new f indings indicate that calsyntenin-2 regulates neuronal hippocampal density in subf ield-specif ic manner, suggesting that the CA1 neuronal subpopulation may represent a cellular target for early-life preventive therapy of ASD. Расстройства аутистического спектра (РАС) – это группа состояний, возникающих в детском возрасте, для которых характерны трудности с социальным взаимодействием и общением, a также нетипичные модели поведения и склонность к стереотипии. Механизмы возникновения этой группы расстройств до сих пор не вполне понятны, и, следовательно, отсутствуют соответствующие методы профилактики. Целью исследования была оценка плотности нейронов в медиальной префронтальной коре и четырех областях гиппокампа, а именно СA1, СA2, СA3 и зубчатой извилины (DG) у мышей линии Clstn2-KO, которая может выступать в качестве генетической модели РАС. Кроме того, охарактеризовали уровень нейрогенеза в области DG гиппокампа. Данная линия получена путем нокаута гена кальсинтенина-2 (Clstn2) на основе мышей линии С57BL/6J; последняя была использована в настоящем исследовании в качестве контроля. Для определения плотности нейронов изготавливали серийные срезы соответствующих областей мозга на криотоме с последующим иммуногистохимическим окрашиванием и конфокальной микроскопией, для чего использовали нейрональный маркер (anti-NeuN) в качестве первичного антитела. Наряду с этим в области DG гиппокампа оценивали нейрогенез, для чего проводили иммуногистохимическое окрашивание с применением антитела против даблкортина (anti-DCX). В обоих случаях в качестве вторичного антитела был Goat anti-rabbit IgG. Плотность нейронов в области гиппокампа СА1 была снижена как у самцов, так и самок мышей Clstn2-KO по сравнению с контролем; у самцов обеих линий плотность нейронов была ниже в этой области по сравнению с самками. Помимо этого, были обнаружены различия между самцами и самками в двух других областях гиппокампа: в области CA2 – у мышей обеих исследованных линий, а в области CA3 лишь у мышей C57BL/6J плотность нейронов была меньше у самцов по сравнению с самками. Различий между исследованными группами в уровне нейрогенеза, а также в плотности нейронов в префронтальной коре и области DG гиппокампа не обнаружено. Полученные результаты показывают, что нокаут по гену Clstn2 приводит к избирательному снижению плотности нейронов в CA1-области гиппокампа, что может представлять собой клеточную мишень для ранней профилактики и возможной терапии РАС.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Moving to a residential care facility represents a critical moment for older adults. It disrupts the continuity of their lives and distances them from significant people and objects. Health care personnel working in residential care facilities can help create a sense of home for residents. There is a lack of qualitative reviews reporting health care personnel's experiences with promoting a sense of home for older adults living in residential care settings. Qualitative studies exploring the experiences of health care personnel with promoting a sense of home for people aged 65 and older living in residential care facilities, including, but not limited to, nursing homes, residential care homes, retirement homes, assisted-living facilities, and skilled nursing facilities. This review followed a meta-aggregation approach according to JBI methodology for systematic reviews of qualitative evidence. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and ILISI databases were searched, as well as Google Scholar, OpenGrey, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. Studies published in English, Italian, French, Portuguese, or Spanish were considered. Study selection, critical appraisal, data extraction, and data synthesis were conducted by two independent reviewers using the JBI approach and JBI standardized tools. Finally, the ConQual approach was used to assess the confidence level in the study findings. Seven studies conducted in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, or the Netherlands between 2014 and 2020 were included. The studies reported the experiences of nurses, nurse aides, and directors of facilities. From the aggregation of 69 findings, 14 categories were generated that were then grouped into three synthesized findings describing the experiences of health care personnel as follows: the promotion of residents' sense of home in residential care facilities is influenced by i) the built environment, including private, single rooms with bathrooms, homelike-domestic spaces, personalization of residents' rooms, homelike interior and exterior design, and non-hospital-like environment; ii) the national and local policy and regulations, and work organization, as well as leadership of managers and directors; and 3) the facilities' care culture, including philosophy of care, maintaining autonomy of residents and ties with the community, participation in domestic and recreational activities, and family relationships. Based on ConQual scores, the confidence level in the synthesized findings was graded as low. According to health care personnel, the physical environment, interpersonal and social aspects, regulations, work organization, and facilities' care culture can contribute to creating a sense of home for older adults in residential care facilities. The evidence derived from this review can help health care personnel, facility directors, and policy-makers identify the changes that should be implemented to promote a sense of home in older adults residing in care facilities.

In particular, the review will examine the experiences related to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to improve sleep. Approximately 80% to 90% of patients with depression suffer from insomnia, which is associated with substantial personal and social costs. Despite these costs, insomnia is often underdiagnosed and viewed as a symptom that disappears when depression abates. However, research indicates that insomnia and depression are distinct but overlapping disorders. Thus, it is important to treat both disorders simultaneously, as improving sleep may, in turn, ease core symptoms of depression. Optimal care and treatment rely on patients' experiences of insomnia and their attitudes toward treatment options. Therefore, it is important to synthesize evidence of patients' experiences of living with insomnia and the experience of pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep interventions to understand the consequences of insomnia and to optimize sleep interventions.

Nurses are required for round-the-clock patient care, and night shift nurses can experience detrimental effects because of their work hours, which disrupt their normal circadian rhythm. Understanding nurses' experiences and perceptions when working night shift will facilitate the development of strategies to minimize the potential negative effects of working at night. In examining nurses' experiences and perceptions of working night shift, there is scope to explore how to improve night shift nurses' practice environment and job satisfaction, which will then translate to improved nurse and patient outcomes. This review included qualitative studies focused on registered nurses and licensed practical nurses who work the night shift or rotate between day and night shift. This review followed the JBI methodology for systematic reviews of qualitative evidence. The methodology used was consistent with the a priori protocol. Studies included in this review were those published in full text, English, and between 1983 (when the seminal work on hospitals that attract and retain nurses was published) and February 2021, when the search was completed. The main databases searched for published and unpublished studies included MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science.From the search, two reviewers independently screened the studies against the inclusion criteria, and then papers selected for inclusion were assessed for methodological quality. Qualitative data was then extracted from the included papers independently by the four reviewers. Results from each reviewer were discussed and clarified to reach agreement. The extracted findings were pooled and examined for shared meaning, coded, and grouped into categories. Common categories were grouped into meta-synthesis to produce a comprehensive set of synthesized findings. The final synthesized findings were graded using the ConQual approach, to determine the level of confidence (trust) users may have in the value of the synthesized findings. Thirty-four papers, representing 33 studies, conducted in 11 countries, six continents, and a total of 601 participants met the criteria for inclusion. From these, a total of 220 findings were extracted and combined to form 11 categories based on similarity in meaning, and three syntheses were derived: i) The Other shift: The distinctiveness of night nursing; ii) Juggling sleep and all aspects of life when working nights; and iii) Existing in the Twilight Zone: Battling the negative impact of sleep deprivation consumes nurses who strive to keep patients, self, and others safe. The major conclusions from this review are the uniqueness of working the night shift and the sleep deprivation of night nurses. Organizational strategies and support are needed for those working this shift, which will enhance nurse and patient safety.

Hippocampal microvessels were isolated from high-fat diet fed mice and assessed for insulin signaling activation, a process known to be involved with receptor internalization. Surface insulin receptors in brain microvascular endothelial cells were labelled to assess the role hyperinsulinemia plays on receptor internalization in response to stimulation, with and without the PTP1B antagonist, Claramine. Our results indicated that insulin receptor levels increased in tandem with decreased receptor signaling in the high-fat diet mouse microvessels. Insulin receptors of cells subjected to hyperinsulinemic treatment demonstrate splice variation towards decreased IR-A mRNA expression and demonstrate a higher membrane-localized proportion. This corresponded with decreased autophosphorylation at sites critical for receptor internalization and signaling. Claramine restored signaling and receptor internalization in cells treated with hyperinsulinemia. In conclusion, hyperinsulinemia impacts brain microvascular endothelial cell insulin receptor signaling and internalization, likely via alternative splicing and increased negative feedback from PTP1B.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Little is known about the disparity of clinicopathologic characteristics between transformed DLBCL (tDLBCL) and primary DLBCL (pDLBCL). This retrospective study analyzed the clinicopathological hallmarks of 10 tDLBCL (7 MZL and 3 FL) and 40 pDLBCL from the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University. Patients of tDLBCL had a higher ECOG score, more B-symptoms, and lower serum albumin level than those in pDLBCL (60.0% vs. 7.50%, 40.0% vs. 10.0%, and 90.0% vs. 10.0%, respectively, p < 0.01). Pathologically, tDLBCL had more c-Myc and BCL-2 dual-expression than that in pDLBCL (60.0% vs. 25.0%, p < 0.01). The positive rate of CD5 expression and the proportion of high Ki-67 score in tDLBCL were higher than those in pDLBCL (50.0% vs. 7.5%, 50.0% vs. 32.5%, respectively, p < 0.01). The median overall survival and progression-free survival were 14 months and 11 months in tDLBCL, 35 months and 28 months in pDLBCL (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001). Our results demonstrate that tDLBCL manifested aggressive clinical course and pathological features of Myc/BCL-2 expression, CD5 expression, and high Ki-67 score.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Patients diagnosed with primary hvKp pneumonia were included, and their clinical data were analyzed, including the baseline characteristics and CT imaging results. After hypermucoviscosity phenotyping, the strains, serological types, and virulence genes of hvKp were identified using multiplex PCR. Twelve patients with primary hvKp pneumonia were included (11 males, 1 female). All patients were infected via respiratory tract inhalation. Ten patients were long-term drinkers. Four patients (33.3%), who were long-term alcohol abusers, died within 30 days after diagnosis. No extrapulmonary metastatic infection was found in any patient. The imaging of lung lesions at the early disease stage exhibited an extensive consolidation in the lungs. As the disease progressed, the most common imaging features were pleural effusion (9/12), cavitation and necrosis (8/12), and pneumothorax (3/12). The serological typing of the capsular polysaccharides on hvKp strains were K1 (6/12) and K2 (6/12). Furthermore, the virulence genotyping showed rmpA (11/12), magA (11/12), ureA (12/12), mrkD (12/12), fim-1 (12/12), wabG (12/12), ybtS (12/12), and iucB (11/12). Primary severe community-acquired hvKp-associated pneumonia is more common in men, especially those with a long-term history of alcohol consumption. CT scanning at the early disease stage mostly showed extensive pulmonary consolidation, which was prone to be combined with cavitation, necrosis, and pleural effusion.

The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DFPP in sHTG patients (TG > 1,000 mg/dL). This was a prospective single-center study in which patients with severe symptomatic drug and diet refractory HTG were recruited. Peripheral venous access of upper extremities was used for DFPP. Blood flow rate was 100 - 120 mL/min and plasma separation rate was 800 - 1,000 mL/h. Plasma volume to treat in each case was calculated with the Kaplan formula. Anticoagulation was achieved by low molecular weight heparin. Treatment goal was triglyceride level decreased to normal (< 1.7 mmol/L). Epidemiological data, lipid, hematological parameters as well as side effects were evaluated before and after DFPP. Seven patients (6 males and 1 female) were consecutively enrolled to this trial. There was diabetes mellitus type 2 in four patients and obesity-associated nephropathy in one patient. The mean age was 42.5 years. The average TG level before plasmapheresis was 17.41 mmol/L (range 10.93 - 26.33 mmol/L). After one session, the levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL-c, HDL-c decreased significantly by 58.3%, 43.2%, 41.9%, 20.7%, respectively. The mean number of treatment sessions was 1.5 (range 1 - 3). DFPP was well-tolerated. Except for transient decrease of albumin, globulin and fibrinogen, liver and renal functions, hematological parameters did not change significantly.

In this study, CD3+T lymphocytes from ITP patients were screened for differentially expressed genes. The expression of miR-21 and miR-155 in T lymphocytes of ITP patients were investigated. The downstream target genes of miR-21 and miR-155 were also searched for the correlation between differentially expressed genes of ITP. Differential gene screening was performed using the GSE43177 data set in the GEO database, and the expression of miR-21 and miR-155 in T lymphocytes of ITP patients was verified by qPCR. The interaction network of core downstream target genes and ITP differentially expressed genes of miR-21 and miR-155 were constructed with the STRING database, and the associated factors were verified by qPCR. In ITP patients, the expression of CD8+T lymphocytes increased, the expression of CD4+T lymphocytes decreased, and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+T cells decreased. Fourteen genes were differentially expressed in CD3+T lymphocytes, all of which were upregulated, and the expression of S100A8 was increased in ITP patients. The expression of miR-21-5p and miR-155-5p increased in CD3+T lymphocytes of initial ITP patients. The core down-stream target gene VCL of miR-21 was associated with the differentially expressed genes such as LTF, LCN2, and DEFA4 in the interaction network.

This study included 85 GDM and 85 age-matched normal pregnant women who visited our hospital from January 2019 to January 2020. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the expression of miR-221 and miR-320 in the plasma of pregnant women. The correlation analysis was used to detect the relationship between miR-221, miR-320, and risk factors of GDM, including homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the prepregnancy BMI. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to determine the diagnostic value of miR-320 and miR-221 in GDM. Compared with normal pregnant women, the expression of miR-221 and miR-320 in GDM was significantly higher (p < 0.05). The results also demonstrate that the expression of miR-221 and miR-320 increases grad-ually with the development of pregnancy in GDM at 24 weeks, 28 weeks, and 32 weeks (p < 0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis confirmed that the expression level of miR-221 and miR-320 in the plasma of GDM is positively correlated with the HOMA-IR and HbA1c, but has no significant correlation with pre-pregnancy BMI. The area under the curve (AUC) values of miR-221 and miR-320 were 0.862 and 0.853, respectively. Meanwhile, the area under the combined detection curve is 0.904. Plasma miR-221 and miR-320 are significantly elevated in GDM, and are positively correlated with HbA1c and HOMA-IR.

Recently, some researchers hypothesized that dysregulation of the bradykinin (BK) system may also play a role in the pathogenesis of severe disease. Des-Arg(9)-bradykinin (DABK), an active metabolite of BK, is responsible for vasodilatation and increased permeability in the lungs and regulated by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). Viral inhibition of ACE-2 by SARS-CoV-2 increases DABK levels. Serum levels of this metabolite may be linked to disease severity in COVID-19 patients. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the prognostic value of serial measurement of serum DABK levels in severe COVID-19 patients. This prospective cohort study was conducted in hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients. Serum DABK levels of patients were serially measured on day 0, day 3 and day 5. Patients were categorized as cases with poor or good prognosis and critical or non-critical cases. Serum DABK levels of these patient groups were compared with paired sample t-test. Serum DABK levels on different days in the same patients were compared with repeated measures ANOVA tests. There was no statistically significant difference in serum DABK levels measured at day 0, day 3, and day 5 between good and poor prognosis groups. DABK levels in critical and non-critical COVID-19 patients also did not show any significant difference.

Detailed analysis on the growth of TiO2 on pre-annealed Si/TiN/Ti and HfO2 (HFO) surfaces is also given. For Si/TiN/Ti, a pre-annealing procedure led to the transformation of Ti to a TiO2 layer which acts as a seed for aligned growth of TiO2 nanorods. In contrast, Si/HFO does not provide a nucleation site for the formation of aligned nanorods. Various samples were prepared by varying the synthesis conditions, i.e. pre- and post-annealing temperatures and hydrothermal reaction time to figure out the optimum conditions which lead to unidirectional and highly aligned nanorods. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to study structural, morphological and optical properties of synthesized samples. It is found that TiO2 nanorods exhibit a rutile phase on the Si/Ti/TiN and Si/HFO substrates, but highly oriented vertical growth of nanorods has been observed only on pre-annealed Si/TiN/Ti substrates. On the other hand, TiO2 nanorods form dandelion-like structures on Si/HFO substrates. Growth of vertically oriented TiO2 nanorods on Si/TiN/Ti is attributed to the TiO2 seed layer which forms after the process of pre-annealing of substrates at a suitable temperature. Variation in hydrothermal reaction time and post-annealing temperature brings further improvement in crystallinity and morphology of nanorods. This work shows that the pre-annealed Si/TiN/Ti substrate is the optimal choice to achieve vertically oriented, highly aligned TiO2 nanorods.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The role of the electron lone pairs of Pb atoms in the phase transition was investigated through the analysis of the electron localization function (ELF) calculated based on the DFT-geometry optimized structures of the three polymorphs. The changes in spatial distribution of the 6s2 electron density during the phase transitions were explored by means of the Wannier Function Centres (WFCs) derived from ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. In the high-temperature hexagonal structure the 6s2 electrons are spherically symmetric relative to the position of Pb atoms.

This approach always reveals a copper bond valence excess relative to the unit value, correlated to an equivalent ligand bond valence deficit. In stoichiometric chalcogenides, this corresponds to one ligand electron in excess per formula unit relative to the valence equilibrium considering only CuI. This ligand electron in excess is 50/50 shared between all or part of the Cu-atom positions, and all or part of the ligand-atom positions. In Cu3Se2, only one of the two Cu positions is involved in this sharing. It would indicate a special type of multicentre bonding (`one-electron co-operative bonding'). Calculated and ideal structural formulae according to this bond valence distribution are presented. At the crystal structure scale, Cu-ligand bonds implying the single electron in excess form one-, two- or three-dimensional subnetworks. Bond valence distribution according to two two-dimensional subnets is detailed in covellite, CuS. This bond valence description is a formal crystal-chemical representation of the metallic conductivity of holes (mixing between Cu 3d bands and ligand p bands), according to published electronic band structures.

To this end, we provide add-on terms to the existing number series with their respective running indices for zinc-blende- (zb-) and diamond-structure NWire cross sections. Such add-on terms to all variables yield the required flexibility for cross section morphing, with main variables presented by the number of NWire atoms NWire(dWire[i]), bonds between NWire atoms Nbnd(dWire[i]) and interface bonds NIF(dWire[i]). Other basic geometric variables, such as the specific length of interface facets, as well as widths, heights and total area of the cross section, are given as well. The cross sections refer to the six high-symmetry zb NWires with low-index faceting frequently occurring in the bottom-up and top-down approaches of NWire processing. The fundamental insights into NWire structures revealed here offer a universal gauge and thus enable major advancements in data interpretation and the understanding of all zb- and diamond-structure-based NWires with arbitrary convex cross sections.

The crystal structure analysis of [PbL(OAc)] showed that the PbII cation is N,N',S-chelated by the tridentate pincer-type ligand L and by the oxygen atoms of the acetate anion. In addition, the metal centre forms Pb...O and Pb...S tetrel bonds with an adjacent complex molecule, yielding a 1D zigzag polymeric chain, which is reinforced by N-H...O hydrogen bonds and π...π interactions. These chains are interlinked by C-H...py non-covalent interactions, realized between one of the acetate hydrogen atoms and the pyridine rings. According to the Hirshfeld surface analysis, the crystal packing is mainly characterized by intermolecular H...H, H...C and H...O contacts, followed by H...N, H...S, C...C, C...N, Pb...H, Pb...O and Pb...S contacts. The FTIR and 1H NMR spectra of [PbL(OAc)] testify to the deprotonation of the parent ligand HL, while the acetate ligand exhibits an anisobidentate coordination mode as established by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy. Lastly, theoretical calculations at the PBE0-D3/def2-TZVP level of theory have been used to analyze and characterize the Pb...O and Pb...S tetrel bonds observed in the crystal of [PbL(OAc)], using a combination of QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules) and NCIPlot (Non-Covalent Interaction Plot) computational tools.","misc","christiaan","misc"

How to cope with breech delivery (vaginal or C-section) has been discussed to find the safest in terms of morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess the risks of foetal and maternal mortality and perinatal morbidity associated with vaginal delivery against elective caesarean in breech presentations, as reported in observational studies. Studies assessing perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with breech presentations births. Cochrane, Medline, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cuiden databases were consulted. This protocol was registered in PROSPERO CRD42020197598. Selection criteria were: years between 2010 and 2020, in English language, and full-term gestation (37-42 weeks). The methodological quality of the eligible articles was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analyses were performed to study each parameter related to neonatal mortality and maternal morbidity. The meta-analysis included 94 285 births with breech presentation. The relative risk of perinatal mortality was 5.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.61-11.51) times higher in the vaginal delivery group, 4.12 (95% CI = 2.46-6.89) for birth trauma and 3.33 (95% CI = 1.95-5.67) for Apgar results. Maternal morbidity showed a relative risk 0.30 (95% CI = 0.13-0.67) times higher in the planned caesarean group. An increment in the risk of perinatal mortality, birth trauma, and Apgar lower than 7 was identified in planned vaginal delivery.

The current study used a lumbar spinal disk puncture (DP) model of low back pain in wild-type (WT) and muMT mice to evaluate pronociceptive adaptive immune responses. Spinal disks and cords were collected 3 weeks after DP for polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analyses. Wild-type DP mice developed 24 weeks of hindpaw mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia, grip weakness, and a conditioned place preference response indicative of spontaneous pain, but pain responses were attenuated or absent in muMT DP mice. Spinal cord expression of inflammatory cytokines, immune cell markers, and complement components were increased in WT DP mice and in muMT DP mice. Dorsal horn immunostaining in WT DP mice demonstrated glial activation and increased complement 5a receptor expressionin spinal neurons. Serum collected from WT DP mice and injected into muMT DP mice caused nociceptive sensitization, as did intrathecal injection of IgM collected from WT DP mice, and IgM immune complexes were observed in lumbar spinal disks and cord of WT DP mice. Serum from WT tibia fracture mice was not pronociceptive in muMT DP mice and vice versa, evidence that each type of tissue trauma chronically generates its own unique antibodies and targeted antigens. These data further support the pronociceptive autoimmunity hypothesis for the transition from tissue injury to chronic musculoskeletal pain state.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Emerging findings indicate an important interaction between the gut microbiota and the lungs, and that the development of asthma causes changes in the gut environment. Hylocereus undatus flower (HUF) is a traditional Chinese medicine used in the treatment of pulmonary and intestinal diseases. Our previous studies have demonstrated significant anti-asthmatic and anti-inflammatory activity, but the exact mechanism has not been elucidated. In the current study, we validated the potential therapeutic asthma properties of HUF in vivo using an ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma mouse model. We found that HUF treatment significantly reduced the key features of allergic asthma, including an elevated respiratory rate, inflammatory cell accumulation, airway inflammation, and the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules. Histological analysis of mouse lungs showed that HUF attenuated lung inflammatory cell infiltration. Periodic acid-Schiff staining confirmed the reduced mucus secretion in lung mucosa, and Masson's staining confirmed the reduced collagen deposition in the lungs after HUF treatment. Western blot and immunohistochemistry confirmed that HUF increased lung SIRT1 and reduced p38MAPK, NF-κBp65, and caspase-1 proteins. 16 S rDNA sequencing showed that HUF improved the endostasis of the disrupted gut microbiota composition in asthmatic mice. Surprisingly, an inflammatory response was found in the gut of asthmatic mice, along with alterations in inflammation-associated SIRT1 and caspase-1 proteins, and HUF was able to ameliorate these lesions. In conclusion, these findings suggest that HUF may be a new drug candidate for the treatment of allergic asthma.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

To quantify changes in nursing home facility staffing during and after a severe COVID-19 outbreak. In this cohort study, daily staffing payroll data were used to construct weekly measures of facility staffing, absences, departures, and use of overtime and contract staff among US nursing homes experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak that started between June 14, 2020, and January 1, 2021. Facility outbreaks were identified using COVID-19 case data. An event-study design with facility and week fixed effects was used to investigate the association of severe outbreaks with staffing measures. Weeks since the beginning of a severe COVID-19 outbreak (4 weeks prior to 16 weeks after). Total weekly staffing hours, staff counts, staff absences, departures, new hires, overtime and contract staff hours measured for all nursing staff and separately by staff type (registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, certified nursing assistants), facility self-reported staff shortages, and resident deaths. Of the included 2967 nursing homes experiencing severe COVID-19 outbreaks, severe outbreaks were associated with a statistically significant drop in nursing staffing levels owing to elevated absences and departures. Four weeks after an outbreak's start, around when average new cases peaked, staffing hours were 2.6% (95% CI, 2.1%-3.2%) of the mean below preoutbreak levels, despite facilities taking substantial measures to bolster staffing through increased hiring and the use of contract staff and overtime. Because these measures were mostly temporary, staffing declined further in later weeks; 16 weeks after an outbreak's start, staffing hours were 5.5% (95% CI, 4.5%-6.5%) of the mean below preoutbreak levels. Staffing declines were greatest among certified nursing assistants, primarily owing to smaller increases in new hires of this staff type compared with licensed practical nurses and registered nurses. In this cohort study of nursing homes experiencing severe COVID-19 outbreaks, facilities experienced considerable staffing challenges during and after outbreaks. These results suggest the need for policy action to ensure facilities' abilities to maintain adequate staffing levels during and after infectious disease outbreaks.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

There is debate as to whether the APOE gene accounts for all genetic variation of the APOE locus. Another question which remains is whether APOE-ε4 carriers have other genetic factors influencing the progression of amyloid positive individuals to AD. We conducted a genome-wide association study in a sample of 5,390 APOE-ε4 homozygous (ε4ε4) individuals (288 cases and 5102 controls) aged 65 or over in the UK Biobank. We found no significant associations of SNPs in the APOE locus with AD in the sample of ε4ε4 individuals.

We demonstrate association of LATE-NC with the previously unappreciated age-related tau oligodendrogliopathy (ARTOG) and highlight the association of LATE-NC with various ARTAG types pointing toward common pathogenic aspects. Only neurofibrillary tangles and LATE-NC were associated with cognitive decline.

"1738",35977783,"Effects of Plasticity on Elevational Range Size and Species Richness.","AbstractElevational ranges within many taxa are greater in the north temperate region than the tropics. Two hypotheses to explain the pattern are, first, that large elevational ranges in the temperate region arise because species have evolved broad tolerance curves in response to seasonality and, second, that a low diversification rate in the temperate region (speciation minus extinction) has led to relatively few species, each of which occupies a large elevational range in the absence of competitors (character release). We build a quantitative genetic model of selection on a phenotypic trait, whereby increased tolerance is modeled as arising from plasticity in the trait. We show that broad tolerances result in evolution of large elevational ranges because they induce shallower genotypic clines and hence reduced maladaptive gene flow. The evolution of large elevational ranges results in relatively few competing species arranged along the elevational gradient at a species carrying capacity. In such saturated communities, species have much elevational overlap. In contrast, in similar-sized communities that could accommodate many more species, the resulting character release is associated with smaller elevational overlaps. Empirical assessment of these predictions should contribute to assessing any role for ecological limits in driving the latitudinal diversity gradient in species richness.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1739",35977785,"The Mismatch between Range and Niche Limits due to Source-Sink Dynamics Can Be Greater than Species Mean Dispersal Distance.","AbstractSpecies distribution models assume that at broad spatial scales, environmental conditions determine species ranges and, as such, source-sink dynamics can be ignored. A rationale behind this assumption is that source-sink dynamics manifest at length scales comparable to species mean dispersal distance, which is much smaller than length scales of species distribution and variation in climate. Using a two-dimensional reaction-diffusion model, we show that species can use sink habitats near the niche limit as stepping-stones to occupy sink habitats much further than the mean dispersal distance, thereby extending the distribution far beyond the environmental niche limit. This mismatch between range and niche limits is mediated by the shape (local curvature) of the niche limit. These curvature effects may be significant for a highly dispersive species with low per capita growth rate sensitivity to changes in the environment. These findings underscore the potential importance of stepping-stone dispersal in determining range limits.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1740",35977786,"Multituberculate Mammals Show Evidence of a Life History Strategy Similar to That of Placentals, Not Marsupials.","AbstractThe remarkable evolutionary success of placental mammals has been partly attributed to their reproductive strategy of prolonged gestation and birthing of relatively precocial, quickly weaned neonates. Although this strategy was conventionally considered derived relative to that of marsupials with highly altricial neonates and long lactation periods, mounting evidence has challenged this view. Until now the fossil record has been relatively silent on this debate, but here we find that proportions of different bone tissue microstructures in the femoral cortices of small extant marsupials and placentals correlate with length of lactation period, allowing us to apply this histological correlate of reproductive strategies to Late Cretaceous and Paleocene members of Multituberculata, an extinct mammalian clade that is phylogenetically stemward of Theria. Multituberculate bone histology closely resembles that of placentals, suggesting that they had similar life history strategies. A stem-therian clade exhibiting evidence of placental-like life histories supports the hypothesis that intense maternal-fetal contact characteristic of placentals is ancestral for therians. Alternatively, multituberculates and placentals may have independently evolved prolonged gestation and abbreviated lactation periods. Our results challenge the hypothesis that the rise of placental mammals was driven by unique life history innovations and shed new light on early mammalian diversification.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1741",35977787,"New Evidence Suggests No Sex Bias in Herbivory or Plant Defense.","AbstractDioecious plants can exhibit sexual dimorphism across a suite of plant traits, including susceptibility to herbivory and secondary chemistry. One hypothesis is that because of greater costs of reproduction in females, males should grow faster and invest less in defense, resulting in male-biased herbivory. Indeed, a series of articles and a prominent meta-analysis have established male-biased herbivory as a rule. However, more recent reviews have raised questions about how general the pattern is, citing the low breadth of taxon sampling. The literature on this topic has not been formally quantified by meta-analysis in over 15 years. Here, we report the results of a meta-analysis of studies that measured sex bias in either herbivory and/or secondary defense in 71 dioecious plant species. We added 58 observations of herbivory and 41 of secondary chemistry to the original. We control for nonindependence of effects from the same study and taxonomic group to address critiques of earlier studies. For secondary chemistry, we found no support for any consistent difference between male and female plants. For herbivory, results are directionally similar to earlier reports, although not statistically significant once we accounted for taxonomic group and study. We also found that earlier studies reported stronger male bias than more recent studies. We discuss our results in light of the decline effect, where the magnitude of a described effect declines as the number of observations increases, and consider whether the data sets exhibit signs of evidence of the type(s) of biases that can result in declining effect sizes over time.","meta_analysis","christiaan","meta_analysis"
"1742",35977788,"Stochasticity Leads to Coexistence of Generalists and Specialists in Assembling Mutualistic Communities.","AbstractSpecies interaction networks are subject to natural and anthropogenic disturbances that lead to their disassembly, while natural regeneration or restoration efforts facilitate their reassembly. Previous models for assembling ecological networks did not include stochasticity at the level of population dynamics (e.g., demographic noise, environmental noise) and focused mainly on food webs. Here, we present a model for the assembly of mutualistic bipartite networks, such as plant-pollinator networks, and examine the influence of demographic noise on the trajectory of species and strategy diversity, that is, the range of present strategies from specialism to generalism. We find that assembled communities show at intermediate assembly stages a maximum of species diversity and of average generalization. Our model thus provides a mechanism for nonlinear, hump-shaped diversity trajectories at intermediate succession, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Long-term coexistence of specialists and generalists emerges only in the presence of demographic noise and is due to a persistent species turnover. These findings highlight the importance of stochasticity for maintaining long-term diversity.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Current guidelines recommend screening for hypoglycemia in at-risk babies (late preterm, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, and infants of diabetic mothers). Past studies have suggested other potential risk factors, such as maternal obesity, gestational hypertension, cesarean section, etc. In this study, we aim to identify additional prenatal and perinatal maternal/fetal characteristics associated with early asymptomatic hypoglycemia in term and late preterm babies. We performed a retrospective review on medical charts of all newborns, born between January, 2017 and December, 2020, in the well-baby newborn nursery of a tertiary medical center. We identified newborns who had received blood glucose concentration monitor after birth. Detailed prenatal and perinatal maternal/newborn information were collected for analysis. In the study period, 841 newborns had received blood glucose screening after birth. After matching by sex and indication for postnatal blood glucose screen (SGA, LGA, and GDM), 148 newborns were included in the hypoglycemia group and 296 newborns were included in the euglycemia group. In the univariate analysis, parity, insulin treatment for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and cesarean section were associated with an increased risk for neonatal hypoglycemia. Factors associated with decreased risk included higher gestational age, longer duration of skin-to-skin contact, neonatal hyperthermia, higher maternal labor pain score, and epidural anesthesia administration. By multivariable analysis, insulin treatment for GDM was identified as an independent factor associated with increased risk for neonatal hypoglycemia. Our study showed insulin treatment for GDM to be independently associated with neonatal hypoglycemia. Other risk factors noted in the univariate analysis, such as decreased skin-to-skin contact duration, hypothermia, Cesarean section, and preterm delivery, would require further investigation to confirm the findings.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Research suggests that these tools may have different predictive performance depending on patient group characteristics. Therefore, we designed this study to identify the factors that make the mortality rates predicted by the tools different. This retrospective study included patients (<18 years) who were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit from July 2017 to May 2019. After defining the predicted mortality of PIM 3 minus the predicted mortality rate of PELOD-2 as difference in mortality prediction, the clinical characteristics significantly related to this were analyzed using multivariable regression analysis. Predictive performance was analyzed through the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). In total, 945 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 3.0 [0.0-8.0] years; girls, 44.7%) were analyzed.

The superiority of ATG over BSX has not been well established, especially in elderly KT recipients with low immunological risk. A total of 847 elderly (≥60 years old), low-risk KT patients in the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry were propensity score-matched at a 1:2 ratio and compared according to ATG or BSX induction therapy. The primary outcome was patient and graft survival and biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection. The secondary outcome was graft function, BK virus nephropathy, infection, cancer, new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT), and delayed graft function. In total, 165 patients in the ATG group were matched with 298 patients in the BSX group with average ages of 64.3 and 64.2 years, respectively. During a follow-up of 28.5 ± 10.4 months, the cumulative probabilities of death-censored graft failure at 3 years posttransplantation were 1.3% and 1.4% in ATG and BSX groups, respectively, without a significant difference (p = 0.72). The cumulative probability of NODAT at 3 years posttransplantation was significantly higher in the BSX group (35.6% vs. 21.6%, p = 0.02). The median tacrolimus trough level was significantly lower at 6 months after KT in the ATG group (5.7 ng/mL vs. 6.4 ng/mL, p = 0.001). There were no differences in the other evaluated outcomes. Compared with BSX, in elderly, low-risk KT patients, ATG reduced tacrolimus and steroid requirements without differences in all-cause mortality, rejection, or infection, resulting in a reduced NODAT incidence.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

The present study determined prognostic factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality in patients with AKI and cancer undergoing CRRT. We included 471 patients with AKI and cancer who underwent CRRT at the intensive care unit of a Korean tertiary hospital from 2013 to 2020, and classified them by malignancy type. The primary outcomes were 28-day all-cause mortality rate and prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was renal replacement therapy (RRT) dependency at hospital discharge. The 28-day mortality rates were 58.8% and 82% in the solid and hematologic malignancy groups, respectively. Body mass index (BMI), presence of oliguria, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and albumin level were common predictors of 28-day mortality in the solid and hematologic malignancy groups. A high heart rate and the presence of severe acidosis were prognostic factors only in the solid malignancy group. Among the survivors, the proportion with RRT dependency was 25.0% and 33.3% in the solid and hematologic malignancy groups, respectively. The 28-day mortality rate of cancer patients with AKI undergoing CRRT was high in both the solid and hematologic malignancy groups. BMI, presence of oliguria, SOFA score, and albumin level were common predictors of 28-day mortality in the solid and hematologic malignancy groups, but a high heart rate and severe acidosis were prognostic factors only in the solid malignancy group.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Inflammation plays a critical role in its development and progression. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells secrete inflammatory factors that modulate ocular immune response. However, it is unclear how diabetes regulates the expression of inflammatory factors in RPE cells. In this study, streptozocin (STZ) was applied to induce diabetic alterations in the retinas of mice, and RPE cells were further purified to profile gene expressions. The IL-17 signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched and the only enriched inflammation pathway in the profile via KEGG analysis. IL-17A induced the expression of targeted genes, which was enhanced by high glucose levels, suggesting a synergistic effect of IL-17A and high glucose. High glucose did not affect the mRNA stability of IL-17A-targeted genes or the activity of IL-17A signaling transduction, but it boosted the histone acetylation on IL-17A-targeted genes. Curcumin, an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase, abolished high glucose-enhanced histone acetylation of IL-17A-targeted genes and blocked the promotion of high glucose levels on gene expression induced by IL-17A. In conclusion, high glucose levels promote IL-17A-induced gene expression via histone acetylation in RPE cells.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

We probed into the mechanisms of MSC-EV-enclosed miR-223-3p in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiac inflammation, pyroptosis, and dysfunction. The cardiomyocyte model of cardiac dysfunction was induced by LPS, followed by determination of miR-223-3p expression. Next, we discerned the relation among miR-223-3p, FOXO3, and NLRP3. LPS-exposed cardiomyocytes were co-incubated with EVs from mouse MSCs to detect inflammation and pyroptosis using the gain- or loss-of-function experimentations. LPS-induced myocarditis mouse models were also prepared for further validating the effects of miR-223-3p from MSCs-derived EVs. Reduced miR-223-3p was witnessed in LPS-induced cardiomyocytes. Specifically, miR-223-3p could target and inhibit FOXO3 to reduce NLRP3 expression. MSC-EVs could transfer miR-223-3p into cardiomyocytes to repress LPS-induced cardiomyocyte inflammation and pyroptosis. Additionally, in LPS-induced mice, pyroptosis, immune cell infiltration, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and cardiac dysfunction were alleviated by MSC-EV-loading miR-223-3p. Conclusively, miR-223-3p shuttled by MSC-EVs restricted cardiac inflammation, pyroptosis, and dysfunction by disrupting FOXO3/NLRP3 axis.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

However, the radiation-associated cognitive disability is poorly understood and there is no effective prevention or long-term treatment. Here, we demonstrate that neurogenesis and neuroinflammation disorder are primarily involved in the pathophysiological basis of irradiation-induced cognitive decline. Furthermore, we discovered that tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside (TSG), a natural active ingredient from Heshouwu that has been well known for its unique anti-aging effect as the Chinese herb, can be a promising mitigator to improve learning-memory ability by facilitating the neurogenesis in the proliferation and differentiation of the surviving neural progenitor cells via AMPK/Tet2, and attenuating the neuroinflammation in the microglial NLRP3 inflammasomes activation via AMPK in vivo. Additionally, TSG was also revealed to activate AMPK by molecular docking and kinase enzyme system assay in vitro. Taken together, our findings identify TSG, as the AMPK activator, prevents radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction by regulating neurogenesis and neuroinflammation via AMPK/Tet2 in rodents, and represents a very promising candidate for developing drugs that can be used for radiation-associated brain injury.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

However, the underlying mechanism of circRNA in OA progression remains unclear. The study aims to reveal the mechanism of circ_0128846 regulating OA. Human chondrocytes (C28/I2 cells) were treated with interleukin-1β (IL-1β) to mimic an OA cell model. The expression levels of circ_0128846, miR-940 and protein tyrosine phosphatase 12 (PTPN12) were detected by qRT-PCR. Protein expression was checked by Western blotting. Cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis were analyzed by a cell counting kit-8 assay, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-6 was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The binding relationship between miR-940 and circ_0128846 or PTPN12 was identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Circ_0128846 and PTPN12 expression were significantly upregulated, whereas miR-940 was downregulated in the cartilage tissues of OA patients and IL-1β-treated C28/I2 cells compared with controls. IL-1β treatment inhibited C28/I2 cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis and the production of inflammatory factors, TNF-α and IL-6; however, these effects were partly reversed after circ_0128846 depletion. In terms of mechanism, circ_0128846 acted as a miR-940 sponge, and miR-940 combined with PTPN12. Also, circ_0128846 depletion partly ameliorated IL-1β-induced C28/I2 cell disorders through miR-940. PTPN12 overexpression also partly relieved miR-940-mediated effects in IL-1β-treated C28/I2 cells. Further, circ_0128846 induced PTPN12 expression by interacting with miR-940.

"1754",35978505,"Histamine H3R antagonist counteracts the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in Lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation.","Adult neurogenesis in hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) is associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases such as aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Overactivation of microglia induced neuroinflammation is well acknowledged to contribute to the impaired neurogenesis in pathologies of these diseases and then leading to cognitive dysfunction. Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) is a presynaptic autoreceptor regulating histamine release via negative feedback way. Recently, studies show that H3R are highly expressed not only in neurons but also in microglia to modulate inflammatory response. However, whether inhibition of H3R is responsible for the neurogenesis and cognition in chronic neuroinflammation induced injury and the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we found that inhibition of H3R by thioperamide reduced the microglia activity and promoted a phenotypical switch from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 in microglia, and ultimately attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation in mice. Additionally, thioperamide rescued the neuroinflammation induced impairments of neurogenesis and cognitive function. Mechanically, the neuroprotection of thioperamide was involved in histamine dependent H2 receptor (H2R) activation, because cimetidine, an H2R antagonist but not pyrilamine, an H1R antagonist reversed the above effects of thioperamide. Moreover, thioperamide activated the H2R downstream phosphorylated protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway but inhibited nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling. Activation of CREB by thioperamide promoted interaction of CREB-CREB Binding Protein (CBP) to increase anti-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release but inhibited NF-κB-CBP interaction to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-1β, Interleukin-6 and Tumor necrosis factor α) release. H89, an inhibitor of PKA/CREB signaling, abolished effects of thioperamide on neuroinflammation and neurogenesis. Taken together, these results suggested under LPS induced neuroinflammation, the H3R antagonist thioperamide inhibited microglia activity and inflammatory response, and ameliorated impairment of neurogenesis and cognitive dysfunction via enhancing histamine release. Histamine activated H2R and reinforced CREB-CBP interaction but weakened NF-κB-CBP interaction to exert anti-inflammatory effects. This study uncovered a novel histamine dependent mechanism behind the therapeutic effect of thioperamide on neuroinflammation.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

This type of cancer can occur at any age, but it is more frequent in women over 50 and is usually diagnosed late. Despite platinum-based chemotherapy and optimal cytoreductive surgery, OC cells tend to metastasize, and patients with OC experience recurrent relapses and poor prognosis. Therefore, the emergence of novel therapies is essential for treating these patients. On the other hand, it has been shown that the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its components play an important role in the pathogenesis of OC. One of these components is cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), which is involved in the growth and development of tumor cells by inducing tumor cells growth, proliferation, angiogenesis and inhibiting anti-tumor responses. Due to the importance of these cells in the TME, various therapeutic approaches such as direct targeting of CAFs, reprogramming of CAFs, and CAF-associated genes and molecules targeting have been suggested for OC treatment. This review summarizes the role of CAFs in the pathogenesis of OC and therapeutic approaches based on the mentioned therapeutic approaches.","misc","christiaan","misc"

In pharmacovigilance study, ICI-T1DM cases were extracted from FAERs. Disproportionality analyses were performed by calculating reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information components (IC). A total of 29 RCTs (20,234 patients) were included, treatment with ICIs significantly increased the risk of all-grade ICI-T1DM (OR: 4.54, 95 % CI: 2.66-7.72), and high-grade (grade 3 or above) ICI-T1DM (OR: 4.26, 95 % CI: 2.12-8.58). No significant differences among subgroup analyses were observed: ICIs treatment schedule, tumor type, case of events (T1DM vs F-T1DM), study design (double blind vs open label) or median PFS (PFS favours ICIs vs PFS favours Control).

Recently, studies have reported that the RNA binding protein Lin28b directly regulates the let-7 microRNA (miRNA), which participates in the process of atherosclerosis (AS) by regulating inflammation. Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is accompanied by inflammation and is critical for AS. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the role of Sirt6 and Lin28b in vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis and the related mechanism. The present study showed that Lin28b expression was upregulated in the aortic intima and aorta of apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 or 12 weeks. Then, in vitro study found Lin28b was involved in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis, as indicated by the increased number of PI-positive cells and gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, as well as the increased release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and interleukin (IL)-1β. Further studies demonstrated that TNF-α significantly decreased the expression of let-7, while Lin28b knockdown significantly increased the expression of let-7a, let-7d and let-7g. In addition, Sirt6 overexpression decreased Lin28b expression. Moreover, Sirt6 overexpression suppressed pyroptosis by decreasing the number of PI-positive cells and GSDMD cleavage, as well as by decreasing the release of LDH and IL-1β in TNF-α-induced vascular endothelial cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that Sirt6 directly interacted with and deacetylated Lin28b. Taken together, these findings indicate that Sirt6 inhibits vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis by negatively regulating the Lin28b/let-7 pathway in AS.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Lymphatic vessels are vital for IBD development and progression to colorectal cancer (CRC), as an occluded conduit for lymphatic fluid to return to the blood. The mechanism involved remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the therapeutic effect of hucMSC-Ex in a mouse model of IBD during the modulation of lymphangiogenesis. We established a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD model in BALB/c mice and observed the influence of hucMSC-Ex on tissue repair, intestinal lymphatic function, changes in lymphangiogenesis, and infiltration of macrophages. We also evaluated the functional changes of human lymphatic endothelial cells (hLECs) in vitro to determine the mechanism by which hucMSC-Ex regulate lymphangiogenesis. Finally, we identified key molecules in hucMSC-Ex by sequencing, database comparison, and cell validation. Results showed that hucMSC-Ex alleviates IBD in mice by improving intestinal lymphatic drainage, inhibiting lymphangiogenesis, and infiltration of macrophages. Mechanistically, the miRNA sequencing results showed that miR-302d-3p was highly expressed in hucMSC-Ex and played an important role in inhibiting lymphangiogenesis by targeting Fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4). At the same time, the phosphorylation of AKT was inhibited and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) was reduced. Collectively, our study suggests that hucMSC-Ex can regulate lymphangiogenesis via the miR-302d-3p/VEGFR3/AKT axis to ameliorate IBD. Our findings identify VEGFR3 as a potential therapeutic target in IBD, where tightly regulated lymphangiogenesis is crucial in its pathogenesis and progression.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Additionally, the M1/M2 ratio, the Th17/Treg ratio, and osteoclastogenesis are regulated by inflammasomes in multiple bone diseases.

We analyzed RNA-SEQ data of SGs of patients with SS from data obtained from the GEO database to explore the correlation between EZH2 gene expression and the progression of SS. Inhibition of EZH2 in the NOD mice was achieved by intraperitoneal administration of GSK343 using both a preventative and a therapeutic model. The effects of GSK343 on SGs secretion and pathological damage, as well as the levels and functions of T cells, B cells, Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and other immune cells were evaluated. The expression levels of the gene encoding EZH2 in the SGs of SS patients were significantly higher than the non-SS sicca patients, and the expression levels were positively correlated with the severity of the SGs pathological damage. GSK343 treatment significantly increased the salivary flow rate and pathological damage of the SGs in the NOD mice compared to the control mice. In addition, GSK343 significantly inhibited the number and pro-inflammatory-factor secretion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and inhibited the increase in the Th1/Th2 cell ratio caused by SS. RNA-SEQ data also showed that EZH2 inhibited several inflammatory pathways during the pathogenesis of SS.

Skin is a constant target of oxidative stress owing to continuous exposure to ultraviolet radiations. Oxidative stress is considered to have a central role in dermatological diseases, including psoriasis. This study was designed to explore the role of Humanin analogue (S14-G HNG) as an important anti oxidant for psoriasis like condition in BALB/c mice as till date the commomly used drugs for this disease are corticosteroids which have a dissatisfactory adverse effect profile in terms of chronic use. Imiquimod 5% was used to induce Psoriasis like condition in mice, and the role of HNG was assessed through the histological examination, protein expressions and markers of oxidative stress. Two doses (low and high) of HNG were used and results were compared with an established drug methylprednisolone. Significant improvement was seen on histology, PASI scoring, protein expression and oxidative stress by the use of intraperitoneal injections of S14-G HNG and the results were comparable to those obtained through peritoneal injections of methylprednisolone. S14G-HNG can be considered as a suitable option for treatment of Psoriasis after clinical trials and it might prove to have lesser side effects as compared to other drugs employed for the treatment of psoriasis being an innate anti oxidant and anti apoptotic compound.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

However, little is known about the effect of ZA on the clinical outcomes of ICIs, or its possible mechanisms. Patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICIs alone or in combination with ZA were recruited. The clinical efficacy was compared between the two cohorts. We used an LL2 mouse model to confirm the combined effects of ZA with ICIs. Immune cell populations and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment and circulation were assayed and analyzed. The median PFS for the patients treated with and without ZA was 5.4 months and 2.8 months, respectively. The combination group showed a higher rate of disease control. In the mouse LL2 lung cancer model, tumor growth was significantly inhibited in mice treated with the combination treatment. More CD8 + IFN-γ + T cells and γδ T cells, and fewer CD11b cells were found in the circulation and TILs in the combination group. Anti-tumor cytokines INF-γ and IL-18 were elevated in the sera after combination therapy.

Chemical risk factors include thorium-232, 1,2-dichloropropane, and dichloromethane. CA19-9 and CEA are recommended as tumor markers for early detection and diagnostic of ICC. Abdominal ultrasonography, CT, and MRI are effective imaging modalities for diagnosing ICC. If bile duct invasion is suspected, imaging modalities for examining the bile ducts may be useful. In unresectable cases, tumor biopsy should be considered when deemed necessary for the differential diagnosis and drug therapy selection. The mainstay of treatment for patients with Child-Pugh class A or B liver function is surgical resection and drug therapy. If the patient has no regional lymph node metastasis (LNM) and has a single tumor, resection is the treatment of choice. If both regional LNM and multiple tumors are present, drug therapy is the first treatment of choice. If the patient has either regional LNM or multiple tumors, resection or drug therapy is selected, depending on the extent of metastasis or the number of tumors. If distant metastasis is present, drug therapy is the treatment of choice. Percutaneous ablation therapy may be considered for patients who are ineligible for surgical resection or drug therapy due to decreased hepatic functional reserve or comorbidities. For unresectable ICC without extrahepatic metastasis, stereotactic radiotherapy (tumor size ≤5 cm) or particle radiotherapy (no size restriction) may be considered. ICC is generally not indicated for liver transplantation, and palliative care is recommended for patients with Child-Pugh class C liver function.","misc","christiaan","protocol"

As systemic therapies, including molecular targeted agents, have a strong impact on sarcopenia, we aimed to review the impact of sarcopenia in patients receiving systemic therapies, especially sorafenib and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). Several studies have demonstrated that sarcopenia is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients receiving sorafenib or lenvatinib, while HAIC has no association with overall survival (OS) and sarcopenia. Furthermore, based on our previous study, we developed the management of sorafenib score (MS score) to stratify patients' survival according to the positivity of three parameters (skeletal MM, disease control of sorafenib, and post-sorafenib therapy), ranging from 0 to 3. Patients with an MS score ≥2 (median survival time [MST], 16.4 months) showed significantly longer survival than those with an MS score ≤1 (MST, 8.4 months) (p < 0.001). This result indicates that patients need at least two positive parameters to prolong OS. Although performance status (PS) has been used in the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system, we consider that the assessment of sarcopenia has the potential to replace PS. Sarcopenia is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients of HCC receiving sorafenib or lenvatinib. The MS score, based on the positivity of three prognostic factors, including skeletal MM, in patients receiving sorafenib, can be a reliable indicator of prolonged survival.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We compared the efficacy and safety of LEN-TACE sequential therapy to LEN monotherapy and investigated the factors contributing to the LEN-TACE sequential therapy deep response. We enrolled a multicenter cohort of 247 patients with u-HCC treated with LEN between 2018 and 2020. Propensity score matching identified 63 matching pairs of patients with well-balanced characteristics. We retrospectively compared the clinical outcomes, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and incidence of adverse events (AEs), between the LEN-TACE and LEN monotherapy groups. Additionally, we evaluated the tumor response, change in albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, factors affecting PFS and OS, and independent predictors contributing to the LEN-TACE sequential therapy deep response. In this study, at eight weeks after resumption of LEN after initial TACE, deep response was defined as achieving complete response or partial response (PR) on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), and at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking the baseline sum diameters as the reference. The OS and PFS in the LEN-TACE group were significantly higher than those in the LEN monotherapy group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.037, respectively). The incidence of AEs related to LEN was not significantly different between the two groups. In LEN-TACE sequential therapy, the objective response rate was 61.9%, and the disease control rate was 74.6%, according to the mRECIST criteria. No significant change in the ALBI score was observed during sequential LEN-TACE therapy. Multivariable analyses revealed that deep response was independently associated with the outcome of the initial response to LEN by mRECIST: PR (odds ratio: 5.176, 95% confidence interval: 1.528-17.537, p < 0.001). LEN-TACE sequential therapy may provide more clinical benefits than LEN monotherapy in u-HCC patients who responded to initial LEN treatment. Objective response according to mRECIST to initial LEN is an independent factor contributing to LEN-TACE sequential therapy deep response.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Here, we report the final OS analysis from the TACTICS trial, which previously demonstrated significant improvement in PFS with TACE plus sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (NCT01217034). Patients with unresectable HCC were randomized to a TACE plus sorafenib group (N = 80) or a TACE alone group (N = 76). Patients in the combination treatment group received sorafenib 400 mg once daily for 2-3 weeks before TACE, followed by 800 mg once daily during on-demand conventional TACE sessions until time to untreatable progression. In this trial, TACE-specific PFS was used. TACE-specific PFS is defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, and PD was defined as untreatable progression, caused by the inability of a patient to further receive or benefit from TACE for reasons that include intrahepatic tumor progression (25% increase vs. baseline) according to response evaluation criteria in cancer of the liver, the detection of extrahepatic spread, vascular invasion, or transient deterioration of liver function to Child-Pugh C after TACE. At the cut-off date of July 31, 2020, 131 OS events were observed. The median OS was 36.2 months with TACE plus sorafenib and 30.8 months with TACE alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.861; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.607-1.223; p = 0.40, ΔOS, 5.4 months). The updated PFS was 22.8 months with TACE plus sorafenib and 13.5 months with TACE alone (HR = 0.661; 95% CI, 0.466-0.938; p = 0.02). Post-trial treatments with active procedures/agents were received by 47 (58.8%) patients in the TACE plus sorafenib group and 58 (76.3%) in the TACE alone group (p = 0.01). In post hoc analysis, PFS and OS benefit were shown in HCC patients with tumor burden beyond up-to-7 criteria. In TACTICS trial, TACE plus sorafenib did not show significant OS benefit over TACE alone; however, clinical meaningful OS prolongation and significantly improved PFS was observed. Thus, the TACE plus sorafenib can be considered a choice of treatment in intermediate-stage HCC, especially in patients with high tumor burden.

Chromosomal translocations involving the MLL1 gene produce in-frame fusion proteins in which the N-terminal portion of the MLL1 protein harboring its CXXC domain is fused to the C-terminal portion of multiple partners. For the MLL-AF9 fusion, mutations which disrupt CXXC domain-DNA binding abrogate the ability to cause leukemia in mice. Based on this, we initiated an effort to develop small-molecule inhibitors of the MLL1 CXXC domain as a novel approach to therapy. We developed a fluorescence polarization-based assay for MLL CXXC domain-DNA binding and screened a library of Cys-reactive molecules. For the most potent hit from this screen, we have synthesized a library of analogs to explore the structure-activity relationship, defined the binding site using chemical shift perturbations in NMR spectra, and explored the selectivity of compounds across the CXXC domain family.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Herein, we applied for the first-time protein-templated dynamic combinatorial chemistry on RAD51 as a hit identification strategy. Upon design of N-acylhydrazone-based dynamic combinatorial libraries, RAD51 showed a clear templating effect, amplifying 19 N-acylhydrazones. Screening against the RAD51-BRCA2 protein-protein interaction via ELISA assay afforded 10 inhibitors in the micromolar range. Further 19F NMR experiments revealed that 7 could bind RAD51 and be displaced by BRC4, suggesting an interaction in the same binding pocket of BRCA2. These results proved not only that ptDCC could be successfully applied on full-length oligomeric RAD51, but also that it could address the need of alternative strategies toward the identification of small-molecule PPI inhibitors.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Structure-activity relationship studies led to selective and potent antitubercular agents with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the submicromolar range against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mtb strains. An evaluation of the activity of the lead compounds against a spontaneous qcrB mutant strain indicated that the structures targeted the cytochrome bc 1 complex. In addition, selected molecules inhibited Mtb growth in a macrophage model of tuberculosis infection. Furthermore, the leading compound was chemically stable depending on the context and showed good kinetic solubility, high permeability, and a low rate of in vitro metabolism. Finally, the pharmacokinetic profile of the compound was assessed after oral administration to mice. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, a 2-(quinoline-4-yloxy)acetamide was obtained with a sufficient exposure, which may enable in vivo effectiveness and its further development as an antituberculosis drug candidate.","rodent","christiaan","misc"

Intrathecal antibody production to measles virus (MeV) is a common finding in patients with MS. To measure serum IgG reactivity to EBV glycoprotein 350 (gp350) and MeV nucleocapsid protein (NCORE) in patients with MS and healthy controls and to determine if reactivity changed in patients during interferon beta (IFNβ) and/or natalizumab (NAT) treatment. A secondary aim was to determine the seroprevalence of EBV in patients and controls. Patients with MS (n=728) were included from the Swedish pharmacovigilance study for NAT. Paired serum samples from 714 patients drawn before and during NAT treatment and paired samples from 170 patients during prior IFNβ treatment were analysed. In total, 156 patients were included in both groups. Samples from 144 matched blood donors served as controls. Indirect ELISA was applied using recombinant EBVgp350 and MeV NCORE as antigens. EBVgp350 IgG seronegative samples were also analysed using EBV nuclear antigen 1 and viral capsid antigen (VCA). Patients with MS showed higher serum levels of anti-EBVgp350 and anti-MeV NCORE IgG compared with controls. During NAT treatment, the levels of anti-EBVgp350 and anti-MeV NCORE IgG declined, compared with the relatively stable levels noted during prior IFNβ treatment. Ten patients failed to demonstrate anti-EBVgp350 IgG but did show detectable anti-VCA IgG, indicating EBV seropositivity. In contrast, 10/144 controls were EBV seronegative. Treatment with NAT, which is considered a selective immunosuppressive agent with a compartmentalised effect on the central nervous system, appeared to be associated with a moderate decrease in circulating IgG levels to EBVgp350 and MeV NCORE. All patients with MS were EBV IgG seropositive, supporting the potential role of EBV in the pathogenesis of MS.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

The objective was to study available, natural, and inexpensive ways to improve oral health status among the studied group. Materials and methods A randomized clinical trial was performed on 50 children with cerebral palsy aged from three to six years. Participants were divided into two groups (n=25, apple cider vinegar, manual brushing without toothpaste). Plaque accumulation and gingival status were evaluated using Turesky of the Quigley-Hein plaque index (TQHPI) and modified gingival index (MGI) seven times: pre-intervention baseline (T0), post-intervention at one month (T1), two months (T2), three months (T3), four months (T4), five months (T5), six months (T6). Results Plaque accumulation and gingivitis decreased significantly for the ACV group between T0 and T6 (p<0.05) and demonstrated significantly lower plaque accumulation and gingivitis compared to the manual brushing group (p<0.05) at T5 and T6. The manual brushing group showed decreasing in TQHPI between T0 and T3, then TQHPI increased significantly (p<0.05) at T4, T5, and T6. Conclusions To sum up, this in vitro study has demonstrated the possibility of using apple cider vinegar to reduce plaque and gingivitis. In addition, without additives, apple cider vinegar has both mechanical and chemical effects on dental plaque, and it may be a natural, available, inexpensive, and harmless substance that can improve the quality of oral care for difficult groups of children and people with special needs.

In particular, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a worldwide concern. According to the World Health Organization, 32% of all deaths worldwide are from CVDs. In addition, stress-related illnesses cost $190 billion in healthcare costs per year. Currently, contact devices are required to extract most of an individual's physiological information, which can be uncomfortable for users and can cause discomfort. However, in recent years, remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology is gaining interest, which enables contactless monitoring of the blood volume pulse signal using a regular camera, and ultimately can provide the same physiological information as a contact device. In this paper, we propose a benchmark comparison using a new multimodal database consisting of 56 subjects where each subject was submitted to three different tasks. Each subject wore a wearable device capable of extracting photoplethysmography signals and was filmed to allow simultaneous rPPG signal extraction. Several experiments were conducted, including a comparison between information from contact and remote signals and stress state recognition. Results have shown that in this dataset, rPPG signals were capable of dealing with motion artifacts better than contact PPG sensors and overall had better quality if compared to the signals from the contact sensor. Moreover, the statistical analysis of the variance method had shown that at least two heart-rate variability (HRV) features, NNi 20 and SAMPEN, were capable of differentiating between stress and non-stress states. In addition, three features, inter-beat interval (IBI), NNi 20, and SAMPEN, were capable of differentiating between tasks relating to different levels of difficulty.

Despite its high rate of incidence, postoperative dysphagia following ACDF is still poorly understood; its pathogenesis remains relatively unknown, and its risk factors are still a subject of debate. The aim of this study is to review the incidence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and methods of prevention of dysphagia in ACDF patients. To this end, a literature review was conducted based on the PubMed internet database. Article titles were searched by using the following keywords: dysphagia and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion or ACDF. The search was limited to prospective clinical studies evaluating dysphagia after ACDF surgery. Studies published in non-English languages, retrospective studies, cadaveric studies, reviews, case reports, study protocols, and commentary studies were excluded. Initially, 335 studies were identified after a primary search. After the application of the exclusion criteria, 73 studies remained for the final analysis. This literature review focused on identifying the rate of dysphagia and the various risk factors leading to this complication by comparing and evaluating the current literature with a wide spectrum of heterogeneity concerning patients, surgeons, and surgical techniques. A mean dysphagia rate of 19.4% (95% CI: 9.6%-29.1%) based on the findings of the included studies correlating dysphagia directly with ACDF procedures was calculated. Various established risk factors leading to dysphagia include the female sex, smoking, the surgical approach, rhBMP-2 use, and multilevel surgery, while zero-profile devices seem to reduce dysphagia risk. The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiological findings, especially prevertebral soft-tissue swelling. However, videofluoroscopic and endoscopic studies have been recently used for the evaluation of dysphagia. The role of local administration of steroids in the prevention of dysphagia has not yet been clarified.

Although there is strong support for the use of student tutors (STs), there is a lack in gauging their effectiveness with more difficult organ systems such as the musculoskeletal (MSK) system. We aim to determine the effectiveness of using STs versus expert ultrasound instructors (UIs) when teaching MSK ultrasound. Methodology Medical students were recruited to participate in an MSK workshop to identify superficial volar arm structures (radial nerve, radial artery, median nerve, ulnar artery, ulnar nerve) using Butterfly iQ. In total, 14 participants were taught by STs and 10 participants were taught by UIs. Participants imaged the five structures and answered surveys gauging their confidence via five-point Likert scales. Results There was no significant difference in confidence or identification accuracy for all five structures between the two groups. However, there was a significant difference in confidence in the understanding of basic ultrasound concepts in favor of the UI group (p < 0.05). A greater number of students were more confident in identifying all five structures when taught by STs, but more students correctly identified the structures when taught by UIs. Conclusions The results on confidence could be due to positive peer perception. Both groups scored relatively high in their identification accuracies, promoting the successful use of STs. The successful use of STs in teaching MSK ultrasound opens the possibility to developing peer-led ultrasound curriculum on more complex ultrasound topics in the future.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

They account for 5% of all primary bone tumors and 20% of all benign bone tumors. The clinical features of GCTB include local swelling, pain, and limitations in joint movement. Approximately half of GCTB arise around the knee joint, affecting either the distal femur or proximal tibia. Tissue biopsy reveals an excess of multinucleated giant cells on a stromal cell background, indicating a diagnosis. Intralesional curettage is used to treat GCTB and is associated with minimal disability; however, local recurrence may occur in many patients. Resection and endoprosthetic repair or bone graft reconstruction are often used to treat GCTB near the joint. To our knowledge, there are currently no studies on this topic in the city of Jeddah, where we conducted our study. Our aim was to evaluate the outcome of surgical resection accompanied by denosumab injection compared to that of surgery alone in treating GCTB. All cases of GCTB at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, between January 2008 and December 2018, that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. All cases of GCTB in the pre-specified period were classified as surgical resection with denosumab injection or surgical resection alone. The outcomes of the two modalities were compared. Recurrence was investigated in patients belonging to both the groups. Twenty-six cases that met the inclusion criteria were included in the study and the data were analyzed. The subjects were divided into two groups: denosumab and surgery (n = 7) and surgery alone (n = 19). Patients treated with denosumab and surgery had a higher recurrence rate (57%); however, the difference was not significant (p = 0.407).

Recent advances have led to multiple novel therapies and multi-treatment approaches combining systemic and locoregional modalities, such as thermal ablation, representing a promising strategy that has received attention in recent years. Nevertheless, no standard locoregional treatment regimens exist for the management of liver metastases of PC. In addition, regional therapy alone is unlikely to provide durable cancer control.

"1790",35978788,"The Psychological Mechanisms Underlying Solomon's Paradox: Impact of Mood and Self-Transcendence.","Solomon's paradox of wise reasoning, in which performance of wisdom differs when reasoning on an issue in one's own life vs. another's life, has been supported by robust evidence. However, the underlying psychological mechanism remains unclear. This asymmetry of wise reasoning may be explained by the different mindsets of self-transcendence when people reason about various conflicts (personal vs. others'), and mood should play a fundamental role. To explore this issue, three hundred ninety-nine participants were recruited to test a hypothesized model. The results supported the effect of Solomon's paradox-that is, participants endorsed wise-reasoning strategies more strongly when resolving others' social conflicts than their own. Further mediation analysis showed that the sequential mediation model was supported. Solomon's paradox can be explained by the difference in positive affect and self-transcendence when reasoning about the two conflicts. This study directly verifies the mediating role of self-transcendence in Solomon's paradox. At the same time, reasoning about personal affairs reduces individuals' self-transcendence mindset, and positive affect can explain the differences. These results are helpful for understanding and effectively avoiding Solomon's wisdom dilemma.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Molecular biomarkers for gefitinib metabolism-related lncRNAs have not yet been elucidated. Here, we downloaded relevant genes and matched them to relevant lncRNAs. We then used univariate, LASSO, and multivariate regression to screen for significant genes to construct prognostic models. We investigated TME and drug sensitivity by risk score data. All lncRNAs with differential expression were selected for GO/KEGG analysis. Imvigor210 cohort was used to validate the value of the prognostic model. Finally, we performed a stemness indices difference analysis. lncRNA-constructed prognostic models were significant in the high-risk and low-risk subgroups. Immune pathways were identified in both groups at low risk. The higher the risk score the greater the value of exclusion, MDSC, and CAF. PRRophetic algorithm screened a total of 58 compounds. In conclusion, the prognostic model we constructed can accurately predict OS in NSCLC patients. Two groups of low-risk immune pathways are beneficial to patients. Gefitinib metabolism was again validated to be related to cytochrome P450 and lipid metabolism. Finally, drugs that might be used to treat NSCLC patients were screened.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The World Health Organization estimates an increase in cases in the coming years. The risk factors of HCC are multiple, and the incidence in different countries is closely related to the different risk factors to which the population is exposed. The molecular mechanisms that drive HCC tumorigenesis are extremely complex, but understanding this multistep process is essential for the identification of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic markers. The development of multigenic next-generation sequencing panels through the parallel analysis of multiple markers can provide a landscape of the genomic status of the tumor. Considering the literature and our preliminary data based on 36 HCCs, the most frequently altered genes in HCCs are TERT, CTNNB1, and TP53. Over the years, many groups have attempted to classify HCCs on a molecular basis, but a univocal classification has never been achieved. Nevertheless, statistically significant correlations have been found in HCCs between the molecular signature and morphologic features, and this leads us to think that it would be desirable to integrate the approach between anatomic pathology and molecular laboratories.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The pathogenesis of TM6SF2-efficient NAFLD remains unclear, resulting in a lack of therapeutic strategies for TM6SF2-deficient patients. To investigate the role of TM6SF2 in fatty acid metabolism in the context of fatty liver and propose possible therapeutic strategies for NAFLD caused by TM6SF2 deficiency. Liver samples collected from both NAFLD mouse models and human participants (80 cases) were used to evaluate the expression of TM6SF2 by using western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RNA-seq data retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were used to confirm the over-expression of TM6SF2. Knockdown and overexpression of TM6SF2 were performed to clarify the mechanistic basis of hepatic lipid accumulation in NAFLD. MK-4074 administration was used as a therapeutic intervention to evaluate its effect on NAFLD caused by TM6SF2 deficiency. Hepatic TM6SF2 levels were elevated in patients with NAFLD and NAFLD mouse models. TM6SF2 overexpression can reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, suggesting a protective role for TM6SF2 in a high-fat diet (HFD). Downregulation of TM6SF2, simulating the TM6SF2 E167K mutation condition, increases intracellular lipid deposition due to dysregulated fatty acid metabolism and is characterized by enhanced fatty acid uptake and synthesis, accompanied by impaired fatty acid oxidation. Owing to the potential effect of TM6SF2 deficiency on lipid metabolism, the application of an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor (MK-4074) could reverse the NAFLD phenotypes caused by TM6SF2 deficiency. TM6SF2 plays a protective role in the HFD condition; its deficiency enhanced hepatic lipid accumulation through dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, and MK-4074 treatment could alleviate the NAFLD phenotypes caused by TM6SF2 deficiency.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Several recent studies have reported the involvement of low-grade inflammation and immunological dysfunction in PI-IBS. T helper 17 (Th17) polarization occurs in IBS. Adenosine and its receptors participate in intestinal inflammation and immune regulation. To investigate the role of Th17 polarization of CD4+ T cells regulated by adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) in PI-IBS. A PI-IBS model was established by infecting mice with Trichinella spiralis. The intestinal A2AR and CD4+ T lymphocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry, and the inflammatory cytokines were detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay. CD4+ T lymphocytes present in the animal's spleen were separated and cultured with or without A2AR agonist and antagonist. Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed to determine the effect of A2AR on the cells and intestinal tissue. Cytokine production was determined. The protein and mRNA levels of A2AR associated signaling pathway molecules were also evaluated. Furthermore, A2AR agonist and antagonist were injected into the mouse model and the clinical features were observed. The PI-IBS mouse model showed increased expression of ATP and A2AR (P < 0.05), and inhibition of A2AR improved the clinical features in PI-IBS, including the abdominal withdrawal reflex and colon transportation test (P < 0.05). The number of intestinal CD4+ T cells and interleukin-17 (IL-17) protein levels increased during PI-IBS, which was reversed by administration of the A2AR antagonist (P < 0.05). CD4+ T cells expressed A2AR and produced IL-17 in vitro, which was regulated by the A2AR agonist and antagonist. The A2AR antagonist increased the production of IL-17 by CD4+ T cells via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription-receptor-related orphan receptor γ signaling pathway. The results of the present study suggested that the upregulation of A2AR increases PI-IBS by promoting the Th17 polarization of CD4+ T cells.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

The occurrence and development of GC is a complex process involving multiple biological mechanisms. Although traditional regulation modulates molecular functions related to the occurrence and development of GC, the comprehensive mechanisms remain unclear. Ultraconserved region (UCR) refers to a genome sequence that is completely conserved in the homologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes, with 100% identity, without any insertions or deletions, and often located in fragile sites and tumour-related genes. The transcribed UCR (T-UCR) is transcribed from the UCR and is a new type of long noncoding RNA. Recent studies have found that the expression level of T-UCRs changes during the occurrence and development of GC, revealing a new mechanism underlying GC. Therefore, this article aims to review the relevant research on T-UCRs in GC, as well as the function of T-UCRs and their regulatory role in the occurrence and development of GC, to provide new strategies for GC diagnosis and treatment.","misc","christiaan","misc"

A previous study by the authors indicated that TMEM121 is highly expressed in adult mouse hearts and acts as an inhibitor of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. In the present study, the association between TMEM121 and cancer was investigated using bioinformatics tools, including Tumour Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 2.0, cBioPortal, LinkedOmics analysis, Kaplan-Meier plotter and UALCAN analysis. The expression, genetic variation, gene interaction network and co-expression pattern of TMEM121 in tumours were analysed. The results revealed that TMEM121 was expressed in various tumours and significantly downregulated in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC) when compared with its expression in paracancerous tissues, whereas the methylation level of its promoter was increased in tumour tissues. Additionally, associations between TMEM121 and the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, as well as the expression of cancer-related molecules, were detected. The aforementioned bioinformatics analysis suggests that TMEM121 may be involved in the development of cervical cancer. Therefore, gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in HeLa cells were conducted to verify the role of TMEM121 in cervical cancer. The assay using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) revealed that the cell viability of HeLa cells with TMEM121 overexpression was significantly reduced. High TMEM121 expression inhibited HeLa cell migration, as indicated by the decrease in the cell scratch healing rate. The western blot assay revealed that TMEM121 overexpression downregulated the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), cyclin D1, cyclin E2 and phosphorylated (p)-AKT, while upregulating that of p27, E-cadherin and p-p38. When TMEM121 was knocked down, retinoblastoma protein (RB), p53, p27, E-cadherin, p-JNK and p-p38 were inhibited, but cyclin E1 was promoted. By combining bioinformatics and experimental biology in the present study, the results demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that TMEM121 may be a novel inhibitor of cervical cancer that is linked to multiple signalling pathways, paving the way for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Insufficient trophoblast invasion and migration has been considered to be an important cause of this disease. The present study aimed to investigate the role of peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), whose knockdown has been previously indicated to reduce inflammation and susceptibility to pregnancy loss in mice, in the development of PE in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to treat a human trophoblast cell line (HTR8/SVneo). After PAD4 silencing via transfection with short hairpin RNA against PAD4, the concentrations of inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-12 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 were measured using ELISA. Cell viability was also measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. HTR8/SVneo cell invasion and migration were detected using Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. Western blotting was used to measure the expression of citrullinated NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) and nuclear NF-κB p65 protein levels. TNF-α was applied for evaluating the potential regulatory effects of PAD4 on NF-κB in LPS-stimulated HTR8/SVneo cells. LPS increased the levels of IL-6, IL-12 and MCP-1 and reduced the migration and invasion of HTR8/SVneo cells. PAD4-knockdown was found to markedly reduce the levels of IL-6, IL-12 and MCP-1 secretion. HTR8/SVneo cell invasion and migration was also significantly elevated after PAD4 silencing following LPS exposure. In addition, LPS stimulation notably upregulated the protein levels of citrullinated NEMO and nuclear NF-κB p65, which was restored by PAD4 knockdown. Furthermore, TNF-α treatment partially counteracted the effects of PAD4 knockdown on the secretion of IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-12, which are markers of inflammation, and invasion and migration in LPS-induced HTR8/SVneo cells. To conclude, these results suggest that PAD4 silencing can suppress inflammation whilst promoting invasion and migration by trophoblast cells through inhibiting the NEMO/NF-κB pathway. These findings furthered the understanding in the complex molecular mechanism that can trigger PE and provide a promising target for the treatment of this disease.","misc","christiaan","rodent"

Therefore the present study aimed to investigate the role of Fos-like antigen-1 (FOSL1) in UC. Use of the JASPAR database predicted the possible interaction of FOSL1 and the MMP13 promoter. FOSL1 and MMP13 mRNA and protein expression levels in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced HT29 cells and colon tissues of a UC mice model were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. MMP13 promoter activity was determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay, the relationship between FOSL1 and MMP13 promoter was determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation, inflammatory factor levels were quantified using ELISA, cell monolayer permeability analysis was performed using transepithelial electrical resistance measurements and tight junction protein expression levels were determined by western blotting. After constructing a UC mice model, mice colonic injury was determined with the quantification of colon length, H&E staining and disease activity index. The results demonstrated that FOSL1 and MMP13 were upregulated in DSS-induced HT29 cells and tissues. FOSL1 was also determined to be bound to the MMP13 promoter region and was demonstrated to upregulate MMP13 expression levels. Furthermore, FOSL1 knockdown inhibited DSS-induced inflammation and barrier damage in HT29 cells via MMP13 downregulation. FOSL1 knockdown also ameliorated colonic injury, inflammation and barrier damage in the tissues of the UC mice model via MMP13 downregulation. Overall, FOSL1 knockdown was demonstrated to potentially ameliorate DSS-induced inflammatory injury and protect the intestinal barrier integrity in the UC mice model via MMP13 downregulation.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Furthermore, the influence of AKIP1 and therefore Rac1 on the expression of the downstream ERK/cellular (c)-Myc signaling pathway was explored. The interaction between AKIP1 and Rac1 was determined using co-immunoprecipitation. The mRNA and protein expression levels of AKIP1 and Rac1 in normal renal epithelial cell lines and ccRCC cell lines were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. The transfection efficiency of small interfering RNA-AKIP1 and the Rac1 overexpression vector were also confirmed using RT-qPCR and western blotting. The viability, proliferation, invasion and migration of ccRCC cells following transfection were analyzed using the Cell Counting Kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine staining, Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. The tube formation ability of HUVECs was assessed using the tube formation assay. The protein expression levels of proliferation, invasion, migration and tube-formation-associated proteins as well as proteins associated with the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway, were detected via western blotting.

Methods  We used an endoscope reprocessing pass through machine with drying cabinet and a Franka Emika Panda robot. The robot was programmed to interact with its environment in a compliant way, guaranteeing desired contact force thresholds and therefore ensuring safety of both robot and medical equipment. Results  In an initial phase we tested the robots' ability to handle a modified tray holding an endoscope as well as certain challenges (correct positioning, connection of tubing, undesired collisions). We added another Panda robot arm resulting in a device featuring two independent manipulators and tested the accuracy of each individual step. We evaluated 50 consecutive processing and transfer procedures, simulating the average daily throughput of an endoscopic unit. The endoscopes were removed in adapted tray using a specially designed lifting device and placed in an endoscope storage and venting cabinet. The mean time for the handling of the scope was 104.2 ± 1.2 seconds and an accuracy of 100 % (0 failures in 50 attempts) was achieved.

Through the combined use of experiments and theoretical modeling, this work resolves a long-standing question in cell biology and establishes mechanical interaction with an irregular-shaped 3D environment which may be relevant to cell migration in a range of tissue contexts.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1811",35979148,"Evaluation of 3T proton MR spectroscopy in the spinal cord - preliminary results.","1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a non-invasive technique that provides information on tissue metabolism and biochemistry. Because of technical difficulties, this method is rarely used in spinal cord examination. The main goal of this study was to develop a routine protocol for MRS of intramedullary lesions. A 1H-MRS protocol was set on a group of healthy volunteers. Forty-eight spectra were acquired in total. Thirty of them were acquired in cervical spinal cord, and the remaining 18 spectra were acquired in the thoracic spinal cord. In 1H-MRS of the spinal cord one of the most important problems is small voxel size. Mean voxel size in this study was 7 × 9 × 29 mm, which is much smaller than in brain examinations. Finally, almost 60% of spectra were of acceptable quality in volunteer examinations, which enabled the subsequent examinations. Challenges of spinal cord spectroscopy were discussed, and the ability of providing additional diagnostic information was proven.","misc","christiaan","protocol"
"1812",35979150,"Evaluation of the effectiveness of partial splenic endovascular embolization in patients with refractory thrombocytopaenia.","Partial splenic endovascular embolization (PSEE) could be an option for patients with thrombocytopaenia (TCP). We selected a group of 22 patients diagnosed with refractory TCP to undergo PSEE, and we followed them for detailed analysis. Twenty-two patients aged 27-75 years (mean 46.5 ± 3.5 years) underwent PSEE, and 5 participants underwent a second PSEE due to the lack of effectiveness after the first procedure. A total of 27 PSEEs were performed. A semi-quantitative scale was used to assess the severity of the post-embolization syndrome. The percentage of spleen parenchyma excluded from circulation was 30-70%. We used the mixture of Histoacryl N-butyl cyanoacry-late glue and Lipiodol in 10 cases, spirals in 10 cases, and polyvinyl alcohol in 7 cases, for the embolization. The mean value of platelet count (PLT) before procedure increased from 22.0 ± 15.0 to 87.7 ± 67.9 (p < 0.05) in a mean period of 194 days. In 2 cases severe post-embolization syndrome was observed. Closure less than 50% of the spleen circulation was associated with poorly expressed post-embolization symptoms. Serious complications occurred in 1 patient (3.5%). A strong positive correlation (r = 0.8, p < 0.05) was found between C-reactive protein (CRP) and the severity of post-embolization syndrome. Increased symptoms of post-embolization syndrome were also associated with a significant increase in hospitalization time - 27.0 vs. 7.2 days (r = 0.66, p < 0.05). Partial endovascular embolization of the spleen (PSEE) may be a valuable therapeutic option for patients with refractory TCP. PSEE is a safe method with a low complication rate.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

English-language studies on the diagnostic accuracy of 3.0 T and 1.5 T MRI in prostate cancer staging published through May 2020 were searched for in relevant databases. The focus was on studies in which both 3.0 T and 1.5 T MRI were performed in the study population, to reduce interstudy heterogeneity. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were determined for 3.0 T and for 1.5 T along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Out of 8 studies identified, 4 met the inclusion criteria. 3.0 T (n = 160) had a pooled sensitivity of 69.5% (95% CI: 56.4-80.1%) and a pooled specificity of 48.8% (95% CI: 6.0-93.4%), while 1.5 T (n = 139) had a pooled sensitivity of 70.6% (95% CI: 55.0-82.5%; p = 0.91) and a pooled specificity of 41.7% (95% CI: 6.2-88.6%; p = 0.88). The pooled DOR for 3.0 T was 3 (95% CI: 0-26.0%), while the pooled DOR for 1.5 T was 2 (95% CI: 0-18.0%), which was not a significant difference (p = 0.89). 3.0 T has slightly better diagnostic performance than 1.5 T MRI in prostate cancer staging (3 vs. 2), although without statistical significance. Our findings suggest the need for larger, randomized trials directly comparing 3.0 T and 1.5 T MRI in prostate cancer.","meta_analysis","christiaan","meta_analysis"

A retrospective analysis of chest lymph nodes on computed tomography (CT) examinations, including CE and non-contrast-enhanced (non-CE) phase, was performed on 40 patients with proven diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Phases were separated, anonymized, and randomized. The assessment was performed by 5 observers: 2 general radiologists, 2 residents, and a senior chest CT expert. There were no significant differences between radiologists and residents, apart from the determination of the 4R node short diameter on CE images. Agreement between the reference observer and both residents and specialists was equally high, without any significant difference in the assessment all chest nodes and hilar nodes, and between non-CE and CE images. There was a significant difference between all observers in the determination of the largest 4R node short diameter on non-CE images, but not on CE images. The number of affected node levels was found to be significantly higher when evaluated on CE images than on non-CE images. Compared to CE images, non-CE computed tomography has sensitivity of 0.94-1.00 and specificity of 0.98-1.00, depending on the observer. The application of contrast medium has a limited impact on the quality of assessment of the chest lymph nodes in patients with sarcoidosis, regardless of the experience of the observer.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

We aimed to determine the frequency of IF detected in the mpMRI examination according to organ distribution and clinical significance. mpMRI examinations performed between January 2015 and 2020 based on the diagnosis or suspicion of PCa were retrospectively evaluated. IFs were divided into 2 groups, as genitourinary system and non- genitourinary system findings. In addition, IFs were also evaluated in 2 groups, as clinically significant and clinically non-significant. The patient population was divided into age ranges, and the frequency of IFs in these age ranges and their clinical significance were recorded. The mpMRI examinations of 426 patients revealed a total of 321 Ifs, comprising 212 (49.8%) genitourinary (41.1%) and 189 (58.9%) extragenitourinary findings. The mean age of the patients was 63.53 ± 7.89 years. As the age increased, the rate of IFs increased (p = 0.001). However, there was no increase for the 75-year-old group compared to the 65-74-year-old age range (p = 0.853). There were a total of 22 (6.9%) clinically significant Ifs - 4 associated with the genitourinary system and 18 extragenitourinary. Although the rate of clinically significant IF was only 6.9%, this rate was high in patients, especially in those over the age of 65 years. It should be kept in mind that the early detection of these findings in the asymptomatic period will increase the survival and successful treatment of patients.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1816",35979154,"Update on the limited sensitivity of computed tomography relative to RT-PCR for COVID-19: a systematic review.","The global and ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has compelled the need for timely and reliable methods of detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been widely accepted as a reference standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, several early studies have suggested the superior sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a previous systematic review, we stratified studies based on risk for bias to evaluate the true sensitivity of CT for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study revisits our prior analysis, incorporating more current data to assess the sensitivity of CT for COVID-19. The PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for relevant articles published between 1 January 2020, and 25 April 2021. Exclusion criteria included lack of specification regarding whether the study cohort was adult or paediatric, whether patients were symptomatic or asymptomatic, and not identifying the source of RT-PCR specimens. Ultimately, 62 studies were included for systematic review and were subsequently stratified by risk for bias using the QUADAS-2 quality assessment tool. Sensitivity data were extracted for random effects meta-analyses. The average sensitivity for COVID-19 reported by the high-risk-of-bias studies was 68% [CI: 58, 80; range: 38-96%] for RT-PCR and 91% [CI: 87, 96; range: 47-100%] for CT. The average sensitivity reported by the low-risk-of-bias studies was 84% [CI: 0.75, 0.94; range: 70-97%] for RT-PCR and 78% [CI: 71, 0.86; range: 44-92%] for CT. On average, the high-risk-of bias studies underestimated the sensitivity of RT-PCR and overestimated the sensitivity of CT for COVID-19. Given the incorporation of recently published low-risk-of-bias articles, the sensitivities according to low-risk-of-bias studies for both RT-PCR and CT were higher than previously reported.","meta_analysis","christiaan","meta_analysis"

Fifty consecutive hospitalized PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who underwent chest CT scan and LUS on the first day of admission were enrolled. The LUS score was calculated based on the presence, severity, and distribution of parenchymal abnormalities in 14 regions. The participants' mean age was 54.60 ± 19.93 years, and 26 (52%) were female. All patients had CT and LUS findings typical of COVID-19. The mean value of CT and LUS severity scores were 11.80 ± 3.89 (ranging from 2 to 20) and 13.74 ± 6.43 (ranging from 1 to 29), respectively. The LUS score was significantly higher in females (p = 0.016), and patients with dyspnoea (p = 0.048), HTN (p = 0.034), immunodeficiency (p = 0.034), room air SpO2 ≤ 93 (p = 0.02), and pleural effusion (p = 0.036). LUS findings were strongly correlated with CT scan results regarding lesion type, distribution, and severity in a region-by-region fashion (92-100% agreement). An LUS score of 14 or higher was predictive of room air SpO2 ≤ 93 and ICU admission, while an LUS score ≥ 12 was predictive of death (p = 0.011, 0.023, and 0.003, respectively). Our results suggested that LUS can be used as a valuable tool for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia and determining high-risk hospitalized patients, helping to triage and stratify high-risk patients, which waives the need to undertake irradiating chest CT and reduces the burden of overworked CT department staff.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1818",35979171,"Effect of biochar on antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes variations during co-composting of pig manure and corn straw.","Pig manure is a reservoir of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The effect of biochar on the variations in physicochemical properties, bacterial communities, antibiotics, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of compost product during co-composting of pig manure and corn straw have been investigated in this study. Compared with the control treatment (CK), biochar addition accelerated the increase in pile temperature and prolonged the high temperature period (>55°C) for 2 days. Under biochar influence, organic matter degradation, NH4 +-N conversion and NO3 --N production was accelerated, and dissolved total organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) utilization by microorganisms were enhanced. Biochar addition altered the microbial community and promoted the vital activity of Actinobacteria in the later composting stage. The antibiotics removal efficiency (except danofloxacin and enrofloxacin) was accelerated in the early composting stage (1-14 days) by biochar addition, the pile temperature had a positive effect on antibiotics removal, and the total antibiotics removal efficiency in CK and CK+Biochar treatments was 69.58% and 78.67% at the end of the composting process, respectively. The absolute abundance of most of the ARGs in the CK+Biochar treatment was lower than that in the CK treatment during composting, and the ARGs removal mainly occurred in the early (1-14 days) and later (28-50 days) stages. Biochar addition reduced the absolute abundance of MGEs (intI1, intI2) in the compost product, and most of the ARGs had a significant positive correlation with MGEs. Network analysis and redundancy analysis showed that ARGs and MGEs occurred in various host bacteria (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Halanaerobiaeota), and that DTN and NH4 +-N are the main factors regulating the changes in bacterial communities, antibiotics, ARGs, and MGEs during composting. Moreover, MGEs contributed the most to the variation in ARGs. In summary, biochar addition during composting accelerated antibiotics removal and inhibited accumulation and transmission of ARGs. The results of this study could provide theoretical and technical support for biochar application for antibiotics and ARGs removal during livestock and poultry manure composting.","misc","christiaan","misc"

A well-designed bone filling product should possess the ability to induce tissue in-growth and facilitate neovascularization and new bone formation. Puerarin has been used in clinics for a long time, and recently it was found to be able to promote osteogenesis. This study aimed to investigate a puerarin-based drug/delivery combination implant for promoting large bone defect repair. Puerarin was incorporated into the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)/β-calcium phosphate (PLGA/TCP, PT) to form a porous PLGA/TCP/Puerarin (PTP) composite scaffold by low-temperature rapid prototyping technology. Its structural and degradation were analyzed in vitro. Then we employed a rat calvarial critical size defect model to assess the potency of the PTP scaffold. MC3T3-E1 cells and EA. hy 926 ​cells were used to investigate the underlying mechanism. PTP scaffold inherited all advantages of PT scaffold in structural, mechanical, and biodegradation, meanwhile puerarin stably and continuously released from PTP scaffold and lasted for 5 months in vitro. At 8 weeks after implantation, the PTP scaffold triggered new bone formation in the macro-pores of the scaffold and inside the scaffold accompanied by the degrading materials. The underlying mechanism revealed that the PTP scaffold induced vascular infiltration and recruit repair cells through stimulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) expressions to promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Puerarin-enriched porous PTP scaffold was a promising local delivery system with sustained release of puerarin for facilitating defect repair through getting synergistic angiogenic and osteogenic effects. The PTP scaffold presents a potential drug/device combination medical implant for large bone defect repair, which also provides a new and innovative application for the old drug puerarin.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

This model involves a team-based approach, with care delivered by a care manager (case reviews and behavioral therapy), psychiatrist (case reviews and psychopharmacological recommendations), and medical provider (ongoing care including psychopharmacological prescriptions). We assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of CoCM in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with IBD. Patients with psychological distress identified by clinical impression and/or the results of the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were referred to the CoCM program. Data from our 9-month CoCM pilot were collected to assess depression and anxiety response and remission rates. We obtained provider surveys to assess provider acceptability with delivering care in this model. Though the SARS-CoV2 COVID-19 pandemic interrupted screening, 39 patients enrolled and 19 active participants completed the program. Overall, 47.4% had either a response or remission in depression, while 36.8% had response or remission in anxiety. The gastroenterologists highly agreed that the program was a beneficial resource for their patients and felt comfortable implementing the recommendations.

When compared to the control group, the study cohort showed a significant reduction in the HADS depression score. No significant differences were observed in the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index, or Short IBD Questionnaire. This is the first study to evaluate the impact of an integrated psychiatry clinic for IBD patients. Unlike their control counterparts, individuals treated in this clinic had a significant reduction in the mean HADS depression score. Larger scale studies are necessary to verify these findings.

When endoscopic piecemeal mucosal resection (EPMR) is performed, endoscopic surveillance is necessary due to the risk of recurrence. The Sydney EMR Recurrence Tool (SERT) is a 0-4 scale that classifies lesions according to size, occurrence of intraprocedural bleeding (IPB) and presence of high-grade dysplasia (HGD). Our goal is to evaluate the applicability of SERT in predicting adenoma recurrence (AR) after EPMR. This is a retrospective single-centre study with inclusion of lateral spreading lesions ≥20 mm, consecutively resected by EPMR from March 2010 to February 2018, with at least 1 endoscopic re-evaluation. A total of 181 lesions were included, corresponding to 174 patients with a mean age of 68 years and male gender predominance (61%; n = 106). The most frequent location was the ascending colon (34%; n = 62). Lesions were assessed according to Paris Classification (PC): 0-IIa: 39% (n = 71); 0-IIb: 24% (n = 43); 0-IIa + Is: 23% (n = 42); 0-IIa + IIb: 6% (n = 11); 0-IIa + IIc: 2% (n = 3). The mean size of the lesions was 33 ± 11 mm, with 25 (14%) being ≥40 mm. IPB occurred in 9 cases (5%), and 44 lesions (24%) displayed HGD. Sixty-six lesions (36.5%) were classified as SMSA (size, morphology, site, and access score) level 4. Adjunctive therapy with argon plasma coagulation (APC) was used in 37% (n = 67) of cases. The 6-month AR rate was 16% (n = 29). According to SERT groups, the AR rate was: SERT 0: 12% (14/120); SERT 1: 17% (6/35); SERT 2: 25% (3/12); SERT 3: 30% (3/10); SERT 4: 75% (3/4). Two of the three SERT variables (size ≥40 mm and IPB) were associated with recurrence at 6 months (p < 0.05). HGD and the remaining tested variables (age, gender, localization, accessibility, PC, use of APC/biopsy forceps and occurrence of delayed bleeding) were not associated with AR. SERT 0 lesions showed an inferior risk of 6-month AR (adjusted OR = 2.62; p = 0.035), with a negative predictive value of 88%. SMSA correlated with SERT (p < 0.001) and SMSA level 4 was associated with 6-month AR (p = 0.007). Lesions classified both as SERT 0 and SMSA level <4 had the lowest 6-month recurrence rate (9.2%). The 24-month recurrence rate was 23% (n = 41). When applying the Kaplan-Meier method, cumulative recurrence was significantly lower in SERT 0 lesions (p = 0.006, log-rank test). Resection of flat colorectal lesions by EPMR has a considerable risk of recurrence, mostly in SERT 1-4 lesions. SERT 0 lesions, especially with SMSA level <4, show a lower risk of recurrent adenoma, which might allow longer intervals to first endoscopic surveillance in the future. A mucosectomia endoscópica é a terapêutica de eleição nas lesões colorretais planas não invasivas e, quando fragmentada, obriga a vigilância endoscópica, dado o risco de recorrência.

O tamanho médio foi 33 ± 11 mm, tendo 25 (14%) dimensões ≥40 mm. Verificou-se HI em 9 casos (5%) e DAG em 44 (24%). O nível SMSA (size, morphology, site, and access score) foi 4 em 66 lesões (36.5%). Realizou-se terapêutica com árgon plasma (APC) em 37% (n = 67) dos casos.A taxa de AR aos 6 meses foi: SERT 0: 12% (14/120); SERT 1: 17% (6/35); SERT 2: 25% (3/12); SERT 3: 30% (3/10); SERT 4: 75% (3/4); global: 16% (29/181). O AR aos 6 meses associou-se à dimensão ≥40 mm e à HI (p < 0.05). A DAG não mostrou relação com a recorrência, assim como a idade, sexo, localização, acessibilidade, CP, terapêutica adju-adjuvante (APC/pinça de biópsias) e ocorrência de hemorragia tardia. As lesões SERT 0 apresentaram menor risco de AR aos 6 meses (OR ajustado = 2.62; p = 0.035), com um valor preditivo negativo de 88%. O SMSA correlacionou-se com o SERT (p < 0.001), estando o nível SMSA 4 associado à recorrência aos 6 meses (p = 0.007). As lesões classificadas como SERT 0 e nível SMSA <4 apresentaram a menor taxa de AR (9.2%). A taxa de recorrência aos 24 meses foi 23% (n = 41). Aplicando o método de Kaplan Meier, a recorrência cumulativa foi menor nas lesões SERT 0 (p = 0.006, teste log-rank). A excisão de lesões planas por mucosectomia fragmentada apresenta uma taxa de recorrência considerável, sobretudo em lesões SERT 1–4.

This study aimed to identify the risk factors for AL, including the type of air leak test (ALT) performed, in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. This study involved a retrospective review of 201 patients who underwent elective laparoscopic procedures using circular stapled anastomosis for colorectal cancer between January 2015 and December 2020 at Kyorin University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. In all cases, the distance from the anal verge to the anastomotic site was within 15 cm. Overall, AL was observed in 16 patients (8.0%). Univariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for AL included diabetes (P = 0.068), tumor location (P = 0.049), level of anastomosis (P = 0.002), number of linear stapler firings (P = 0.007), and intraoperative colonoscopy (IOCS; P = 0.069). Multivariate analysis revealed that the level of anastomosis (P = 0.029) and IOCS (P = 0.039) were significant and independent risk factors for AL. One of the 107 patients undergoing ALT without IOCS and 3 of the 94 patients undergoing ALT with IOCS were proven to be positive for air leak. However, these four patients underwent additional suturing intraoperatively and developed no AL following surgery. This study identified the level of anastomosis and ALT with IOCS as predictors for AL. The results of our study indicate that ALT with IOCS may be more effective than ALT without IOCS in the diagnosis and prevention of AL.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"
"1826",35979270,"Pain at the First Post-hemorrhoidectomy Defecation Is Associated with Stool Form.","Post-hemorrhoidectomy defecation pain is problematic, and pain associated with the first defecation is particularly important for patients. The present study aimed to investigate whether stool form consistency affected defecation pain after hemorrhoidectomy. A prospective, cohort, observational study where patients scheduled for hemorrhoidal surgery were analyzed. This study used two patient-reported scales to study parameters based on the first postoperative defecation. The Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) and visual analog scale (VAS) assessed stool consistency and defecation pain. The association between stool consistency and defecation pain intensity was assessed using multiple linear regression analysis. Where there was evidence of non-linearity, we applied a restricted cubic spline with three knots to explore the non-linear association. We performed a non-linear regression analysis to estimate the association. A total of 179 patients were analyzed. The regression model results demonstrated that these scales negatively correlated with statistical significance (p = 0.003). This study showed that the softer the stool, the less painful the defecation. Surgeons should attempt to induce a patient to avoid hard stool after surgery. The Ethics Review Committee of the Japan Medical Association approved the study.

In this study, we conducted a 3-year follow-up study of MuRAL (380 cases) and compared it with LE (1417 cases) and ALTA (541 cases) performed at the same period. Operative time, mean hospital stay, postoperative pain, postoperative complications, and recurrence were compared and examined retrospectively. The mean operative time was the longest for MuRAL, followed by LE, and then ALTA at 29.1, 21.5, and 12.4 minutes, and the mean length of hospital stay was 6.2, 10.6, and 1.3, days, respectively. Based on the frequency of injectable analgesic use, postoperative pain was clearly milder in MuRAL and ALTA than in LE. The recurrence rates were 3.2% with MuRAL, 1.1% with LE, and 12.4% with ALTA. Early postoperative low-grade fever and bowel movement urgency were observed in all surgeries, but these were minor and did not pose a safety problem. LE is painful and requires prolonged hospitalization but is the most curative; ALTA is simple and can be performed as a day surgery but has a high recurrence rate. MuRAL was less painful than LE and had a lower recurrence rate than ALTA. In recent years, there have been various innovations in the surgical treatment of hemorrhoids, and choosing a technique that is appropriate for the condition of the hemorrhoid and patient's needs is necessary. MuRAL can be one of the options for hemorrhoid treatment as a cure without cutting method.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

When sphincteroplasty fails or is not feasible, the subsequent surgical options are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of anal encirclement using the Leeds-Keio ligament in patients with FI. The inclusion criteria for the procedure were failure of or unsuitability for sphincteroplasty and the presence of a patulous anus (diameter, ≥35 mm). The artificial ligament was routed outside the external anal sphincter at the depth of the middle anal canal under caudal epidural anesthesia. Fourteen patients (mean age, 79.4 years; 8 females) with FI were included. Of these, seven (50%) showed a ≥50% reduction in the Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS). The mean CCFIS of 13.6 at baseline significantly improved to 7.9 3 months after surgery. The mean maximal anal resting pressure significantly increased from 16.8 mmHg to 22.6 mmHg. Postoperatively, temporary fecal impaction was observed in one patient (7%). None of the cases required removal of the artificial ligament or additional operative interventions for FI during the mean follow-up period of 31.9 months. Anal encirclement using the Leeds-Keio ligament was technically simple and safe and achieved good short-term outcomes. Therefore, this technique appears to be a simple solution for sphincter defects and may become an important surgical option for patients with FI and a patulous anus.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

The patient presented to the urology clinic with a complaint of penile pain during urination. The patient underwent the Dixon operation for rectal carcinoma 2 mo before the presentation. During hospitalisation, abdominal computed tomography revealed a nodular lesion on the left penis. The postoperative pathological examination revealed a typical intestinal-type adenocarcinoma. Previous cases of PMRC were retrieved from PubMed to characterise the clinicopathological features and identify the prognostic factors of PMRC. The analysis suggested that approximately 24 mo is the median time to metastasis occurrence and 150 d is the survival time after diagnosis. Furthermore, poor pathological differentiation, lymph node involvement of the primary RC, metastasis time < 6 mo, penile metastatic nodule diameter > 1 cm, and treatment abandonment are negative predictors of survival outcomes.

When HEV-related LF occurs, a series of changes take place in both the intrahepatic environment and extrahepatic microenvironment. The changed types and distribution of immune cells (infiltrating macrophages and increased lymphocytes) in liver tissue, as well the increased proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the blood, indicate that the occurrence and progression of HEV-related LF are closely related to immune imbalance. The clinical features and immune reaction in the body during HEV-related acute LF (ALF) and ACLF are complicated.

On average, he smoked 20 cigarettes and consumed 200 galcoholdaily. He didn't have a history of hepatitis or surgery. Fever, vomiting, jaundice, dysuria, chills, and abdominal distention were not observed at the time of admission. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant was found on physical examination, but there was no palpable abdominal mass. No obvious abnormalities in laboratory tests and tumor markers were found. The plasma retention rate of indocyanine green (ICG) at 15 min was 1.35%. Subsequent abdominal ultrasonography showed a mixed echoic mass approximately 3.8 cm diameter in the left caudate lobe of the liver. Abdominal computed tomography confirmed a 3.0 cm × 3.5 cm irregular mass with inhomogeneous density and moderate delayed enhancement in the left caudate lobe of the liver. Laparoscopic left caudate lobectomy was performed to remove the liver mass. Intra-operative findings confirmed a non-cirrhotic liver, with a 3 cm × 3.5 cm white tumor mass in the left caudate lobe with no tumor rupture and no hemoperitoneum.

Herein, we describe our experience in neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and subsequent surgery for the treatment of UESL in children. To evaluate the efficacy of NAT and explore a new choice for successful operation of UESL in children. We retrospectively analyzed six patients newly diagnosed with unresectable UESL who received NAT and then surgery at our center between January 2004 and December 2019. The tumor was considered unresectable if it involved a large part of both lobes of the liver or had invaded the main hepatic vessels or inferior vena cava. The NAT included preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and systemic chemotherapy. The patients were 4 boys and 2 girls with a mean age of 7 years. The longest tumor at presentation ranged from 8.6 to 14.8 cm (mean, 12 cm). Extrahepatic metastases were present in 2 cases. Preoperative systemic chemotherapy was administered 3 wk after TACE. Tumor resection was performed 3 wk after one or two cycles of NAT. The patients received systemic chemotherapy after surgery. All patients successfully underwent NAT and complete resection. The tumor volumes decreased by 18.2%-68.7%, with a mean decrease of 36% after 1 cycle of NAT (t = 3.524, P = 0.017). According to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria, 4 patients had a partial response and underwent surgery, while 2 had stable disease and received another cycle of NAT before surgery. Massive tumor necrosis was seen on pathological examination of the surgical specimen: > 90% necrosis in two, > 50% necrosis in three, and 25% necrosis in 1, with an average of 71.8%. Post-NAT complications included fever, nausea and vomiting, and mild bone marrow suppression. Elevated alanine transaminase levels occurred in all patients, which returned to normal within 7-10 d after treatment. No cardiac or renal toxicity, severe hepatic dysfunction, bleeding and non-target embolization were observed in the patients. The median follow-up period was 8 years with an overall survival of 100%. NAT effectively reduced tumor volume, cleared the tumor margin, and caused massive tumor necrosis. This may be a promising choice for successful surgery of UESL in children.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Here we report on a case of massive bleeding after ERBL. A 31-year-old female was admitted to the department of gastroenterology with a chief complaint of discontinuous hematochezia for 2 years. No previous history, accompanying diseases or drug use was reported. Physical examination and colonoscopy showed grade II internal hemorrhoids. The patient received ERBL therapy. Five days after ligation, the patient presented with mild hematochezia. On days 7 and 9 after ligation, she presented with a large amount of rectal bleeding, dizziness and weakness. Emergency colonoscopy revealed active bleeding and an ulcer in the anal wound. The patient received two sessions of hemoclipping on days 7 and 9 to treat the bleeding. No further bleeding was reported up to day 15 and she was discharged home. Although the hemorrhoid prolapse disappeared after ERBL, she was dissatisfied with the subsequent complications. ERBL therapy is an effective treatment for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids with satisfactory short and long-term recovery. Pain and anal bleeding are the most frequently reported postoperative complications. Coagulation disorders complicate the increased risk of bleeding. Although rarely reported, our case reminds us that those patients without coagulation disorders are also at risk of massive life-threatening bleeding and need strict follow-up after ligation.","misc","christiaan","misc"

There are reports of mood and affect changes in the general population and the suggestion that similar changes occur also in the pregnant population. The greater vulnerability of women during the COVID-19 restriction period may translate into a greater risk for mental disorders in the gestational period. We hypothesised that pregnant women in the pre-pandemic period would have less psychopathology and more psychological support than pregnant women during the pandemic restriction period. To compare pregnant women for anxiety, prenatal depression, psychopathology, and social support before and after the awareness of the pandemic. We administered to women willing to participate in their 2nd-3rd trimesters of pregnancy the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y (STAI-Y), and the Symptom CheckList-90-Revised (SCL-90R); we further collected sociodemographic variables and explored women's social support. The comparison was cross-sectional. The first sample was termed nonCOVID-19 because data were gathered before the COVID-19 outbreak (January 2020-February 2020) was declared, and the second sample termed COVID-19 because participants were already subjected to the COVID-19-related restrictive measures (January 2021-February 2021). Since normal distribution was not met (Shapiro-Wilk test applied), we applied nonparametric Mann-Whitney's U-test to compare psychometric tests. Ethical standards were met. The nonCOVID-19 group reported higher support from partners only, while the COVID-19 group reported multiple support (χ 2 = 9.7181; P = 0.021); the nonCOVID-19 group scored higher than the COVID-19 group only on state anxiety among psychometric scales [STAI-Y1, nonCOVID-19 median = 39 (95%CI: 39.19-51.10) vs COVID-19 median= 32 (95%CI: 30.83-38.90); Mann-Whitney's U=117.5, P = 0.00596]. Other measures did not differ meaningfully between the two groups. Scores on the EPDS, the state and trait subscales of the STAI-Y, and most SCL-90R subscales inter-correlated with one another. The anxiety component of the EPDS, EPDS-3A, correlated poorly with other measures, while it was the Global Symptom Index of the SCL-90-R that correlated most strongly with most measures. Our results are at odds with most literature and do not confirm increased depression and anxiety rates in pregnant women during the pandemic. The ability of pregnant women to deal with novel generalised threats involves mobilization of inner resources.

However, the symptoms of hypertriglyceridemia are insidious and difficult to detect without blood tests. The fundus is the only site where blood vessels can be observed directly. Understanding the specific performance of LR in multimodal imaging fundus examinations can help diagnose more patients with abnormal hyperlipidemia. A 29-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes presented to our clinic complaining of a six-day loss of visual acuity in the left eye. The fundus color images showed typical LR: Arteries and veins were the same pink-white color. Infrared images showed hyperinfrared reflections of the arteries and veins. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed numerous high point-like reflections in the retinal section, corresponding to different calibers of blood vessel sections. Medium reflections were seen in the big vessels of the choroid. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) showed no significant changes. Laboratory examination found a total cholesterol level of 13.98 mmol/L, triglyceride 20.55 mmol/L, which confirmed the diagnosis of LR. After treatment to lower blood lipids and control blood glucose, the fundus imaging showed that the blood lipids in the patient had returned to normal. LR shows specific changes in fundus color photography, infrared photography, and OCT. FFA and OCTA were not sensitive to LR changes.","misc","christiaan","misc"

For severe VD of the knee, a more lateral structural release is needed to achieve balance between medial and lateral space and neutral femorotibial mechanical axis (FTMA), which is challenging and technical. To introduce a new surgical technique of resection, soft tissue release, and FTMA for Ranawat type-II VD with a 5-year follow-up. A retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent TKA from December 2011 to December 2014. Hip-knee-ankle (HKA), range of motion (ROM), Oxford knee score (OKS), and knee society score (KSS) were used to assess the joint activity of patients in the new theory TKA group (NT-TKA) and were compared with those of the conventional TKA group (C-TKA). A total of 103 people (103 knees) were included in this study, including 42 patients with an average follow-up period of 83 mo in the C-TKA group and 61 patients with an average follow-up period of 76 mo in the NT-TKA group. Six patients had constrained prosthesis, one had common peroneal nerve injury, and two had joint instability in the C-TKA group, but none of these occurred in the NT-TKA group. There were significant statistical differences in constrained prosthesis usage and complications between the groups (P = 0.002 and P = 0.034, respectively). The KSS at 1 mo post-operation for the C-TKA and NT-TKA groups were 11.2 ± 3.8 and 13.3 ± 2.9, respectively, with a significant difference (P = 0.007). However, the data of HKA, ROM, OKS KSS, and prosthesis survival rate were insignificant (P > 0.05) in both the preoperative and follow-up periods. Adopting 5°-7° valgus cut angle for VD and sacrificing 2° neutral FTMA for severe VD which cannot be completely corrected during TKA can reduce the need for soft tissue release, maintain early joint stability, reduce the use of constrained prostheses, and minimize postoperative complications.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

Delayed-onset Achromobacter species endophthalmitis appearing in acute presentation that develops more than several months after cataract surgery is very rare. Intraocular lens (IOL) removal is commonly recommended to treat Achromobacter species endophthalmitis, which is based on previous studies. Here, we report the results of surgery without IOL removal when treating patients with delayed-onset postoperative Achromobacter species endophthalmitis that developed in an acute form. Three patients visited our ophthalmology clinic due to visual impairment that began 2-3 d earlier. They had undergone cataract surgery 5-18 mo prior. Best-corrected visual acuity of the diseased eye was between counting fingers at 30 cm to non-light perception. They showed conjunctival injection, inflammation in the anterior chamber (cell reaction 4+) and hypopyon formation. The patients were diagnosed with infectious endophthalmitis and immediately underwent pars plana vitrectomy, anterior chamber irrigation and intravitreal injection of ceftazidime and vancomycin. Before fluid infusion, a vitreous specimen was obtained. In all cases, the IOLs were not removed. Achromobacter species was detected on vitreous specimen culture. After surgery, the vitreous opacity decreased gradually and there was little retinal damage. At 1 mo after treatment, the best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/50 and 20/40. Delayed onset postoperative endophthalmitis caused by Achromobacter species can appear in an acute form. All patients responded well to early vitrectomy and administration of empirical antibiotics including ceftazidime. There was no need for IOL removal during surgery.","misc","christiaan","misc"

To evaluate the Humasis COVID-19 Ag Test (Humasis Co., Ltd., Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea) in the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This retrospective study was carried out at the Croatian Institute of Public Health and included patients with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 lasting no longer than 5 d prior to testing, whose nasopharyngeal swabs were primarily tested with RAT. Negative RAT samples underwent confirmatory real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Diagnostic efficacy was determined compared to RT-PCR. The patients were divided into three age groups (< 18, 19-65, > 65 years). Statistical analysis was performed with the significance level set at P < 0.05. In total, 2490 symptomatic patients were tested; 953 samples were positive on RAT, and 1537 were negative. All negative RAT samples were subjected to RT-PCR; 266 samples were positive and marked as false-negative results on RAT. The calculated negative predictive value as a measure of RAT efficacy was 82.69%. The χ 2 test and Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference in the proportion of false negatives (P < 0.001) and RT-PCR cycle (Ct) values for false-negative RATs (P = 0.012) among the age groups. The young age group was significantly less likely to be false negative, whereas the false negatives from the elderly group experienced significantly lower Ct values than the other two age groups. Evaluated RAT demonstrated satisfactory performance with more reliable results in younger patients. Humasis COVID-19 Ag RAT is potentially a valuable tool in areas where access to molecular methods is limited; however, RT-PCR remains a gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

However, development of green processing methods that meet these criteria remains a major research challenge. Here, we harness microbial biofabrication of nanocellulose and draw inspiration from ancient textile techniques to engineer sustainable biotextiles with a circular life cycle. The unique molecular self-organization of microbial nanocellulose (MC) combined with bio-phosphorylation with a lecithin treatment yields a compostable material with superior mechanical and flame-retardant properties. Specifically, treatment of MC with a lecithin-phosphocholine emulsion makes sites available to modulate cellulose cross-linking through hydroxyl, phosphate and methylene groups, increasing the interaction between cellulose chains. The resultant bioleather exhibits enhanced tensile strength and high ductility. Bio-phosphorylation with lecithin also redirects the combustion pathway from levoglucosan production towards the formation of foaming char as an insulating oxygen barrier, for outstanding flame retardance. Controlled color modulation is demonstrated with natural dyes. Life cycle impact assessment reveals that MC bioleather has up to an order of magnitude lower carbon footprint than conventional textiles, and a thousandfold reduction in the carcinogenic impact of leather production. Eliminating the use of hazardous substances, these high performance materials disrupt linear production models and strategically eliminate its toxicity and negative climate impacts, with widespread application in fashion, interiors and construction. Importantly, the biotextile approach developed in this study demonstrates the potential of biofabrication coupled with green chemistry for a circular materials economy.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Modern lifestyle, the inappropriate use of antibiotics, and exposure to pollution have significantly affected the composition of commensal microorganisms. The intestinal microbiota has been shown to sustain inappropriate autoimmune responses at distant sites in animal models of disease, and may also have a role in immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). We studied the composition of the gut mycobiota in fecal samples from 27 persons with MS (pwMS) and in 18 healthy donors (HD), including 5 pairs of homozygous twins discordant for MS. We found a tendency towards higher fungal abundance and richness in the MS group, and we observed that MS twins showed a higher rate of food-associated strains, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then found that in pwMS, a distinct population of cells with antibacterial and antifungal activity is expanded during the remitting phase and markedly decreases during clinically and/or radiologically active disease. These cells, named MAIT (mucosal-associated invariant T cells) lymphocytes, were significantly more activated in pwMS compared to HD in response to S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans strains isolated from fecal samples. This activation was also mediated by fungal-induced IL-23 secretion by innate immune cells. Finally, immunofluorescent stainings of MS post-mortem brain tissues from persons with the secondary progressive form of the disease showed that MAIT cells cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. These results were in agreement with the hypothesis that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota might determine the inappropriate response of a subset of pathogenic mucosal T cells and favor the development of systemic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The Expanded Socioecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness to Transition (Expanded SMART) offers a holistic view of factors that influence transition readiness and outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine conceptual congruency of transition readiness instruments with the Expanded SMART to determine the breadth and frequency of constructs measured. PubMed was searched to identify observational and experimental studies that measured transition readiness across chronic illnesses. Selected instruments were first evaluated on their development and psychometric properties. Next, reviewers independently mapped each instrument item to Expanded SMART constructs: knowledge, skills/self-efficacy, relationships/communication, psychosocial/emotions, developmental maturity, beliefs/expectations, goals/motivation. If items did not map to a construct, a new construct was named inductively through group discussion. Three instruments (TRAQ [20 items], STARx [18 items] and TRxANSITION Index [32 items]), reported in 74 studies, were identified. Across instruments, most items mapped to three constructs: skills/self-efficacy, developmental maturity, and knowledge. The psychosocial constructs of goals/motivation and psychosocial/emotions were underrepresented in the instruments. No instrument mapped to every model construct. Two new constructs: independent living and organization were identified. Constructs representing transition readiness in three frequently used transition readiness instruments vary considerably from Expanded SMART, a holistic conceptual model of transition readiness, suggesting that conceptualization and operationalization of transition readiness is not standardized. No instrument reflected all conceptual constructs of transition readiness and psychosocial constructs were underrepresented, suggesting that current instruments may provide an incomplete measurement of transition readiness.","misc","christiaan","misc"

A longitudinal, randomized controlled trial.","Children's spatial cognition abilities are a vital part of their learning and cognitive development, and important for their problem-solving capabilities, the development of mathematical skills and progress in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) topics. As many children have difficulties with STEM topic areas, and as these topics have suffered a decline in uptake in students, it is worthwhile to find out how learning and performance can be enhanced at an early age. The current study is the first to investigate if dog-assisted and relaxation interventions can improve spatial abilities in school children. It makes a novel contribution to empirical research by measuring longitudinally if an Animal-Assisted Intervention (AAI) or relaxation intervention can boost children's development of spatial abilities. Randomized controlled trials were employed over time including dog intervention, relaxation intervention and no treatment control groups. Interventions were carried out over 4 weeks, twice a week for 20 min. Children were tested in mainstream schools (N = 105) and in special educational needs (SEN) schools (N = 64) before and after interventions, after 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. To assess intervention type and to provide advice for subsequent best practice recommendations, dog-assisted interventions were run as individual or small group interventions. Overall, children's spatial abilities improved over the year with highest increases in the first 4 months. In Study 1, typically developing children showed higher scores and more continuous learning overall compared to children with special educational needs. Children in the dog intervention group showed higher spatial ability scores immediately after interventions and after a further 6 weeks (short-term). Children in the relaxation group also showed improved scores short-term after relaxation intervention. In contrast, the no treatment control group did not improve significantly. No long-term effects were observed. Interestingly, no gender differences could be observed in mainstream school children's spatial skills. In study 2, children in SEN schools saw immediate improvements in spatial abilities after relaxation intervention sessions. No changes were seen after dog interventions or in the no treatment control group. Participants' pet ownership status did not have an effect in either cohort. These are the first findings showing that AAI and relaxation interventions benefit children's spatial abilities in varied educational settings. This research represents an original contribution to Developmental Psychology and to the field of Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) and is an important step towards further in-depth investigation of how AAI and relaxation interventions can help children achieve their learning potential, both in mainstream schools and in schools for SEN.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"
"1855",35979429,"Unraveling Origin, History, Genetics, and Strategies for Accelerated Domestication and Diversification of Food Legumes.","Domestication is a dynamic and ongoing process of transforming wild species into cultivated species by selecting desirable agricultural plant features to meet human needs such as taste, yield, storage, and cultivation practices. Human plant domestication began in the Fertile Crescent around 12,000 years ago and spread throughout the world, including China, Mesoamerica, the Andes and Near Oceania, Sub-Saharan Africa, and eastern North America. Indus valley civilizations have played a great role in the domestication of grain legumes. Crops, such as pigeon pea, black gram, green gram, lablab bean, moth bean, and horse gram, originated in the Indian subcontinent, and Neolithic archaeological records indicate that these crops were first domesticated by early civilizations in the region. The domestication and evolution of wild ancestors into today's elite cultivars are important contributors to global food supply and agricultural crop improvement. In addition, food legumes contribute to food security by protecting human health and minimize climate change impacts. During the domestication process, legume crop species have undergone a severe genetic diversity loss, and only a very narrow range of variability is retained in the cultivars. Further reduction in genetic diversity occurred during seed dispersal and movement across the continents. In general, only a few traits, such as shattering resistance, seed dormancy loss, stem growth behavior, flowering-maturity period, and yield traits, have prominence in the domestication process across the species. Thus, identification and knowledge of domestication responsive loci were often useful in accelerating new species' domestication. The genes and metabolic pathways responsible for the significant alterations that occurred as an outcome of domestication might aid in the quick domestication of novel crops. Further, recent advances in omics sciences, gene-editing technologies, and functional analysis will accelerate the domestication and crop improvement of new crop species without losing much genetic diversity. In this review, we have discussed about the origin, center of diversity, and seed movement of major food legumes, which will be useful in the exploration and utilization of genetic diversity in crop improvement. Further, we have discussed about the major genes/QTLs associated with the domestication syndrome in pulse crops and the future strategies to improve the food legume crops.","misc","christiaan","misc"

CAPRIN1 encodes a ubiquitous protein that regulates the transport and translation of neuronal mRNAs critical for synaptic plasticity, as well as mRNAs encoding proteins important for cell proliferation and migration in multiple cell types. We identified twelve cases with loss-of-function CAPRIN1 variants, and a neurodevelopmental phenotype characterized by language impairment/speech delay (100%), Intellectual Disability (ID; 83%), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; 82%), and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; 67%). Affected individuals also had respiratory problems (50%), limb/skeletal anomalies (50%), developmental delay (42%) feeding difficulties (33%), seizures (33%) and ophthalmologic problems (33%). In patient-derived lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, we showed a monoallelic expression of the wild-type allele, and a reduction of the transcript and protein compatible with a half dose. To further study pathogenic mechanisms, we generated CAPRIN1+/- human iPSCs (hiPSCs) via CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis and differentiated them into neuronal progenitor cells and cortical neurons. CAPRIN1 loss caused reduced neuronal processes, overall disruption of the neuronal organization, and an increased neuronal degeneration. We also observed an alteration of mRNA translation in CAPRIN1+/- neurons, compatible with its suggested function as translational inhibitor. CAPRIN1+/- neurons also showed an impaired calcium signalling and increased oxidative stress, two mechanisms that may directly affect neuronal networks development, maintenance, and function. According to what was previously observed in the mouse model, measurements of activity in CAPRIN1+/- neurons via micro-electrode arrays (MEA) indicated lower spike rates and bursts, with an overall reduced activity. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CAPRIN1 haploinsufficiency causes a novel autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder and identify morphological and functional alterations associated with this disorder in human neuronal models.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Effective vaccines for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus exist; however, vaccination rates among EMS professionals remain largely unknown. Consequently, we sought to document vaccination rates of EMS professionals and identify predictors of vaccination uptake. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of North Carolina EMS professionals after the COVID-19 vaccines were widely available. The survey assessed vaccination status as well as beliefs regarding COVID-19 illness and vaccine effectiveness. Prediction of vaccine uptake was modeled using logistic regression. A total of 860 EMS professionals completed the survey, of whom 74.7% reported receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. Most respondents believed that COVID-19 is a serious threat to the population, that they are personally at higher risk of infection, that vaccine side effects are outweighed by illness prevention, and the vaccine is safe and effective. Despite this, only 18.7% supported mandatory vaccination for EMS professionals. Statistically significant differences were observed between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness, recall of employer vaccine recommendation, perceived risk of infection, degree of threat to the population, and trust in government to take actions to limit the spread of disease. Unvaccinated respondents cited reasons such as belief in personal health and natural immunity as protectors against infection, concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness, inadequate vaccine knowledge, and lack of an employer mandate for declining the vaccine. Predictors of vaccination included belief in vaccine safety (odds ratio [OR] 5.5, P=<0.001) and effectiveness (OR 4.6, P=<0.001); importance of vaccination to protect patients (OR 15.5, P=<0.001); perceived personal risk of infection (OR 1.8, P=0.04); previous receipt of influenza vaccine (OR 2.5, P=0.003); and sufficient knowledge to make an informed decision about vaccination (OR 2.4, P=0.024).

The Richmond Stress and Sugar Study includes a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort of adults at risk for type 2 diabetes (n = 125; mean age 57 years, 48% black, and 61% high neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES)). Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity was assessed by salivary cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a laboratory stressor. Higher perceived stress was associated with a lower cortisol response to the TSST [-7.5%; 95% CI: -13.1%, -1.5%], but was not associated with cortisol recovery after the TSST [3%; 95% CI: -0.6%, 6.8%]. In contrast, domain-specific stress was not associated with cortisol response [-2.1%; 95%CI: -20.7%, 20.9%], but was inversely associated with cortisol recovery [3.7%; 95%CI: 0.6%, 7.0%]. SES modified these associations: both perceived stress and domain-specific stress were associated with TSST cortisol response only among participants from high SES neighborhoods. There was minimal evidence of effect-modification by race. Both self-report measures of psychosocial stress were associated with HPA-axis reactivity to an acute stressor. These associations varied by perceived vs. domain-specific measurement scales and by neighborhood SES. Further efforts to refine stress measures and clarify biological linkages between social status and health are needed.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and signaling of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) are important in the inflammatory response and have been associated with increased stress and poorer health outcomes in patients with cancer. This study examined relationships among circulating cortisol, a measure of HPA axis activity and physiological stress; s100A8/A9, a RAGE ligand and emerging cancer-related biological measure; and self-reported cancer-related distress. Patients with BCa (N = 183, stage 0-IIIb) were recruited 2-10 weeks post-surgery but prior to receiving adjuvant therapies. Participants provided blood samples, from which serum cortisol and s100A8/A9 levels were determined, and completed a psychosocial questionnaire. Regression analyses, adjusting for age, cancer stage, time since surgery, race, and menopausal status, were conducted examining the relationships between cortisol, s100A8/A9, and cancer-related distress (Impact of Event Scale [IES]-Revised). Cortisol and s100A8/A9 levels were positively related (β = .218, t(112) = 2.332, p = .021), although the overall model was not significant. Cortisol levels were also positively associated with IES-Intrusions (β = .192, t(163) = 2.659, p = .009) and IES-Hyperarousal subscale scores (β = .171, t(163) = 2.304, p = .022). Patients with higher cortisol levels also reported higher s100A8/A9 levels and more cancer-related distress. The relationship between cortisol and s100A8/A9 supports a link between the stress response and pro-inflammatory physiological processes known to predict greater metastatic risk in BCa. Stress processes implicated in cancer biology are complex and replication and extension of these initial findings is important.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

In a cohort of community-dwelling older Black adults (N = 611), we investigated the relationship between John Henryism and cognitive decline. John Henryism was measured using the John Henryism Active Coping Scale (JHACS), a 9-item validated measure of self-reported high-effort coping (mean = 16.9, sd = 4.8, range: 4-27). We implemented a three-step modeling process using mixed effect models to assess the relationship between the JHACS and global cognitive function as well as five cognitive domains. We adjusted for demographics and for factors known to be associated with cognitive function and decline including vascular risk factors, discrimination, and income. The trait of high-effort active coping was associated with lower average cognitive function (β = -0.07, 95% CI: -0.10, -0.03), but not with decline. The results remained after further adjustment for experiences of discrimination, income, and vascular risk factors. In domain specific analyses, we found that the JHACS was associated with baseline levels of working memory, semantic memory and visuospatial ability, but not decline. These results highlight the importance of using culturally specific measures in considering the heterogeneity of cognitive health outcomes in minoritized populations. Understanding how stress responses relate to late-life cognition among older Black adults could help promote aspects of behavioral resilience along with healthful coping responses.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

With regard to allergic rhinits, previous research provided inconclusive evidence for the effects of OLP, possibly related to a separate focus on either symptom severity or symptom frequency. Overcoming this limitation of previous research, the present study aimed to examine the effects of OLP on both the severity and frequency of allergic symptoms. In a randomized-controlled trial, patients with allergic rhinits (N = 74) were randomized to OLP or treatment as usual (TAU). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, OLP was administered remotely in a virtual clinical encounter. Participants took placebo tablets for 14 days. The primary outcomes were the severity and frequency of allergic symptoms. The secondary endpoint was allergy-related impairment. OLP did not significantly improve symptom severity over TAU, F(1, 71) = 3.280, p = .074, ɳ2p = .044, but did reduce symptom frequency, F(1, 71) = 7.272, p = .009, ɳ2p = .093, and allergy-related impairment more than TAU, F(1, 71) = 6.445, p = .013, ɳ2p = .083, reflecting medium to large effects. The use of other anti-allergic medication did not influence the results. While OLP was able to lower the frequency of allergic symptoms and allergy-related impairment substantially, its effects on symptom severity were weaker. The remote provision of OLP suggests that physical contact between patients and providers might not be necessary for OLP to work.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"

The quantitation of microbial exoelectrogenic ability is fundamental to studying the process of EET. However, there is no accurate and time-saving protocol to directly evaluate EET ability, hindering our understanding and application of EET. In this work, we proposed an accurate and rapid quantitation system for measuring EET ability using a gold-coated membrane filter as a working electrode. The quantitation signals could be recorded within 1 h and accurately normalized by the number of cells with outstanding repeatability and reproducibility. Further, this method could be distinguished microbial direct EET performances of different growth stages, and the results showed the middle logarithmic growth stage of Shewanella onedensis MR-1 had the best electrochemical activity. This method can be widely used for different types of electroactive microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and fungi. Due to its time savings, accurate quantification and easy operation, this method provides a standard way to assess the role of EET ability.","misc","christiaan","misc"

On May 24, 2019, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage. Sexual and gender minority older adults are becoming more visible in Taiwanese society. However, healthcare providers' behaviour and intention to offer culturally competent care to sexual and gender minority older adults and factors affecting their behaviour and intention in Asian culture remain unclear. This study determined factors associated with healthcare providers' behaviour and intention to offer culturally competent care to Taiwanese sexual and gender minority older adults and identified related training requirements. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. This study recruited participants from 14 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organisations; long-term care facilities; and community healthcare centres. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of XXX (Ref. 201811049RIND). A total of 25 providers were interviewed: 12 nurses, 10 social workers, and 3 staff members from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organisations. Semistructured interviews were conducted between May 2019 and September 2019. Interview data were analysed using the socio-ecological model and the constant comparative technique. Factors associated with the providers' behaviour and intention to offer culturally competent care to sexual and gender minority older adults were categorised by the socio-ecological model level: 1) intrapersonal factors, namely providers' attitudes towards sexual and gender minority older adults, knowledge regarding sexual and gender minority populations, and experiences of providing care for sexual and gender minority older adults; 2) interpersonal factors, namely providers' concerns regarding interactions among staff, sexual and gender minority older adults, nonsexual and gender minority residents, and nonsexual and gender minority residents' families; 3) community factors, namely resources, training courses, and support from managers and organisations; and 4) societal factors, namely social environment and policies. This study identified multilevel factors associated with the providers' cultural competence in caring for sexual and gender minority older adults in Taiwan. These factors may lead to disparities in quality of life and health for sexual and gender minority older adults.

The combination of PULL@CPB and PMIA could increase the one-step refining of protoplasmic beer as well as the ability of biocatalysis to lower the alcohol-to-ester ratio. The experimental results showed that the addition of PULL@CPB and the increase in the ratio of EtOH/water in the coagulation bath both increased the load of pullulanase on the membrane surface, while excessive addition decreased the activity of pullulanase. Under the amount of PULL@CPB is 0.5 g·L-1 and the ratio of EtOH/water is 60%, the relative activity of pullulanase in PULL@CPB modified PMIA membrane was the highest, which was 91.7% of the initial activity. The interception rates of protein and macromolecular β-glucan were 92.2% and 87.3%, respectively, under the condition of beer flux (162.3 L·m-2·h-1). At the same time, the PULL@CPB/PMIA membrane has strong antibacterial performance and thus plays a role in extending the shelf life of beer. Compared with free pullulanase, the thermal stability, pH stability, organic solvent stability, and storing stability of immobilized pullulanase were significantly improved. The effects of PULL@CPB dosage and operating temperature on biocatalysis efficiency were discussed. The immobilized pullulanase activity on the membrane remained at 70.8% after 10 continuous uses. Therefore, the PMIA membrane is an excellent carrier of pullulanase, so its bioactive membrane has a wide range of prospects in food, medicine, and other fields.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We report the results of a consensus survey among 42 Italian experts in the diagnosis and treatment of LGS. The consensus procedure followed a modified Delphi approach. Statements were formulated, based on the most recent published evidence and the clinicians' personal experience, then discussed, and agreed upon by the experts through a two-round voting procedure. Approval of a statement was reached with an average score ≥7. Thirteen statements dealing with three main topics (i.e., clinical diagnosis and prognosis, impact on the Quality of Life (QoL), and treatment strategies) were generated. Six statements achieved a level of agreement sufficient for approval on the first voting round. Following the discussion and a few consequent amendments, most of the statements increased their level of agreement and all 13 were approved. Overall, the statements draw a slightly more benign picture of this rare and severe disease, highlighting the possibility of remission - albeit modest -, an apparent trend towards lower mortality, and the availability of several effective drugs, to which greater accessibility would be hoped for. Valproate remains a major therapeutic option in LGS patients although lamotrigine, rufinamide, topiramate, cannabidiol, and clobazam are popular therapeutic options in Italy, allowing for a tailor-made antiseizure therapy.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The impact of modern era GDMT on survival in this population is unknown. This study sought to investigate the impact of number of GDMT medications prescribed for HFrEF on all-cause mortality in recipients of primary prevention ICD. A cohort of 4,972 recipients with primary prevention ICD (n = 3,210) or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) (n = 1,762) was studied. The association of number of GDMT medications prescribed at the time of device implantation and all-cause mortality at 2 years post implantation was examined. In our primary prevention cohort, 5%, 20%, 52%, and 23% of patients were prescribed 0, 1, 2, or 3-4 GDMT medications, respectively. After risk adjustment for age, sex, ejection fraction, body mass index, the Elixhauser comorbidity score, the type of cardiomyopathy, and the year of device implantation, each additional GDMT conferred a reduction in the risk of death of 36% in recipients of ICD (HR: 0.64; P < 0.001) and 30% in recipients of CRT-D (HR: 0.70; P < 0.001). A higher number of prescribed GDMT medications is associated with an incremental 1-year survival in recipients of primary prevention ICD with or without CRT. Initiation of maximum number of tolerated GDMT medications should therefore be the goal for all patients with HFrEF. In the setting of robust GDMT, the risk versus benefit of a primary prevention ICD warrants re-examination in future studies.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Three key hydrological parameters, such as Water Presence Frequency (WPF), water depth, and hydro-period were considered for hydrological strength modelling using two ensemble Machine Learning (ML) techniques (Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost). Image algebra was employed for phasal change detection. Hydrological strength models show that around 75% of the wetland area was lost in-between phases I to III and the loss was found more intensive in moderate and weak HS zones. Existing wetland shows a clear spatial difference of HS between wetland core and periphery and river linked and delinked or not linked wetlands. Regarding the suitability of the ML models, both are acceptable, however, the XGBoost outperformed in reference to applied 15 statistical validation techniques and field evidence. HS models based on change detection clarified that more than 22% and 55% of the weak HS zone in phases II and III respectively were turned into non-wetland. The degree of alteration revealed that about 40% of wetland areas experienced a negative alteration during phases I to II, and this proportion increased to 63% in between phases II to III. Since the study figured out the spatial nature of HS, degree and direction of alteration at a spatial scale, these findings would be instrumental for adopting rational planning towards wetland conservation and restoration.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The anaerobic sequencing batch reactors were fed cheese production wastewater as substrate and inoculated by anaerobic granular seed sludge. The results showed that acidic pH improved VFA production yield (0.92 at pH 5; 0.42 at pH 10 and 0.21 gCOD/gVS at neutral pH). Furthermore, propionic acid was dominant under both pH 10 (64 ± 20%) and neutral pH (72 ± 8%), whereas, acetic acid (23 ± 20%4), propionic acid (22 ± 3%), butyric acid (21 ± 4%) and valeric acid (15 ± 8%) were almost equally distributed under pH 5.

It is anticipated that the difficulty associated with the management of ash will worsen over time as the industry increases its reliance on green fuel. Thus, there is a strong need to identify beneficial uses of pulp and paper boiler ash for the sake of environmental and economic sustainability. The purpose of this report is to provide the first step in this direction, a review of proposed or implemented uses for coal and hog (or wood) ash around the world. Considering both the properties of the ash and local opportunities, this could be the first step toward screening the applications that may apply to individual mills. Several large-scale practices use ash, such as land application (as a nutrient source or as a liming agent), use in the construction industry (as a replacement for cement or as a fill material), and reclamation of mine sites and stabilization of unpaved forest roads. In some cases, relatively small-scale applications have been used which included uses such as a compost component, agent for pH adjustment of liquid streams and slurries, blasting abrasive, and source of quartz for glass manufacturing to name a few. It is important to note that the chemical nature of both fly and bottom ashes can be quite variable due to the type of wood residues combusted as well as combustion equipment used and must be considered in identifying beneficial applications.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1880",35982554,"The economics of sediment quality on barrier shoreline restoration.","This paper depicts a simulation-based assessment of sediment quality on the performance of dedicated dredging projects for barrier island restoration in coastal Louisiana, USA. The research involved the development and integration of two sub-models. In the first, geomorphic modeling was used to simulate sediment transport dynamics within a proxy barrier island template over a 50-year trajectory. The template was assumed to be nourished with one of two sources of dredged material: nearshore (NS) sediments of lower quality (smaller grain diameter, higher organic fines); or higher quality sediments from distal sources located on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). In the second model, agency project records and commercial bids were used to estimate project construction costs as a function of dredge material quantity, transport distance, and project target elevation. These sub-models were coupled within a net present value framework from which average annual break-even values for ecosystem services (EBEV) were derived as an efficiency metric for comparing the economic performance of NS- and OCS-sourced projects. Results indicate that in some cases, the physical resiliency afforded by even small increases in sand diameter (+4 μm d50) can translate to greater long-term economic viability (lower EBEV) for OCS-sourced sediment transported over longer distances. Moreover, projects constructed with much higher diameter OCS sediment (+44 μm d50) with low fines and transported over relatively long distances (200 μm, 5% fines, 15-20 miles) were found to be more cost-effective than all comparably-sized projects constructed with lower quality NS sediments obtained from proximal sources (156 μm, 20% fines, 3-5 miles). For some comparisons, this quality advantage yielded a lower EBEV for OCS-sourced projects with transport distances exceeding 30 miles. Under storm-punctuated simulations, these quality advantages were more pronounced, with greater physical and economic implications for earlier (Y5) versus later (Y20) occurring storms. Budgeting for dedicated dredging projects has traditionally centered on the value of sediment as a commodity, with a focus on material placement cost. The findings of this study, however, indicate that a more comprehensive accounting of sediment quality and performance is required to maximize the economic efficiency of coastal restoration spending.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We used a systems approach and applied an impact matrix and chain effect analysis methods to projects in the highly urbanized Taipei metropolitan region to identify the influences and effects between urban development projects and climate change objectives. Three types of urban plans and projects were analyzed: flood control, transportation, and urban planning. The magnitudes of the influences and effects between these projects and plans were derived through interviews with experts familiar with Taipei's urban development. This pilot study found no synergy in the response to climate change mitigation and adaptation for the urban development projects analyzed. The current standalone policies and plans related to urbanization in Taipei have resulted in trade-offs for flood control and public transit projects because they contribute positively toward one climate objective but negatively impact another. A high-level policymaking mechanism that ensures coordination and collaboration between different sectors is needed to supervise sectoral policies. Prior to the approval and implementation of a plan, policymakers should request the assessment of synergies and trade-offs between plans and projects to ensure a synergistic effect to climate change issues. This study confirms that the strategy from individual sector in a metropolitan region will result in trade-off between climate change issues is a global problem. This paper also strengthens the concept that the assessment of synergy/trade-offs between policy and plans should be conducted using systemic approach.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Six leachates characterised by similar COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) but different BOD5/COD (Biochemical Oxygen demand/COD) and TOC/COD (Total Organic Carbon/COD) ratios were tested. By combining these ratios, the BOD5/TOC ratio was introduced to take into account the effect of both leachate properties (biodegradability and oxidation degree). Process treatment performance was significantly influenced by the quality of organic substances. Higher BOD5/TOC values (higher biodegradability and lower oxidation degree) resulted in a greater and faster larvae growth, with final wet weight of between 49.2 and 91.9mg/larva; lower mortality between 5 and 32%; higher prepupation percentages ranging from 4 to 21% and higher specific substrate consumption rate with values varying from 0.051 to 0.063 mgTOC/mg larva/d, up to 3-fold higher than values obtained using conventional activated sludge based on COD consumption.

Previous research noticed that the MAW might underestimate the calculation results, while the reasons for this underestimation haven't been studied systematically. With 29 vehicles tested in 10 cities and different boundaries applied for calculation, this study quantitively analyzed the problem, causes, and impacts of the light-duty MAW method. The instantaneous utilization factor (IUF) is proposed for reason analysis. The current MAW method could weaken the supervision of real driving tests as more than 75% of the tests underestimated MAW results, with the largest underestimation being around 100%. The data exclusion could lead to biased MAW results. But without the exclusion, the MAW result couldn't always get an increase due to the IUF and window weighting factor variation. With the extended factors removed, the MAW result bias is significantly reduced. The MAW will lead to a lower IUF of the data at the start/end of the tests, and when the cold-start data is considered, this low utilization must be noticed. The effect from the data exclusion, extended factors, and the window characteristics are closely coupled and they should be taken into consideration simultaneously to consummate the calculation method. The current drift-check progress couldn't effectively monitor the portable emission measurement system (PEMS), especially during the tests. The MAW result might lead to unreasonable emission limits and the emission inventory. Relevant policy based on these results might be implausible.","misc","christiaan","misc"

PM long-term characterisation allows identifying trends and evaluating the outcomes of environmental protection policies. This work is aimed to study the inter-annual variability of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations and chemical composition in an urban background site (Italy). A dataset of daily PM2.5 and PM10 was collected in the period 2016-2017, including the content of OC, EC, major water-soluble ions, main metals, and compared to a similar dataset collected in the period 2013-2014. Oxidative potential using DTT assay (dithiothreitol) was evaluated and expressed in DTTV as 0.39 nmol/min·m3 in PM10 and 0.29 in PM2.5 nmol/min·m3. PM source apportionment was computed using the EPA PMF5.0 model and source contributions compared with those of a previous dataset collected between 2013 and 2014. Multi linear regression analysis identified which source contributed (p < 0.05) to the oxidative potential of each size fraction. Inter-annual trends were more evident on PM2.5 with reductions of biomass burning contribution and increases in traffic contribution in the 2016-2017 period. Crustal contributions were similar for the two periods, in both size fractions. Carbonates were comparable in PM10 with a slight increase in PM2.5. Sea spray decreased in PM10. The DTTV of PM2.5 peaked during cold periods, while, the DTTV of the PM10-2.5 fraction peaked in summer, suggesting that different sources, with different seasonality, influence OP in the PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 fractions. Analysis showed that sea spray, crustal, and carbonates sources contribute ∼13.6% to DTTV in PM2.5 and ∼62.4% to DTTV in PM10-2.5. Combustion sources (biomass burning and traffic) contribute to the majority of DTTV (50.6%) in PM2.5 and contribute for ∼26% to DTTV in PM10-2.5. Secondary nitrate contributes to DTTV in both fine and coarse fraction; secondary sulphate contribute to DTTV in PM2.5 with negligible contributions to DTTV in PM10-2.5.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The fugacity model has been widely used to quantify biogeochemical cycles of pesticides due to its clear compartments, simple structure, and easy-accessible data. However, the lack of detailed hydrological processes limits its application for large and heterogeneous watershed. In present study, a new framework was proposed through integration of hydrological processes of SWAT and pesticide fate of fugacity model, and was applied into a typical watershed in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. The results showed that surface runoff, soil erosion, and percolation varied spatiotemporally, which highlighted the importance of considering regional and seasonal heterogeneity of pesticide transport variables in the fugacity model. The amount of dichlorvos (DDV) and chlorpyrifos (CHP) in air, water, soil, and sediment phase were estimated as 0.26 kg, 19.77 kg, 1.06 × 104 kg, and 0.55 kg, respectively. Spatiotemporally, pesticide concentrations in water phase peaked in summer, while the middle and southwest regions of the watershed were identified as the hotspots for pesticide pollution. Compared with the classical model, the new framework provided technical support for the pesticide assessment at watershed scale with heterogeneous hydrological conditions, which can be easily extended to other watersheds, and integrated with other models for comprehensive agricultural management.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1886",35982568,"Paired denitrifying bioreactors with wide orientation for increased drainage flow capacity.","Denitrifying bioreactors are a conservation drainage practice for reducing nitrate loads in subsurface agricultural drainage. Bioreactor hydraulic capacity is limited by cross-sectional area perpendicular to flow through the woodchip bed, with excess bypass flow untreated. Paired bioreactors with wide orientations were built in 2017 in Illinois, USA, to treat drainage from a relatively large 29 ha field. The paired design consisted of: a larger, Main bioreactor (LWD: 6.1 × 18.3 × 0.9 m) for treating base flow, and 2) a smaller, Booster bioreactor (7.8 × 13.1 × 0.9 m) receiving bypass flow from the Main bioreactor during periods of high flow. Over three years of monitoring, the paired bioreactor captured 84-92% of the annual drainage discharge which demonstrated an expanded cross-sectional area could improve bioreactor flow capture, even for a large drainage area. However, the paired bioreactors removed 6-28% of the annual N load leaving the field (1.8-5.6 kg N ha-1 removed; 52-161 kg N), which was not a notable improvement compared to bioreactors treating smaller drainage areas. The design operated as intended at low annual flow-weighted hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of usually ≤2 h, but these short HRTs ultimately limited bioreactor nitrate removal efficiency. Daily HRTs of <2 h often resulted in nitrate flushing. The Main bioreactor had higher hydraulic loading as intended and was responsible for the majority of flow captured in each year although not always the most nitrate mass removal. The Booster bioreactor provided better nitrate removal than the Main at HRTs of 3.0-11.9 h, possibly due to its drying cycles which may have liberated more available carbon. This new design approach tested at the field-scale illustrated tradeoffs between greater flow capacity (via increased bioreactor width) and longer HRT (via increased length), given a consistent bioreactor surface footprint.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Considering co-digestion can adjust carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of the feedstock and improve the synergetic interactions among microorganisms, anaerobic co-digestion (AnCoD) is then becoming an emerging approach to achieve higher energy recovery from FW while ensuring the stability of the system. To obtain higher economic gain from such biodegradable wastes, increasing attention has been paid on optimizing the system configuration or applying enzymatic hydrolysis before digesting FW. A better understanding on the potentiality of correlating enzymatic pretreatment and AnCoD operated in various system configuration would enhance the bioresource recovery from FW and increase revenue through treating this organic waste. Specifically, the biobased chemicals outputs from FW-related co-digestion system with different configuration were firstly compared in this review. A deep discussion concerning the challenges for achieving bioresources recovery from FW co-digestion systems with enzymatic pretreatment was then given.

"1888",35982574,"Detecting vinyl chloride by phytoscreening in the shallow critical zone at sites with potential human exposure.","Chlorinated ethene (CE) contaminants are widespread in groundwater, and the occurrence of vinyl chloride (VC), among others, is a well-known issue due to its mobility, persistence, and carcinogenicity. Human exposure to VC may occur through inhalation after soil vapor intrusion into buildings at sites with shallow underground contamination. Soil vapor intrusion risk is traditionally assessed through indoor air and sub-slab sampling (direct evidence) or soil gas and groundwater surveys (indirect evidence). Phytoscreening (sampling and analysis of tree trunk matrices) was proven as a cost-effective alternative technique to indirectly detect shallow underground contamination by higher chlorinated ethenes and subsequent vapor intrusion risk. However, the technique has appeared barely capable to screen for the lower chlorinated VC, likely due to its fugacity and aerobic bio-degradability, with only one literature record to date showing successful detection in trees. We applied phytoscreening at two sites with severe CE contamination nearby residential buildings caused by illegal dumping of chlorinated pitches from petrochemical productions. The two sites show variable amounts of VC in the shallow groundwater (1e2 to 1e4 μg/L), posing potential sanitary risk issues. Former soil gas surveys did not detect VC in the vadose zone. At both sites, we sampled trunk micro-cores and trunk gas from poplar trees close to contaminated piezometers in different seasons. VC was detected in several instances, disproving the shared literature assumption of the inefficacy of phytoscreening towards this compound. Factors influencing the detectability of VC and other CEs in trees were analyzed through linear regressions. Two different conceptual models were proposed to explain the effective uptake of VC by trees at the two sites, i.e., direct uptake of contaminated groundwater at the first site and uptake of VC from an anoxic vadose zone at the second site. In planta reductive dechlorination of CEs is not expected based on current literature knowledge. Thus, the detection of VC in trunks would indicate its occurrence in the shallow underground, suggesting higher screening effectiveness of phytoscreening compared to soil gas; this has implications for indirect vapor intrusion risk assessment.","misc","christiaan","misc"

In recent decades, climate change has threatened the nutrient balance of dryland ecosystems. However, its impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) in drylands of China are still unclear. In this study, the structural equation model (SEM) was used to explain the relationship between environmental variables used by the best model and SOC or STN. Then Adaptive Boosting Regressor (AdaBoost), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBRT), Extreme gradient boosting Regression (XGBoost) and Random Forest Regression (RF) were used to establish the prediction model of SOC and STN based on soil samples along with environmental variables. The performance of these models was assessed based on a 10-fold cross-validation method using three statistical indicators. Finally, we predicted the SOC and STN of soil samples from 2000 to 2019 based on the best model. Overall, the RF model performed better at predicting SOC and STN in drylands than the other three prediction models (AdaBoost, GBRT, XGBoost). Climate factors were the main factors affecting SOC and STN in the study area. In the Alashan, a dryland in northern China, the precipitation in the growing season increased from 2000 to 2019, at a rate of 12.9 mm/decade. During the same period, the annual sunshine duration significantly decreased by 66 h/decade. Along with interannual hydrothermal variability, SOC showed a fluctuating upward trend at a rate of 0.04 g/kg/decade, while STN exhibited a fluctuating downward trend at 0.003 g/kg/decade from 2000 to 2019. Due to the effects of climate change, dryland were considered as potential sites for carbon sequestration. However, due to the annual hydrothermal variance causing dynamic annual changes, it was deemed unstable. Moreover, it would cause STN loss, which might reduce soil fertility. More attention should be paid to STN monitoring in dryland in the future.","misc","christiaan","misc"

They were asked to assess their health and social needs via the CHSNA system, which was integrated into an online community-care platform. Three assessment steps (basic health assessment, needs for activities of daily living, and in-depth health assessment) associated with five ICF components were used to evaluate physical health impairment, difficulties in activities and participation, and environmental problems. The final list of health and social needs was systematically linked to the domains and categories of the ICF. Only data from participants who completed all three assessment steps were included. Wide ranges of impairments and difficulties regarding the daily living activities, physical health, and environmental status of the community were recorded from 190 people who completed assessments of their health and social needs by the CHSNA system. These participants reported various health and social needs for their community life; common needs corresponded to the ICF components of body functions and activities/participation. The ICF may be suitable for determining the health-related problems and needs of the general population.

Its treatment is difficult, and measurements of its severity are highly dependent on clinicians' experience. Pustules and brown spots are the main efflorescences of the disease and directly correlate with its activity. We propose an automated deep learning model (DLM) to quantify lesions in terms of count and surface percentage from patient photographs. In this retrospective study, two dermatologists and a student labeled 151 photographs of PP patients for pustules and brown spots. The DLM was trained and validated with 121 photographs, keeping 30 photographs as a test set to assess the DLM performance on unseen data. We also evaluated our DLM on 213 unstandardized, out-of-distribution photographs of various pustular disorders (referred to as the pustular set), which were ranked from 0 (no disease) to 4 (very severe) by one dermatologist for disease severity. The agreement between the DLM predictions and experts' labels was evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the test set and Spearman correlation (SC) coefficient for the pustular set. On the test set, the DLM achieved an ICC of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-0.98) for count and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92-0.94) for surface percentage. On the pustular set, the DLM reached a SC coefficient of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.60-0.74) for count and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83) for surface percentage.

The KFACS participants were classified as robust or frail based on Fried's frailty phenotype and excluded if they did not properly answer the questions, resulting in 1,066 robust and 165 frail participants. We then selected influential features through feature selection and trained the model using support vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms with the prepared dataset. Due to the imbalanced distribution in the dataset with a low sample size, holdout was applied with stratified 10-fold and cross-validation for estimating the model performance. The reliability of the constructed model was validated using an unseen test set. The model was then trained with hyperparameter optimization. During the feature selection process, 27 features were identified as meaningful factors for frailty. The model was trained based on the selected features, and the weighted average F1-score reached 95.30% with the random forest algorithm. The results of the study demonstrated the possibility of adopting machine learning to strengthen existing frailty criteria.

We propose a network analysis method, in which we generate association networks of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can differentiate case and control groups. We hypothesize that certain phenotypic traits are attributable to mutations in groups of associated SNPs. We propose a method based on a network analysis framework to study SNP-SNP interactions related to cancer incidence. We employed logistic regression to measure the significance of all SNP pairs from GWAS for the incidence of colorectal cancer and computed a cancer risk score based on the generated SNP networks. We demonstrated our method in a dataset from a case-control study of colorectal cancer in the South Sulawesi population. From the GWAS results, 20,094 pairs of 200 SNPs were created. We obtained one cluster containing four pairs of five SNPs that passed the filtering threshold based on their p-values. A locus on chromosome 12 (12:54410007) was found to be strongly connected to the four variants on chromosome 1. A polygenic risk score was computed from the five SNPs, and a significant difference in colorectal cancer risk was obtained between the case and control groups. Our results demonstrate the applicability of our method to understand SNP-SNP interactions and compute risk scores for various types of cancer.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Rapid responses from fertility subspecialist doctors may reduce patients' anxiety levels, but fertility subspecialist doctors' high workload and their patients' worsening health conditions make them unable to handle IVF patients' complaints quickly. Research suggests that smart systems using case-based reasoning (CBR) can help doctors handle patients quickly. However, a prior study reported enhanced accuracy by modifying the CBR similarity formula based on Lin's similarity theory to generate the Chris case-based reasoning (CCBR) similarity formula. The data were validated through interviews with two fertility subspecialist doctors, interviews with two IVF patients, a questionnaire administered to 17 community members, the relevant literature, and 256 records with data on IVF patients' complaints and how they were handled. An experiment compared the performance of the CBR similarity formula algorithm with the CCBR similarity formula algorithm. A confusion matrix showed that the CCBR similarity formula had an accuracy value of 52.58% and a precision value of 100%. Fertility subspecialist doctors stated that 89.69% of the CCBR similarity formula recommendations were accurate. We recommend applying a combination of the CCBR similarity formula and a minimum reference value of 80% with a CBR smart system for handling IVF patients' complaints.

To understand this, we designed a transmission chain experiment using naïve, intranasally (IN) or intramuscularly (IM) vaccinated, and previously infected (PI) hamsters. Vaccination and previous infection protected animals from disease and virus replication after Delta and Omicron dual challenge. A gradient in transmission blockage was observed: IM vaccination displayed moderate transmission blockage potential over three airborne chains (approx. 70%), whereas, IN vaccination and PI blocked airborne transmission in >90%. In naïve hamsters, Delta completely outcompeted Omicron within and between hosts after dual infection in onward transmission. Although Delta also outcompeted Omicron in the vaccinated and PI transmission chains, an increase in Omicron competitiveness was observed in these groups. This correlated with the increase in the strength of the humoral response against Delta, with the strongest response seen in PI animals.

Cardiac fibrosis in the mouse MI model was mitigated by TRIM38 overexpression, but aggravated by its depletion. Consistently, in vitro overexpression or knockdown of TRIM38 ameliorated or aggravated the proliferation and secretion of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) exposed to fibrotic stimulation, respectively. Mechanistically, TRIM38 suppressed cardiac fibrosis progression by attenuating TAK1/MAPK signaling. Inhibiting TAK1/MAPK signaling with a pharmacological inhibitor greatly reversed the effects of TRIM38 knockdown on CF secretion. Specifically, TRIM38 interacted with and targeted TAB2 and TAB3 for degradation, subsequently inhibiting TAK1 phosphorylation and negatively regulating MAPK signaling.

Here, we employ bromocriptine as a tool to elucidate the roles of catecholamine signaling in regulating pancreatic hormone secretion. In β-cells, bromocriptine acts on D2R and α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2A-AR) to reduce glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Moreover, in α-cells, bromocriptine acts via D2R to reduce glucagon secretion. α2A-AR activation by bromocriptine recruits an ensemble of G proteins with no β-arrestin2 recruitment. In contrast, D2R recruits G proteins and β-arrestin2 upon bromocriptine stimulation, demonstrating receptor-specific signaling. Docking studies reveal distinct bromocriptine binding to α2A-AR versus D2R, providing a structural basis for bromocriptine's dual actions on β-cell α2A-AR and D2R.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit and brain is the preferred imaging modality to diagnose and define extent of disease as well as to assess response to therapy. Sometimes, it may be difficult to differentiate the presence of active residual disease from therapy-related changes based on posttreatment completion MRI. RB patients who completed treatment between January 2017 and October 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. We evaluated the utility of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) to predict active disease in RB patients who continued to have residual disease on MRI at completion of treatment. Out of the 89 patients who completed treatment, dilemma regarding remission status was present in 11 children. All 11 patients underwent FDG-PET-CT. None of them had evidence of metabolically active disease in the orbit, optic nerve, brain, or rest of the body. After a median follow-up of 24 months, no children developed any evidence of disease progression in the form of local or distant relapse. Our results showed that in MRI doubtful cases, a nonavid FDG-PET is reassuring in avoiding further therapy as long as close follow-up can be ensured. FDG-PET-CT may emerge as a useful functional modality to predict disease activity in RB.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

The study aims to radiolabel 17-oxo-17a-aza-D-homo-5-androsten-3β-yl phenoxyacetate (17a-aza steroid) with Tc-99m to evaluate its targeted uptake in experimentally induced prostate carcinogenesis in rats. The prediction of the optimal interaction and binding affinity of Tc-99m-17-oxo-17a-aza-D-homo-5-androsten-3 β-ylphenoxyacetate (Tc-99m-17a-aza steroid) toward 5AR inhibitor was done using Biopredicta Vlife MDS tool. Tc-99m-17a-aza steroid was developed by direct radiolabeling protocol. The radio-pharmacological characteristics (serum stability, plasma protein-binding ability, and lipophilicity) of the complex were evaluated. Further, the bio-distribution studies of the complex were performed in rats with experimentally induced prostate carcinogenesis. The in-silico analysis exhibits favorable binding of Tc-99m-17a-aza toward 5AR with D score-130.97. The radiochemical purity of Tc-99m-17a-aza was 96.79%. The radio-complex maintained stability in the rat serum for a period of 6 h (hours). Plasma protein binding and Log Po/w value were observed to be 86.23 ± 7.08% and 0.118 ± 0.045, respectively. A significantly enhanced percent-specific uptake was observed in the prostate of rats with induced prostate carcinogenesis.

Imaging (image matrix - 128 × 128 × 47, 2 min, 3D model) was done using two different (TOF/non-TOF) PET scanners. Phantom data were reconstructed in TOF and non-TOF modes for lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate and non-TOF mode for bismuth germanate-based PET scanners. The reconstructed data (by varying iteration and subsets) that provided the best image contrast and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were evaluated. The whole-body [18F]-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT scans (7-8 frames; 2.0 min/frame) in 16 lymphoma patients were acquired at 60 min after injecting the radioactivity (370.0-444.0 MBq of [18F]-FDG. The clinical PET/CT data were reconstructed using phantom-derived reconstruction parameters and evaluated for image contrast and SNR of the detected lesions. TOF reconstruction at second iteration provided significantly (P ≤ 0.02) higher SNR (20.7) and contrast (contrast recovery coefficient/background variability = 3.21) for the smallest hot lesions (10.0 mm) in the phantom than the non-TOF system. Similarly, in patient data analysis for the selected FDG avid lesions, the SNR values were significantly (P = 0.02) higher (13.3 ± 6.49) in TOF than (11 ± 6.48) in non-TOF system. Further, the small (≤10.0 mm) lesions were seen more distinctly in TOF system. It is thus observed that TOF reconstruction converged faster than the non-TOF, and the applicability of the same may impact the image quality and interpretation in the clinical PET data. The validation of the phantom-based experimental reconstruction parameters to clinical PET imaging data is highly warranted.","misc","christiaan","misc"

It is important to study effects of different patterns of ionizing radiation. In this study, a rat model was used to compare the effects of repetitive and acute exposure. Groups: (I) control, (II, III) were exposed to fractionated doses (1.5 GyX4) and (2 GyX4), respectively/24h interval, and (IV, V) were exposed to 6 Gy and 8 Gy of whole-body gamma irradiation, respectively. The gene expression of MAPT and tau phosphorylation increased in all irradiated groups but the gene expression of PKN not affected. TGFβ% increased at dose of 2 GyX4 only. In addition, the cell cycle was arrested in S phase. Micronucleus (MN) increased and cell proliferation decreased. In conclusion, the dose and pattern of ionizing radiation do not affect the MAPT and PKN gene expression, but TGF-β, p-tau, MN assay and cell proliferation are significantly affected. The dose of 2 GyX4 showed distinctive effect. Repetitive exposure may increase TGF-β%, which causes radio-resistance and, G2/M delay.

The spectra from both phases are interpreted with the assistance of high-level electronic structure and ab initio molecular dynamics calculations. In addition to the regular Auger-Meitner-electron features, we observe electron emission at kinetic energies of 374-388 eV, above the leading Auger-Meitner peak (3a1 2). Based on the electronic structure calculations, we assign this peak to a shake-up satellite in the gas phase, i.e., Auger-Meitner emission from an intermediate state with additional valence excitation present. The high-energy contribution is significantly enhanced in the liquid phase. We consider various mechanisms contributing to this feature. First, in analogy with other hydrogen-bonded liquids (noticeably water), the high-energy signal may be a signature for an ultrafast proton transfer taking place before the electronic decay (proton transfer mediated charge separation). The ab initio dynamical calculations show, however, that such a process is much slower than electronic decay and is, thus, very unlikely. Next, we consider a non-local version of the Auger-Meitner decay, the Intermolecular Coulombic Decay. The electronic structure calculations support an important contribution of this purely electronic mechanism. Finally, we discuss a non-local enhancement of the shake-up processes.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The present study comparatively evaluated the impact performance of hardhat helmets, climbing-style safety helmets, and helmets with novel rotation-damping technologies to determine if advanced designs deliver improved protection. Six helmet designs from three categories of safety helmets were tested: two traditional hardhat helmets (HH Type I, HH Type II), two climbing-style helmets (CS Web, CS Foam), and two helmets with dedicated rotation-damping technologies (MIPS, CEL). Helmets were first evaluated in impacts of 31 J energy representing a falling object according to standard Z89.1-2014. Subsequently, helmets were evaluated in impacts representing a fall by dropping a helmeted head-neck surrogate at 275 J impact energy. The resulting head kinematics were used to calculate the probability of sustaining a head or brain injury. Crown impacts representative of a falling object resulted in linear acceleration of less than 50 g in all six helmet models. Compared to crown impacts, front, side and rear impacts caused a several-fold increase in head acceleration in all helmets except HH Type II and CEL helmets. For impacts representative of falls, all helmets except the CEL helmet exhibited significantly increased head accelerations and an increased brain injury probability compared to the traditional HH Type I hardhat. Neck compression was 35%-90% higher in the two climbing-style helmets and 80% higher in MIPS helmets compared to the traditional HH type I hardhat. Contemporary helmets do not necessarily deliver improved protection from impacts and falls compared to traditional hardhat helmets.","misc","christiaan","misc"

To date, it is unclear whether the convergent bipolar MT array assumes unified poles in plant spindles, and if so, how such a goal is achieved. Among six classes of Kinesin-14 motors in Arabidopsis thaliana, the Kinesin-14A motors ATK1 (KatA) and ATK5 share the essential function in spindle morphogenesis. To understand how the two functionally redundant Kinesin-14A motors contributed to the spindle assembly, we had ATK1-GFP and ATK5-GFP fusion proteins expressed in their corresponding null mutants and found that they were functionally comparable to their native forms. Although ATK1 was a nuclear protein and ATK5 cytoplasmic prior to nuclear envelop breakdown, at later mitotic stages, the two motors shared similar localization patterns of uniform association with both spindle and phragmoplast MTs. We found that ATK1 and ATK5 were rapidly concentrated toward unified polar foci when cells were under hyperosmotic conditions. Concomitantly, spindle poles became perfectly focused as if there were centrosome-like MT-organizing centers where ATK1 and ATK5 were highly enriched and at which kinetochore fibers pointed. The separation of ATK1/ATK5-highlighted MTs from those of kinetochore fibers suggested that the motors translocated interpolar MTs. Our protein purification and live-cell imaging results showed that ATK1 and ATK5 are associated with each other in vivo. The stress-induced spindle pole convergence was also accompanied by poleward accumulation of the MT nucleator γ-tubulin. These results led to the conclusion that the two Kinesin-14A motors formed oligomeric motor complexes that drove MT translocation toward the spindle pole to establish acentrosomal spindles with convergent poles.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Decreased bone formation due to osteoblast dysfunction may be one of the causes of aging-related bone loss. With increasing evidence suggesting that multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in osteoblast function, the relationship between miRNAs and senile osteoporosis has become a popular research topic. Previously, we confirmed that mechanoresponsive miR-138-5p negatively regulated bone anabolic action. In this study, the miR-138-5p level was found to be negatively correlated with BMD and osteogenic markers in bone specimens of senile osteoporotic patients by bioinformatic analysis and experimental verification. Furthermore, high miR-138-5p levels aggravated the decrease of aged osteoblast differentiation in vitro and led to worse bone loss in aged osteoblastic miR-138-5p transgenic mice in vivo. We also previously identified that the target of miR-138-5p, microtubule actin cross-linking factor 1 (MACF1), could attenuate senile osteoporosis. Here, miR-138-5p was demonstrated to regulate aged osteoblast differentiation by targeting MACF1. Finally, the therapeutic inhibition of miR-138-5p counteracted the decrease in bone formation and aging-related bone loss in aged mice. Overall, our results highlight the crucial roles and the molecular mechanism of miR-138-5p in aging-related bone loss and may provide a powerful therapeutic target for ameliorating senile osteoporosis.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

It has a prevailing transmission rate and continues to be a global burden. There is a paucity of data regarding the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in COVID-19. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate lncRNAs, particularly NEAT1 and TUG1, and their association with IL-6, CCL2, and TNF-α in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe disease. Methods: The study was conducted on 80 COVID-19 patients (35 with severe and 45 with moderate infection) and 40 control subjects. Complete blood count (CBC), D-dimer assay, serum ferritin, and CRP were assayed. qRT-PCR was used to measure RNAs and lncRNAs. Results: NEAT1 and TUG1 expression levels were higher in COVID-19 patients compared with controls (P<0.001). Furthermore, CCL2, IL-6, and TNF-α expressions were higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (P<0.001). CCL2 and IL-6 expression levels were significantly higher in patients with severe compared to those with moderate COVID-19 infection (P<0.001). IL-6 had the highest accuracy in distinguishing COVID-19 patients (AUC=1, P<0.001 at a cutoff of 0.359), followed by TUG1 (AUC=0.999, P<0.001 at a cutoff of 2.28). NEAT1 and TUG1 had significant correlations with the measured cytokines, and based on the multivariate regression analysis, NEAT1 is the independent predictor for survival in COVID-19 patients (P=0.02). Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients, significant overexpression of NEAT1 and TUG1 was observed, consistent with cytokine storm. TUG1 could be an efficient diagnostic biomarker, whereas NEAT1 was an independent predictor for overall survival.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

CASC8 was highly overexpressed in ESCC tissues and upregulation of CASC8 predicted poor prognosis in ESCC patients. Moreover, CASC8 decreased the cisplatin sensitivity of ESCC cells and promoted ESCC tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, CASC8 interacted with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNPL) and inhibited its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thus stabilizing hnRNPL protein levels and activating the Bcl2/caspase3 pathway. Additionally, AlkB Homolog 5, RNA demethylase (ALKBH5)-mediated m6A demethylation stabilized the CASC8 transcript, resulting in CASC8 upregulation.

Accumulating evidence reported the orchestrating role of ER stress in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress, but the detailed mechanism was unclear. Here, we identified ectopic expression of TMTC3 in cells undergoing ER stress and verified the association with EMT markers through the cellular model of ER stress and database analysis. TMTC3 was abnormally highly expressed in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and regulated by TP63, an SCCs-specific transcription factor. Biological function experiments indicated that TMTC3 promoted a malignant phenotype in vitro, and accelerated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. RNA-seq analyses and further experiments revealed that TMTC3 promoted the expression of EMT markers via interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI, FAM3C). Further studies on the mechanism showed that TMTC3 disrupted the interaction between PERK and GRP78 to activate the PERK pathway and promote the nuclear translocation of ATF4, which increased the transcriptional activity of ILEI. These findings indicated that TMTC3 activates GRP78/PERK signaling pathway during ER stress-induced EMT, which might serve as a potential therapeutic target in SCCs.","misc","christiaan","misc"

The results showed that increased expression of CPNE8 was positively correlated with metastasis and can be considered an independent prognostic risk factor for poor survival. We found that CPNE8 can promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness in GC using in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our study demonstrated that CPNE8 promotes tumor progression via regulation of focal adhesion, and these effects can be rescued by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor GSK2256098 or knockdown of FAK. In addition, CPNE8 was correlated significantly with the infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells, as demonstrated by various algorithms, and high CPNE8 expression predicted poor efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy.

Currently, secondary injury severity is difficult to estimate. The objective of this study was to investigate the capacity of non-invasive amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to assess TBI injury in different brain regions and predict long-term neurobehavior outcomes. Fifty-five male and female rats were subjected to a controlled cortical impact with one of three different impactor depths to produce different degrees of TBI. Multi-parameter MRI data were acquired on a 4.7-Tesla scanner at 1 h, 1 day, and 3 days. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect activated microglia at 3 days, and neurobehavioral tests were performed to assess long-term outcomes after 28 days. The APTw signal in the injury core at 1 day correlated with deficits in sensorimotor function, the sucrose preference test (a test for anhedonia), and spatial memory function on the Barnes maze. The APTw signal in the perilesion ipsilateral cortex gradually increased after TBI, and the value at 3 days correlated with microglia density at 3 days and with spatial memory decline and anhedonia at 28 days. The correlation between APTw and activated microglia was also observed in the ipsilateral thalamus, and its correlation to memory deficit and depression was evident in other ipsilateral sites. These results suggest that APTw imaging can be used for detecting secondary injury and as a potential predictor of long-term outcomes from TBI.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Evidence has suggested that patients with mTBI can suffer from long-lasting cognitive deficits, persistent symptoms, and decreased quality of life. Sleep disorders are commonly observed after TBI, with the prevalence rate of sleep disturbances in persons with TBI being much higher than that in the general population. Poor sleep quality can impair cognitive functions in the general population. This effect of sleep disturbances may impede the recovery processes in the population with TBI. The objective of this study is to add to our understanding of the relationship between self-reported sleep problems and other post-concussion symptoms and look at the association between early sleep problems and long-term outcomes in mTBI. Post-concussion symptoms, neurocognitive functions, level of global outcomes, and rating of satisfaction of life were assessed in 64 patients with mTBI. The results revealed that the presence of sleep disturbances co-occur with an increased level of overall post-concussion symptoms at the subacute stage of mTBI, particularly with symptoms including poor concentration, memory problems, and irritability. In addition, sleep disturbance at the subacute stage is associated with persistent poor concentration and memory problems, as well as worse neurocognitive function, slower overall recovery, and lower satisfactory of life at the long term. Our findings suggest that sleep disturbance can be a prognostic factor of long-term outcomes after mTBI. Early interventions to improve sleep quality can have potential benefits to facilitate the recovery process from mTBI.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

This was a scoping review of studies pertaining to models for the prediction of post-surgical complication after spinal surgery published over 10 years (2010-2020). Qualitative data was extracted from the studies to include study classification, adherence to Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines and risk of bias (ROB) assessment using the Prediction model study Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Model evaluation was determined using area under the curve (AUC) when available. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement was used as a basis for the search methodology in four different databases. Thirty studies were included in the scoping review and 80% (24/30) included model development with or without internal validation. Twenty percent (6/30) were exclusively external validation studies and only one study included an impact analysis in addition to model development and internal validation. Two studies referenced the TRIPOD guidelines and there was a high ROB in 100% of the studies using the PROBAST tool. The majority of post-surgical complication prediction models in spinal surgery have not undergone standardized model development and internal validation or adequate external validation and impact evaluation. As such there is uncertainty as to their validity, generalizability, and clinical utility.

While carbohydrate metabolism in immune cells is signaled by glycolytic shift during a bacterial or viral infection, it is widely evident that effector surface proteins are expressed on the surface of parasites and fungi to modulate metabolism in these cells. Carbohydrate metabolism in immune cells can be categorized according to the pathogen or the disease type. Accordingly, this classification can be used to adopt new strategies in disease diagnosis and treatment.","misc","christiaan","systematic_review"

The mean relative telomerase activity was significantly higher in the PeCa tissues than the control group (138.66 vs. 14.46, P < 0.001). A significantly higher relative telomerase activity was noted in the PeCa tissues positive for high-risk HPV subtypes than controls (141.90 vs. 14.46, P = 0.0008), but not between high-risk HPV-positive and HPV-negative PeCa cases (141.90 vs. 137.03, P = 0.79). High-risk subtypes were not associated with tumor stage (P = 0.76) or lymph node metastasis (P = 0.816). HPV was associated in 42.5% of PeCa cases based on our experience from a single institution. PeCa tissues had a higher relative E7 mRNA expression for HPV-18 and relative telomerase activity as compared to controls suggesting their potential role as surrogate markers of virus-induced tumorigenesis.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

The performance of the TFL across different ranges of stone volumes and stone densities is assessed. Between October 2019 and August 2020, a prospective study was done on 135 patients with < 20 mm renal stones, who underwent RIRS using TFL. Stone parameters, total laser time, total energy delivered (kJ), and fiber burn-back were recorded. Laser efficacy (J/mm3) and ablation speed (mm3/s) were calculated. Data of 126 of 135 patients included in the study were analyzed. The mean patient age was 45.04 ± 12.30 years. Mean stone size was 15.19 ± 4.52 mm, and mean stone volume was 1061.85 ± 806.81 mm3. Mean laser time was 19.78 ± 12.32 min. At higher stone volume (>1000 mm3), J/mm3 decreased significantly from 16.18 ± 5.90 to 10.92 ± 3.21 (P < 0.001) and the ablation speed increased significantly (0.77 ± 0.28-1.04 ± 0.28 mm3/s [P < 0.001]). Stone density did not have a significant influence on the laser efficacy [B = -0.31 (-2.45 to 1.82, p=0.771)] or on the ablation speed [B = -0.06 (-0.17 to 0.05, p=0.278)]. Overall SFR was 93.6%. The complication rate was 16.6% (21/126). Out of the 21, 12 patients had hematuria and 9 had fever, which were of Clavien grades 1-2. Superpulse TFL is efficient and safe. The work efficiency increases for larger volume stones. The work efficiency remains the same across different stone densities. No complication more than Clavien grade 2 was encountered.","human_intervention","christiaan","human_intervention"

Some studies have even compared partial nephrectomy (PN) performed through various modalities such as open PN (OPN) versus RAPN and laparoscopic PN (LPN) versus OPN. The primary aim of this review was to analyze perioperative outcomes such as warm ischemia time (WIT), duration of surgery, estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, blood transfusion, length of stay, and margin status following RAPN for complex renal masses. Another objective was to compare perioperative outcomes following various surgical modalities, i.e., OPN, LPN, or RAPN. Literature search was conducted to identify studies reporting perioperative outcomes following RAPN for moderate (Radius, Endophytic/Exophytic, Nearness, Anterior/posterior location [RENAL] score 7-9 or Preoperative Aspects of Dimension used for anatomic classification [PADUA] score 8-9) to high complexity renal masses (RENAL or PADUA score ≥ 10). Meta-analysis of robotic versus OPN and robotic versus LPN was also performed. Study protocol was registered with PROPSERO (CRD42019121259). In this review, 22 studies including 2,659 patients were included. Mean duration of surgery, WIT, and EBL was 132.5-250.8 min, 15.5-30 min, and 100-321 ml, respectively. From pooled analysis, positive surgical margin, need for blood transfusion, minor and major complications were seen in 3.9%, 5.2%, 19.3%, and 6.3% of the patients. No significant difference was noted between RAPN and LPN for any of the perioperative outcomes. Compared to OPN, RAPN had significantly lower EBL, complications rate, and need for transfusion. RAPN for moderate to high complexity renal masses is associated with acceptable perioperative outcomes. LPN and RAPN were equal in terms of perioperative outcomes for complex masses whereas, OPN had significantly higher blood loss, complications rate, and need for transfusion as compared to RAPN.","systematic_review","christiaan","meta_analysis"

Here we present TF-COMB (Transcription Factor Co-Occurrence using Market Basket analysis) - a tool to investigate co-occurring TFs and binding grammar within regulatory regions. We found that TF-COMB can accurately identify known co-occurring TFs from ChIP-seq data, as well as uncover preferential localization to other genomic elements. With the use of ATAC-seq footprinting and TF motif locations, we found that TFs exhibit both preferred orientation and distance in relation to each other, and that these are biologically significant. Finally, we extended the analysis to not only investigate individual TF pairs, but also TF pairs in the context of networks, which enabled the investigation of TF complexes and TF hubs.

This was a cross-sectional study among patients attending a secondary oral healthcare facility in the North Central city of Jos between January 2019 and December 2020. The sociodemographic features of the patients include patients' complaints, clinical and social history, result of simple clinical oral examinations, and diagnoses of dental trauma. The classification of Ellis and Davey (1970) was used to classify dental trauma for this study. One hundred and seventy-six (6.7%) patients presented with dental trauma involving 281 teeth. The mean age was 37.54 ± 2.16 years. The most common cause of dental trauma in 48 (27.3%) patients was bone cracking, followed by falls in 33 (18.8%), road traffic accidents (RTAs) in 26 (14.8%), and bottle opening with teeth in 26 (14.8%). Bone cracking was the major cause of dental trauma in 18 (31.0%) educated and 2 (28.6%) non-educated patients. Among the patients, 118 (67.1%) presented with single traumatized tooth. Permanent anterior teeth 151 (53.74%) were more involved, and class 2 trauma involving enamel and dentinal structure was the most common presentation.

No reliable solution to stenosis CD exists so far. Therefore, we generated carboxymethyl chitosan oligosaccharide (CMCOS) as a new promising therapy and investigate its efficacy in an improved rat CD model. CMCOS was synthesized by enzymatic hydrolysis, and its biosafety was evaluated in vivo. The rat model of stenosis CD was optimized by an orthogonal experiment of 75 or 100 mg/kg trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) in a 50 or 75% ethanol enema. The therapeutic efficacy of CMCOS on the rat model of stenosis CD was investigated and compared with the commercial drug 5-aminosalicylic acid over a 28 day period of disease progression. The rat model of stenosis CD was well established by intracolonic administration of 75 mg/kg TNBS in 75% ethanol. CMCOS significantly alleviated CD symptoms morphologically, hematologically, and pathologically, promoting functional recovery of intestinal epithelium in a dose-dependent manner. CMCOS reduced infiltrations of inflammatory cells by regulating the IL-17A/PPAR-γ pathway and reduced fibro-proliferation and fibro-degeneration of the colon tissue by downregulating the TGF-β1/WT1 pathway. 75 mg/kg TNBS in a 75% ethanol enema induces a rat model of stenosis CD suitable for preclinical pathology and pharmacological studies.

Other questions that remain unanswered also include: What is the ideal selectivity between JAK1 and JAK3? Which cells are most relevant to JAK blockade? And what is the ideal tissue distribution pattern for addressing specific autoimmune conditions? We hypothesized that JAK3 selectivity is most relevant to low-dose clinical effects and interleukin-10 (IL-10) stimulation in particular, that immune cells are the most important compartment, and that distribution to inflamed tissue is the most important pharmacokinetic characteristic for in vivo disease modification. To test these hypotheses, we prepared modified derivatives of JAK3 specific inhibitors that target C909 near the ATP binding site based on FM-381, first reported in 2016; a compound class that was hitherto limited in uptake and exposure in vivo. These limits appear to be due to metabolic instability of side groups binding in the selectivity pocket. We identified derivatives with improved stability and tissue exposure. Conjugation to macrolide scaffolds with medium chain linkers was sufficient to stabilize the compounds and improve transport to organs while maintaining JAK3 affinity. These conjugates are inflammation targeted JAK3 inhibitors with long tissue half-lives and high exposure to activated immune cells.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Although the binding of CPPs to serum proteins may possibly reduce their cellular uptake to some extent, it may also prolong their circulation half-life in vivo. We aimed to identify novel binding proteins of arginine-rich CPPs in serum to better understand their in vivo fate and develop more sophisticated drug delivery systems using CPPs. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis suggests that albumin, the most abundant protein in serum, binds to d-forms of oligoarginine; however, the dissociation constants are several tens of a micromolar. Candidate proteins with the potential of binding to arginine-rich CPPs in serum were then explored using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Studies using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy determined hemopexin as a potential binding partner of d-forms of arginine-rich CPPs, including d-octaarginine (r 8) and the d-form of the peptide, corresponding to HIV-1 Rev (34-50), with dissociation constants of submicromolar to micromolar range. Using flow cytometry and a split-luciferase-based system, the promotion effect of hemopexin on the total cellular uptake and cytosolic localization of cargos conjugated with these CPPs was confirmed.

Additionally, the efficacy of topical applications was investigated using a porcine skin model, in which particle size and zeta potential relate to skin permeability. Skin permeation was correlated to particle size and relative stability in skin-like conditions but not directly related to the CBD content, suggesting that topical products can be designed to enhance overall skin permeation.

"1947",35983313,"Surface Nanostructure Effects on Dopamine Adsorption and Electrochemistry on Glassy Carbon Electrodes.","Dopamine (DA) adsorption and electron-transfer kinetics are strongly sensitive to the structure and composition of carbon electrodes. Activation of carbon surfaces is a popular method to improve DA detection, but the role of carbon structural features on DA behavior remains uncertain. Herein, we use scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) for local anodization of glassy carbon (GC) electrodes in acid media followed by electrochemical imaging of DA adsorption and electrochemistry covering both unmodified and anodized GC regions of the same electrode. Electrochemical measurements of adsorbed DA involve the delivery of DA from the SECCM meniscus (30 μM) for 1 s periods followed by voltammetric analysis at a reasonable sweep rate (47 V s-1). This general approach reduces effects from interelectrode variability and allows for considerable numbers of measurements and statistical analysis of electrochemical data sets. Localized electrode activity is correlated to surface structure and chemistry by a range of characterization techniques. Anodization enhances DA electron-transfer kinetics and provides more sites for adsorption (higher specific surface area). A consequence is that adsorption takes longer to approach completion on the anodized surface. In fact, normalizing DA surface coverage by the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) reveals that adsorption is less extensive on anodized surfaces compared to as-prepared GC on the same time scale. Thus, ECSA, which has often been overlooked when calculating DA surface coverage on carbon electrodes, even where different activation methods would be expected to result in different surface roughness and nanostructure, is an important consideration. Lower graphitic and higher oxygen content on anodized GC also suggest that oxygen-containing functional groups do not necessarily enhance DA adsorption and may have the opposite effect. This work further demonstrates SECCM as a powerful technique for revealing surface structure-function relationships and correlations at heterogeneous electrodes.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Two processes are observed on nanostructured KBr surfaces: the movement of the atomic steps and the formation of solvation islands. The first process takes place at comparatively lower pressures at around 1% relative pressure, whereas the second process starts at higher pressures at around 25% relative pressure and above. Furthermore, the second process takes place only after the complete relocation of the step edges and thereby formation of a nearly flat surface. This implies that there is a competition between the restructuring of the atomic steps and solvation layer formation, as both processes require solvated ions. Unlike in the case of a flat surface, solvation islands of alcohols wet the restructured surface due to a higher density of low-coordination sites.","misc","christiaan","misc"

In Canada, caregivers of older adults receiving home care face difficult decisions that may lead to decision regret. We assessed difficult decisions and decision regret among caregivers of older adults receiving home care services and factors associated with decision regret. Methods. From March 13 to 30, 2020, at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted an online survey with caregivers of older adults receiving home care in the 10 Canadian provinces. We distributed a self-administered questionnaire through Canada's largest and most representative private online panel. We identified types of difficult health-related decisions faced in the past year and their frequency and evaluated decision regret using the Decision Regret Scale (DRS), scored from 0 to 100. We performed descriptive statistics as well as bivariable and multivariable linear regression to identify factors predicting decision regret. Results. Among 932 participants, the mean age was 42.2 y (SD = 15.6 y), and 58.4% were male. The most frequently reported difficult decisions were regarding housing and safety (75.1%). The mean DRS score was 28.8/100 (SD = 8.6). Factors associated with less decision regret included higher caregiver age, involvement of other family members in the decision-making process, wanting to receive information about the options, and considering organizations interested in the decision topic and health care professionals as trustworthy sources of information (all P < 0.001). Factors associated with more decision regret included mismatch between the caregiver's preferred option and the decision made, the involvement of spouses in the decision-making process, higher decisional conflict, and higher burden of care (all P < 0.001). Discussion. Decisions about housing and safety were the difficult decisions most frequently encountered by caregivers of older adults in this survey. Our results will inform future decision support interventions. This is one of the first studies to assess decision regret among caregivers of older adults receiving home and community care services and to identify their most frequent difficult decisions.Difficult decisions were most frequently about housing and safety. Most caregivers of older adults in all 10 provinces of Canada experienced decision regret.Factors associated with less decision regret included higher caregiver age, the involvement of other family members in the decision-making process, wanting to receive information about the options, considering organizations interested in the decision topic, and health care professionals as trustworthy sources of information.

This was a retrospective observational study of patients with COPD followed between August 2018 and July 2019. The patients were divided into two groups by the eosinophil count in peripheral blood: eosinophilic (≥ 300 cells/µL); and non-eosinophilic (< 300 cells/µL). Quantitative, automated assessments of emphysema and bronchial wall thickness were performed by evaluating computed tomography scans of the chest. We evaluated the records of 110 patients diagnosed with COPD: 28 (25.5%) in the eosinophilic group; and 82 (74.5%) in the non-eosinophilic group. The demographic, clinical, functional, and therapeutic variables were comparable between the two groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the emphysema score or bronchial wall thickness (p > 0.05 for both). Patients with eosinophilic COPD do not appear to have lower emphysema scores or greater bronchial wall thickening than do those with non-eosinophilic phenotypes of the disease.

COVID-19 vaccines and their boosters are life-saving developments that have helped prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. We conducted this study to assess the coverage of the booster dose in an Indian population (the third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in India is referred to as the booster or precautionary dose), record the reasons for not taking the booster dose, and determine the effectiveness of the booster. The levels of adherence to COVID-19 precautionary behavior was also assessed.  Methods We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study using convenient sampling via an online survey of 550 respondents older than 18 in the second quarter of 2022. The respondents were distributed among 18 states and union territories in India. The data were analyzed as simple proportions and percentages. Results Of the 550 respondents, 152 (27.6%) received the booster dose, indicating low coverage. A small percentage of respondents (7.2%) reported suffering from COVID-19 following the booster, of whom 91% were medical professionals. The most common reported reason for not taking the vaccine was that the respondents were not yet due for their dose (48.1%). The time between the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and the booster had no impact on infection rates. Men were less likely to adhere to COVID-19 precautionary behavior than women, despite similar vaccination rates. Conclusion The COVID-19 vaccine booster had a low acceptance in our study population, with roughly one-quarter of the population receiving the booster. The booster dose has been influential in the prevention of COVID-19. Most respondents followed behavioral safety measures despite the decline of active cases of COVID-19 in India following the Omicron wave. Our results indicate a need to strengthen public strategies to affect behavioral changes, such as improving India's Behavior Change Communication program to ensure adequate booster dose coverage.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Recently many pleiotropic actions of statins have been explored, but very few studies were done to explore statins' antinociceptive action; therefore, the current study was planned to evaluate the antinociceptive activity of Simvastatin in different pain models in mice. Antinociceptive activity of Simvastatin was evaluated by using Eddy's hot plate method (central analgesic model), acetic acid-induced writhing method (peripheral analgesic model), and biphasic formalin-induced paw licking method. Twenty-four mice were divided into four groups (n = 6 in each): Vehicle control group, simvastatin 5mg/kg, simvastatin 20mg/kg, and positive control group. In the hot plate method, as compared to the vehicle control group, Simvastatin 20mg/kg group showed a significant rise in the reaction time to the corresponding time interval (p<0.001). While the simvastatin 5mg/kg group did not show any significant analgesic activity in the hot plate test. In the acetic acid writhing method, both test groups show a significant delay in the onset of writhing and a decrease in the number of writhes as compared to the vehicle control group (P<0.001). While in the formalin test, both groups show dose-dependent analgesic activity in both the early and late phases. Simvastatin exhibits analgesic activity in both central as well as peripheral models of analgesia, but central analgesia shows only at higher concentrations. Similarly, it inhibits inflammatory pain more predominantly than neurogenic, and hence simvastatin can be used in inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis particularly when there is coexisting dyslipidemia.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

However, HL can rarely occur in the elderly population (≥60 years) and probably has different biology as compared to the younger counterparts. There was a paucity of data on the clinical and epidemiological profile of the elderly subset with HL in Indian patients who are misdiagnosed and empirically treated as tuberculosis. We have done an analysis of this subset of elderly patients who were registered at our institute. Methods A retrospective chart analysis of HL patients who presented to our center from 2008 to 2016 was conducted. Twenty-eight patients with HL of age ≥60 years were included in this study. Results Elderly HL comprised 18.67% of the total HL patients registered during this period. The majority were male patients, and the mean age of presentation was 65.9±5.6 years. A Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of ≥2 was seen in 30.77% of the patients. Among these, 84.62% of the patients presented with advanced-stage disease, and 57.69% of the patients presented with B symptoms, which was significantly associated with a high-risk international prognostic score (IPS). Histology-wise, mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (MCCHL) and nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (NSCHL) were equally represented (30.76%). Of the patients, 50% had extranodal disease, with the liver being the most frequent site involved. One patient each had bone marrow involvement and bulky disease.

We present the case of a 32-year-old male with uncontrolled hypertension, altered mental status, and left-sided weakness. He had a rapid neurological decline, and a computed tomography (CT) head showed blurring of gray-white matter interfaces in the right posterior parietal lobe, suggesting infarction or PRES.

Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a marker of proliferative capacity and inflammatory responsiveness but the impact of LTL on the prognosis in AS remains elusive. The aim of this study was to analyse the association of LTL with inflammatory markers and prognosis of pts undergoing TAVR. LTL was analysed using quantitative real-time PCR in 285 consecutive pts (median age 82 years) undergoing TAVR and correlated with 18-month all-cause mortality. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in pts with the longest LTL (P = 0.017), paralleled by increased procalcitonin (PCT) serum levels (P = 0.0006). This inflammatory reaction was accompanied by increased myeloid cells in the highest LTL tertile, mainly a rise in circulating neutrophils (P = 0.0025) and monocytes (P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed LTL (HR 2.6, 95%CI 1.4-5.1,  P= 0.004) and PCT levels (HR 4.3, 95%CI 1.7-11.0, P = 0.003) as independent predictors of mortality. Longer LTL is associated with increased mortality after TAVR. This might be explained by enhanced proliferative capacity of cells resulting in myeloid and systemic inflammation.

A review was performed on 20 patients who underwent the treatment, 16 having suffered from a chronic form of the condition, with the remaining 4 being afflicted with retronychia for less than a year prior to treatment. The treatment was a combination of eliminating the proximal sharp edge of the uppermost nail layer and thinning of the nail with fraises and drills of various sizes. This therapy was repeated every 7-14 days. The patients came for checkup every 6 weeks. Treatment duration varied from 2 to 14 months. The rate, at which the appearance of a healthy nail occurred depended on the length of the intact nail layer below the part of the nail affected by retronychia, the age of the patient, and cofactors such as obesity, diabetes, etc. The treatment result in our case study was completely healthy nail growth without relapse of retronychia in all the 20 patients for a follow-up period of 18 months. By combining a healthy nail growth and the simultaneous protection of the nail, we were able to achieve a normal nail in all cases. In order to maintain the achieved results, we recommended our patients to continue wearing protective tubes whenever they would wear closed shoes because recurrence of retronychia may occur even after minimal trauma.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

Our previous study found that the secretome of MSCs was significantly amplified by treatment with IFN-γ and TNF-α (IT). It has been known that macrophages are involved in the initiation and termination of inflammation, secretion of growth factors, phagocytosis, cell proliferation and collagen deposition in wound, which is the key factor during wound healing. In the present study, we used a unique supernatant of MSCs from human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) pretreated with IT, designated S-IT MSCs, to explore whether S-IT MSCs have a better effect on improving wound healing by improving the biological function of macrophages than the control supernatant of MSCs (S-MSCs). In the present study, we used a unique supernatant of MSCs pretreated with IT subcutaneously injected into a mice total skin excision. We evaluated the effect of S-IT MSCs on wound healing and the quality of wound repair via promoting macrophages migration and M2 polarization in vivo. In addition, the effect of S-IT MSCs on macrophages migration, converting toward M2 phenotype and phagocytosis were also investigated in vitro. Indeed, S-IT MSCs were found to be more potent in promoting macrophage migration, M2 polarization, phagocytosis, and promoting wound closure than S-MSCs during the wound repair. High levels of CCL2 and IL-6 were found in S-IT MSCs, which indicated that the optimization of macrophage function by S-IT MSCs may be achieved through their high expression of CCL2 and IL-6. Our results suggest that the beneficial paracrine effect of MSCs on wound healing can be amplified by pretreatment with IT, which may represent a new strategy for optimizing the therapeutic effect of MSCs on wound healing.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

The article objectives are to compare and explore the relationship between iodine sources and nutrition of pregnant women and adults. A total of 2,145 pregnant women and 1,660 adults were investigated by multi-stage random method. Questionnaire was used to collect basic information and the consumption of food, water, and iodine preparations. Household salt and individual urine and blood samples were collected, and thyroid function and morphology of pregnant women were measured. The median urinary iodine concentration (MUIC) of pregnant women (164.49 μg/L) was lower than adults (187.30 μg/L, p < 0.05). Iodine supplement with IS (iodized salt) was the main measure for pregnant women and adults, and the difference was mainly on the consumption of iodine preparations between pregnant women (5.19%) and adults (0.85%). Moreover, adults' dietary iodine intake from food (100.6 μg/day), IS (140.8 μg/day), and drinking water (6.0 μg/day) was higher than those of pregnant women (86.5, 107.2, and 3.5 μg/day, respectively). Compared with iodine supplement with IS, ISFP (IS + iodine-rich food + iodine preparations) could reduce the risk of iodine deficiency for pregnant women. The MUICs for pregnant women and adults of iodine supplements with IF (iodine-rich food) and ISF (IS + iodine-rich food) were lower. For pregnant women, thyroid nodule (11.90%) and peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) positive (9.32%) were high prevalent thyroid diseases, and habitation (urban/rural), gestation, annual income, and drinking water type would affect them. Pregnant women and adults had adequate iodine nutrition in four provinces. Their iodine supplement measures were different, the consumption of iodine preparations in pregnant women was higher, and their dietary iodine intake was lower than adults. ISFP was an effect measure for pregnant women to supplement iodine.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We aimed to analyse the characteristics of patients hospitalised because of ECOPD in a real-life setting using a big data approach. The study population included all patients over 40 years old with a diagnosis of COPD (n=69 359; prevalence 3.72%) registered from 1 January 2011 to 1 March 2020 in the database of the public healthcare service (SESCAM) of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) (n=1 863 759 subjects). We used natural language processing (Savana Manager version 3.0) to identify those who were hospitalised during this period for any cause, including ECOPD. During the study 26 453 COPD patients (38.1%) were hospitalised (at least once). Main diagnoses at discharge were respiratory infection (51%), heart failure (38%) or pneumonia (19%). ECOPD was the main diagnosis at discharge (or hospital death) in 8331 patients (12.0% of the entire COPD population and 31.5% of those hospitalised). In-hospital ECOPD-related mortality rate was 3.11%. These patients were hospitalised 2.36 times per patient, with a mean hospital stay of 6.1 days. Heart failure was the most frequent comorbidity in patients hospitalised because of ECOPD (52.6%). This analysis shows that, in a real-life setting, ECOPD hospitalisations are prevalent, complex (particularly in relation to heart failure), repetitive and associated with significant in-hospital mortality.","misc","christiaan","human_intervention"

First, a list of potential quality indicators was defined, followed by determination of the comparability (case-mix adjusted multilevel analysis) and discriminability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)). Second, focus group meetings were conducted with stakeholders (physical therapists and senior researchers) to select a core set of quality indicators. Overall, 229 physical therapists from 137 practices provided 2651 treatment episodes. Comparability: in 10 of the 11 case-mix adjusted models, the ICC increased compared with the intercept-only model. Discriminability: the ICC ranged between 0.01 and 0.34, with five of the 11 ICCs being >0.10. The majority of physical therapists in each focus group preferred the inclusion of seven quality indicators in the core set, including three process and four outcome indicators based upon the 6-min walk test (6MWT), the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ), and the determination of quadriceps strength using a hand-held dynamometer. This is the first study to describe the comparability and discriminability of the outcome-based quality indicators selected for patients with COPD treated in primary care physical therapy practices.

As the evidence for SLB versus complete ACL reconstruction remains unclear, this study aimed to compare the two techniques. This study's hypothesis was that SLB reconstruction allows better function and stability compared to complete ACL reconstruction. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane Library was conducted, identifying studies that compared SLB ('selective' group) versus complete ('complete' group) ACL reconstruction. Meta-analysis was conducted for post-operative functional scores, stability outcomes and complications as well as pre-operative to post-operative change. Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis, with 1107 patients and a pooled mean follow-up of 29.5 months. Post-operatively, the Selective group had significantly reduced anterior laxity, shown by a lower mean arthrometry side-to-side difference (p<0.01). Analysis of change results showed that the Selective group had a lower mean improvement in arthrometry side-to-side difference as well (p<0.01). No significant difference was shown for all other post-operative outcomes. This study provides valuable insight to the management of partial tears. It has demonstrated that the preservation of the intact bundle offers stability and function that is as good as complete reconstruction and that SLB is a potentially viable option in the management of partial tears.

To compare clinician-facing interventions to prevent unsafe opioid prescribing in opioid-naive primary care patients with acute noncancer pain. We conducted a multisite, cluster-randomized, 2 × 2 factorial, clinical trial in 3 health care systems that comprised 48 primary care practices and 525 participating clinicians from September 2018 through January 2021. Patient participants were opioid-naive outpatients, 18 years or older, who presented for a qualifying clinic visit with acute noncancer musculoskeletal pain or nonmigraine headache. Practices randomized to: (1) control; (2) opioid justification; (3) monthly clinician comparison emails; or (4) opioid justification and clinician comparison. All groups received opioid prescribing guidelines via the electronic health record at the time of a new opioid prescription. Primary outcome measures were receipt of an initial opioid prescription at the qualifying clinic visit. Other outcomes were opioid prescribing for more than 3 months and a concurrent opioid/benzodiazepine prescription over 12-month follow-up. Among 22 616 enrolled patient participants (9740 women [43.1%]; 64 American Indian/Alaska Native [0.3%]; 590 Asian [2.6%], 1120 Black/African American [5.0%], 1777 Hispanic [7.9%], 225 Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander [1.0%], and 18 981 White [83.9%] individuals), the initial opioid prescribing rates at the qualifying clinic visit were 3.1% in the total sample, 4.2% in control, 3.6% in opioid justification, 2.6% in clinician comparison, and 1.9% in opioid justification and clinician comparison. Compared with control, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for a new opioid prescription was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.46-1.18; P = .20) for opioid justification and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.38-0.96; P = .03) for clinician comparison. Compared with control, clinician comparison was associated with decreased odds of opioid therapy of more than 3 months (aOR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91; P = .001) and concurrent opioid/benzodiazepine prescription (aOR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-1.00; P = .04), whereas opioid justification did not have a significant effect. In this cluster randomized clinical trial, comparison emails decreased the proportion of opioid-naive patients with acute noncancer pain who received an opioid prescription, progressed to treatment with long-term opioid therapy, or were exposed to concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine therapy. Health care systems can consider adding clinician-targeted nudges to other initiatives as an efficient, scalable approach to further decrease potentially unsafe opioid prescribing.

"1984",35983691,"Role of Genes in Regulating Host Plants Expansion in Tephritid Fruit Flies (Diptera) and Potential for RNAi-Based Control.","Host plant expansion is an important survival strategy for tephritids as they expand their range. Successful host expansion requires tephritids to adapt to the chemical and nonchemical properties of a novel host fruit, such as fruit color, phenology, and phytochemicals. These plant properties trigger a series of processes in tephritids, with each process having its own genetic basis, which means that various genes are involved in regulating host plant expansion by tephritids. This review summarizes current knowledge on the categories and roles of genes involved in host plant expansion in several important tephritid species, including genes related to chemoreception (olfactory and gustation), vision, digestion, detoxification, development, ribosomal and energy metabolism. Chemoreception- and detoxification- and digestion-related genes are stimulated by volatile chemicals and secondary chemicals of different hosts, respectively, which are involved in the regulation of nervous signal transduction that triggers behavioral, physical, and chemical responses to the novel host fruit. Vision-, nerve-, and development-related genes and metabolism-associated genes are activated in response to nonchemical stimuli from different hosts, such as color and phenology, to regulate a comprehensive adaptation of the extending host for tephritids. The chemical and nonchemical signals of hosts activate ribosomal and energy-related genes that result in the basic regulation of many processes of host expansion, including detoxification and development. These genes do not regulate novel host use individually, but multiple genes regulate multilevel adaptation to novel host fruits via multiple mechanisms. These genes may also be potential target genes for RNAi-based control of tephritid pests.","misc","christiaan","misc"

We hypothesized that EVs released after trauma/hemorrhagic shock (HS) contribute to endotheliopathy and coagulopathy. To test this hypothesis, adoptive transfer experiments were performed to determine whether EVs derived from severely injured patients in shock were sufficient to induce endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathy. Methods: Total EVs were enriched from plasma of severely injured trauma/HS patients or minimally injured patients by ultracentrifugation and characterized for size and numbers. Under isoflurane anesthesia, noninjured naive C57BL/6J mice were administered EVs at varying concentrations and compared with mice receiving equal volume vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) or to mice receiving EVs from minimally injured patients. Thirty minutes after injection, mice were sacrificed, and blood was collected for thrombin generation (thrombin-antithrombin, thrombin-antithrombin complex [TAT] assay) and syndecan-1 by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Lungs were harvested for examination of histopathologic injury and costained with von Willebrand factor and fibrin to identify intravascular coagulation. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid was aspirated from lungs for protein measurement as an indicator of the endothelial permeability. Data are presented as mean ± SD, P < 0.05 was considered significant, and t test was used. Results: An initial proof-of-concept experiment was performed in naive mice receiving EVs purified from severely injured trauma/HS patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS], 34 ± 7) at different concentrations (5 × 106 to 3.1 × 109/100 μL/mouse) and compared with PBS (control) mice. Neither TAT nor syndecan-1 levels were significantly different between groups at 30 minutes after EV infusion. However, lung vascular permeability and histopathologic injury were significantly higher in the EV group, and lung tissues demonstrated intravascular fibrin deposition. Based on these data, EVs from severely injured trauma/HS patients (ISS, 32 ± 6) or EVs from minimally injured patients (ISS, 8 ± 3) were administered to naive mice at higher concentrations (1 × 109 to 1 × 1010 EV/100 μL/mouse). Compared with mice receiving EVs from minimally injured patients, plasma TAT and syndecan-1 levels were significantly higher in the trauma/HS EV group. Similarly, bronchial alveolar lavage protein and lung histopathologic injury were higher in the trauma/HS EV group, and lung tissues demonstrated enhanced intravascular fibrin deposition. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that trauma/HS results in the systemic release of EVs, which are capable of inducing endotheliopathy as demonstrated by elevated syndecan-1 and increased permeability and coagulopathy as demonstrated by increased TAT and intravascular fibrin deposition. Targeting trauma-induced EVs may represent a novel therapeutic strategy.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

Characterized by severe immune cell derangements, sepsis is often associated with multiorgan dysfunction. For many sepsis survivors, these deficits can persist long after clinical resolution of the underlying infection. Although many studies report on the impact of sepsis on individual immune cell subtypes, a comprehensive analysis of sepsis-induced alterations within and across the immune cell landscape is lacking. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to assess sepsis-associated transcriptional changes in immune cells isolated from bone marrow at single-cell resolution. We used a high-survival fecal-induced peritonitis sepsis model using Friend leukemia virus B mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing classified 3402 single cells from control subjects into 14 clusters representing long-term hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), short-term HSC, basophil, dendritic cell, eosinophil, erythroblast, erythrocyte, macrophage, neutrophil, natural killer cell, plasma cell, plasmacytoid dendritic cell, pre-B cell, and T memory cell lineages. One day following experimentally induced sepsis, cell type compositions shifted significantly and included notable decreases in HSC and myeloid cell abundance. In addition to proportional cell composition changes, acute sepsis induced significant transcriptional alterations in most immune cell types analyzed-changes that failed to completely resolve 1 month after sepsis. Taken together, we report widespread and persistent transcriptional changes in diverse immune cells in response to polymicrobial infection. This study will serve as a valuable resource for future work investigating acute and/or long-term sepsis-associated immune cell derangements.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

MicroRNAs (miRs) are associated with IVD degeneration. This study expounded the mechanism of microRNA (miR)-25-3p carried by extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in interleukin (IL)-1β-induced NP cell degeneration. Methods: Platelet-rich plasma from mouse blood was obtained, and EVs were isolated from PRP (EVs derived from PRP [PRP-EVs]) and identified. Nucleus pulposus cells were isolated from the mouse lumbar IVD and treated with IL-1β to induce NP cell degeneration. Extracellular vesicles derived from PRP were added into NP cell culture medium. Afterward, intracellular miR-25-3p, sex determining region Y-related high-mobility-group box 4 (SOX4), and CXC chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) levels were examined. Nucleus pulposus cell viability, apoptosis, and inflammation were detected. Extracellular vesicles derived from PRP were labeled by PKH67 to obverse the uptake of EVs by NP cells. The binding relations between SOX4 and miR-25-3p and CXCR7 were predicted and examined. Functional rescue experiments were performed to investigate the roles of miR-25-3p, SOX4, and CXCR7 in NP cell degeneration. Results: miR-25-3p was downregulated, whereas SOX4 and CXCR7 were upregulated in IL-1β-induced NP cells. Extracellular vesicles derived from PRP increased the cell viability, and decreased apoptosis and inflammation. miR-25-3p carried by PRP-EVs into NP cells alleviated NP cell degeneration. miR-25-3p inhibited SOX4 expression and limited CXCR7 transcription. Silencing miR-25-3p or overexpressing SOX4 or CXCR7 reversed the alleviating role of PRP-EVs in NP cell degeneration. Conclusion: miR-25-3p carried by PRP-EVs into NP cells elevated intracellular miR-25-3p expression, which suppressed SOX4 expression and further limited CXCR7 transcription, thus alleviating IL-1β-induced NP cell degeneration. Extracellular vesicles derived from PRP containing miR-25-3p may be a new method for IVD treatment.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"

The greenbug Schizaphis graminum is an important cereal aphid worldwide. However, the secreted effectors of S. graminum are still uncharacterized. Here, 76 salivary proteins were identified from the watery saliva of S. graminum using transcriptome and proteome analyses. Among them, a putative salivary effector Sg2204 was significantly up-regulated during aphid feeding stages, and transient overexpression of Sg2204 in Nicotiana benthamiana inhibited cell death induced by BAX or INF1. Delivering Sg2204 into wheat via the type III secretion system of Pseudomonas fluorescens EtAnH suppressed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI)-associated callose deposition. The transcript levels of jasmonic acid (JA)- and salicylic acid (SA)-associated defence genes of wheat were significantly down-regulated, and the contents of both JA and SA were also significantly decreased after delivery of Sg2204 into wheat leaves. Additionally, feeding on wheat expressing Sg2204 significantly increased the weight and fecundity of S. graminum and promoted aphid phloem feeding. Sg2204 was efficiently silenced via spray-based application of the nanocarrier-mediated transdermal dsRNA delivery system. Moreover, Sg2204-silenced aphids induced a stronger wheat defence response and resulted in negative impacts on aphid feeding behaviour, survival and fecundity. Silencing of Sg2204 homologues from four aphid species using nanocarrier-delivered dsRNA also significantly reduced aphid performance on host plants. Thus, our study characterized the salivary effector Sg2204 of S. graminum involved in promoting host susceptibility by suppressing wheat defence, which can also be regarded as a promising RNAi target for aphid control.","misc","christiaan","misc"

This study investigated patterns of structural disconnections associated with chronic language impairments using disconnectome maps. Seventy-six individuals with post-stroke aphasia underwent a battery of language assessments and a structural MRI scan. Support-vector regression disconnectome-symptom mapping analyses were performed to examine the correlations between disconnectome maps, representing the probability of disconnection at each white matter voxel and different language scores. To further understand whether significant disconnections were primarily representing focal damage or a more extended network of seemingly preserved but disconnected areas beyond the lesion site, results were qualitatively compared to support-vector regression lesion-symptom mapping analyses. Part of the left white matter perisylvian network was similarly disconnected in 90% of the individuals with aphasia. Surrounding this common left perisylvian disconnectome, specific structural disconnections in the left fronto-temporo-parietal network were significantly associated with aphasia severity and with lower performance in auditory comprehension, syntactic comprehension, syntactic production, repetition and naming tasks. Auditory comprehension, repetition and syntactic processing deficits were related to disconnections in areas that overlapped with and extended beyond lesion sites significant in SVR-LSM analyses. In contrast, overall language abilities as measured by aphasia severity and naming seemed to be mostly explained by focal damage at the level of the insular and central opercular cortices, given the high overlap between SVR-DSM and SVR-LSM results for these scores. While focal damage seems to be sufficient to explain broad measures of language performance, the structural disconnections between language areas provide additional information on the neural basis of specific and persistent language impairments at the chronic stage beyond lesion volume. Leveraging routinely available clinical data, disconnectome mapping furthers our understanding of anatomical connectivity constraints that may limit the recovery of some language abilities in chronic post-stroke aphasia.","misc","christiaan","misc"
"1991",35985127,"Two- and three-dimensional piezoelectric scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.","The incidence of bone disorders worldwide is increasing. For this reason, new and more effective strategies for bone repair are needed. The most common strategy used for cell regeneration relies in biochemical stimulation while biophysical stimulation using mechanical, and electrical cues is a promising, however, still under-investigated field. This work reports on the development of piezoelectric 2D and 3D porous scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration strategies. While the porous scaffolds mimic the bone's structure, the piezoelectric activity of the scaffolds mimics the bone mechano-electric microenvironment. The piezoelectric activity is related to the electroactive β-phase of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in the scaffolds and was dynamically stimulated by cell culture in a custom-made mechanical bioreactor. These two factors combined provide an effective biomimetic environment for the proliferation of preosteoblasts. The electromechanically-responsive scaffolds are found to promote the enhancement of proliferation rate of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells in about 20 % as well as an improved adhesion and proliferation over the materials, mainly when dynamically stimulated. These results prove that local piezoelectric effect, as the one existing in bone tissue, allows effective cell proliferation, which could be further translated in more efficient strategies for bone tissue regeneration.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Hip circumference decreased (p = 0.009) during the study period, and the 6-m walking speed increased (p = 0.001) in women in the intervention group. In contrast, 6-m walking speed, 6-min walking distance and handgrip strength were significantly improved in men in the intervention group, but increased total body fat percentage (p = 0.038) and decreased mid-thigh cross-muscle area (CMA) (p = 0.007) were observed in the control group. Compared to the control group, the 12-week interval change in the percentage of mid-thigh CMA was maintained in men in the intervention group but was significantly decreased in the control group (p = 0.03, 95% CI:0.002-0.05). Oligonol supplementation (200 mg per day) significantly improved physical performance and muscle mass in men. Further studies are needed to confirm the potential favorable effects of oligonol® supplementation.","randomized_trial","christiaan","randomized_trial"

The role of TPTEP1 in gastric cancer has not been reported. Wound healing assay and transwell assay analysis TPTEP1/miR-548d-3p/KLF9/PER1 effect on migration and invasiveness of gastric cells. Western blot and RT-qPCR certificate TPTEP1/miR-548d-3p/KLF9/PER1transcription and expression of migration and invasion related genes. Luciferase assay was used to determine the adsorption of miR-548d-3p by TPTEP1 sponge, the targeting of miR-548d-3p to KLF9, and the binding of KLF9 to the promoter of PER1. immunohistochemical assay and H&E staining prove the function of TPTEP1 and miR-548d-3p in nude mice model of gastric cancer. TPTEP1 inhibited its expression by sponge adsorption of miR-548d-3p. miR-548d-3p targets KLF9 3'UTR to inhibit its expression, and KLF9 binds to the PER1 promoter to promote its expression.TPTEP1/KLF9/PER1 inhibits gastric cancer cell migration and invasion, and miR-548d-3p does the opposite. Our data suggest that TPTEP1 affects gastric cancer progression by regulating the miR-548d-3p/KLF9/PER1 axis. Targeting this pathway may provide new therapeutic opportunities for gastric cancer.","rodent","christiaan","rodent"
"1995",35985722,"Challenges to Telehealth: What Was Learned from Families of Children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders.","Children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are a vulnerable population diagnosed as having an impairment of the central nervous system caused by genetic, metabolic, toxic or traumatic factors. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic children with NDD benefitted from the swift transition to telehealth. Most found telehealth favorable but some encountered challenges with accessibility and technology. Racial disparity was found with accessibility challenges by marginalized groups within this already vulnerable population. Telehealth use should continue to be utilized by children with NDD but clinicians should be aware of how to address challenges.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Although Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) experience the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, mistrust and historical unethical research and medical practices continue to preclude this population from getting the vaccine. This article urges clinicians to subscribe to development and application of cultural intelligence to understand the impact of structural racism and cultural considerations of BIPOC to partner in strategy development.","misc","christiaan","misc"

Race, frequently taught as an impartial risk factor for disease, is a facilitator of structural inequities stemming from racist policies. Nursing educators must help students understand the impact of structural racism on patient populations, communities, and society at large. This article illustrates the face of structural racism, highlights how structural racism impacts health care outcomes, and provides meaningful ways for educators to unmute racism and facilitate race-related discourse in the classroom to counter the impact of structural racism on health equity.","misc","christiaan","misc"
