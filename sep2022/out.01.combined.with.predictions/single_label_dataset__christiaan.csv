How to cope with breech delivery (vaginal or C-section) has been discussed to find the safest in terms of morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess the risks of foetal and maternal mortality and perinatal morbidity associated with vaginal delivery against elective caesarean in breech presentations, as reported in observational studies. Studies assessing perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with breech presentations births. Cochrane, Medline, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cuiden databases were consulted. This protocol was registered in PROSPERO CRD42020197598. Selection criteria were: years between 2010 and 2020, in English language, and full-term gestation (37-42 weeks). The methodological quality of the eligible articles was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analyses were performed to study each parameter related to neonatal mortality and maternal morbidity. The meta-analysis included 94 285 births with breech presentation. The relative risk of perinatal mortality was 5.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.61-11.51) times higher in the vaginal delivery group, 4.12 (95% CI = 2.46-6.89) for birth trauma and 3.33 (95% CI = 1.95-5.67) for Apgar results. Maternal morbidity showed a relative risk 0.30 (95% CI = 0.13-0.67) times higher in the planned caesarean group. An increment in the risk of perinatal mortality, birth trauma, and Apgar lower than 7 was identified in planned vaginal delivery. However, the risk of severe maternal morbidity because of complications of a planned caesarean was slightly higher.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

However, little is known about the effects of tobacco smoking on CVD in patients with SLE. To systematically review and summarize the available literature regarding the effects of tobacco smoking on developing CVD in patients with SLE. We retrieved relevant studies from the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) database. Two reviewers independently reviewed the eligible studies, assessed their validity, and extracted relevant data. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to distinguish sources of heterogeneity. A total of 10 studies, which comprised 6984 participants, were included in the analysis. The overall quality of evidence was rated as moderate to low. The smoking prevalence among CVD patients was 39.28% (271/690), which was higher than 31.36% (1974/6294) among non-CVD patients. Compared with never-smokers, the risk of developing CVD in current smokers was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.21-1.66). No significant publication bias was found in our meta-analysis. In spite of the several negative results, this study found that current smokers with SLE have an increased risk of developing CVD, although most of the included studies were in low-to-moderate quality. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42022338109.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

In part 1, a systematic search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus and SPORTDiscus (EBSCOhost) was undertaken from the earliest records to January 2021. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020, the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews, and the PRISMA extension protocols were followed. In part 2, 31 international experts in women's rugby (ie, elite players, sports scientists, medical clinicians, sports administrators) participated in a three-round Delphi consensus method. These experts reviewed the findings from part 1 and subsequently provided a list of priority research topics in women's rugby. Research topics were grouped into expert-based themes and expert-based subthemes via content analysis. Expert-based themes and expert-based subthemes were ranked from very low to very high research priority on a 1-5 Likert scale. Consensus was defined by ≥70% agreement. The median research priority agreement and IQR were calculated for each expert-based theme and subtheme. PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus and SPORTDiscus (EBSCOhost). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated applied sports science or sports medicine in women's rugby. In part 1, the systematic scoping review identified 123 studies, which were categorised into six sports science and sports medicine evidence-based themes: injury (n=48), physical performance (n=32), match characteristics (n=26), fatigue and recovery (n=6), nutrition (n=6), and psychology (n=5). In part 2, the Delphi method resulted in three expert-based themes achieving consensus on future research priority in women's rugby: injury (5.0 (1.0)), female health (4.0 (1.0)) and physical performance (4.0 (1.0)). This two-part systematic scoping review and Delphi consensus is the first study to summarise the applied sports science and sports medicine evidence base in women's rugby and establish future research priorities. The summary tables from part 1 provide valuable reference information for researchers and practitioners. The three expert-based themes that achieved consensus in part 2 (injury, female health and physical performance) provide clear direction and guidance on future research priorities in women's rugby. The findings of this two-part study facilitate efficient and coordinated use of scientific resources towards high-priority research themes relevant to a wide range of stakeholders in women's rugby.","systematic_review","christiaan"

Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of rTMS in restoring motor function. This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the current evidence of the effect of rTMS in improving upper limb function and fine motor recovery in stroke patients. Three online databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase) were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials. A total of 45 studies (combined n = 2064) were included. Random effects model was used for meta-analysis and effect size was reported as standardized mean difference (SMD). rTMS was effective in improving fine motor function in stroke patients (SMD, 0.38; 95% CI 0.19-0.58; P = 0). On subgroup analyses, for post-stroke functional improvement of the upper extremity, bilateral hemisphere stimulation was more effective than unilateral stimulation during the acute phase of stroke, and a regimen of 20 rTMS sessions produced greater improvement than <20 sessions. In the subacute phase of stroke, affected hemispheric stimulation with a 40-session rTMS regimen was superior to unaffected hemispheric stimulation or bilateral hemispheric stimulation with <40 sessions. Unaffected site stimulation with a 10-session rTMS regimen produced significant improvement in the chronic phase compared to affected side stimulation and bilateral stimulation with >10 rTMS sessions. For the rTMS stimulation method, both TBS and rTMS were found to be significantly more effective in the acute phase of stroke, but TBS was more effective than rTMS. However, rTMS was found to be more effective than TBS stimulation in patients in the subacute and chronic phases of stroke. rTMS significantly improved upper limb and fine function in the short term (0-1-month post-intervention) and medium term (2-5 months), but not for upper limb function in the long term (6 months+). The results should be interpreted with caution due to significant heterogeneity. This updated meta-analysis provides robust evidence of the efficacy of rTMS treatment in improving upper extremity and fine function during various phases of stroke. https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2022-5-0121/, identifier: INPLASY202250121.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

Several high-quality observational studies have been published following a prior systematic review with only one study included. Consequently, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively investigate the relationship between DAL and cancer risk and prognosis. A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception to 26 October 2021. Summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs were calculated using a random-effects model. Publication bias, subgroup, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Ten observational studies (six cohorts and four case-control studies) with 227,253 participants were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The summary RRs revealed a statistically significant associations between DAL and cancer risk (RR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.23-2.05, I 2 = 71.9%, n = 7) and prognosis (RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.10-2.13, I 2 = 77.1%, n = 3). No evidence of publication bias was observed in the current analysis. Positive associations were observed in most subgroup analyses stratified by predefined factors, including region, study design, study quality, study population, participants' gender, age of participants, cancer type, DAL assessment indicator, and adjustment of potential confounding parameters. No evidence of heterogeneity between subgroups was indicated by meta-regression analyses. The high DAL might be associated with an increased risk of cancer, as well as a poor prognosis of cancer. More high-quality prospective studies are warranted to further determine the associations between DAL and risk and prognosis for specific cancers.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of remotely delivered intervention on loneliness using a systematic review and meta-analysis. The PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (EBSCO) databases were searched for studies, the search ended on 7 July 2021. Thirteen randomized controlled trials of remotely delivered intervention compared with usual care, brief contact, or no intervention for loneliness were included. A random-effects model measured estimation of loneliness reduction. Furthermore, standardized mean differences (SMDs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), publication bias, and heterogeneity were calculated. Subgroup analysis was used to explore the factors that might affect the treatment effects. The evidence of remotely delivered intervention on loneliness reduction was certain (SMD = -0.41 [95% CI, -0.70 to -0.13]). Media subgroup analysis supported the effectiveness of intervention delivered by video call (SMD = -0.54 [95% CI, -0.83 to -0.25]); treatment strategy subgroup analysis found evidence to support the effectiveness of increasing social support and maladaptive social cognition treatment strategy (SMD = -0.47 [95% CI, -0.77 to -0.18] and SMD = -1.04 [95% CI, -1.98 to -0.10], respectively); participants subgroup analysis shown the effectiveness of intervention for older adults living in LTC and social isolation (SMD = -1.40 [95% CI, -2.43 to -0.36] and SMD = -0.55 [95% CI, -0.74 to -0.36], respectively); group format subgroup analysis testified the effectiveness of intervention carried out in individual format (SMD = -0.39 [95% CI, -0.71 to -0.07]); measurement time points subgroup analysis found the positive effect of intervention at 3 months and 3 to 6 months stage (SMD = -0.33 [95% CI, -0.52 to -0.14] and SMD = -0.32 [95% CI, -0.57 to -0.07], respectively). Significant publication bias was detected (p < 0.05), and the heterogeneity of the studies was substantial. This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that remotely delivered intervention can reduce loneliness in older adults, and it appears to be affected by media type, treatment strategy, participants characteristics, group format, and measurement time points.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the safety and effect of HEN compared with normal oral diet (NOD) in postoperative patients with esophageal cancer (EC). EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were used to search articles in English-language journals. The intervention effect was expressed using risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcome measures, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The chi-square test and I-square test were used to test heterogeneity among studies. Four studies were eventually included in this meta-analysis. Compared with NOD, HEN has a favorable impact on postoperative body mass index (BMI) (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.09-1.30, P = 0.02), lean body mass (LBM) (WMD = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.04-1.48, P = 0.04), and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) (WMD = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.02-0.58, P = 0.03).

The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the diagnostic utility of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in suspected empyema cases to identify staphylococcal strains and avoid unnecessary empiric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) therapy. From inception to July 24, 2021, relevant records were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The quality of studies was determined using the QUADAS-2 tool. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve for NAAT's diagnostic performance were evaluated using an HSROC model. Eight studies comprising 424 samples evaluated NAAT accuracy for Staphylococcus aureus (SA) identification, while four studies comprising 317 samples evaluated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) identification. The pooled NAAT summary estimates for detection of both SA (sensitivity: 0.35 (95% CI 0.19-0.55), specificity: 0.95 (95% CI 0.92-0.97), PLR: 7.92 (95% CI 4.98-12.59), NLR: 0.44 (95% CI 0.14-1.46), and DOR: 24.0 (95% CI 6.59-87.61) ) and MRSA (sensitivity: 0.45 (95% CI 0.15-0.78), specificity: 0.93 (95% CI 0.89-0.95), PLR: 10.06 (95% CI 1.49-67.69), NLR: 0.69 (95% CI 0.41-1.15), and DOR: 27.18 (95% CI 2.97-248.6) ) were comparable. The I 2 statistical scores for MRSA and SA identification sensitivity were 13.7% and 74.9%, respectively, indicating mild to substantial heterogeneity. PCR was frequently used among NAA tests, and its diagnostic accuracy coincided well with the overall summary estimates. A meta-regression and subgroup analysis of country, setting, study design, patient selection, and sample condition could not explain the heterogeneity (meta-regression P = 0.66, P = 0.46, P = 0.98, P = 0.68, and P = 0.79, respectively) in diagnostic effectiveness. Our study suggested that the diagnostic accuracy of NAA tests is currently inadequate to substitute culture as a principal screening test. NAAT could be used in conjunction with microbiological culture due to the advantage of faster results and in situations where culture tests are not doable.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

"17",35979154,"Update on the limited sensitivity of computed tomography relative to RT-PCR for COVID-19: a systematic review.","The global and ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has compelled the need for timely and reliable methods of detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been widely accepted as a reference standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, several early studies have suggested the superior sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a previous systematic review, we stratified studies based on risk for bias to evaluate the true sensitivity of CT for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study revisits our prior analysis, incorporating more current data to assess the sensitivity of CT for COVID-19. The PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for relevant articles published between 1 January 2020, and 25 April 2021. Exclusion criteria included lack of specification regarding whether the study cohort was adult or paediatric, whether patients were symptomatic or asymptomatic, and not identifying the source of RT-PCR specimens. Ultimately, 62 studies were included for systematic review and were subsequently stratified by risk for bias using the QUADAS-2 quality assessment tool. Sensitivity data were extracted for random effects meta-analyses. The average sensitivity for COVID-19 reported by the high-risk-of-bias studies was 68% [CI: 58, 80; range: 38-96%] for RT-PCR and 91% [CI: 87, 96; range: 47-100%] for CT. The average sensitivity reported by the low-risk-of-bias studies was 84% [CI: 0.75, 0.94; range: 70-97%] for RT-PCR and 78% [CI: 71, 0.86; range: 44-92%] for CT. On average, the high-risk-of bias studies underestimated the sensitivity of RT-PCR and overestimated the sensitivity of CT for COVID-19. Given the incorporation of recently published low-risk-of-bias articles, the sensitivities according to low-risk-of-bias studies for both RT-PCR and CT were higher than previously reported.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

The spectrum of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 ranges from mild to life-threatening forms. Alteration of hepatic function in COVID-19 is multifactorial. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced hepatic dysfunction and the clinical outcome in patients infected with COVID-19. We methodically explored several electronic databases (PubMed, PubMed Central, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar) in April 2022 using focused words and terms of medical subject headings for appropriate studies. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for conducting our systematic review. Hepatic dysfunction was identified as elevation of liver function tests (LFTs) above the upper limit of normal. The clinical outcome was described as a combination of mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, and the need for mechanical ventilation (MV). The initial search yielded a total of 7187 studies. After elimination of duplicates, exclusion of studies based on irrelevant titles and abstracts, comprehensive analysis of full-text formats, and evaluation of quality, a total of 16 studies were eligible to be included in our systematic review. In the 16 selected studies, there were 23,962 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can negatively affect several organ systems by interacting with specific receptors widely expressed in the human body. A multifactorial etiology of hepatic dysfunction is observed in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with abnormal LFTs. Significantly higher mortality, ICU admissions, and requirement for MV are associated with LFT alterations. For this reason, patients infected with COVID-19 must have their hepatic function closely monitored.","systematic_review","christiaan"
"20",35968439,"Effects of traditional Chinese mind-body exercise-Baduanjin for type 2 diabetes on psychological well-being: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","Type 2 diabetes is considered one of the most psychologically demanding chronic conditions. Patients suffering from this disease often have poor psychological well-being due to emotional stress. Baduanjin exercises, a traditional Chinese mind-body exercise, are used in the management of type 2 diabetes, especially for mental health. However, the effect of Baduanjin exercises on psychological well-being of patients with type 2 diabetes maintains controversial. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effects on psychological well-being of Baduanjin exercises for type 2 diabetes. Six electronic databases were searched from their inception to March 2022 for randomized controlled trials of Baduanjin exercises for type 2 diabetes. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality based on PEDro scale. The subgroup analysis was conducted based on different control interventions. The Cochran Q statistic and I 2 were applied to assess the heterogeneity. Twenty-seven studies between 2005 and 2019 were included in our review. Most of them exceeded the cutoff score 6 based on the PEDro scale. In psychological well-being, the aggregated results indicated that Baduanjin exercises showed positive effects in psychological well-being (SMD, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.36; p < 0.00001), depression (SMD, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.97; p = 0.03), anxiety (SMD, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.46; p = 0.003), and mental health (SMD, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.02; p < 0.00001). In glycemic control, Baduanjin exercises showed better improvements in FBG (SMD, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.72; p < 0.00001), HbA1c (SMD, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.75; p < 0.00001), and 2-hPBG (SMD, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.03; p = 0.02) compared with usual care/education. However, Baduanjin exercises only showed better improvements in HbA1c when compared with other exercises.

This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to explore the effect of lifestyle intervention during pregnancy in women with GDM on the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched by 1st April 2022. Data were pooled as the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs of neonatal hypoglycemia. Random-effects, subgroup analyses, meta-regression analysis, and leave-one-out analysis were conducted, involving 18 RCTs. Prenatal lifestyle intervention could significantly reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia (RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.98, P = 0.037). Subgroup analysis further demonstrated that the reduced risk of neonatal hypoglycemia was observed only when subjects were younger than 30 years, initiated before the third trimester, and with dietary intervention. Meta-regression analysis revealed that the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia post lifestyle intervention was lower in mothers with lower fasting glucose levels at trial entry. We found that prenatal lifestyle intervention in women with GDM significantly reduced the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Only lifestyle intervention before the third trimester of pregnancy, or dietary intervention only could effectively reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Future studies are required to explore the best pattern of lifestyle intervention and to determine the proper diagnostic criteria of GDM in the first/second trimester of pregnancy. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/#myprospero, PROSPERO, identifier: CRD42021272985.","meta_analysis","christiaan"
"22",35967772,"Association between the mediterranean diet and cognitive health among healthy adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","An increasing prevalence of cognitive disorders warrants comprehensive systematic reviews on the effect of diet on cognitive health. Studies have suggested that the Mediterranean (MeDi) diet has protective effects against metabolic diseases. However, comprehensive systematic reviews on the effect of the MeDi diet on the cognitive decline are limited. We investigated whether adherence to the MeDi diet could lower the risk of the cognitive disorder or improve cognitive function in older adults. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to June 2021. Cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The effect sizes were estimated as log risk ratios and standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The Newcastle-Ottawa score and Cochrane Collaboration's tool were used to assess the risk of bias in cohort studies and RCTs, respectively. Of the 1,687 screened studies, 31 cohort studies and five RCTs met the eligibility criteria for qualitative analysis; 26 cohort studies and two RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. In the cohort studies, high adherence to the MeDi diet was associated with lower risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [risk ratio (RR) = 0.75 (0.66-0.86)], and Alzheimer's disease (AD) [RR = 0.71 (0.56-0.89)]. In the RCTs, high adherence to the MeDi diet was associated with better episodic [SMD = 0.20 (0.09-0.30)] and working memories [SMD = 0.17 (0.01-0.32)] than lowest group. Adherence to the MeDi diet may reduce the risk of MCI and AD. However, other associations with cognitive outcomes (global cognition, working memory, and episodic memory) remain open to interpretation. Overall, the MeDi diet is recommended to prevent or delay cognitive disorders and improve cognitive function. Further, long-term RCTs are warranted to strengthen the evidence.

"23",35967781,"Association between vitamins and risk of brain tumors: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies.","Brain tumor is one of the important causes of cancer mortality, and the prognosis is poor. Therefore, early prevention of brain tumors is the key to reducing mortality due to brain tumors. This review aims to quantitatively evaluate the association between vitamins and brain tumors by meta-analysis. We searched articles on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases from inception to 19 December 2021. According to heterogeneity, the fixed-effects model or random-effects model was selected to obtain the relative risk of the merger. Based on the methods described by Greenland and Longnecker, we explored the dose-response relationship between vitamins and the risk of brain tumors. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were also used for the analysis. The study reviewed 23 articles, including 1,347,426 controls and 6,449 brain tumor patients. This study included vitamin intake and circulating concentration. For intake, it mainly included vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin E, β-carotene, and folate. For circulating concentrations, it mainly included vitamin E and vitamin D in the serum (25-hydroxyvitamin D and α-tocopherol). For vitamin intake, compared with the lowest intakes, the highest intakes of vitamin C (RR = 0.81, 95%CI:0.66-0.99, I 2 = 54.7%, P for heterogeneity = 0.007), β-carotene (RR = 0.78, 95%CI:0.66-0.93, I 2 = 0, P for heterogeneity = 0.460), and folate (RR = 0.66, 95%CI:0.55-0.80, I 2 = 0, P for heterogeneity = 0.661) significantly reduced the risk of brain tumors. For serum vitamins, compared with the lowest concentrations, the highest concentrations of serum α-tocopherol (RR = 0.61, 95%CI:0.44-0.86, I 2 = 0, P for heterogeneity = 0.656) significantly reduced the risk of brain tumors. The results of the dose-response relationship showed that increasing the intake of 100 μg folate per day reduced the risk of brain tumors by 7% (P -nonlinearity = 0.534, RR = 0.93, 95%CI:0.90-0.96). Our analysis suggests that the intake of vitamin C, β-carotene, and folate can reduce the risk of brain tumors, while high serum α-tocopherol concentration also has a protective effect on brain tumors. Therefore, vitamins may provide new ideas for the prevention of brain tumors. PROSPERO, identifier CRD42022300683.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

However, high HCV reinfection rates have been reported among the high-risk population. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the HCV reinfection rate after successful treatment of HIV-1 coinfected MSM populations. Bibliographic databases were searched and a random-effect model was utilized to calculate the pooled HCV reinfection rate. Sub-group and meta-regression were used to explore heterogeneity among selected studies. A funnel plot and Egger's regression test were performed to estimate the publication bias. Sixteen studies with 9,017.2 person-years (PY) follow-up were included. The overall HCV reinfection rate following successful treatment among HIV-1-infected MSM was 5.27/100 PY (95% CI, 3.98, 6.96). Lower reinfection rates were observed in developed parts of Europe (5.28/100 PY; 95% CI, 3.73, 6.84) and North America (3.92/100 PY; 95% CI, 1.67, 6.17). Reinfection rates among people with HCV test intervals of fewer than 6 months (7.59/100 PY; 95% CI: 5.15, 10.03) were significantly higher than those with more than 6 months test interval (2.88/100 PY; 95% CI: 2.26, 3.50), with an adjusted RR of 1.86 (95% CI, 1.06, 3.13). The adjusted study factors explained 91.03% the of studies' heterogeneity. HCV reinfection rate was high in successfully treated MSM who were coinfected with HIV-1. A shorter HCV test interval may help to explore more HCV reinfections. HCV reinfection rate studies from HIV-1 coinfected MSM in underdeveloped countries are urgently needed.

A total of 13 articles were extracted from four main databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science from the onset of 2000 to January 2021. All studies published in English with the purpose of examining quality of life (QOL) among patients with BD or investigating its main determinants were included. Totally, 1137 BD patients participated in 13 studies. Based on random effect analysis, the total score of physical health-related QOL was 46.7 (95% CI=41.26 to 52.13) and the total score of mental health-related QOL was 49.01 (95% CI=43.83 to 54.18) representing a moderate level of QOL among BD patients. Furthermore, weighted effect size analyses showed a significant correlation between QOL and variables such as patients' age, gender, disease duration and depression (pvalue: 0.00). As the symptoms of BD worsen over time, patients confront with more severe body pain, mobility restrictions, and difficulties in chewing, eating, speaking and swallowing which negatively affect social interactions of patients and reduce their QOL. Furthermore, depression was proved to act as a deteriorating factor for Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) among BD patients. Thus, patients need to be psychologically supported by a specialized team and be informed during the course of treatment to gain useful information about the disease, treatment approaches and coping strategies.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

This study was designed using the network meta-analysis (NMA) framework to provide a comparison of the different available options for the treatment of men with mCSPC. A systematic search was performed and the prospective randomized controlled trials reporting the overall survival (OS) or failure-free survival (FFS) were selected for review. A total of 14 studies were included in the NMA. The addition of abiraterone, apalutamide, docetaxel, and docetaxel with zoledronic acid to the androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) demonstrated a significant improvement in the OS. In indirect comparison, abiraterone had a higher impact on the OS as compared to docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.46) and docetaxel with zoledronic acid (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.05-1.63) but not apalutamide. Furthermore, apalutamide was not different than docetaxel or docetaxel with zoledronic acid. There was a significant improvement in the FFS with the combination of abiraterone, apalutamide, docetaxel (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.46-0.81), docetaxel with zoledronic acid (HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.9), and enzalutamide (HR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.25-0.61) as compared to the ADT alone. Similar to the indirect comparison of OS, abiraterone outperformed docetaxel (HR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.12-2.47), docetaxel with zoledronic acid (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.06-2.68), and enzalutamide (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.63-1.80), but not apalutamide in terms of impact on the FFS.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of infection due to being directly involved in diagnosing and taking care of patients. Due to this, they were prioritized to receive the initial supply of vaccines. However, vaccine hesitancy has been identified as a major global public health threat. Therefore, this review aimed to synthesize pieces of evidence on the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and determinate factors among HCWs. A systematic search of published articles was identified using PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for relevant studies of vaccine acceptance and determinant factors among HCWs. Published articles were identified using abstracts and titles of the articles, and articles were assessed for eligibility criteria. The review process was conducted according to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). An electronic database search identified 365 articles, from which 33 full-text articles were included in the systematic review. In this review, the highest rate of vaccine acceptance was reported at 95% and the lowest rate of vaccine acceptance was found at 21%. Factors such as sex (male), age, profession (medical doctors), and previous influenza vaccination were the main positive predictors for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among HCWs. Concerns about vaccine safety, efficacy, and effectiveness were the main barriers and drivers for vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, to improve the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among HCWs, governments, public health authorities, and private healthcare systems should work together to provide continuous professional development and training on the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine.","systematic_review","christiaan"
"35",35971374,"An Integrative Comparative Study Between Digoxin and Amiodarone as an Emergency Treatment for Patients With Atrial Fibrillation With Evidence of Heart Failure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","The emergency treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) involves utilizing two strategies. The first strategy normally involves permitting the atrial fibrillation to persevere as the ventricular rate is controlled. The other method involves utilizing anti-arrhythmic drugs in cardioversion and attempting to maintain sinus rhythm. Different pharmacological treatments, including digoxin and amiodarone, have been used to manage AF. A literature review on amiodarone and digoxin in the treatment of AF among patients with heart failure (HF) has shown that both drugs have potential risks. Therefore, we are conducting this systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of amiodarone and digoxin in the treatment of AF among patients with evidence of HF. A literature search of relevant articles was conducted on six electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar) from 2000 to 2022. The search yielded seven studies that had met the inclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis of four studies showed that there was no significant difference in the reduction of heart rate after treatment with either amiodarone or digoxin (mean difference (MD): -5.44; 95% confidence interval (CI): -9.53 to -1.34; I2 = 25%; p = 0.26). On the other hand, the statistical analysis showed that amiodarone had a better effect on the conversion to sinus rhythm than digoxin (63% versus 35%, respectively). Based on evidence from our meta-analysis, the clinical effect of amiodarone and digoxin in the emergency treatment of AF on heart rate control was unclear. However, amiodarone has a significant impact on the restoration of sinus rhythm compared with digoxin and can be considered the first-line drug regimen in conversion to sinus rhythm for AF patients with evidence of heart failure. However, the use of amiodarone and digoxin is complicated by adverse events and all-cause mortality.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

This study ought to compare the efficacy, safety, and effectiveness between HPSD and conventional settings. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched. Studies that compared HPSD and conventional radiofrequency ablation settings in AF patients were included while studies performed additional ablations on nonpulmonary vein targets without clear recording were excluded. Data were pooled with random-effect model. Efficacy endpoints include first-pass pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), acute pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection, free from AF, and free from atrial tachycardia (AT) during follow-up. Safety endpoints include esophagus injury rate and major complication rate. Effectiveness endpoints include complete PVI rate, total procedure time, PVI time, and PVI radiofrequency ablation (PVI RF) time. We included 22 studies with 3867 atrial fibrillation patients in total (2393 patients received HPSD radiofrequency ablation). Perioperatively, the HPSD group showed a higher first-pass PVI rate (risk ratio, RR = 1.10, P = 0.0001) and less acute PV reconnection rate (RR = 0.56, P = 0.0004) than the conventional group. During follow-up, free from AF (RR = 1.11, P = 0.16) or AT (RR = 1.06, P = 0.24) rate did not differ between HPSD and conventional groups 6-month postsurgery. However, the HPSD group showed both higher free from AF (RR = 1.17, P = 0.0003) and AT (RR = 1.11, P < 0.0001) rate than the conventional group 12-month postsurgery. The esophagus injury (RR = 0.99, P = 0.98) and major complications (RR = 0.76, P = 0.70) rates did not differ between the two groups. The HPSD group took shorter total procedure time (MD = -33.71 95% CI: -43.10 to -24.33, P < 0.00001), PVI time (MD = -21.60 95% CI: -25.00 to -18.21, P < 0.00001), and PVI RF time (MD = -13.72, 95% CI: -14.45 to -13.00, P < 0.00001) than conventional groups while complete procedure rate did not differ between two groups (RR = 1.00, P = 0.93).

It is still unknown whether azygos vein preservation will increase the difficulty or time of operation and reduce the quality of anastomosis. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to explore the puzzle. Two researchers independently searched the databases. Randomized controlled trials were included if these studies applied thoracotomy to perform operations and compared the outcomes in patients with EA/TEF between azygos vein preservation groups and azygos vein ligation groups. The Jadad score was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the I 2 value. A fixed or random-effect model was applied regarding the I 2 value. Four studies involving 286 patients were included. The pooled estimates indicated that preservation of the azygos vein decreased the incidence of anatomic leakage with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 0.54 (95% CI 0.29-0.99, P = 0.05) and mortality with an RR of 0.51 (95% CI 0.29-0.90; P = 0.02). Preservation of the azygos vein might not require a longer operative time than ligation of the azygos vein. This research certifies that preservation of the azygos vein is able to reduce the prevalence of anastomotic leakage and mortality.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

Studies were excluded if they included paediatric participants or those with complicated appendicitis. Data on complications of treatment, treatment efficacy (defined in the antibiotic group as not undergoing appendicectomy within 1 year of enrolment, versus surgery without complications or no negative histology in the appendicectomy group), readmissions, and length of stay (LOS) were presented. Eight RCTs involving 3203 participants (1613 antibiotics/1590 appendicectomy; 2041 males/1162 females) were included. There was no significant benefit of antibiotic treatment on complication rates (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95 per cent c.i. 0.41 to 1.04). Antibiotics had a reduced treatment efficacy compared with appendicectomy (RR 0.75, 95 per cent c.i. 0.63 to 0.89). Antibiotic treatment at 1 year was successful in 1016 of 1613 (62.9 per cent) participants. There was a six-fold increase in hospital readmissions within 1 year of enrolment in participants receiving antibiotic treatment (RR 6.28, 95 per cent c.i. 2.87 to 13.74).

As the evidence for SLB versus complete ACL reconstruction remains unclear, this study aimed to compare the two techniques. This study's hypothesis was that SLB reconstruction allows better function and stability compared to complete ACL reconstruction. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane Library was conducted, identifying studies that compared SLB ('selective' group) versus complete ('complete' group) ACL reconstruction. Meta-analysis was conducted for post-operative functional scores, stability outcomes and complications as well as pre-operative to post-operative change. Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis, with 1107 patients and a pooled mean follow-up of 29.5 months. Post-operatively, the Selective group had significantly reduced anterior laxity, shown by a lower mean arthrometry side-to-side difference (p<0.01). Analysis of change results showed that the Selective group had a lower mean improvement in arthrometry side-to-side difference as well (p<0.01). No significant difference was shown for all other post-operative outcomes. This study provides valuable insight to the management of partial tears. It has demonstrated that the preservation of the intact bundle offers stability and function that is as good as complete reconstruction and that SLB is a potentially viable option in the management of partial tears.

Despite clinical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of ST36 acupuncture, the brain activities and the neural mechanism following acupuncture at ST36 remain unclear. Literature searches were conducted on online databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, WeiPu database, and China Biology Medicine, for task-based fMRI studies of acupuncture at ST36 in healthy subjects. Brain regions activated by ST36 acupuncture were systematically evaluated and subjected to seed-based d mapping meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted on control procedures, manual acupuncture, electrical acupuncture (EA), and acupuncture-specific activations. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the effects of needle retention time on brain activities following ST36 acupuncture stimulation. The activated brain regions were further decoded and mapped on large-scale functional networks to further decipher the clinical relevance of acupuncturing at ST36. A total of sixteen studies, involving a total of 401 right-handed healthy participants, that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included in the present meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncturing on ST36 positively activates the opercular part of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG.R), left superior temporal gyrus (STG.L), and right median cingulate/paracingulate gyri (MCG.R) regions. Needle retention time in an acupuncture session positively correlates with the activation of the left olfactory cortex, as shown in meta-regression analysis. Subgroup analysis revealed that EA stimulation may be a source of heterogeneity in the pooled results. Functional network mappings showed that the activated areas were mapped to the auditory network and salience network. Further functional decoding analysis showed that acupuncture on ST36 was associated with pain, secondary somatosensory, sound and language processing, and mood regulation. Acupuncture at ST36 in healthy individuals positively activates the opercular part of IFG.R, STG.L, and MCG.R. The left olfactory cortex may exhibit positive needle retention time-dependent activities.

However, the impact of antibiotic (ATB) use on cancer patients treated with ICIs remains controversial. Our research included retrospective studies and a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with cancer patients treated with ICIs and ATB, from the public database of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, clinical trials, and JAMA. The survival outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Meanwhile, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and subgroup analyses were performed to determine the concrete association between ATB use and the prognosis of cancer patients treated in ICIs. Our results revealed that ATB use was associated with poor survival outcomes, including OS (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.68-2.25, p <0.001) and PFS (HR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.53-2.19, p <0.001). The subgroup analysis learned about the association between ATB use and the prognosis of cancer patients with ICI treatment, including 5 cancer types, 3 kinds of ICI, 5 different ATP windows, broad-spectrum ATB class, and ECOG score. ATB treatment was associated with poor OS of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), esophageal cancer (EC), and melanoma (MEL) in patients treated in ICIs, while non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were associated with poor PFS. Meanwhile, it was strongly related to the ICI type and ATB window. Furthermore, it is firstly mentioned that the use of broad-spectrum ATB class was strongly associated with poor PFS. In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicated that ATB use was significantly associated with poor OS and PFS of cancer patients treated with ICI immunotherapy, especially for patients with ATB use in the period of (-60 days; +30 days) near the initiation of ICI treatment. Also, different cancer types and the ICI type can also impact the survival outcome. This first reveals the strong relationship between the broad-spectrum ATB class and poor PFS.

"49",35977787,"New Evidence Suggests No Sex Bias in Herbivory or Plant Defense.","AbstractDioecious plants can exhibit sexual dimorphism across a suite of plant traits, including susceptibility to herbivory and secondary chemistry. One hypothesis is that because of greater costs of reproduction in females, males should grow faster and invest less in defense, resulting in male-biased herbivory. Indeed, a series of articles and a prominent meta-analysis have established male-biased herbivory as a rule. However, more recent reviews have raised questions about how general the pattern is, citing the low breadth of taxon sampling. The literature on this topic has not been formally quantified by meta-analysis in over 15 years. Here, we report the results of a meta-analysis of studies that measured sex bias in either herbivory and/or secondary defense in 71 dioecious plant species. We added 58 observations of herbivory and 41 of secondary chemistry to the original. We control for nonindependence of effects from the same study and taxonomic group to address critiques of earlier studies. For secondary chemistry, we found no support for any consistent difference between male and female plants. For herbivory, results are directionally similar to earlier reports, although not statistically significant once we accounted for taxonomic group and study. We also found that earlier studies reported stronger male bias than more recent studies. We discuss our results in light of the decline effect, where the magnitude of a described effect declines as the number of observations increases, and consider whether the data sets exhibit signs of evidence of the type(s) of biases that can result in declining effect sizes over time.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted on Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed Central using the key terms sellar and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data, including patient demographics, histology, treatments, and overall survival were extracted and analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank analysis were used to compare survival outcomes between different treatment regimens. Our literature search disclosed 123 publications. After prespecified exclusions, 41 patients with sellar AT/RT from 30 manuscripts were identified, and 38 were included in the final analysis. Including our patient, the median age was 44 (range: 20-70) with a substantial female predominance (94.7%). Collectively, patients who received combined chemoradiation therapy had a significantly increased overall survival compared to those who received single modality or no adjuvant therapies (median OS 27 vs. 1.25 months; p=0.0052). Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor in the sellar region carries a poor prognosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy were associated with significantly increased overall survival.

Despite its high rate of incidence, postoperative dysphagia following ACDF is still poorly understood; its pathogenesis remains relatively unknown, and its risk factors are still a subject of debate. The aim of this study is to review the incidence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and methods of prevention of dysphagia in ACDF patients. To this end, a literature review was conducted based on the PubMed internet database. Article titles were searched by using the following keywords: dysphagia and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion or ACDF. The search was limited to prospective clinical studies evaluating dysphagia after ACDF surgery. Studies published in non-English languages, retrospective studies, cadaveric studies, reviews, case reports, study protocols, and commentary studies were excluded. Initially, 335 studies were identified after a primary search. After the application of the exclusion criteria, 73 studies remained for the final analysis. This literature review focused on identifying the rate of dysphagia and the various risk factors leading to this complication by comparing and evaluating the current literature with a wide spectrum of heterogeneity concerning patients, surgeons, and surgical techniques. A mean dysphagia rate of 19.4% (95% CI: 9.6%-29.1%) based on the findings of the included studies correlating dysphagia directly with ACDF procedures was calculated. Various established risk factors leading to dysphagia include the female sex, smoking, the surgical approach, rhBMP-2 use, and multilevel surgery, while zero-profile devices seem to reduce dysphagia risk. The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiological findings, especially prevertebral soft-tissue swelling. However, videofluoroscopic and endoscopic studies have been recently used for the evaluation of dysphagia. The role of local administration of steroids in the prevention of dysphagia has not yet been clarified. This review underscores the prevailing rudimentary understanding of the problem of dysphagia after ACDF procedures and highlights the need for more sensitive, factor-specific studies for understanding the impact of various risk factors on the incidence rate of dysphagia.","systematic_review","christiaan"

We conducted a systematic narrative review of available scientific publications concerning One Health in the setting of Denmark that were retrievable using One Health as the key search term. Three searches in two databases yielded 30 retrieved publications, 13 of which were included in the review. The included publications had been published between 2015 and 2021. Twelve of the included publications were co-authored in collaboration across institutes from different sectors. Three of the included publications had focus on antimicrobial resistance, three on disease surveillance and/or control, and five were assessments or evaluations. The overall number of publications identified by a search using One Health as the key search term was small, and the search identified some publications that were not relevant to One Health. Our work thus highlights a missed scientific and communication opportunity of signposting articles as relevant to One Health. Using the expression One Health as keyword could help making One Health research more easily findable and thereby obtaining an overview of research in the field.","systematic_review","christiaan"
"53",35975311,"Experiences and perceptions of nurses working night shift: a qualitative systematic review.","The objective of this review was to examine the available evidence on the experiences and perceptions of nurses working the night shift within any specialty in the acute care, subacute, or long-term care setting. Nurses are required for round-the-clock patient care, and night shift nurses can experience detrimental effects because of their work hours, which disrupt their normal circadian rhythm. Understanding nurses' experiences and perceptions when working night shift will facilitate the development of strategies to minimize the potential negative effects of working at night. In examining nurses' experiences and perceptions of working night shift, there is scope to explore how to improve night shift nurses' practice environment and job satisfaction, which will then translate to improved nurse and patient outcomes. This review included qualitative studies focused on registered nurses and licensed practical nurses who work the night shift or rotate between day and night shift. This review followed the JBI methodology for systematic reviews of qualitative evidence. The methodology used was consistent with the a priori protocol. Studies included in this review were those published in full text, English, and between 1983 (when the seminal work on hospitals that attract and retain nurses was published) and February 2021, when the search was completed. The main databases searched for published and unpublished studies included MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science.From the search, two reviewers independently screened the studies against the inclusion criteria, and then papers selected for inclusion were assessed for methodological quality. Qualitative data was then extracted from the included papers independently by the four reviewers. Results from each reviewer were discussed and clarified to reach agreement. The extracted findings were pooled and examined for shared meaning, coded, and grouped into categories. Common categories were grouped into meta-synthesis to produce a comprehensive set of synthesized findings. The final synthesized findings were graded using the ConQual approach, to determine the level of confidence (trust) users may have in the value of the synthesized findings. Thirty-four papers, representing 33 studies, conducted in 11 countries, six continents, and a total of 601 participants met the criteria for inclusion. From these, a total of 220 findings were extracted and combined to form 11 categories based on similarity in meaning, and three syntheses were derived: i) The Other shift: The distinctiveness of night nursing; ii) Juggling sleep and all aspects of life when working nights; and iii) Existing in the Twilight Zone: Battling the negative impact of sleep deprivation consumes nurses who strive to keep patients, self, and others safe. The major conclusions from this review are the uniqueness of working the night shift and the sleep deprivation of night nurses. Organizational strategies and support are needed for those working this shift, which will enhance nurse and patient safety. PROSPERO CRD42019135294.","systematic_review","christiaan"

With the increasing incidence of C-sections worldwide, there is a need for precise characterization of neonatal gut microbiota to understand how to restore microbial imbalance after C-section. After birth, gut microbiota development is shaped by various factors, especially the infant's diet and antibiotic exposure. Concerning diet, current research has proposed that breastfeeding can restore the characteristic gut microbiome after C-section. In this systematic review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the current literature on the effect of breastfeeding on gut microbiota development after C-section delivery in the first 3 months of life. The retrieved data from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were evaluated according to the PICO/PECO strategy. Quality assessment was conducted by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. After critical selection, we identified 14 out of 4,628 studies for the evaluation of the impact of the diet after C-section delivery. The results demonstrate consistent evidence that C-section and affiliated intrapartum antibiotic exposure affect Bacteroidetes abundance and the incapacity of breastfeeding to reverse their reduction. Furthermore, exclusive breastfeeding shows a positive effect on Actinobacteria and Bifidobacteria restoration over the 3 months after birth. None of the included studies detected any significant changes in Lactobacillus abundance in breastfed infants after C-section. C-section and intrapartum antibiotic exposure influence an infant's gut microbiota by depletion of Bacteroides, regardless of the infant's diet in the first 3 months of life. Even though breastfeeding increases the presence of Bifidobacteria, further research with proper feeding classification is needed to prove the restoration effect on some taxa in infants after C-section.

As the field moves toward clinical implementation of AAC-BCI systems, research involving participants with SSPI is essential. Research has demonstrated variability in AAC-BCI system performance across users, and mixed results for comparisons of performance for users with and without disabilities. The aims of this systematic review were to (1) describe study, system, and participant characteristics reported in BCI research, (2) summarize the communication task performance of participants with disabilities using AAC-BCI systems, and (3) explore any differences in performance for participants with and without disabilities. Electronic databases were searched in May, 2018, and March, 2021, identifying 6065 records, of which 73 met inclusion criteria. Non-experimental study designs were common and sample sizes were typically small, with approximately half of studies involving five or fewer participants with disabilities. There was considerable variability in participant characteristics, and in how those characteristics were reported. Over 60% of studies reported an average selection accuracy ≤70% for participants with disabilities in at least one tested condition. However, some studies excluded participants who did not reach a specific system performance criterion, and others did not state whether any participants were excluded based on performance. Twenty-nine studies included participants both with and without disabilities, but few reported statistical analyses comparing performance between the two groups. Results suggest that AAC-BCI systems show promise for supporting communication for people with SSPI, but they remain ineffective for some individuals. The lack of standards in reporting outcome measures makes it difficult to synthesize data across studies. Further research is needed to demonstrate efficacy of AAC-BCI systems for people who experience SSPI of varying etiologies and severity levels, and these individuals should be included in system design and testing. Consensus in terminology and consistent participant, protocol, and performance description will facilitate the exploration of user and system characteristics that positively or negatively affect AAC-BCI use, and support innovations that will make this technology more useful to a broader group of people. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42018095345, PROSPERO: CRD42018095345.","systematic_review","christiaan"
"57",35972064,"Fathers' experience of depression during the perinatal period: a qualitative systematic review.","The objective of this review was to understand fathers' experiences of depression in the perinatal period, including how they recognize their depression, the emotions they experience, the impact of depression on their relationships, and their help-seeking behaviors and support. Whilst the prevalence of perinatal depression in men is now estimated to be just below that in women, no current care pathways for affected men exclusively exist in the United Kingdom. However, evidence demonstrates that paternal depression has severe consequences, affecting men's relationships with their partners and infants, their parenting behaviors, and the well-being of their children. This demonstrates a need to focus on the paternal experience of depression during this stage of life. This review included qualitative studies that included biological fathers over the age of 18. The phenomena of interest was depression or mental distress in fathers within the context of the perinatal period. All qualitative designs were included in the study with a focus on lived experiences of fathers. Searches for existing systematic reviews were carried out in March 2021 and no similar protocols or completed reviews were identified. Seven databases were searched in August 2021: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest Sociology, ProQuest Dissertations and Thesis Global, and OpenGrey. Search limits included English language and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Two reviewers assessed methodological quality, a third reviewer was not required when assessing quality since no disagreements arose. A standardized data extraction tool was used to extract and synthesize data. Confidence in the findings was subsequently assessed. Nine papers were included after full-text review, which were considered relevant to the research questions and which focused on fathers' experiences (n = 138), although only two focused specifically on depression. The overall quality of the studies was moderate. Overall, 109 findings were collated into 22 categories producing six synthesized findings. These were: mental health literacy around paternal perinatal depression is poor amongst men; relationships are experienced as both comforting and distressing in the perinatal period; new fathers do experience depression, but this is avoided, normalized, or hidden; fathers feel judged about mental health difficulties and so are reluctant to disclose them; help-seeking in fathers is prevented by non-targeted support for dads; and all men have the potential to become depressed because fatherhood is challenging. The review found that fathers may experience depression and negative emotions around the time their child is born, including anger, irritability, and resentment of the child. Men found their relationship changes difficult, feeling that fatherhood did not seem real until the baby was born. There was a significant lack of father-focused support for men, who were aware of stigma and social expectations of them. Men were not keen to seek help for their feelings, in part due to prioritizing the needs of the mother (and child) as more important. There is a need for greater attention on paternal perinatal depression through research and practice. PROSPERO CRD42021245894.","systematic_review","christiaan"

Electronic databases searches (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Ebsco) for relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals were conducted, and eligibility criteria were based on the PICOS model in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies were considered as follows: (a) highly trained and elite adult (>18 years) women's soccer players; (b) continuous (minimum 1-week duration) TL monitoring in the context of the team routine; (c) TL collected from entire training session. Methodological qualitative assessments and risk of bias criteria were used for judging the studies. A total of 1,163 studies were identified, and 16 were included. The selected studies were fully screened to extract the population characteristics; the number of players; a type of study design; region where the study was performed; the main findings. Accumulated external TL (ETL) during the pre-season was positively correlated to enhanced adaptations in intermittent exercise capacity. Daily ETL was negatively correlated to next-day self-reported fatigue and muscle soreness. Daily internal TL (ITL) was negatively correlated to post-session sleep duration and sleep efficiency. One study showed that higher accumulated player load and total distance were associated with injury. Information about TL during training sessions in women soccer players is very sparse, and it is currently very difficult to consider evidence-based practices for training sessions in highly trained and elite adult women soccer players. Moreover, the dose-response relationships between TL and training outcome (e.g., fatigue, training adaptations and injuries) need to be further explored to understand the optimal training stimulus to enhance performance outcomes while preserving player health.","systematic_review","christiaan"
"59",35967150,"Effectiveness of Communication Skills Training in Medical Students Using Simulated Patients or Volunteer Outpatients.","Communication skills are the vital basis for patient-doctor interactions in undergraduate medical education. With excellent patient-physician interaction and communication, patients will likely build better rapport and trust with the physician. This allows all the necessary information to be divulged with the reassurance of confidentiality and devise appropriate investigations and treatment plans that patients would be more inclined to follow. The most common and effective ways of teaching communication skills to medical students are by using simulated patients and volunteer outpatients. However, which types of patients to use for better development of practical communication skills training. Establishing the demonstrable difference between using two kinds of patients would refine the training scheme for students. This would produce doctors that have practical communication skills and enhance their care to assist patients on their road to recovery or palliative care. This review compares and establishes the effectiveness of medical students' communication skills training using simulated patients and volunteer outpatients about the adult learning theories. This research is carried out following a critical review of internationally reputed guidelines from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the General Medical Council (GMC). Several search terms were used on various online databases such as Medline (Ovid), PubMed, and Academic Medicine. A thorough selection process was applied using the inclusion and exclusion criteria to narrow the search. Four studies related to this review's aim were collected and critically analyzed. The methods of obtaining the studies were structured using the PRISMA guidelines. The studies showed that one study favored volunteer outpatients while the other preferred having simulated patients. Another study showed that students considered both types of patients essential for communication skills training. All the studies presented the strengths and weaknesses of both simulated and volunteer outpatients. Discussion of the validity of all analyses was based on the CASP criteria. Study design, sample selection, and biases were scrutinized for each study. Various adult learning theories were used to correlate the effects of the communication skills training. In conclusion, simulated patients are more useful for pre-clinical years, intimate examination, and giving instructions about the physical examination. Whereas volunteer outpatients are put to better use in clinical years to incorporate more medical aspects such as obtaining a differential diagnosis, management of illness, and procedural techniques. Introducing different types of patients based on their study progression and topic of discussion could be adapted.","systematic_review","christiaan"

The main results indicated effectiveness with regard to different forms of the cognitive training of episodic memory. Episodic memory training among the elderly can mitigate the negative effects of cognitive decline in dementia and healthy subjects promoting impacts at social, psychological, and economic levels.

Moving to a residential care facility represents a critical moment for older adults. It disrupts the continuity of their lives and distances them from significant people and objects. Health care personnel working in residential care facilities can help create a sense of home for residents. There is a lack of qualitative reviews reporting health care personnel's experiences with promoting a sense of home for older adults living in residential care settings. Qualitative studies exploring the experiences of health care personnel with promoting a sense of home for people aged 65 and older living in residential care facilities, including, but not limited to, nursing homes, residential care homes, retirement homes, assisted-living facilities, and skilled nursing facilities. This review followed a meta-aggregation approach according to JBI methodology for systematic reviews of qualitative evidence. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and ILISI databases were searched, as well as Google Scholar, OpenGrey, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. Studies published in English, Italian, French, Portuguese, or Spanish were considered. Study selection, critical appraisal, data extraction, and data synthesis were conducted by two independent reviewers using the JBI approach and JBI standardized tools. Finally, the ConQual approach was used to assess the confidence level in the study findings. Seven studies conducted in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, or the Netherlands between 2014 and 2020 were included. The studies reported the experiences of nurses, nurse aides, and directors of facilities. From the aggregation of 69 findings, 14 categories were generated that were then grouped into three synthesized findings describing the experiences of health care personnel as follows: the promotion of residents' sense of home in residential care facilities is influenced by i) the built environment, including private, single rooms with bathrooms, homelike-domestic spaces, personalization of residents' rooms, homelike interior and exterior design, and non-hospital-like environment; ii) the national and local policy and regulations, and work organization, as well as leadership of managers and directors; and 3) the facilities' care culture, including philosophy of care, maintaining autonomy of residents and ties with the community, participation in domestic and recreational activities, and family relationships. Based on ConQual scores, the confidence level in the synthesized findings was graded as low. According to health care personnel, the physical environment, interpersonal and social aspects, regulations, work organization, and facilities' care culture can contribute to creating a sense of home for older adults in residential care facilities. The evidence derived from this review can help health care personnel, facility directors, and policy-makers identify the changes that should be implemented to promote a sense of home in older adults residing in care facilities.

To systematically summarize the available evidence concerning the effects of pyeloplasty on the differential renal function of PFK in children with unilateral UPJO, highlighting the ongoing challenges in their definition, management, and long-term follow-up. In addition, we aim to verify potential predictors of renal functional recoverability that could help clinicians choose candidates for pyeloplasty. We searched several databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library CENTRAL until August 20, 2021, according to the PRISMA guidelines. The following concepts were searched: pediatric, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, UPJO, pyeloplasty, recovery, split renal function, and differential renal function. We enrolled studies where the PFK was defined as preoperative differential renal function (DRF) ≤30% by renal scintigraphy. Potential predictors of renal functional recoverability were assessed and compared among studies. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). 1499 citations perceived as relevant to screening were retrieved. After screening, 20 studies were included, comprising a total of 625 cases. The number of patients in each study varied between 5 and 84, while the average post-surgical follow-up duration ranged between 3 months and 180 months. The most significant preoperative predictive factor for postoperative functional recoverability was the baseline DRF, especially when antenatally diagnosed. The quality was considered average in a significant portion of included studies. A significant proportion of PFK showed an increase of DRF post-pyeloplasty. However, no consistent predictive factors for functional recoverability have yet been determined apart from preoperative DRF. Until further evidence appears, pyeloplasty should be considered a valid option in the armamentarium of UPJO management in PFK.","systematic_review","christiaan"

Some studies have even compared partial nephrectomy (PN) performed through various modalities such as open PN (OPN) versus RAPN and laparoscopic PN (LPN) versus OPN. The primary aim of this review was to analyze perioperative outcomes such as warm ischemia time (WIT), duration of surgery, estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, blood transfusion, length of stay, and margin status following RAPN for complex renal masses. Another objective was to compare perioperative outcomes following various surgical modalities, i.e., OPN, LPN, or RAPN. Literature search was conducted to identify studies reporting perioperative outcomes following RAPN for moderate (Radius, Endophytic/Exophytic, Nearness, Anterior/posterior location [RENAL] score 7-9 or Preoperative Aspects of Dimension used for anatomic classification [PADUA] score 8-9) to high complexity renal masses (RENAL or PADUA score ≥ 10). Meta-analysis of robotic versus OPN and robotic versus LPN was also performed. Study protocol was registered with PROPSERO (CRD42019121259). In this review, 22 studies including 2,659 patients were included. Mean duration of surgery, WIT, and EBL was 132.5-250.8 min, 15.5-30 min, and 100-321 ml, respectively. From pooled analysis, positive surgical margin, need for blood transfusion, minor and major complications were seen in 3.9%, 5.2%, 19.3%, and 6.3% of the patients. No significant difference was noted between RAPN and LPN for any of the perioperative outcomes. Compared to OPN, RAPN had significantly lower EBL, complications rate, and need for transfusion. RAPN for moderate to high complexity renal masses is associated with acceptable perioperative outcomes. LPN and RAPN were equal in terms of perioperative outcomes for complex masses whereas, OPN had significantly higher blood loss, complications rate, and need for transfusion as compared to RAPN.","systematic_review","christiaan"

After obtaining ethical clearance double-blinded single centered a randomized controlled trial was conducted in a total of 86 pregnant mothers who were randomly allocated into two groups by computer-generated random number. Approximately 1 ml of 10 mg preservative-free pethidine was added to 12.5 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia in the treatment group and 12.5 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine alone was given in the control group. Incidence and severity of shivering, as well as adverse effect was recorded intraoperatively, in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and ward. Independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square were used for analysis. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Shivering was observed in 53.5 and 20.9% in the control and treatment groups, respectively, which was statistically significant with p = 0.002. The risk of developing shivering was reduced by 61% in the treatment group with (RR = 0.39 and CI of 0.205-0.745); the intensity of shivering was also higher in the control group than in the treatment group with p = 0.004. Considering an adverse effect, the incidence of PONV was not significantly different between with p > 0.05 while the incidence of pruritus was higher in the treatment group than the control group with p = 0.003.

Zoledronic acid (ZA) enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of endocrine therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. However, little is known about the effect of ZA on the clinical outcomes of ICIs, or its possible mechanisms. Patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICIs alone or in combination with ZA were recruited. The clinical efficacy was compared between the two cohorts. We used an LL2 mouse model to confirm the combined effects of ZA with ICIs. Immune cell populations and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment and circulation were assayed and analyzed. The median PFS for the patients treated with and without ZA was 5.4 months and 2.8 months, respectively. The combination group showed a higher rate of disease control. In the mouse LL2 lung cancer model, tumor growth was significantly inhibited in mice treated with the combination treatment. More CD8 + IFN-γ + T cells and γδ T cells, and fewer CD11b cells were found in the circulation and TILs in the combination group. Anti-tumor cytokines INF-γ and IL-18 were elevated in the sera after combination therapy. Our study provides preclinical and clinical evidence to show that ZA could improve the therapeutic effects of ICIs. This effect was likely related to the activation of immune cells and elevated cytokines, which provided a new way to improve the effect of ICIs therapy, and is worth exploring further.","rodent","christiaan"

"105",35981838,"Study Evaluating the Use of RenalGuard to Protect Patients at High Risk of AKI.","Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) can occur after cardiovascular procedures using contrast media, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. RenalGuard is a closed-loop system designed to match intravenous hydration with diuretic-induced diuresis that has shown mixed results in the prevention of CIN in previous randomized controlled trials. The STRENGTH (Study Evaluating the Use of RenalGuard to Protect Patients at High Risk of AKI) study assessed whether RenalGuard (PLC Medical Systems) is superior to standard intravenous hydration for CIN prevention in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing complex cardiovascular procedures. STRENGTH is a multicenter, international, open-label, postmarket, prospective, randomized (1:1) study monitored by the Cardiovascular European Research Center (Massy, France) that included a total of 259 patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration 15-40 mL/min/m2) requiring a complex coronary, structural, or peripheral procedure with an expected contrast injection of at least 3 times the estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients were randomized to either RenalGuard or intravenous saline hydration according to current guidelines. The primary endpoint, the incidence of CIN at day 3 after the procedure, was similar between the 2 groups (17/107 [15.9%] in the RG group vs 15/110 [13.9%] in the control group; P = 0.62). In addition, none of the secondary endpoints differed between the 2 groups. In high-risk patients undergoing complex cardiovascular interventions in experienced centers, furosemide-induced high urine output with matched hydration using the RenalGuard system did not reduce the risk of CIN and adverse outcomes at 12 months compared with conventional intravenous hydration.","randomized_trial","christiaan"
"111",35974870,"Postpartum Use of Shavari Bar® Improves Breast Milk Output: A Double-Blind, Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Clinical Study.","Background and objectives Appropriate nutrition, along with the establishment of lactation, is of paramount importance for the feeding mother and the growing neonate. Asparagus racemosus, a common name for Shatavari, is a well-known herb that has been used as a galactagogue in traditional Indian culture. It is also referenced in Ayurvedic medicine. Despite multiple formulations available, palatability has been a concern always as Shatavari is very bitter. We have devised a palatable and nutritionally rich formulation of Shatavari with no artificial ingredients. To understand the efficacy, we have conducted this double-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effect of oral Shatavari formulation (Shavari Bar®) on breast milk output in postpartum women. Methods A prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at two centers in women with gestational age 37 weeks or more who intended to breastfeed. Hundred and four women were screened, of which 78 were randomized to receive either bar containing Shatavari and oats (n=39, study) or an identical placebo bar (n=39, control). All 78 women completed the study, 61 delivered by a lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS), and 17 had a full-term normal vaginal delivery. Time to first noticeable breast fullness was measured and expressed milk volume measurements were done 72 hours after delivery or after consumption of four bars, whichever was later using a standardized breast pump. Comparison between the two groups was analyzed using a t-test. Results Demography and baseline data of patients enrolled were similar in the two groups. The mean total milk volume expressed was higher (p=0.008) with Shavari (64.74 ml) compared to placebo (49.69 ml). The time to breast fullness was shorter (p=0.024) with Shavari (30.49 hours) compared to placebo (38.09 hours). No adverse events were noted in either of the study groups. Global assessment of the satisfaction of mothers with lactation, the well-being of the child, taste, and ease of use was better in the treatment arm than in the placebo arm. Conclusion The use of the Shavari bar can be an effective option in postpartum women to establish early lactation and build confidence in breastfeeding along with nonpharmacological intervention.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

The inception of endoscopy and minimal invasive intervention has revolutionized the surgical treatment of blow out fracture of orbital walls. Thus, the present study was conducted to compare the outcome of conventional open reduction approach with endoscopic approach for orbital floor repair. The study included 10 patients with clinical and radiographic evidence of orbital floor fracture, divided randomly into two groups: Group I-operated using endoscopic approach; and Group II- operated using conventional external approach. All the patients were evaluated clinically preoperatively, immediate post-operative and after 1 month for Diplopia, Extrinsic ocular motility, Enophthalmos and Hypoglobus. The study consisted of 40% females and 60% males, with mean age of Endoscopic and Conventional group being 27.20 ± 6.14 years and 27.60 ± 7.23 years respectively. In relation to diplopia, an insignificant difference was observed statistically. The mean change in enophthalmos and hypoglobus in endoscopic and conventional group showed a significant difference statistically (p < 0.001). Unrestricted ocular motility was present only in one case of each group and significantly increased to 5 cases in both the groups (p = 0.048).

The diagnostic criteria for septic cardiomyopathy has not been unified, which brings serious difficulties to clinical treatment. This study aimed to provide evidence for the early identification and intervention in patients with sepsis by clarifying the relationship between the ultrasound phenotype of septic cardiomyopathy and the prognosis of patients with sepsis. This was a multicenter, prospective cohort study. The study population will consist of all eligible consecutive patients with sepsis or septic shock who meet the Sepsis 3.0 diagnostic criteria and were aged ≥18 years. Clinical data and echocardiographic measurements will be recorded within 2 h, at the 24th hour, at the 72nd hour, and on the 7th day after admission. The prevalence of each phenotype will be described as well, and their association with prognosis will be analyzed statistically. To achieve early recognition, prevent reinjury, achieve precise treatment, and reduce mortality in patients with sepsis, it is important to identify septic cardiac alterations and classify the phenotypes at all stages of sepsis. First, there is a lack of studies on the prevalence of each phenotype in Chinese populations. Second, each phenotype and its corresponding prognosis are not clear. In addition, the prognosis of patients with normal cardiac ultrasound phenotypes vs. those with suppressed or hyperdynamic cardiac phenotypes is unclear. Finally, this study was designed to collect data at four specific timing, then the timing of occurrence, duration, changes over time, impact to outcomes of each phenotype will probably be found. This study is expected to establish a standard and objective method to assess the ultrasound phenotype of septic cardiomyopathy due to its advantages of visualization, non-invasiveness and reproducibility, and to provide more precise information for the hemodynamic management of septic patients. In addition, this research will promote the clinical application of critical care ultrasound, which will play an important role in medical education and make ultrasound the best method to assess cardiac changes in sepsis. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05161104, identifier NCT05161104.","protocol","christiaan"

Early recognition and management of shock in children improves patient outcome. Simulation-based education (SBE) for shock recognition and prompt management prepares interdisciplinary pediatric emergency teams in crisis management. COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on in-person simulation led us to the development of telesimulation for shock. We hypothesized that telesimulation training would improve pediatric shock recognition, process of care, and patient outcomes in both simulated and real patient settings. We conducted a prospective quasi-experimental interrupted time series cohort study over 9 months. We conducted 40 telesimulation sessions for 76 participants in teams of 3 or 4, utilizing the video telecommunication platform (Zoom©). Trained observers recorded time-critical interventions on real patients for the pediatric emergency teams composed of residents, fellows, and nurses. Data were collected on 332 pediatric patients in shock (72% of whom were in septic shock) before, during, and after the intervention. The data included the first hour time-critical intervention checklist, patient hemodynamic status at the end of the first hour, time for the resolution of shock, and team leadership skills in the emergency room. There was a significant improvement in the percent completion of tasks by the pediatric emergency team in simulated scenarios (69% in scenario 1 vs. 93% in scenario 2; p < 0.001). In real patients, completion of tasks as per time-critical steps reached 100% during and after intervention compared to the pre-intervention phase (87.5%), p < 0.05. There was a significant improvement in the first hour hemodynamic parameters of shock patients: pre (71%), during (79%), and post (87%) intervention (p < 0.007 pre vs. post). Shock reversal time reduced from 24 h pre-intervention to 6 h intervention and to 4.5 h post intervention (p < 0.002). There was also a significant improvement in leadership performance assessed by modified Concise Assessment of Leader Management (CALM) instrument during the simulated (p < 0.001) and real patient care in post intervention (p < 0.05). Telesimulation training is feasible and improved the process of care, time-critical interventions, leadership in both simulated and real patients and resolution of shock in real patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies where telesimulation has shown improvement in real patient outcomes.","human_intervention","christiaan"

Here, we report the final OS analysis from the TACTICS trial, which previously demonstrated significant improvement in PFS with TACE plus sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (NCT01217034). Patients with unresectable HCC were randomized to a TACE plus sorafenib group (N = 80) or a TACE alone group (N = 76). Patients in the combination treatment group received sorafenib 400 mg once daily for 2-3 weeks before TACE, followed by 800 mg once daily during on-demand conventional TACE sessions until time to untreatable progression. In this trial, TACE-specific PFS was used. TACE-specific PFS is defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, and PD was defined as untreatable progression, caused by the inability of a patient to further receive or benefit from TACE for reasons that include intrahepatic tumor progression (25% increase vs. baseline) according to response evaluation criteria in cancer of the liver, the detection of extrahepatic spread, vascular invasion, or transient deterioration of liver function to Child-Pugh C after TACE. At the cut-off date of July 31, 2020, 131 OS events were observed. The median OS was 36.2 months with TACE plus sorafenib and 30.8 months with TACE alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.861; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.607-1.223; p = 0.40, ΔOS, 5.4 months). The updated PFS was 22.8 months with TACE plus sorafenib and 13.5 months with TACE alone (HR = 0.661; 95% CI, 0.466-0.938; p = 0.02). Post-trial treatments with active procedures/agents were received by 47 (58.8%) patients in the TACE plus sorafenib group and 58 (76.3%) in the TACE alone group (p = 0.01). In post hoc analysis, PFS and OS benefit were shown in HCC patients with tumor burden beyond up-to-7 criteria. In TACTICS trial, TACE plus sorafenib did not show significant OS benefit over TACE alone; however, clinical meaningful OS prolongation and significantly improved PFS was observed. Thus, the TACE plus sorafenib can be considered a choice of treatment in intermediate-stage HCC, especially in patients with high tumor burden.

The aim in this study was to compare vitamin D levels between children and adolescents, 1-18 years of age, with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and a health control group of peers. We considered effects of endogenous, exogenous, and genetic factors on measured differences in vitamin D levels among children with JIA. Our findings are based on a study sample of 150 patients with various variants of JIA and 277 healthy children. The blood level of vitamin D was assessed by calcidiol level. The following factors were included in our analysis: age and sex; level of insolation in three regions of country (center, south, north); assessment of dietary intake of vitamin D; effect of prophylactic doses of cholecalciferol; a relationship between the TaqI, FokI, and BsmI polymorphisms of the VDR gene and serum 25(OH)D concentration. We identified a high frequency of low vitamin D among children with JIA, prevalence of 66%, with the medial level of vitamin D being within the range of insufficient vitamin D. We also show that the dietary intake of vitamin D by children with JIA is well below expected norms, and that prophylactic doses of vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol) at a dose of 500-1,000 IU/day and 1,500-2,000 IU/day do not meet the vitamin D needs of children with JIA. Of importance, we show that vitamin D levels among children with JIA are not affected by clinical therapies to manage the disease nor by the present of VDR genetic variants. Prophylactic administration of cholecalciferol and season of year play a determining role in the development of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency.","human_intervention","christiaan"
"168",35967820,"Dietary adaptation for weight loss maintenance at Yale (DAWLY): Protocol and predictions for a randomized controlled trial.","Current therapies for obesity treatment are effective at producing short-term weight loss, but weight loss maintenance remains a significant challenge. Here we investigate the impact of pre-intervention dietary fat intake on the efficacy of a dietary supplement to support weight loss maintenance. Preclinical work demonstrates that a vagal afferent pathway critical for sensing dietary lipids is blunted by a high-fat diet (HFD), resulting in a reduced preference for a low-fat emulsion and severe blunting of the dopamine (DA) response to the gastric infusion of lipids. Infusion of the gut lipid messenger oleoylethanolamide (OEA), which is also depleted by HFD, immediately reverses this DA blunting and restores preference for the low-fat emulsion. Studies of OEA supplementation for weight loss in humans have had limited success. Given the strong effect of HFD on this pathway, we designed a study to test whether the efficacy of OEA as a weight loss treatment is related to pre-intervention habitual intake of dietary fat. We employed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 100 adults with overweight/obesity (OW/OB) were randomized to receive either OEA or placebo daily for 16 months. Following a baseline evaluation of diet, metabolic health, adiposity, and brain response to a palatable an energy dense food, participants in both groups underwent a 4-month behavioral weight loss intervention (LEARN®) followed by a 1-year maintenance period. The study aims are to (1) determine if pre-intervention dietary fat intake moderates the ability of OEA to improve weight loss and weight loss maintenance after a gold standard behavioral weight loss treatment; (2) identify biomarkers that predict outcome and optimize a stratification strategy; and (3) test a model underlying OEA's effectiveness. Focusing on interventions that target the gut-brain axis is supported by mounting evidence for the role of gut-brain signaling in food choice and the modulation of this circuit by diet. If successful, this work will provide support for targeting the gut-brain pathway for weight loss maintenance using a precision medicine approach that is easy and inexpensive to implement.

Laboratory and anthropometric outcomes were measured, and liver stiffness was assessed using a fibroscan. The primary outcome measures were changes from baseline in fibrosis scores and liver transferases. Out of 120 patients randomized into sitagliptin and placebo groups, 76 patients completed the trial, of whom 44 were in the sitagliptin and 32 in the placebo groups. Patients receiving sitagliptin showed a significant decrease in the fibrosis scores (P = 0.001). The reductions in the alanine aminotransferase (AST) (P = 0.036) and aspartate AST (P < 0.001) levels were also statistically significant. The effect of sitagliptin in reducing fibrosis scores was significantly greater in normal-weight and overweight individuals than in obese individuals (p = 0.036, and p = 0.018, respectively), whereas the effects of sitagliptin on AST levels were greater among overweight/obese patients (p = 0.028, and p = 0.016, respectively). Sitagliptin reduced fibrosis scores and liver enzymes in NAFLD patients after 56 weeks of therapy. The changes in fibrosis scores were more prominent in patients with normal weight and overweight than obese patients, whereas the effects on AST levels were greater among overweight/obese patients.

With the advancement of endoscopic DCR and the silicone stents, an update of the surgical outcomes and preferable approaches is required. This study aims at comparing the surgical outcomes of endoscopic DCR using pushed bicanalicular intubation (BCI) to pulled monocanalicular intubation (MCI) in adults with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO). Forty five eyes of 45 patients were enrolled, including 22 eyes of 22 patients treated with endoscopic DCR with pulled MCI and 23 eyes of 23 patients with pushed BCI from January 2014 to June 2021. The success rates at stent removal, 1 month and 3 months after removal were 95, 91, and 82%, respectively, in the MCI group, and 100, 87, and 87% in the BCI group. The BCI group had better success rates but failed to reach a significant difference (p = 0.49, p = 0.67, p = 0.24, respectively). After analyzing with binary logistic regression, the implant material was demonstrated as the predictive of surgical success (p = 0.045). There was no significant difference in success rates between patients with dacryocystitis and those without dacryocystitis. We conclude that endoscopic DCR with pushed BCI is easily manipulated and has a promising surgical outcome over pulled MCI. Stent indwelling duration as well as history of dacryocystitis have less influence on the success rates.","human_intervention","christiaan"

Electroacupuncture (EA) has been recognized as a cognitive stimulation for its effects on memory disorder, but whether different brain regions or neural circuits contribute to memory recovery in AD remains unknown. Here, we found that memory deficit was ameliorated in 3×Tg-AD mice with EA-treatment, as shown by the increased number of exploring and time spent in the novel object. In addition, reduced locomotor activity was observed in 3×Tg-AD mice, but no significant alteration was seen in the EA-treated mice. Based on the functional magnetic resonance imaging, the regional spontaneous activity alterations of 3×Tg-AD were mainly concentrated in the accumbens nucleus, auditory cortex, caudate putamen, entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus, insular cortex, subiculum, temporal cortex, visual cortex, and so on. While EA-treatment prevented the chaos of brain activity in parts of the above regions, such as the auditory cortex, EC, hippocampus, subiculum, and temporal cortex. And then we used the whole-cell voltage-clamp recording to reveal the neurotransmission in the hippocampus, and found that EA-treatment reversed the synaptic spontaneous release. Since the hippocampus receives most of the projections of the EC, the hippocampus-EC circuit is one of the neural circuits related to memory impairment. We further applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tracking and functional connectivity, and found that hypo-connected between the hippocampus and EC with EA-treatment. These data indicate that the hippocampus-EC connectivity is responsible for the recognition memory deficit in the AD mice with EA-treatment, and provide novel insight into potential therapies for memory loss in AD.","rodent","christiaan"

Most studies emphasize on the improvement of child's core symptoms or maladaptive behaviors, making parental perceived competence and self-efficacy secondary. Yet, the evaluations of intervention implementation are under-reported, especially when translating such interventions into a new population or context. This research investigated the intervention implementation of a 12-week parent coaching intervention which was delivered through telehealth and tailored to Chinese population. The intervention was based on the Parent-mediated Early Start Denver Model with culturally adapted lectures, manuals, and demonstration and commentary videos. This study aimed to evaluate the intervention implementation by assessing parents' satisfaction, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with two telehealth conditions: self-directed and web+group therapy. Parents in the self-directed condition received intervention individually through the online learning platform. The web+group therapy condition navigated the same program with weekly 1.5-h group coaching sessions via videoconferencing. This mixed-methods study used a concurrent convergent design to evaluate the intervention implementation at post-intervention. The quantitative data was collected from the Program Evaluation Survey and the qualitative data was collected from five focus groups. Parents in self-directed group reported significantly lower scores in total perceived competence than parents in web+group therapy condition, while there was no group difference on the total self-efficacy. Tailored feedback, demonstration and commentary videos, peer commenting, live coaching, and guided reflection were the top-five acceptable telehealth strategies that were strongly endorsed by parents. Family centered care, home-based intervention, strategies relative to daily activities, the remote learning platform, and the program-based community were elements that parents considered when evaluating the program's appropriateness. Parent modeling, step-by-step instructions, and tailored feedback were key components in making intervention strategies feasible for parents to implement at home. Findings indicate the application of telehealth was acceptable, appropriate, and feasible for Chinese parents. Group-based parent coaching intervention via videoconferencing could be a promising home-based service model to increase parental perceived competence. A large-scale RCT is needed to investigate the effectiveness of group-based PMI via telehealth.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

The results unexpectedly revealed that antibiotic treatment induced the appearance of substances with Nsp15 activity inhibition in the intestine of mice. Comprehensive analysis based on functional profiling of the fecal metagenomes and endoribonuclease assay of antibiotic-enriched bacteria and metabolites demonstrated that the Nsp15 inhibitors were the primary bile acids that accumulated in the gut as a result of antibiotic-induced deficiency of bile acid metabolizing microbes.

However, the precise standards for probiotic administration in alleviating colitis remain undefined. Most analysis methods rely on limited diversity and abundance of gut microorganisms. Therefore, observational studies cannot establish causation. In this study, we applied antibiotic-induced pseudo-germ-free mice to investigate the role of gut microbiota in regulating the probiotic effects of Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. This process allows for evaluating the bidirectional regulating effect of B. cereus supplementation on health and provides stable and reproducible results. Here, the detailed protocols for B. cereus cultivation, gavage operation, stool collection, and antibiotic clearance treatment on colitis mice are provided. The optimization methods are also applicable for other chronic inflammatory-associated disorders. The results showed that B. cereus administration decreased body weight loss, colon length shortening, disease activity index, and histopathological scores. However, treatment with antibiotics suppressed the positive effect of B. cereus on colitis. These results indicate that gut microbiota are needed for the alleviating effects of B. cereus on colitis. Therefore, exploring the beneficial effects of probiotics in this research is a promising approach for developing novel treatment strategies for alleviating the symptoms of chronic inflammatory-associated disorders.","rodent","christiaan"

A recent proposal suggests replacing the standardized World Health Organisation (WHO) exercise recommendations for healthy adults by co-designed interventions where individuals participate actively in the decisions about the selected physical activities and the effort regulation. This study contrasts the effects on mental health and interoceptive awareness of a co-designed and co-adapted exercise intervention with an exercise program based on the WHO recommendations for healthy adults. Twenty healthy adults (10 men and 10 women, 40-55 y.o.) participated voluntarily in the research. They were randomly assigned to a co-designed exercise intervention (CoD group) and a prescribed exercise program (WHO group). Supervised online by specialized personal trainers, both programs lasted 9 weeks and were equivalent in volume and intensity. The effects of the exercise intervention were tested through personal interviews, questionnaires (DASS-21 and MAIA) and a cardiorespiratory exercise test. Intragroup differences (pre-post) were assessed using the Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test and intergroup differences through Student's t-tests. Effect sizes were calculated through Cohen's d. Interviews were analyzed through thematic analysis. Eleven participants completed the intervention (CoD = 8, WHO = 5). Both groups improved, but non significantly, their cardiorespiratory testing results, and no differences were found between them post-intervention. Mental health was only enhanced in the CoD group (p < 0.001), and interoceptive awareness improved in seven of the eight scales in the CoD group (p < 0.001) and only in 3 scales in the WHO group (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the co-designed intervention was more effective for developing mental health, interoceptive awareness, autonomy, and exercise self-regulation than the WHO-based exercise program.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

The intelligent electronic stimulator (CX-DZ-II) is a digital device with an evidence-based diagnosis and treatment system. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of the CX-DZ-II intelligent EA instrument for NPCS. A total of 164 patients with NPCS [mean age (SD), 49.48 (13.47) years] were randomly assigned to receive 8 sessions (over 2 weeks) EA of the intelligent electronic stimulator (CX-DZ-II) or the regular electronic stimulator (SDZ-II). The primary outcome was the change of the visual analog scale (VAS) from baseline to 2 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included mean scores of the VAS after each treatment in 1 week, responder rate, drug-usage rate of non-steroidal antipyretic analgesics (NSAAs), the occurrence rate of adverse events (AEs), proportions of apparatus with defect during treatment, and excellent rate of apparatus. The intelligent electronic stimulator (CX-DZ-II) was non-inferior to the regular electronic stimulator (SDZ-II) for changes from baseline in the VAS [3.36 vs. 3.23, with a difference of 0.17 (95% CI, -0.36 to 0.69), P < 0.025 for non-inferiority]. No between-group differences were found in outcomes of VAS in 1 week, overall responders, and drug-usage rate of NSAAs. The defect rate and excellent rate of the instrument were similar in the CX-DZ-II and SDZ-II groups. Adverse events occurred in 9 (10.84%) patients in the CX-DZ-II group and 4 (5.00%) patients in the SDZ-II group. The intelligent electronic stimulator (CX-DZ-II) was non-inferior to the regular electronic stimulator (SDZ-II) in relieving neck pain. The intelligent electronic stimulator (CX-DZ-II) is a promising non-inferior alternative instrument for NPCS.

Prospective randomized single-blinded trial. Tertiary care teaching hospital. All of the patients scheduled for elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with an ejection fraction of >45%. After obtaining institutional ethical committee approval, 130 patients were randomized into Group E and Group D. Group E patients received ESP block bilaterally with 25 mL of bupivacaine plus 0.5 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine. The patients in Group D received conventional intravenous analgesia, as well as a 0.7 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine bolus, followed by a 0.3 μg/kg dexmedetomidine infusion during surgery and continued postoperatively for 24 hours. Group E patients received 8 mL/h of bupivacaine infusion bilaterally for 24 hours. The primary outcome assessed was pain scores in the postoperative period. The secondary outcomes assessed were postoperative rescue analgesic consumption, time to first rescue analgesia, intraoperative fentanyl consumption, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Both groups were comparable in demographic characteristics. The postoperative pain scores from 4 hours to 12 hours were lower in Group E compared with Group D. The pain scores at 24 hours were not significantly different between groups. Postoperative fentanyl consumption in Group E (99.23 ± 50.19 μg) was significantly lower than in Group D (181.15 ± 82.92 μg), with a p value of 0.001. Time to first rescue analgesia was significantly longer in Group E, with a median score of 8 hours when compared with that of 4 hours in Group D, with a p value of 0.01. Intraoperative fentanyl consumption was significantly lower in Group E (392.15 ± 55.36 μg) compared with Group D (604.00 ± 131.87 μg; p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in the duration of mechanical ventilation in both groups. Duration of ICU stay was significantly lower in Group E (51.95 ± 8.54 hours) when compared with Group D (59.06 ± 8.68 hours) (p = 0.001). Erector spinae fascial plane blocks appeared to reduce postoperative pain scores in off-pump coronary artery bypass graft patients.

This study assessed 30-day point prevalence abstinence and patient satisfaction of TCS provided by pharmacists compared with primary care providers (PCPs) in a community health center. Secondary objectives assessed the number of encounters and time spent counseling and medications prescribed at each visit. Patients at the age of 18 years or older with tobacco use disorder and a new quit attempt were invited to complete a 9-question survey via e-mail, phone, and mail 7 months after their initial tobacco cessation visit. The survey assessed 30-day point prevalence abstinence and patient satisfaction. Chart reviews were conducted to assess time spent counseling and prescribing patterns. The response rate was 38.8% (50/129) overall, 43.9% in the pharmacist group and 36.3% in the PCP group. A 30-day point prevalence abstinence was reached by 22.2% (4/18) in the pharmacist group and 9.4% (3/32) in the PCP group (P = 0.23). Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the pharmacist group with regard to discussion around medications used to quit smoking (100% vs. 65.6%, P = 0.004), understanding how to properly use the medications (100% vs. 62.5%, P = 0.002), identifying behavioral changes to assist with quitting (94.4% vs. 65.6%, P = 0.036), and frequent follow-up visits (83.3% vs. 46.9%, P = 0.016). Pharmacists spent more time counseling patients and were more likely to prescribe dual nicotine replacement therapy and prescription medications. There was not a statistically significant difference in abstinence rates, and patient satisfaction with TCS provided by pharmacists and PCPs was high. Pharmacists provide a more intensive service by spending more time counseling patients and providing more follow-ups and are more likely to diversify medications prescribed to quit smoking.","human_intervention","christiaan"

Several studies showed effectiveness of inhaled morphine as a secondary treatment for the improvement of dyspnea. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the efficacy of low dose inhaled morphine for respiratory function improvement in patients who were exposed to the mustard gas. This study was designed as a cross-over double-blinded clinical trial. Patients exposed to mustard gas were randomly assigned into two groups: 1) received 0.4 mg of morphine by inhalation and 2) received 5 ml of normal saline serum as a placebo in the same manner. After a washout period of one week, the first group received the placebo and the second group received morphine for 5 days. Spirometric indices, expiratory flow peak, exercise test, severity of dyspnea, and quality of life were evaluated as respiratory function parameters. Data analysis was done using SPSS software Version 16. The mean maximum expiratory flow was significantly higher among cases who used morphine in comparison with the placebo group (p<0.05). Moreover, the severity of dyspnea, quality of life, and the frequency of coughing during the day were significantly improved among the recipients of morphine (p<0.05) while the spirometric indices and exercise tolerance tests were similar between the two groups (p>0.05), but the mean peak expiratory flow (PEFR) was significantly higher among the patients receiving morphine than the placebo patients (p<0.001). The use of inhaled morphine had a significant positive effect on the respiratory system of people exposed to mustard gas.

Our hypothesis is that for preterm infants <30 weeks with potential to develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is non-inferior to the nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) as primary respiratory support before minimal invasive surfactant administration (MISA). The NIV-MISA-RDS trial is planned as an unblinded, multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority trial at 14 tertiary neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in China. Eligible infants are preterm infants of 24-29+6 weeks of gestational age who have spontaneous breaths at birth and require primary NIV support for RDS. Infants are randomized 1:1 to treatment with either NCPAP or NIPPV once admitted into NICUs. If an infant presents progressively aggravated respiratory distress and is clinically diagnosed as having RDS, pulmonary surfactant will be supplemented by MISA in the first 2 h of life. The primary outcome is NIV treatment failure within 72 h after birth. With a specified non-inferiority margin of 10%, using a two-sided 95% CI and 80% power, the study requires 480 infants per group (in total 960 infants). Current evidence shows that NIV and MISA may be the most effective strategy for minimizing IMV in preterm infants with RDS. However, there are few large randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of NCPAP and NIPPV as the primary respiratory support after birth and before surfactant administration. We will conduct this trial to test the hypothesis that NCPAP is not inferior to NIPPV as the initial respiratory support in reducing the use of IMV in premature infants who have spontaneous breaths after birth and who do not require intubation in the first 2 h after birth. The study will provide clinical data for the selection of the initial non-invasive ventilation mode in preterm infants with a gestational age of <30 weeks with spontaneous breaths after birth. https://register.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT05137340.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

Currently, secondary injury severity is difficult to estimate. The objective of this study was to investigate the capacity of non-invasive amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to assess TBI injury in different brain regions and predict long-term neurobehavior outcomes. Fifty-five male and female rats were subjected to a controlled cortical impact with one of three different impactor depths to produce different degrees of TBI. Multi-parameter MRI data were acquired on a 4.7-Tesla scanner at 1 h, 1 day, and 3 days. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect activated microglia at 3 days, and neurobehavioral tests were performed to assess long-term outcomes after 28 days. The APTw signal in the injury core at 1 day correlated with deficits in sensorimotor function, the sucrose preference test (a test for anhedonia), and spatial memory function on the Barnes maze. The APTw signal in the perilesion ipsilateral cortex gradually increased after TBI, and the value at 3 days correlated with microglia density at 3 days and with spatial memory decline and anhedonia at 28 days. The correlation between APTw and activated microglia was also observed in the ipsilateral thalamus, and its correlation to memory deficit and depression was evident in other ipsilateral sites. These results suggest that APTw imaging can be used for detecting secondary injury and as a potential predictor of long-term outcomes from TBI.","rodent","christiaan"

We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) platform using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model (AI-CNN model) to evaluate the quality of bowel preparation before colonoscopy. This was a colonoscopist-blinded, randomized study. Enrolled patients were randomized into an experimental group, in which our AI-CNN model was used to evaluate the quality of bowel preparation (AI-CNN group), or a control group, which performed self-evaluation per routine practice (Control group). The primary outcome was the consistency (homogeneity) between the results of the two methods. The secondary outcomes included the quality of bowel preparation according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), the polyp detection rate (PDR), and the adenoma detection rate (ADR). A total of 1,434 patients were enrolled (AI-CNN, n = 730; Control, n = 704). No significant difference was observed between the evaluation results (pass or not pass) of the groups in terms of the adequacy of bowel preparation as represented by BBPS scores. The mean BBPS scores, PDRs, and ADRs were similar between the groups. These results indicated that the AI-CNN model and routine practice were generally consistent in the evaluation of bowel preparation quality. However, the mean BBPS score of patients with pass results were signiﬁcantly higher in the AI-CNN group than in the Control group, indicating that the AI-CNN model may further improve the quality of bowel preparation in patients exhibiting adequate bowel preparation. The novel AI-CNN model, which demonstrated comparable outcomes to the routine practice, may serve as an alternative approach for evaluating bowel preparation quality before colonoscopy.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

Data were compared at baseline and at all follow-up examinations for uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BCVA), keratometry (K), central corneal thickness, and complications of CXL. Pre- and post-intervention values were compared for each group. P < 0.05 was statistically significant. After the treatment, there was a statistically greater improvement in UCVA in the conventional CXL (CCXL) group (49%) compared to the ACXL group (34%) (P = 0.028). The improvement in BCVA was similar between the groups (P = 0.060). Gain of two lines of UCVA and stability were comparable between groups (P = 0.078 and P = 0.060, respectively). The average flat K and steep K values fluctuated remarkably across different follow-up assessments in both the groups. At 3 months of follow-up, there was a statistically significantly faster return to baseline levels of flat and steep Ks in the CCXL group (P = 0.028 and P = 0.002, respectively). The findings of the current study confirm the efficacy and safety of accelerated high-fluence CXL compared to CCXL. Both protocols were effective in stabilizing KC at 9th-month and the last follow-up visit.

Single-cell RNA sequencing has laid the foundation for studying RILI at the cellular microenvironmental level. This study focused on changes during the acute pneumonitis stage of RILI at the cellular microenvironmental level and investigated the interactions between different cell types. An acute RILI model in mice and a single-cell transcriptional library were established. Intercellular communication networks were constructed to study the heterogeneity and intercellular interactions among different cell types. A single-cell transcriptome map was established in a mouse model of acute lung injury. In total, 18,500 single-cell transcripts were generated, and 10 major cell types were identified. The heterogeneity and radiosensitivity of each cell type or subtype in the lung tissues during the acute stage were revealed. It was found that immune cells had higher radiosensitivity than stromal cells. Immune cells were highly heterogeneous in terms of radiosensitivity, while some immune cells had the characteristics of radiation resistance. Two groups of radiation-induced Cd8+Mki67+ T cells and Cd4+Cxcr6+ helper T cells were identified. The presence of these cells was verified using immunofluorescence. The ligand-receptor interactions were analyzed by constructing intercellular communication networks.

Dendrobium officinale (DO), a medicinal and edible homologous Chinese herbal medicine, plays essential role in regulating intestinal microbiota. However, the extent of DO on the intestinal contents microbiota in mice fed with a high-fat diet still remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored the role of intestinal contents microbiota in the regulation of adverse effects caused by high-fat diet by DO from the perspective of intestinal microecology. Twenty-four mice were randomly distributed into the normal saline-treated basal diet (bcn), normal saline-treated high-fat diet (bmn), 2.37 g kg-1 days-1 DO traditional decoction-treated high-fat diet (bdn) and 1.19 g kg-1 days-1 lipid-lowering decoction-treated high-fat diet (bjn) groups for 40 days. Subsequently, we assessed the changes in body weight, serum total cholesterol (TC), total triacylglycerol (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and the characteristics of intestinal contents microbiota. Results demonstrated that DO exerted the modulating effect on the changes in body weight, TG, TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels. Besides, DO decreased the richness and diversity of intestinal contents microbiota, and altered the structure as a whole. Dominant bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, varied significantly and statistically. Moreover, DO influenced the carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolic functions. Furthermore, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira presented varying degrees of inhibition/promotion of TG, TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C. Consequently, we hypothesized that Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, as dominant bacteria, played key roles in the treatment of diseases associated with a high-fat diet DO.","rodent","christiaan"

Oolong tea (OT), which is partially fermented from Camellia sinensis leaves, has proven health benefits and potential preventive applications in multiple studies. However, research on the role of OT in obesity prevention and potential mechanisms is still limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the modulatory effects of OT intervention on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and gut microbiota dysbiosis using an obese mouse model. Our results showed that 8-week OT supplementation with 93.94% polyphenols significantly decreased body weight gain, adipose tissue mass, and serum levels of triglyceride (2.60 mmol/L), cholesterol (5.49 mmol/L), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.61 mmol/L) in HFD-fed mice. Meanwhile, OT intervention was observed to improve fat accumulation, hepatic damage, glucose intolerance, and endotoxemia and alleviate inflammation by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory factors. OT also upregulated the expression of genes including Srebf1, Ppara, Lxra, Pgc1a, and Hsl and downregulated the expression of genes including Leptin, Il-6, and Il-1b. In addition, the gut dysbiosis characterized by decreased flora diversity and increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in obese mice was recovered by OT intervention. Certain differentially abundant microbes caused by HFD feeding, including Enterococcus, Intestinimonas, Blautia, and Bilophila, were also improved by OT treatment. This study demonstrated that OT, as a novel resource of dietary polyphenols, exhibited a protective effect on HFD-induced obesity and gut microbiota disorder.","rodent","christiaan"

Expanding on previous studies conducted in collegiate and professional settings, the current study investigates the application of MAC amongst national sub-elite athletes. The study was conducted utilizing a single case A-B design, with a total of six sub-elite Malaysian Squash athletes (2 males, 3 females; Mage = 15 ± 2 years) purposively sampled from the Malaysian national squash team. Participants underwent 6 weeks of baseline testing, 7 weeks of program intervention, and a retention test 4 weeks post-intervention. The intervention consisted of psycho-education, centering and cognitive defusion among other aspects as purported in MAC programs. Changes in proficiency of mindful practice was observed through the Mindfulness Awareness Acceptance Scale (MAAS), experiential avoidance through the Acceptance Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), stress levels through the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and sport performance through both coach- and self-rated scales. Overall, visual analysis revealed improvements in MAAS levels (M = 1.15 ± 0.15), with no marked changes in AAQ-II (M = -0.002 ± 1.12) and PSS (M = 0.7 ± 0.93) after 7 weeks of intervention. Coach-rated sport performance also improved across the phases (M = 0.86 ± 0.93), with mixed responses for self-rated improvements (M = 0.01 ± 1.19). Overall, the benefits of MAC program were well-maintained past the post-intervention phase. The current study supported the implementation of an MAC program for sub-elite athletes in real-world settings.","human_intervention","christiaan"
"434",35979305,"Effect of cold snare polypectomy for small colorectal polyps.","Colorectal cancer remains a considerable challenge in healthcare nowadays. Approximately 60%-80% of colorectal cancer is caused by intestinal polyps, and resection of intestinal polyps has been proved to reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. The vast majority of intestinal polyps can be found during colonoscopy and removed endoscopically. Therefore, more attention has been paid to the development of endoscopic resection of intestinal polyps. In this study, we compared the efficacy and safety of cold snare polypectomy (CSP) and hot snare polypectomy (HSP). To investigate the efficacy and safety of CSP and HSP for colorectal polyps. Between January and December 2020, 301 patients with colorectal polyps 4-9 mm in diameter were treated with endoscopic therapy in our hospital, and were divided into the CSP group (n = 154) and HSP group (n = 147). The operating time, incidence of bleeding and perforation, use of titanium clips, and complete resection rate were compared between the two groups. We included 249 patients (301 polyps). No differences in gender, age, and polyp size, location, shape and type were observed between the CSP and HSP groups, and the resection rates in these two groups were 93.4% and 94.5%, respectively, with no significant difference. The use of titanium clips was 15.6% and 95.9%, the operating time was 3.2 ± 0.5 min and 5.6 ± 0.8 min, the delayed bleeding rate was 0% and 2.0%, and delayed perforation was 0% and 0.7%, in the CSP and HSP groups, respectively. For sessile colorectal polyps < 10 mm, CSP had the same resection rate of impaired tissue integrity as traditional HSP had. The rate of complications was lower in the CSP group. CSP is a safe and effective method for polypectomy.","human_intervention","christiaan"

For this purpose, the following interventional study was designed to investigate the effects of educational programs for students, as well as the changes in diet and physical activity on obesity and components of the metabolic syndrome. This study is part of an interventional research project (elementary school) conducted on all students of Sama schools in Zanjan and Abhar in three levels;elementary, middle and high school, including 1000 individuals in Zanjan (intervention group) and 1000 individuals (control group) in Abhar in 2011. Interventions were based on educating students, teachers and parents, changes in food services and physical activity. We primarily measured anthropometric indices, fasting blood sugar, lipid profiles and blood pressure and completed standard nutrition and physical activity questionnaires. Also, blood insulin levels were randomly measured in a number of students. Data analysis was done by SPSS software Version 16.0. Overall, 589 individuals (252 males, 337 females) entered the case group and 803 individuals (344 males, 459 females) entered the control group. After two years of intervention, the mean waist circumference (63.8±10.9) and diastolic BP (63.8±10.4) were significantly lower, however, the mean systolic BP (10.1.0±12.5), food score (25.0±5.0) and drinking score (12.1±2.3) were higher in the intervention group (p<0.001). Comparing the components of metabolic syndrome between the second year and at the time of recruitment within the intervention group, showed that although the number of overweight/obese individuals, individuals with hypertriglyceridemia and high LDL increased, while those with abdominal obesity, high BP, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance decreased (p<0.001). On the other hand, in the control group, the number of individuals with high BP increased significantly. The prevalence of abdominal obesity and hypertension, which are the two major components of metabolic syndrome, are much higher in our study than the other regions of the country. However, interventions for modification of diet and increasing physical activity, are effective in lowering of their prevalence.","human_intervention","christiaan"

Three groups of pubertal boys aged 13-15 years were recruited, including a control group (which included 13 untrained adolescents), a moderately trained group (which included 13 non-elite weightlifters, with four sessions of 2 hours per week) and a highly trained group (which included 13 elite weightlifters, with eight sessions of 2 hours per week). The three groups were paired for age and maturation index (using Tanner stages). Body composition, bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD were evaluated by dual-energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA). Physical performance variables (including weightlifting specific exercises, counter movement jump and squat jump) were measured using validated methods. Results showed that the values of BMD and physical performance variables were greater in the group of elite weightlifters compared to the group of non-elite weightlifters and the control group. In addition, the values of BMD and physical performance variables were higher in the group of the non-elite weightlifters compared to those of the control group. After adjusting for lean mass and squat jump, lumbar spine BMD, FN BMD, UL BMD and LL BMD remained significantly higher in the elite weightlifters' group compared to the two other groups. In conclusion, the current study suggests that elite adolescent weightlifters have greater bone health parameters compared to moderately-trained adolescent weightlifters and untrained adolescents.","human_intervention","christiaan"
"449",35977054,"Hylocereus undatus flower extract suppresses OVA-induced allergic asthma in BALb/c mice by reducing airway inflammation and modulating gut microbiota.","Asthma is a chronic allergic respiratory disease with limited treatment options. Emerging findings indicate an important interaction between the gut microbiota and the lungs, and that the development of asthma causes changes in the gut environment. Hylocereus undatus flower (HUF) is a traditional Chinese medicine used in the treatment of pulmonary and intestinal diseases. Our previous studies have demonstrated significant anti-asthmatic and anti-inflammatory activity, but the exact mechanism has not been elucidated. In the current study, we validated the potential therapeutic asthma properties of HUF in vivo using an ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma mouse model. We found that HUF treatment significantly reduced the key features of allergic asthma, including an elevated respiratory rate, inflammatory cell accumulation, airway inflammation, and the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules. Histological analysis of mouse lungs showed that HUF attenuated lung inflammatory cell infiltration. Periodic acid-Schiff staining confirmed the reduced mucus secretion in lung mucosa, and Masson's staining confirmed the reduced collagen deposition in the lungs after HUF treatment. Western blot and immunohistochemistry confirmed that HUF increased lung SIRT1 and reduced p38MAPK, NF-κBp65, and caspase-1 proteins. 16 S rDNA sequencing showed that HUF improved the endostasis of the disrupted gut microbiota composition in asthmatic mice. Surprisingly, an inflammatory response was found in the gut of asthmatic mice, along with alterations in inflammation-associated SIRT1 and caspase-1 proteins, and HUF was able to ameliorate these lesions. In conclusion, these findings suggest that HUF may be a new drug candidate for the treatment of allergic asthma.","rodent","christiaan"
"457",35967183,"The Antipyretic Effect of High-Dose Paracetamol Versus Mefenamic Acid in the Treatment of Febrile Children: A Randomized Control Trial.","Introduction Fever is the most common presenting symptom in children and causes distress in patients and parents. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used as antipyretics, they should be reserved for pain or chronic inflammatory conditions due to safety concerns. If we can safely achieve the same antipyretic effect using a higher dose (20 mg/kg) of paracetamol, NSAIDs may be avoided for treating fever. There is a paucity of literature comparing the antipyretic effect of mefenamic acid and high-dose paracetamol. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in the antipyretic effect of high-dose paracetamol and mefenamic acid. Methods In this randomized control trial, 165 febrile children were randomly allocated to one of the following three groups: standard-dose (15 mg/kg) paracetamol (SDPCM) as the control group and high-dose (20 mg/kg) paracetamol (HDPCM) and mefenamic acid (6 mg/kg) (MFN) as the intervention groups. The temperature was measured using a digital thermometer at the start of drug dosage and every 15 minutes until it reached normal. One-way between-group analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare outcome measures such as time for temperature to reach normal, fall of temperature in 60 minutes, and time for the next fever. Post hoc analysis was performed to compare mean differences. Patients were monitored for adverse effects. Results Out of 165 enrolled patients, 159 were analyzed. The baseline demographic data were comparable among the groups. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean time taken for the temperature to reach normal (F-value (F) (2,156)=3.184, p<0.05) and the mean reduction in temperature at 60 minutes (F (2,156)=23.40, p<0.001) among the groups. The mean time for temperature to reach normal in the SDPCM group (97.50±26.60 minutes) was longer than that in the HDPCM (85.09±31.43 minutes) and MFN (84.90±30.42 minutes) groups. The decrease in temperature over 60 minutes was greater in the HDPCM (0.46°C±0.19°C) and MFN (0.45°C±0.11°C) groups than in the SDPCM (0.33°C±0.10°C) group. The time to the next fever spike was shorter for the SDPCM group (5.07±2.66 hours) than for the HDPCM (7.20±3.08 hours) and MFN (8.82±3.83 hours) groups. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that high-dose paracetamol and mefenamic acid had similar and faster antipyretic effects than standard-dose paracetamol. Although the duration of action was found to be longer in the mefenamic acid group, the difference was not statistically significant. There were negligible adverse effects in the groups. Conclusion  Standard-dose paracetamol (15 mg/kg/dose) had a slower and shorter antipyretic effect than high-dose paracetamol (20 mg/kg/dose) and mefenamic acid (6 mg/kg/dose). A single dose of high-dose paracetamol was safe and had a similar antipyretic effect as mefenamic acid. Mefenamic acid may be avoided as an antipyretic and spared for pain and anti-inflammatory indications. Multicentered double-blind clinical trials with larger sample sizes and comparisons of other NSAIDs will be required to confirm these findings.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

In addition, a control group, pregnant rats in other 5 experimental groups (n=12) received orally C. fistula aqueous extract (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg), tween80 (10%) and distilled water during pregnancy up to the delivery (21-23 days). Some serum indices were evaluated in maternal blood samples after delivery. Histopathologic and histomorphometric evaluations were performed on the selected slices of newborn rats. Anthraquinone‎ content of the aqueous extract was 0.34% w/w. Oral LD50 was obtained more than 5000mg/kg. No abortions and newborn anomalies were observed in groups. The height and weight of the offspring were significantly reduced by the administration of 500, and 2000 mg/kg of extract compared to control. There was no significant change in maternal blood urea and creatinine. Higher concentration (2000mg/kg) led to ALT elevation. ALS levels decreased dose-dependency in treatment groups comparing to control. Histopathological findings showed significant lung vascular congestion, and hypertrophy of heart in group tween80, and significant hepatic parenchymal inflammation in tween80 and 2000mg/kg and 1000mg/kg groups. In all tissues of all groups, malpighian body area and bowman's capsule space significantly increased compared to the control group. It seems C. fistula extract is safe in pregnancy. Because of confounding role of tween80 in histopathological finding, more research is necessary.","rodent","christiaan"

To compare clinician-facing interventions to prevent unsafe opioid prescribing in opioid-naive primary care patients with acute noncancer pain. We conducted a multisite, cluster-randomized, 2 × 2 factorial, clinical trial in 3 health care systems that comprised 48 primary care practices and 525 participating clinicians from September 2018 through January 2021. Patient participants were opioid-naive outpatients, 18 years or older, who presented for a qualifying clinic visit with acute noncancer musculoskeletal pain or nonmigraine headache. Practices randomized to: (1) control; (2) opioid justification; (3) monthly clinician comparison emails; or (4) opioid justification and clinician comparison. All groups received opioid prescribing guidelines via the electronic health record at the time of a new opioid prescription. Primary outcome measures were receipt of an initial opioid prescription at the qualifying clinic visit. Other outcomes were opioid prescribing for more than 3 months and a concurrent opioid/benzodiazepine prescription over 12-month follow-up. Among 22 616 enrolled patient participants (9740 women [43.1%]; 64 American Indian/Alaska Native [0.3%]; 590 Asian [2.6%], 1120 Black/African American [5.0%], 1777 Hispanic [7.9%], 225 Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander [1.0%], and 18 981 White [83.9%] individuals), the initial opioid prescribing rates at the qualifying clinic visit were 3.1% in the total sample, 4.2% in control, 3.6% in opioid justification, 2.6% in clinician comparison, and 1.9% in opioid justification and clinician comparison. Compared with control, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for a new opioid prescription was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.46-1.18; P = .20) for opioid justification and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.38-0.96; P = .03) for clinician comparison. Compared with control, clinician comparison was associated with decreased odds of opioid therapy of more than 3 months (aOR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91; P = .001) and concurrent opioid/benzodiazepine prescription (aOR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-1.00; P = .04), whereas opioid justification did not have a significant effect. In this cluster randomized clinical trial, comparison emails decreased the proportion of opioid-naive patients with acute noncancer pain who received an opioid prescription, progressed to treatment with long-term opioid therapy, or were exposed to concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine therapy. Health care systems can consider adding clinician-targeted nudges to other initiatives as an efficient, scalable approach to further decrease potentially unsafe opioid prescribing.

We undertook this study to evaluate the impact of this service on psychiatric outcomes, quality of life, and symptom experience. We performed a longitudinal prospective study comparing patients who had been cared for at our integrated IBD-psychiatry clinic to those who had not. We abstracted demographic and clinical information as well as contemporaneous responses to validated surveys. Thirty-six patients cared for in the IBD psychiatry clinic were compared to a control cohort of 35 IBD patients. There was a significant reduction in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) depression score over time in the study cohort (p = 0.001), though not in the HADS anxiety score. When compared to the control group, the study cohort showed a significant reduction in the HADS depression score. No significant differences were observed in the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index, or Short IBD Questionnaire. This is the first study to evaluate the impact of an integrated psychiatry clinic for IBD patients. Unlike their control counterparts, individuals treated in this clinic had a significant reduction in the mean HADS depression score. Larger scale studies are necessary to verify these findings. However, this study suggests that use of an integrated psychiatry IBD clinic model can result in improvement in mental health outcomes, even in the absence of significant changes in IBD activity.","human_intervention","christiaan"

However, acute and chronic postoperative pain after fixation of mesh with tacks and the cost of tacking devices are major hindrances to the widespread use of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair in resource-poor settings. This study sought to introduce a method of mesh fixation that will reduce the cost of laparoscopic TAPP repair and might help reduce postoperative pain. To compare outcomes in the early postoperative period like pain, seroma, hematoma, urinary retention, and neuralgia after fixation with suture versus the tack fixation of mesh in laparoscopic TAPP repair of inguinal hernia.  Subjects and methods: This study was conducted from 1st June 2019 to 31st May 2020. A total of 144 patients between ages 18 and 60 years with an inguinal hernia on any side and having an American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score of I/II were included in this study. Patients with a recurrent hernia, large scrotal hernia, strangulated and obstructed hernias, ASA III and ASA IV, prostatism, and chronic cough were excluded. Seventy-two patients were in Group A (tack fixation group) while 72 were in Group B (suture fixation group). Separate investigators were assigned to collect pre-operative and post-operative data from both groups, recorded on specially designed proforma.  The age range was 18 to 60 years with a mean age of 46.53 years ±10.01 S.D in Group A and 46.19 ±9.58 S.D in Group B. In Group A 98.6% of patients were male, and 1.4% were females while in Group B 100% of patients were male. It was found that mean pain in Group A was 4.88 ±0.887 and 5.29± 0.777 at 6 hours and 24 hours respectively. Mean pain in group B was 3.43 ±0.962 and 4.11±0.703 at 6 hours and 24 hours respectively. Moreover, mean pain in Group B was significantly less than mean pain in Group A both at 6 hours and 24 hours intervals with a p-value < 0.001. The early postoperative complications were not significantly different in both groups.  Conclusion: In TAPP repair, suture fixation of mesh is less painful than tack fixation. However, there is no significant difference in the rate of other early postoperative outcomes like seroma, hematoma, urinary retention, and neuralgia. Further multicentric studies with a longer duration of follow-up are needed to validate our results.","human_intervention","christiaan"

All patients underwent thin-layer computed tomography examination before the operation, and then 3D reconstruction was performed with Mimics 20.0 software. The radian and curvature of the pectus bar were designed according to the reconstructed images. Afterward, the images were imported into the light-curing 3D printer in STL format for slice printing. Hence that the personalized operation scheme, including the size of the pectus bar and the surgical approach, can be made according to the 3D printed model. The thoracoscopic-assisted Nuss operation was completed by bilateral incisions. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative hospitalization were counted and analyzed. The satisfaction of the surgery was evaluated according to the Haller index and the most posterior sternal compression sternovertebral distance. The surgeries were successfully completed in 10 patients without a transfer to open procedure. The average operation time was (56 ± 8.76) min, the intraoperative blood loss was (23.5 ± 11.07) mL, and the postoperative hospitalization was (7.2 ± 0.92) d. There were no serious complications or death during the perioperative period. Compared with the data before the operation, the most posterior sternal compression sternovertebral distance was larger, and the Haller index was lower, the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). 3D reconstruction technology combined with 3D printing, which can be used before operation, contributes to the operator performing thoracoscopic-assisted Nuss operation safely and effectively, which has productive clinical application value for the treatment of pectus excavatum.","human_intervention","christiaan"

For this study, we used two transgenic mouse models of HCC induced by protooncogenes, MYC, and MET. Biochemical data have shown that tumors induced by MYC have increased levels of glutamine metabolism compared to those induced by MET. One-hour dynamic [18F]FGln PET data were acquired and reconstructed for fasted MYC mice (n = 11 tumors from 7 animals), fasted MET mice (n = 8 tumors from 6 animals), fasted FVBN controls (n = 8 normal liver regions from 6 animals), nonfasted MYC mice (n = 16 tumors from 6 animals), and nonfasted FVBN controls (n = 8 normal liver regions from 3 animals). The influx rate constants (K 1) using the one-tissue compartment model were derived for each tumor with the left ventricular blood pool input function. Influx rate constants were significantly higher for MYC tumors (K 1 = 0.374 ± 0.133) than for MET tumors (K 1 = 0.141 ± 0.058) under fasting conditions (P = 0.0002). Rate constants were also significantly lower for MET tumors (K 1 = 0.141 ± 0.135) than normal livers (K 1 = 0.332 ± 0.179) under fasting conditions (P = 0.0123). Fasting conditions tested for MYC tumors and normal livers did not result in any significant difference with P values > 0.005. Higher influx rate constants corresponded to elevated levels of glutamine metabolism as determined by biochemical assays. The data showed that there is a distinctive difference in glutamine metabolism between MYC and MET tumors. Our study has demonstrated the potential of [18F]FGln PET imaging as a tool to assess glutamine metabolism in HCC tumors in vivo with a caution that it may not be able to clearly distinguish HCC tumors from normal liver tissue.","rodent","christiaan"

Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the serum phosphate level immediately after hemodialysis (HD) and its association with some clinical complications in CKD patients. The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 54 eligible CKD patients undergoing regular hemodialysis. Blood samples were taken, prior to the start and immediately after the end of hemodialysis to determine the serum levels of urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, PTH, blood sugar and albumin. Moreover, the clinical complications of patients including muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, weakness and inability to speak are assessed by a questionnaire, before and after HD. As we expected, the mean of serum creatinine, urea and phosphate levels significantly decreased after dialysis. Post-dialysis hypophosphatemia was graded as mild (3.5 > P ≥ 2.5 mg/dl), moderate (2.5 > P ≥ 1 mg/dl), and severe (<1 mg/dl) based on serum phosphate levels. The frequency of mild and moderate hypophosphatemia was 39.2% and 45.1 %, respectively. None of the participants had severe hypophosphatemia and 13.7% had normal phosphate levels. There was a significant correlation between post-dialysis hypophosphatemia and incidence of nausea and confusion after adjusting for confounding factors. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the possible association of some of the post-dialysis clinical complications with hypophosphatemia was investigated. Future large-scale studies are required to confirm the association of post-dialysis hypophosphatemia with clinical complications.","human_intervention","christiaan"

To optimize the limited efficacy of curcumin and to improve its protective effects against PD, we prepared and tested a novel curcumin oil solution. In vivo imaging was used to confirm that the curcumin oil solution has higher bioavailability than curcumin alone. To test its motor effects on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced movement disorders, behavioral tests, including the open-field test, pole test, rotarod test, and automated gait analysis were used. Finally, pathological evaluation using immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis was done. Encouragingly, the behavioral test findings exhibited a better protective effect against MPTP-induced movement disorders. In addition, it had a greater protective effect on dopaminergic neurons in the compact part of the substantia nigra along with the PD process according to pathological evaluation. This novel curcumin oil solution may provide a new choice for PD prevention as a dietary supplement or clinically assisted treatment based on its better bioavailability and efficiency.","rodent","christiaan"

Lipids exert essential functions in biological processes; however, the role of lipids in CU remains unclear. Nontargeted lipidomics was performed to investigate the differential lipid profiles between CU patients and healthy control (HC) subjects. Functional validation studies were performed in vitro and in vivo including β-hexosaminidase release examination from mast cells and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) mouse model. We detected dramatically altered glycerophospholipids in CU patients compared with HCs. Phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) were increased, while phosphatidylcholine (PC) was reduced in CU patients. The reduction in PC was related to a high weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7), while PS was positively associated with the dermatology life quality index (DLQI). We also identified the differential lipid profiles between chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), symptomatic dermographism (SD), and CSU coexist with SD. CU patients were classified into two subtypes (subtype 1 and subtype 2) based on consensus clustering of lipid profiling. Compared with patients in subtype 2, patients in subtype 1 had elevated levels of PC (18:0e/18:2) and PE (38:2), and lower urticaria control test (UCT) scores indicated worse clinical efficiency of secondary generation H1 antihistamines treatment. Importantly, we found that supplementation with PC could attenuate IgE-induced immune responses in mast cells. In general, We described the landscape of plasma lipid alterations in CU patients and provided novel insights into the role of PC in mast cells.","rodent","christiaan"

It is assumed that the prevalence might increase due to climatic change and deterioration of protective ozone barrier. With the chances of increasing prevalence, newer and specific treatment options need to be explored. Skin is a constant target of oxidative stress owing to continuous exposure to ultraviolet radiations. Oxidative stress is considered to have a central role in dermatological diseases, including psoriasis. This study was designed to explore the role of Humanin analogue (S14-G HNG) as an important anti oxidant for psoriasis like condition in BALB/c mice as till date the commomly used drugs for this disease are corticosteroids which have a dissatisfactory adverse effect profile in terms of chronic use. Imiquimod 5% was used to induce Psoriasis like condition in mice, and the role of HNG was assessed through the histological examination, protein expressions and markers of oxidative stress. Two doses (low and high) of HNG were used and results were compared with an established drug methylprednisolone. Significant improvement was seen on histology, PASI scoring, protein expression and oxidative stress by the use of intraperitoneal injections of S14-G HNG and the results were comparable to those obtained through peritoneal injections of methylprednisolone. S14G-HNG can be considered as a suitable option for treatment of Psoriasis after clinical trials and it might prove to have lesser side effects as compared to other drugs employed for the treatment of psoriasis being an innate anti oxidant and anti apoptotic compound.","rodent","christiaan"

Some side effects have been seen during these treatments, besides Helicobacter pylori becoming resistant to these antibiotics easily. According to some studies, there is a relationship between metformin and reduction in Helicobacter pylori infection. Thus, in this study, we determine the effects of metformin on Helicobacter pylori infection. We performed this assessment in a randomized, case-controlled way in the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infected outpatients and inpatients. In both groups (case group and control group), patients took two tablets for a two-week period. In the case group, the patients were given two metformin tablets (each containing 500mg of metformin (extended release) and in the control group, they were given two placebo tablets (each containing 500mg of white flour). We took h.pylori Ag stool test and rapid urease test to confirm the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. In this study, at first all the patients had positive h.pylori Ag stool test or positive rapid urease test. At the end of this study, the results of h.pylori Ag stool*- test presented that Helicobacter pylori infection was negative in 82.7% of the case group patients and 76% of control group patients which illustrates suppression of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, comparing to the control group (P=0.36), this difference was not statistically remarkable. According to these findings, it is stated that having metformin along with prescribed antibiotics can help decrease Helicobacter pylori infection.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

To improve patient care and reduce healthcare expenditures, interventions to reduce surgical infections must be employed. The crystalline C-band ultraviolet (UV-C) air filtration technology (Aerobiotix Inc., Miamisburg, OH, USA) has been designed to reduce airborne bioburden through high-quality filtration and germicidal irradiation. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of a novel UV-C air filtration device to reduce airborne particle counts and contamination of surgical instrument trays in an operating room (OR) setting. Materials and methods Thirty sterile instrument trays were opened in a positive-air-flow OR. The trays were randomly assigned to one of two groups (UV-C or control, n=15 per group). In the UV-C group, the UV-C filtration device was used and in the control, it was not. All trays were opened with the use of a sterile technique and left exposed in the OR for four hours. Air was sampled by a particle counter to measure the numbers of 5µm and 10µm particles. Culture specimens were obtained from the trays to assess for bacterial contamination. Outcome data were collected at 30-minute intervals for the duration of the four-hour study period. Results Use of the UV-C device resulted in statistically significant reductions in the numbers of 5µm (average of 64.9% reduction when compared with the control, p<0.001) and 10µm (average of 65.7% reduction when compared with the control, p<0.001)-sized particles detectable in the OR. There was no significant difference in the overall rates of contamination (33.3% in the control group vs. 26.7% in the UV-C group, p=1.0) or the time to contamination (mean survival of 114 minutes in the control group vs. 105 minutes in the UV-C group, p=0.72) of surgical instrument trays with the use of the UV-C device. Conclusions The results demonstrate that the UV-C filtration device can successfully reduce airborne bioburden in standard ORs, suggesting that it may have the potential to reduce the risk for wound and hardware infections. Further clinical trials are necessary to better determine the effect of this air filtration system on postoperative infection rates.","randomized_trial","christiaan"
"575",35966785,"Enriched environment ameliorates propagation of tau pathology and improves cognition in rat model of tauopathy.","The typical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are cognitive impairment, disrupted spatial orientation, behavioral and psychiatric abnormalities, and later motor deficits. Neuropathologically, AD is characterized by deposits of pathological forms of endogenous proteins - amyloid-β, and neurofibrillary tau protein pathology. The latter closely correlates with brain atrophy and clinical impairment. Pharmacological therapies for these pathologies are largely absent, raising the question whether non-pharmacological interventions could be efficacious. Environmental factors can play a role in the manifestation of AD. It is unknown whether enriched environment (EE) can ameliorate the propagation of protein aggregates or their toxic components. We injected insoluble tau extracts from human brains with AD (600 or 900 ng per animal) into hippocampi of SHR72 transgenic rats that express non-mutated truncated human tau 151-391/4R, but usually do not develop hippocampal tangles. The rats had either standard housing, or could access an EE 5×/week for 3 months. Behavioral analysis included the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Histological analysis was used to assess the propagation of tau pathology. Animals exposed to EE performed better in the MWM (spatial acquisition duration and total distance, probe test); unexposed animals improved over the course of acquisition trials, but their mean performance remained below that of the EE group. Enriched environment abrogated tau propagation and hippocampal tangle formation in the 600 ng group; in the 900 ng group, tangle formation was ∼10-fold of the 600 ng group, and unaffected by EE. Even a small difference in the amount of injected human AD tau can cause a pronounced difference in the number of resulting tangles. EE leads to a noticeably better spatial navigation performance of tau-injected animals. Furthermore, EE seems to be able to slow down tau pathology progression, indicating the possible utility of similar interventions in early stages of AD where tangle loads are still low.","rodent","christiaan"

Accumulating evidence indicates that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a core lesion in AD and persistent ER stress promotes AD pathology and impairs cognition. However, whether the imbalance of the gut microbiota is involved in triggering the ER stress in the brain remains unknown. In the present study, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed with gut microbiota from AD patients and APP/PS1 mice, respectively, resulting in two mouse models with dysregulated gut microbiota. The ER stress marker protein levels in the cerebral cortex were assessed using western blotting. The composition of the gut microbiota was assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Excessive ER stress was induced in the cerebral cortex of mice after FMT. Elevated ER stress marker proteins (p-perk/perk, p-eIF2α/eIF2α) were observed, which were rescued by 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB). Notably, DMB is a compound that significantly attenuates serum trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite of the gut microbiota widely reported to affect cognition. The findings indicate that imbalance of the gut microbiota induces ER stress in the cerebral cortex, which may be mediated by TMAO.","rodent","christiaan"

Various novel therapies have been developed to treat nonhealing ulcers. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) has been developed in the recent era initially in the dental world for treating oral ulcers. Now, the role of PRF is strongly established in treating nonhealing ulcers. PRF has an aggregate of a myriad of growth factors and cytokines that stimulate healing of the wounds. In this study, we have compared the efficacy of PRF in treating nonhealing ulcers of the lower limb against normal saline dressings. Aims and objectives This study aims to determine the efficacy of platelet-rich fibrin over normal saline dressings in the treatment of nonhealing ulcers of the lower limb by comparing the percentage reduction in the surface area of wounds after treatment in both groups. Methods Fifty patients with nonhealing ulcers were selected and randomly divided into two groups with 25 patients in each group. Cases were treated with PRF dressings weekly for a period of six weeks. Controls were treated with normal saline dressings weekly for a period of six weeks. The percentage reduction in the size of the ulcer after treatment was recorded in both groups and compared. Patients of age 18-60 with nonhealing ulcers of the lower limb of >12 weeks duration have been included in the study. Patients having wounds with active infection, wound size > 35 cm2, uncontrolled diabetes, peripheral vascular disease with Ankle-Brachial Index < 0.9, osteomyelitis of the underlying bone, and immunocompromised state, and patients on antiplatelet drugs have been excluded from the study. Results The mean age of the patients included in the study was 42.88 ± 2.73 years. The mean initial surface of the wound​​​ was 14.95 ± 3.08 cm2 among cases and 13.28 ± 2.83 cm2 among controls. The mean surface area of the wound after six weeks was 1.59 ± 0.78 cm2 among cases and 11.08 ± 2.74 cm2 among controls. The mean percentage reduction in the wound size after six weeks of treatment was 89.3% among cases and is significantly higher than in the normal saline group (16.5%) (Mdn = 14.63, U = 23, p < 0.00001). Conclusion Platelet-rich fibrin is an emerging potential topical agent for the treatment of nonhealing ulcers of the lower limbs and is more effective than normal saline dressings and also has the advantage of being cost-effective.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

Characterized by severe immune cell derangements, sepsis is often associated with multiorgan dysfunction. For many sepsis survivors, these deficits can persist long after clinical resolution of the underlying infection. Although many studies report on the impact of sepsis on individual immune cell subtypes, a comprehensive analysis of sepsis-induced alterations within and across the immune cell landscape is lacking. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to assess sepsis-associated transcriptional changes in immune cells isolated from bone marrow at single-cell resolution. We used a high-survival fecal-induced peritonitis sepsis model using Friend leukemia virus B mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing classified 3402 single cells from control subjects into 14 clusters representing long-term hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), short-term HSC, basophil, dendritic cell, eosinophil, erythroblast, erythrocyte, macrophage, neutrophil, natural killer cell, plasma cell, plasmacytoid dendritic cell, pre-B cell, and T memory cell lineages. One day following experimentally induced sepsis, cell type compositions shifted significantly and included notable decreases in HSC and myeloid cell abundance. In addition to proportional cell composition changes, acute sepsis induced significant transcriptional alterations in most immune cell types analyzed-changes that failed to completely resolve 1 month after sepsis. Taken together, we report widespread and persistent transcriptional changes in diverse immune cells in response to polymicrobial infection. This study will serve as a valuable resource for future work investigating acute and/or long-term sepsis-associated immune cell derangements.","rodent","christiaan"
"602",35966798,"Attenuation of HECT-E3 ligase expression rescued memory deficits in 3xTg-AD mice.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorders that cause deterioration of cognitive functions. Recent studies suggested that the accumulation of inflammatory molecules and impaired protein degradation mechanisms might both play a critical role in the progression of AD. Autophagy is a major protein degradation pathway that can be controlled by several HECT-E3 ligases, which then regulates the expression of inflammatory molecules. E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to be upregulated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we studied the expressional change of HECT-E3 ligase using M01 on autophagy and inflammasome pathways in the context of AD pathogenesis. Our results demonstrated that the M01 treatment reversed the working memory deficits in 3xTg-AD mice when examined with the T-maze and reversal learning with the Morris water maze. Additionally, the electrophysiology recordings indicated that M01 treatment enhanced the long-term potentiation in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. Together with the improved memory performance, the expression levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome protein were decreased. On the other hand, autophagy-related molecules were increased in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. Furthermore, the protein docking analysis indicated that the binding affinity of M01 to the WWP1 and NEDD4 E3 ligases was the highest among the HECT family members. The western blot analysis also confirmed the decreased expression level of NEDD4 protein in the M01-treated 3xTg-AD mice. Overall, our results demonstrate that the modulation of HECT-E3 ligase expression level can be used as a strategy to treat early memory deficits in AD by decreasing NLRP3 inflammasome molecules and increasing the autophagy pathway.","rodent","christiaan"

Patients generally respond quickly and perfectly to standard antiepileptic drugs but lifelong medication is necessary. Sodium valproate is the drug of choice in most references but it has some adverse reactions and some patients cannot tolerate the complications. Because of the need for life long treatment in this young aged group particularly child bearing women, we aimed to analyze the efficacy of these drugs to determine which has better efficacy with lower adverse effects. In this double-blind clinical trial 102 patients suffering from juvenile myoclonic epilepsy were randomly divided to three groups and treated with valproate, levetiracetam or lamotrigine and followed for 12 months at specified intervals. Patients' mean age was 22.8 years and 28.4% of them were males and 71.6% were females. Effective terminal dose of sodium valproate, levetiracetam and lamotrigine were 1000, 1000 and 250mg, respectively. The rate of failure in controlling seizures and myoclonic jerks in lamotrigine group was meaningfully more than levetiracetam and sodium valproate (P=0.037).The general side effects of sodium valproate were much more; but there was not any significant difference between their effects on electroencephalogram (EEG) findings (P=0.81). Levetiracetam and sodium valproate have similar efficacy. But in the group of lamotrigine, rate of failure, myoclonus and drug adverse reactions were meaningfully more than sodium valproate and levetiracetam. According to our study, lamotrigine could not be a suitable treatment option for JME patients as a mono therapy.

Dietary lipids are the main source of brain lipids and thus contribute to the brain lipidome. Human milk is the only source of a dietary lipids for exclusively breastfed infant. Notably, it contains milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) enriched in polar lipids (PL). While early life is a key for early brain development, the interplay between dietary intake of polar lipids and spatial dynamics of lipid distribution during brain development is poorly understood. Here, we carried out an exploratory study to assess the early postnatal temporal profiling of brain lipidome between postnatal day (PND) 7 and PND 50 using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization as a mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) in an in vivo preclinical model. We also assessed the effect of chronic supplementation with PL extracted from alpha-lactalbumin-enriched whey protein concentrate (WPC) containing 10% lipids, including major lipid classes found in the brain (37% phospholipids and 15% sphingomyelin). MALDI-MSI of the spatial and temporal accretion of lipid species during brain development showed that the brain lipidome is changing heterogeneously along time during brain development. In addition, increases in 400+ PL supplement-dependent lipids were observed. PL supplementation had significant spatial and temporal effect on specific fatty esters, glycerophosphocholines, glycerophosphoethanolamines, and phosphosphingolipids. Interestingly, the average levels of these lipids per brain area tended to be constant in various brain structures across the age groups, paralleling the general brain growth. In contrast, other lipids, such as cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol, diacylglycerophosphates, phosphocholines, specific ether-phosphoethanolamines, phosphosphingolipids, glycerophosphoinositols, and glycerophosphoserines showed clear age-dependent changes uncoupled from the general brain growth. These results suggest that the dietary PL supplementation may preferentially provide the building blocks for the general brain growth during development. Our findings add to the understanding of brain-nutrient relations, their temporospatial dynamics, and potential impact on neurodevelopment.","rodent","christiaan"

Despite advancements in prevention and therapy, quality of life remains poor for many HF patients due to associated target organ damage. Pulmonary manifestations of HF are well-established. However, difficulties in the treatment of HF patients with chronic lung phenotypes remain as the underlying patho-mechanistic links are still incompletely understood. Here, we aim to investigate the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) involvement in lung inflammation during HF, a concept that may provide new mechanism-based therapies for HF patients with pulmonary complications. In a mouse model of HF, pharmacological CFTR corrector therapy (Lumacaftor (Lum)) was applied systemically or lung-specifically for 2 weeks, and the lungs were analyzed using histology, flow cytometry, western blotting, and qPCR. Experimental HF associated with an apparent lung phenotype characterized by vascular inflammation and remodeling, pronounced tissue inflammation as evidenced by infiltration of pro-inflammatory monocytes, and a reduction of pulmonary CFTR+ cells. Moreover, the elevation of a classically-activated phenotype of non-alveolar macrophages coincided with a cell-specific reduction of CFTR expression. Pharmacological correction of CFTR with Lum mitigated the HF-induced downregulation of pulmonary CFTR expression and increased the proportion of CFTR+ cells in the lung. Lum treatment diminished the HF-associated elevation of classically-activated non-alveolar macrophages, while promoting an alternatively-activated macrophage phenotype within the lungs. Collectively, our data suggest that downregulation of CFTR in the HF lung extends to non-alveolar macrophages with consequences for tissue inflammation and vascular structure. Pharmacological CFTR correction possesses the capacity to alleviate HF-associated lung inflammation.","rodent","christiaan"

As many children have difficulties with STEM topic areas, and as these topics have suffered a decline in uptake in students, it is worthwhile to find out how learning and performance can be enhanced at an early age. The current study is the first to investigate if dog-assisted and relaxation interventions can improve spatial abilities in school children. It makes a novel contribution to empirical research by measuring longitudinally if an Animal-Assisted Intervention (AAI) or relaxation intervention can boost children's development of spatial abilities. Randomized controlled trials were employed over time including dog intervention, relaxation intervention and no treatment control groups. Interventions were carried out over 4 weeks, twice a week for 20 min. Children were tested in mainstream schools (N = 105) and in special educational needs (SEN) schools (N = 64) before and after interventions, after 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. To assess intervention type and to provide advice for subsequent best practice recommendations, dog-assisted interventions were run as individual or small group interventions. Overall, children's spatial abilities improved over the year with highest increases in the first 4 months. In Study 1, typically developing children showed higher scores and more continuous learning overall compared to children with special educational needs. Children in the dog intervention group showed higher spatial ability scores immediately after interventions and after a further 6 weeks (short-term). Children in the relaxation group also showed improved scores short-term after relaxation intervention. In contrast, the no treatment control group did not improve significantly. No long-term effects were observed. Interestingly, no gender differences could be observed in mainstream school children's spatial skills. In study 2, children in SEN schools saw immediate improvements in spatial abilities after relaxation intervention sessions. No changes were seen after dog interventions or in the no treatment control group. Participants' pet ownership status did not have an effect in either cohort. These are the first findings showing that AAI and relaxation interventions benefit children's spatial abilities in varied educational settings. This research represents an original contribution to Developmental Psychology and to the field of Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) and is an important step towards further in-depth investigation of how AAI and relaxation interventions can help children achieve their learning potential, both in mainstream schools and in schools for SEN.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

Materials & methods Forty-four patients who needed extraction of impacted mandibular third molar were arbitrarily categorized into four groups namely, piroxicam, diclofenac, paracetamol with tramadol, and placebo. The test medicine was given one hour preoperatively before the surgical removal. The pain was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale (VRS) scores preoperatively and at the third and 24th hours. The time required for escape analgesia was measured.  Results The mean VAS and VRS scores showed significant differences across the groups after 24 hours. The mean score was lowest for the patients taking piroxicam (1.30+1.95) and highest for patients taking tramadol + paracetamol (4.50+2.59). As far as escape analgesia is concerned piroxicam group was by far superior. Conclusion The pain scores and the rescue analgesic requirement suggested that piroxicam analgesic significantly reduced pain; moreover, it is a safe as well as an efficacious substitute to the conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for mandibular third molar impactions.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

Therapies that protect mitochondrial number and function have the potential to impact the progression of conditions such as diabetic neuropathy. We therefore assessed indices of mitochondrial function in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and brain cortex of the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat model of type 2 diabetes and tested the therapeutic impact of a neurogenic compound, NSI-189, on both mitochondrial function and indices of peripheral and central neurological dysfunction. ZDF rats were maintained for 16 weeks of untreated diabetes before the start of oral treatment with NSI-189 for an additional 16 weeks. Nerve conduction velocity, sensitivity to tactile and thermal stimuli, and behavioral assays of cognitive function were assessed monthly. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, mitochondrial protein levels, and respiratory complex activities were assessed in the DRG and brain cortex after 16 weeks of treatment with NSI-189. Treatment with NSI-189 selectively elevated the expression of protein subunits of complexes III and V and activities of respiratory complexes I and IV in the brain cortex, and this was accompanied by amelioration of impaired memory function and plasticity. In the sensory ganglia of ZDF rats, loss of AMPK activity was ameliorated by NSI-189, and this was accompanied by reversal of multiple indices of peripheral neuropathy. Efficacy of NSI-189 against dysfunction of the CNS and PNS function in type 2 diabetic rats was accompanied by improvement of mitochondrial function. NSI-189 exhibited actions at different levels of mitochondrial regulation in central and peripheral tissues.","rodent","christiaan"

This study examines the horizontal stability of the ACJ after a complete dislocation was repaired using one of two Ethibond suture techniques, the loop technique and the two holes in the clavicle technique. In this single-blind, randomized clinical trial, 104 patients diagnosed with complete ACJ dislocation type V were treated using Ethibond sutures with either the loop technique or the two holes in the clavicle technique. Horizontal changes in the ACJ were radiographically assessed in the lateral axial view, and shoulder function was evaluated by the Constant (CS) and Taft (TS) scores at intervals of 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The horizontal stability of the ACJ was better with the two-hole technique than the loop technique at all measurement times. CS and TS changes showed a significant upward trend over time with both techniques. The mean CS and TS at the final visit were 95.2 and 11.6 with the loop technique and 94 and 11.9 with the two-hole technique, respectively. The incidence of superficial infections caused by the subcutaneous pins was the same in the two groups. Due to the improved ACJ stability with the two-hole technique, it appears to be a more suitable option than the loop technique for AC joint reduction.","randomized_trial","christiaan"
"785",35972083,"Comparison of Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Videoangiography vs Postoperative Catheter Angiography to Confirm Microsurgical Occlusion of Spinal Dorsal Intradural Arteriovenous Fistulas.","Dorsal intradural arteriovenous fistulas (DI-AVFs) represent 80% of spinal AVFs. Microsurgical clip occlusion is a durable treatment that uses preoperative and postoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as standard practice. Intraoperative indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-VA) is a valuable intraoperative adjunct in these cases. Intraoperative ICG-VA findings have not been compared with postoperative DSA findings. To assess the diagnostic value of intraoperative ICG-VA vs postoperative DSA for spinal DI-AVFs. A multi-institutional database of vascular malformations was queried for all surgically managed cases of DI-AVF. Patients with both intraoperative ICG-VA and postoperative DSA were included. Demographic and radiologic data, intraoperative findings, and surgical outcomes data were retrospectively analyzed. Forty-five patients with DI-AVF were identified (male sex, 32; mean age, 61.9 [range, 26-85] years). All DI-AVFs were treated with interruption of the fistula with clip occlusion of the draining vein. Intraoperative ICG-VA showed complete obliteration in all patients. Postoperative DSA was performed for 40 patients and confirmed complete obliteration in all patients. The negative predictive value of ICG-VA confirming complete occlusion of the DI-AVFs was 100%. Eighteen patients (47%) experienced clinical improvement, and 16 (42%) experienced no change in condition. ICG-VA is useful for intraoperative identification of DI-AVFs and confirmation of complete microsurgical occlusion. Correlation between intraoperative ICG-VA and postoperative DSA findings demonstrates the diagnostic power of ICG-VA. This finding suggests that postoperative DSA is unnecessary when intraoperative ICG-VA confirms complete occlusion of the DI-AVF, which will spare patients the procedural risk and cost of this invasive procedure.","human_intervention","christiaan"

The main aim of this study was to develop a protocol for pain control in the management of OSMF postoperatively. This was a prospective, parallel with active control, double-arm, triple-blinded, randomised control trial (RCT) with 48 OSMF patients, randomised into two groups - Group A (control, n = 25): received non-opioid analgesics (NSAIDs) and Group B (cases, n = 23): received transdermal fentanyl patches (TFP). Pain and interincisal opening were measured on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 15, and on the1st and 3rd postoperative months. Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed preoperatively, on the 15th day postoperatively, and 3rd month postoperatively, and compliance was documented postoperatively on the 9th day. The transdermal fentanyl patch was found to have statistically significantly more effect in controlling severe pain during active mouth opening exercises, and thus significantly increased the patients' compliance. Although there was increased mouth opening and QoL in the fentanyl group, the differences were statistically insignificant. Our study recommends the use of TFP for better pain control and compliance in postoperative OSMF patients.","randomized_trial","christiaan"
"793",35983393,"Evaluation of the Antinociceptive Action of Simvastatin in Mice.","Statins are well-established agents for dyslipidemia and have successfully been used for the prevention of coronary artery diseases for a long time; this is attributed not only to their lipid-lowering action but also to their pleiotropic actions. Recently many pleiotropic actions of statins have been explored, but very few studies were done to explore statins' antinociceptive action; therefore, the current study was planned to evaluate the antinociceptive activity of Simvastatin in different pain models in mice. Antinociceptive activity of Simvastatin was evaluated by using Eddy's hot plate method (central analgesic model), acetic acid-induced writhing method (peripheral analgesic model), and biphasic formalin-induced paw licking method. Twenty-four mice were divided into four groups (n = 6 in each): Vehicle control group, simvastatin 5mg/kg, simvastatin 20mg/kg, and positive control group. In the hot plate method, as compared to the vehicle control group, Simvastatin 20mg/kg group showed a significant rise in the reaction time to the corresponding time interval (p<0.001). While the simvastatin 5mg/kg group did not show any significant analgesic activity in the hot plate test. In the acetic acid writhing method, both test groups show a significant delay in the onset of writhing and a decrease in the number of writhes as compared to the vehicle control group (P<0.001). While in the formalin test, both groups show dose-dependent analgesic activity in both the early and late phases. Simvastatin exhibits analgesic activity in both central as well as peripheral models of analgesia, but central analgesia shows only at higher concentrations. Similarly, it inhibits inflammatory pain more predominantly than neurogenic, and hence simvastatin can be used in inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis particularly when there is coexisting dyslipidemia.","rodent","christiaan"

Recently, immune mechanisms involved in hepatic IRI have attracted increased attention of investigators working in this area. In specific, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), have been strongly implicated in mediating type 2 inflammation. However, their immune mechanisms as involved with hepatic IRI remain unclear. Here, we reported that the population of ILC2s is increased with the development of hepatic IRI as shown in a mouse model in initial stage. Moreover, M2 type CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophages increased and reached maximal levels at 24 h followed by a significant elevation in IL-4 levels. We injected exogenous IL-33 into the tail vein of mice as a mean to stimulate ILC2s production. This stimulation of ILC2s resulted in a protective effect upon hepatic IRI along with an increase in M2 type CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophages. In contrast, depletion of ILC2s as achieved with use of an anti-CD90.2 antibody substantially abolished this protective effect of exogenous IL-33 and M2 type CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophage polarization in hepatic IRI. Therefore, this exogenous IL-33 induced potentiation of ILC2s appears to regulate the polarization of CD45+CD11b+F4/80high macrophages to alleviate IRI. Such findings provide the foundation for the development of new targets and strategies in the treatment of hepatic IRI.","rodent","christiaan"

Healthy male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into control diet group (CS) and PS diet group (2% PS). After 28 weeks of continuous feeding, serums, livers, and lungs were collected for targeted free sterols quantification, biochemical tests, lipid profile detection, and RNA-seq analysis. Compared with the CS group, 2% PS supplementation significantly increased campesterol concentrations and its ratio to cholesterol in the serum, liver, and lung of mice, with cholestanol concentrations and its ratio to cholesterol decreased. Total cholesterol (TC) levels were reduced in the serum of the PS group (p < 0.05), with the triglyceride (TG) levels unchanged. In response to the decreased circulating cholesterol concentration, the expression of endogenous cholesterol synthesis genes was upregulated in the liver, but caused no obvious lipid accumulation and inflammatory cell infiltration. However, for peripheral tissues, long-term PS-fed mice exhibited diminished cholesterol synthesis, fatty acid transport, and oxidation in the lung. The results provided clear indication that 2% PS diet effectively reduced circulating TC levels in the healthy mice, with tissue-specific lipid metabolic regulation in the liver and the lung.","rodent","christiaan"

To assess the effectiveness of the intervention following intragastric injection of various dosages of LBLF (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg⋅bw), obese model mice developed via a high-fat diet were utilized. Treatment for LBLF may decrease body weight gain, Lee's index, serum lipids levels, oxidative stress levels, and hepatic lipids levels. It may also enhance fecal lipids excretion and improve glucose tolerance. Additionally, LBLF therapy significantly restored gut dysfunction brought on by a high-fat diet by boosting gut bacterial diversities and altering the composition of the gut bacterial community by elevating probiotics and reducing harmful bacteria.","rodent","christiaan"

This neurodegenerative process is triggered by the deposition of protein aggregates in the brain, which are mainly constituted of α-synuclein. Several studies have indicated that neuroinflammation is required to develop the neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease. Notably, the neuroinflammatory process involves microglial activation as well as the infiltration of peripheral T cells into the substantia nigra (SN). This work analyzes a mouse model of Parkinson's disease that recapitulates microglial activation, T-cell infiltration into the SN, the neurodegeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, and motor impairment. This mouse model of Parkinson's disease is induced by the stereotaxic delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors encoding the human wild-type α-synuclein (AAV-hαSyn) into the SN. The correct delivery of viral vectors into the SN was confirmed using control vectors encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). Afterward, how the dose of AAV-hαSyn administered in the SN affected the extent of hαSyn expression, the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons, and motor impairment were evaluated. Moreover, the dynamics of hαSyn expression, microglial activation, and T-cell infiltration were determined throughout the time course of disease development. Thus, this study provides critical time points that may be useful for targeting synuclein pathology and neuroinflammation in this preclinical model of Parkinson's disease.","rodent","christiaan"

Laparoscopic omentectomy is often undertaken as a salvage procedure in case of malfunctioning catheters. However, there is no randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the role of prophylactic laparoscopic omentectomy on catheter function. This pilot RCT was undertaken to evaluate the impact of laparoscopic omentectomy on the incidence of catheter malfunction. Consecutive patients were randomized into three groups: laparoscopic PDCI with omentectomy (Group A), laparoscopic PDCI without omentectomy (Group B) and open surgical PDCI (Group C). The primary outcome was the incidence of catheter malfunction at 6 weeks and 3 months. Forty-one patients completed follow-up, with 16, 11, and 14 patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. Incidence of catheter malfunction was 6.2%, 27.3%, and 14.3% in Groups A, B, and C, respectively, at 6 weeks and 6.2%, 36.4%, and 21.4% at 3 months, respectively. In patients with previously failed catheter insertion (n = 23), malfunction at 3 months was 8.3% (1/12) in patients who had omentectomy, compared with 45.5% (5/11) in those who did not (P = 0.069). Operating time was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in Group A. Laparoscopic omentectomy may be associated with a lower incidence of catheter malfunction, especially in patients with previously failed peritoneal dialysis catheter. Data from this pilot RCT can be used to design a large trial with an adequate number of patients.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

Alterations of the microbiota, known as dysbiosis, can direct reactivity to self-antigens not only in the intestinal mucosa but also at the systemic level. Our laboratory previously reported gut dysbiosis, particularly lower abundance of bacteria in the family Lactobacillaceae, in lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, a model of systemic autoimmunity. Restoring the microbiota with a mix of 5 different Lactobacillus species (spp.), L. reuteri, L. oris, L. johnsonii, L. gasseri and L. rhamnosus, attenuated lupus-liked clinical signs, including splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. However, our understanding of the mechanism was limited. In this study, we first investigated the effects of individual species. Surprisingly, none of the species individually recapitulated the benefits of the mix. Instead, Lactobacillus spp. acted synergistically to attenuate splenomegaly and renal lymphadenopathy through secreted factors and a CX3CR1-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, oral administration of MRS broth exerted the same benefits likely through increasing the relative abundance of endogenous Lactobacillus spp. Mechanistically, we found increased percentages of FOXP3-negative type 1 regulatory T cells with administration of the mix in both spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. In addition, oral gavage of Lactobacillus spp. decreased the percentage of central memory T cells while increasing that of effector memory T cells in the lymphoid organs. Furthermore, a decreased percentage of double negative T cells was observed in the spleen with the mix. These results suggest that Lactobacillus spp. might act on T cells to attenuate splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Together, this study advances our understanding of how Lactobacillus spp. attenuate lupus in MRL/lpr mice. The synergistic action of these bacteria suggests that multiple probiotic bacteria in combination may dampen systemic autoimmunity and benefit lupus patients.","rodent","christiaan"

Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without administration of Ex, FA, and Ex-FA for 13 weeks. The body weight, antioxidant ability, Ex performance, and lipid profiles in the serum, liver, and skeletal muscle were compared among the groups, and serum metabolomics analysis was conducted. The results showed that Ex, FA, and Ex-FA exhibited a similar effect on body weight management. Ex had a more beneficial function by alleviating HFD-induced dyslipidemia than FA, while FA exerted a more efficient effect in mitigating lipid deposition in the liver and skeletal muscle. Ex-FA showed comprehensive effects in the regulation of the lipid contents in serum, liver, and skeletal muscle, and provoked enhancement effects on antioxidant ability and Ex capacity. Mice administered with Ex, FA, and Ex-FA showed different metabolic profiles, which might be achieved through different metabolic pathways. The findings of this research implied that Ex coupled with FA could become an effective and safe remedy for the management of dietary-induced obesity.","rodent","christiaan"

Growing pediatric usage of anesthetics during painless procedures has raised concerns about the effect of low-dose anesthetics on neurodevelopment. It is urgent to ascertain the neuronal effect of low-dose Propofol, a widely used anesthetic in pediatrics, on developing brains. The behavioral tests after neonatal exposure to low-dose/high-dose Propofol in mice were conducted to clarify the cognitive effect. The nascent cells undergoing proliferation and differentiation stage in the hippocampus and cultured neural stem cells (NSCs) were further identified. In addition, single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), NSCs bulk RNA-seq, and metabolism trials were performed for pathway investigation. Furthermore, small interfering RNA and stereotactic adenovirus injection were, respectively, used in NSCs and hippocampal to confirm the underlying mechanism. Behavioral tests in mice showed enhanced spatial cognitive ability after being exposed to low-dose Propofol. Activated neurogenesis was observed both in hippocampal and cultured NSCs. Moreover, transcriptome analysis of snRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and metabolism trials revealed a significantly enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) level in NSCs. Furthermore, PGC-1α, a master regulator in mitochondria metabolism, was found upregulated after Propofol exposure both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, downregulation of PGC-1α remarkably prevented the effects of low-dose Propofol in activating OXPHOS and neurogenesis. Taken together, this study demonstrates a novel alteration of mitochondrial function in hippocampal neurogenesis after low-dose Propofol exposure, suggesting the safety, even potentially beneficial effect, of low-dose Propofol in pediatric use.","rodent","christiaan"

The use of audiovisual aids to demonstrate the conduct of anaesthesia may help improve parental education and reduce anxiety. Patient and methods We analysed data from a prospective randomised trial conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Parents of children posted for day care dental procedures were enrolled in the study. Children could be of either gender, aged 2-6 years, and categorised as American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) 1 or 2. Parents' anxiety regarding the surgical and anaesthesia procedure was assessed using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS). The first APAIS scoring was recorded on arrival in the preoperative holding area. Thereafter, the participants were randomly allocated into two groups; one group was shown a short video on a smartphone of a dental operating theatre (OT), dental chair and anaesthesia equipment (SPG group), while the other group was verbally explained the dental procedure (conventional management or CM group).

When sphincteroplasty fails or is not feasible, the subsequent surgical options are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of anal encirclement using the Leeds-Keio ligament in patients with FI. The inclusion criteria for the procedure were failure of or unsuitability for sphincteroplasty and the presence of a patulous anus (diameter, ≥35 mm). The artificial ligament was routed outside the external anal sphincter at the depth of the middle anal canal under caudal epidural anesthesia. Fourteen patients (mean age, 79.4 years; 8 females) with FI were included. Of these, seven (50%) showed a ≥50% reduction in the Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS). The mean CCFIS of 13.6 at baseline significantly improved to 7.9 3 months after surgery. The mean maximal anal resting pressure significantly increased from 16.8 mmHg to 22.6 mmHg. Postoperatively, temporary fecal impaction was observed in one patient (7%). None of the cases required removal of the artificial ligament or additional operative interventions for FI during the mean follow-up period of 31.9 months. Anal encirclement using the Leeds-Keio ligament was technically simple and safe and achieved good short-term outcomes.

We hypothesized that EVs released after trauma/hemorrhagic shock (HS) contribute to endotheliopathy and coagulopathy. To test this hypothesis, adoptive transfer experiments were performed to determine whether EVs derived from severely injured patients in shock were sufficient to induce endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathy. Methods: Total EVs were enriched from plasma of severely injured trauma/HS patients or minimally injured patients by ultracentrifugation and characterized for size and numbers. Under isoflurane anesthesia, noninjured naive C57BL/6J mice were administered EVs at varying concentrations and compared with mice receiving equal volume vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) or to mice receiving EVs from minimally injured patients.

Lungs were harvested for examination of histopathologic injury and costained with von Willebrand factor and fibrin to identify intravascular coagulation. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid was aspirated from lungs for protein measurement as an indicator of the endothelial permeability. Data are presented as mean ± SD, P < 0.05 was considered significant, and t test was used. Results: An initial proof-of-concept experiment was performed in naive mice receiving EVs purified from severely injured trauma/HS patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS], 34 ± 7) at different concentrations (5 × 106 to 3.1 × 109/100 μL/mouse) and compared with PBS (control) mice. Neither TAT nor syndecan-1 levels were significantly different between groups at 30 minutes after EV infusion. However, lung vascular permeability and histopathologic injury were significantly higher in the EV group, and lung tissues demonstrated intravascular fibrin deposition. Based on these data, EVs from severely injured trauma/HS patients (ISS, 32 ± 6) or EVs from minimally injured patients (ISS, 8 ± 3) were administered to naive mice at higher concentrations (1 × 109 to 1 × 1010 EV/100 μL/mouse). Compared with mice receiving EVs from minimally injured patients, plasma TAT and syndecan-1 levels were significantly higher in the trauma/HS EV group. Similarly, bronchial alveolar lavage protein and lung histopathologic injury were higher in the trauma/HS EV group, and lung tissues demonstrated enhanced intravascular fibrin deposition. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that trauma/HS results in the systemic release of EVs, which are capable of inducing endotheliopathy as demonstrated by elevated syndecan-1 and increased permeability and coagulopathy as demonstrated by increased TAT and intravascular fibrin deposition. Targeting trauma-induced EVs may represent a novel therapeutic strategy.","rodent","christiaan"
"898",35975542,"Prognostic Value of Serial Measurement of Serum Des-Arg(6)-Bradykinin Levels in Severe COVID-19 Patients.","Excessive inflammatory immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to severe disease in COVID-19 patients. Recently, some researchers hypothesized that dysregulation of the bradykinin (BK) system may also play a role in the pathogenesis of severe disease. Des-Arg(9)-bradykinin (DABK), an active metabolite of BK, is responsible for vasodilatation and increased permeability in the lungs and regulated by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). Viral inhibition of ACE-2 by SARS-CoV-2 increases DABK levels. Serum levels of this metabolite may be linked to disease severity in COVID-19 patients. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the prognostic value of serial measurement of serum DABK levels in severe COVID-19 patients. This prospective cohort study was conducted in hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients. Serum DABK levels of patients were serially measured on day 0, day 3 and day 5. Patients were categorized as cases with poor or good prognosis and critical or non-critical cases. Serum DABK levels of these patient groups were compared with paired sample t-test. Serum DABK levels on different days in the same patients were compared with repeated measures ANOVA tests. There was no statistically significant difference in serum DABK levels measured at day 0, day 3, and day 5 between good and poor prognosis groups. DABK levels in critical and non-critical COVID-19 patients also did not show any significant difference. According to our results serially measured serum DABK levels did not correlate with outcome of severe COVID-19 and do not have prognostic value in severe COVID-19 patients.","human_intervention","christiaan"

In this study, we conducted a 3-year follow-up study of MuRAL (380 cases) and compared it with LE (1417 cases) and ALTA (541 cases) performed at the same period. Operative time, mean hospital stay, postoperative pain, postoperative complications, and recurrence were compared and examined retrospectively. The mean operative time was the longest for MuRAL, followed by LE, and then ALTA at 29.1, 21.5, and 12.4 minutes, and the mean length of hospital stay was 6.2, 10.6, and 1.3, days, respectively. Based on the frequency of injectable analgesic use, postoperative pain was clearly milder in MuRAL and ALTA than in LE. The recurrence rates were 3.2% with MuRAL, 1.1% with LE, and 12.4% with ALTA. Early postoperative low-grade fever and bowel movement urgency were observed in all surgeries, but these were minor and did not pose a safety problem. LE is painful and requires prolonged hospitalization but is the most curative; ALTA is simple and can be performed as a day surgery but has a high recurrence rate. MuRAL was less painful than LE and had a lower recurrence rate than ALTA. In recent years, there have been various innovations in the surgical treatment of hemorrhoids, and choosing a technique that is appropriate for the condition of the hemorrhoid and patient's needs is necessary. MuRAL can be one of the options for hemorrhoid treatment as a cure without cutting method.","human_intervention","christiaan"

Soldiers undergoing CAC were measured by the stress hormone cortisol from saliva samples at baseline and during training. The training consisted of being taken capture and put through a number of realistic and threatening scenarios, targeting survival strategies taught in the preceding week. Between scenarios, the trainees were held in a holding cell where they were monitored by a guard. The saliva samples were taken in conjunction with the scenarios. The whole training took place over a period of ~24 h. Cognitive performance was measured at baseline and after training. Three groups took part Group A (n = 20) was taken after 48 h of intense tasks leaving them in a poor resting state. Group B (n = 23) was well rested at CAC onset. Group C (n = 10) was part of a survival, evasion, resistance, and escape (SERE) instructor course. The CAC training was the same for all groups. Group A exhibited a high increase in cortisol during CAC, compared to baseline levels were multiple times as high as expected values. Group B exhibited elevated levels slightly lower than those of group A, they also dropped to normal levels during the latter part of the exercise. Group C displayed the least increase with only slightly elevated levels. CAC training is stressful and cortisol levels were elevated enough to satisfy the prerequisite for effective stress inoculation. No cognitive performance drop could be identified; however, several participants froze during the exercise due to intensive stress.","human_intervention","christiaan"

Participants were allocated into the EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) group (EG, n = 11) and control group (CG, n = 10) through stratified randomization. The EG and CG took 3600 mg fish oil (containing 900 mg EPA and 403 mg DHA) and 3600 mg corn oil (without EPA and DHA), respectively, every day for two menstrual cycles. The redox reaction was measured four times: the menstrual and follicular phases in two menstrual cycles. There was a significant difference in reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) and potential antioxidant capacity during the menstrual phase by the main effect of time (before and after intake) in EG and CG (p < 0.01). In a subsequent test, d-ROMs were significantly lower after intake in EG and CG (p < 0.05); however, no significant difference in potential antioxidant capacity was found.

With regard to allergic rhinits, previous research provided inconclusive evidence for the effects of OLP, possibly related to a separate focus on either symptom severity or symptom frequency. Overcoming this limitation of previous research, the present study aimed to examine the effects of OLP on both the severity and frequency of allergic symptoms. In a randomized-controlled trial, patients with allergic rhinits (N = 74) were randomized to OLP or treatment as usual (TAU). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, OLP was administered remotely in a virtual clinical encounter. Participants took placebo tablets for 14 days. The primary outcomes were the severity and frequency of allergic symptoms. The secondary endpoint was allergy-related impairment. OLP did not significantly improve symptom severity over TAU, F(1, 71) = 3.280, p = .074, ɳ2p = .044, but did reduce symptom frequency, F(1, 71) = 7.272, p = .009, ɳ2p = .093, and allergy-related impairment more than TAU, F(1, 71) = 6.445, p = .013, ɳ2p = .083, reflecting medium to large effects. The use of other anti-allergic medication did not influence the results. While OLP was able to lower the frequency of allergic symptoms and allergy-related impairment substantially, its effects on symptom severity were weaker. The remote provision of OLP suggests that physical contact between patients and providers might not be necessary for OLP to work.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

It is important to study effects of different patterns of ionizing radiation. In this study, a rat model was used to compare the effects of repetitive and acute exposure. Groups: (I) control, (II, III) were exposed to fractionated doses (1.5 GyX4) and (2 GyX4), respectively/24h interval, and (IV, V) were exposed to 6 Gy and 8 Gy of whole-body gamma irradiation, respectively. The gene expression of MAPT and tau phosphorylation increased in all irradiated groups but the gene expression of PKN not affected. TGFβ% increased at dose of 2 GyX4 only. In addition, the cell cycle was arrested in S phase. Micronucleus (MN) increased and cell proliferation decreased. In conclusion, the dose and pattern of ionizing radiation do not affect the MAPT and PKN gene expression, but TGF-β, p-tau, MN assay and cell proliferation are significantly affected. The dose of 2 GyX4 showed distinctive effect. Repetitive exposure may increase TGF-β%, which causes radio-resistance and, G2/M delay. Thus, the cell cycle could be regulated in a different manner according to the dose and pattern of irradiation.","rodent","christiaan"

However, the effects of different T. gondii genotypes on the gut microbiota of rats remain unclear. In this study, acute and chronic T. gondii infection in Fischer 344 rats was induced artificially by intraperitoneal injection of tachyzoites PYS (Chinese 1 ToxoDB#9) and PRU (Type II). Fecal 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was employed to analyze the gut microbiota structure at different stages of infection, and to compare the effects of infection by two T. gondii genotypes. Our results suggested that the infection led to structural changes of gut microbiota in rats. At the acute infection stage, the microbiota diversity increased, while both diversity and abundance of beneficial bacteria decreased at the chronic infection stage. The differences of microbiota structure were caused by strains of different genotypes. However, the diversity changes were consistent. This study demonstrates that the gut microbiota plays an important role in T. gondii infection in rats. The data will improve our understanding of the association between T. gondii infection and gut microbiota in rodents.","rodent","christiaan"

Accumulating evidence attests to the important roles of the immune system in OA pathogenesis. Understanding the role of various immune cells in joint degeneration or joint repair after injury is vital for improving therapeutic strategies for treating OA. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) develops in ~50% of individuals who have experienced an articular trauma like an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Here, using the high resolution of single-cell RNA sequencing, we delineated the temporal dynamics of immune cell accumulation in the mouse knee joint after ACL rupture. Our study identified multiple immune cell types in the joint including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, B cells, T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells. Monocytes and macrophage populations showed the most dramatic changes after injury. Further characterization of monocytes and macrophages reveled 9 major subtypes with unique transcriptomics signatures, including a tissue resident Lyve1hiFolr2hi macrophage population and Trem2hiFcrls+ recruited macrophages, both showing enrichment for phagocytic genes and growth factors such as Igf1, Pdgfa and Pdgfc. We also identified several genes induced or repressed after ACL injury in a cell type-specific manner. This study provides new insight into PTOA-associated changes in the immune microenvironment and highlights macrophage subtypes that may play a role in joint repair after injury.","rodent","christiaan"

Although previous studies have selectively investigated the localization of amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition in certain brain regions, a comprehensive characterization of the rostro-caudal distribution of Aβ plaques in the brain and their inter-regional correlation remain unexplored. Our results demonstrated remarkable working and spatial memory deficits in 9-month-old 5xFAD mice compared to wildtype mice. High Aβ plaque load was detected in the somatosensory cortex, piriform cortex, thalamus, and dorsal/ventral hippocampus; moderate levels of Aβ plaques were observed in the motor cortex, orbital cortex, visual cortex, and retrosplenial dysgranular cortex; and low levels of Aβ plaques were located in the amygdala, and the cerebellum; but no Aβ plaques were found in the hypothalamus, raphe nuclei, vestibular nucleus, and cuneate nucleus. Interestingly, the deposition of Aβ plaques was positively associated with brain inter-regions including the prefrontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, medial amygdala, thalamus, and the hippocampus. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive morphological profile of Aβ deposition in the brain and its inter-regional correlation. This suggests an association between Aβ plaque deposition and specific brain regions in AD pathogenesis.","rodent","christiaan"

However, existing sound localization systems are built around distributed-microphone arrays, which require a special recording arena and long processing time. Here, we report a novel acoustic camera system, USVCAM, which enables simpler and faster USV localization and assignment. The system comprises recently developed USV segmentation algorithms with a modification for overlapping vocalizations that results in high accuracy. Using USVCAM, we analyzed USV communications in a conventional home cage, and demonstrated novel vocal interactions in female ICR mice under a resident-intruder paradigm. The extended applicability and usability of USVCAM may facilitate future studies investigating typical and atypical vocal communication and social behaviors, as well as the underlying mechanisms.","rodent","christiaan"

Chronic stroke lesions increase gradually due to the secondary neuroinflammation that occurs following acute ischemic neuronal degeneration. In this study, the ameliorating effect of a cytokine mixture consisting of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-3 was evaluated on ischemic brain injury using a rat stroke model prepared by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). The mixture reduced infarct volume and ameliorated ischemia-induced motor and cognitive dysfunctions. Sorted microglia cells from the ischemic hemisphere of rats administered the mixture showed reduced mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β at 3 days post-reperfusion. On flow cytometric analysis, the expression of CD86, a marker of pro-inflammatory type microglia, was suppressed, and the expression of CD163, a marker of tissue-repairing type microglia, was increased by the cytokine treatment. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry data showed that the cytokines increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in neurons in the ischemic lesion. Thus, the present study demonstrated that cytokine treatment markedly suppressed neurodegeneration during the chronic phase in the rat stroke model. The neuroprotective effects may be mediated by phenotypic changes of microglia that presumably lead to increased expression of Bcl-xL in ischemic lesions, while enhancing neuronal survival.","rodent","christiaan"

Impaired autophagy function (decreased autophagy or blocked autophagic flow) leads to cell damage and death and promotes NAFLD progression. The experimental and clinical research of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) in the treatment of NAFLD has gradually attracted attention with clear pharmacological activities such as immune regulation, antiviral, antitumor, antioxidant, liver protection, and anti-inflammatory. However, the effects of GA on the STAT3-HIF-1α pathway and autophagy in macrophages are still unclear, and its mechanism of action in the treatment of NAFLD remains to be further elucidated. We constructed a NAFLD mouse model through a high-fat and high-sugar diet to investigate the therapeutic effects of GA. The results showed that GA reduced weight, improved the pathological changes and hepatic lipid deposition of liver, and abnormally elevated the levels of serum biochemical (AST, ALT, TG, T-CHO, LDL-C, and HDL-C) and inflammatory indexes (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-α) in NAFLD mice. Further examination revealed that GA ameliorates excessive hepatic macrophage infiltration and hepatocyte apoptosis. The results of the cell experiments further elaborated that GA modulated the PA-induced macrophage STAT3-HIF-1α pathway and ameliorated impaired autophagic flux (blockade of autophagosome-lysosome fusion) and overactivation of inflammation. Excessive hepatocyte apoptosis caused by the uncontrolled release of inflammatory cytokines was also suppressed by GA. This study demonstrated that GA could regulate the STAT3-HIF-1α pathway of macrophages, ameliorate the impaired autophagy flux, and reduce the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines to improve the excessive apoptosis of liver cells, thus playing a therapeutic role on NAFLD.","rodent","christiaan"

Here, we investigate the effects of bilberry anthocyanins on the gut microbiota composition and metabolism, and the intestinal mucosal immune system of mice. We observed an increased proportion of IgA-producing plasma cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and an enhanced secretion of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and antimicrobial peptides in the small intestine. Small intestine transcriptome analysis further suggested that anthocyanins influenced IgA production. We found that oral administration of anthocyanins altered the gut microbiota through maintaining the anaerobic intestinal environment, promoting the secretion of sIgA and antimicrobial peptides, and downregulating cell motility and mobile genetic elements of commensal bacteria. These observations suggest that the oral administration of anthocyanins helps in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and thus it may find applications in immunotherapy and related fields.","rodent","christiaan"

For distribution analysis, huCD20 and wildtype mice (n = 5 per group) were imaged by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT 72 h after SC/IV administration of ofatumumab or SC/IV administration of ocrelizumab, radiolabeled with Indium-111 (111In-ofatumumab or 111In-ocrelizumab; 5 µg, 5 MBq). For efficacy analysis, huCD20 mice with focal delayed-type hypersensitivity lesions and associated tertiary lymphoid structures (DTH-TLS) were administered SC/IV ofatumumab or SC/IV ocrelizumab (7.5 mg/kg, n = 10 per group) on Days 63, 70 and 75 post lesion induction. Treatment impact on the number of CD19+ cells in select tissues and the evolution of DTH-TLS lesions in the brain were assessed. Uptake of an 111In-labelled anti-CD19 antibody in cervical and axillary lymph nodes was also assessed before and 18 days after treatment initiation as a measure of B-cell depletion. SPECT/CT image quantification revealed similar tissue distribution, albeit with large differences in blood signal, of 111In-ofatumumab and 111In-ocrelizumab following SC and IV administration; however, an increase in both mAbs was observed in the axillary and inguinal lymph nodes following SC versus IV administration. In the DTH-TLS model of MS, both treatments significantly reduced the 111In-anti-CD19 signal and number of CD19+ cells in select tissues, where no differences between the route of administration or mAb were observed. Both treatments significantly decreased the extent of glial activation, as well as the number of B- and T-cells in the lesion following SC and IV administration, although this was mostly achieved to a greater extent with ofatumumab versus ocrelizumab. These findings suggest that there may be more direct access to the lymph nodes through the lymphatic system with SC versus IV administration. Furthermore, preliminary findings suggest that ofatumumab may be more effective than ocrelizumab at controlling MS-like pathology in the brain.","rodent","christiaan"

In this study, we investigate the use of caffeine administration as a possible means of pharmacological management for hydrocephalus. A total of 76 three-day-old mice pups from 10 dams were divided into four groups: hydrocephalus was induced in the pups in two groups by intracisternal injection of kaolin suspension, and their dams were given either caffeine (50 mg/kg by gavage) or water daily for 21 days; the dams in the other 2 (non-hydrocephalic) groups similarly had either caffeine or water; the pups received caffeine administered via lactation. Developmental neurobehavioral tests were performed until day 21, when the pups were sacrificed. Their brains were removed and processed for Cresyl and Golgi staining; both quantitative and qualitative analyses were then carried out. Improved developmental motor activities and reflexes were observed in the hydrocephalus + caffeine-treated pups. Caffeine administration was associated with reduced cell death and increased dendritic arborization of the neurons in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum of hydrocephalic mice pups.

To introduce a new surgical technique of resection, soft tissue release, and FTMA for Ranawat type-II VD with a 5-year follow-up. A retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent TKA from December 2011 to December 2014. Hip-knee-ankle (HKA), range of motion (ROM), Oxford knee score (OKS), and knee society score (KSS) were used to assess the joint activity of patients in the new theory TKA group (NT-TKA) and were compared with those of the conventional TKA group (C-TKA). A total of 103 people (103 knees) were included in this study, including 42 patients with an average follow-up period of 83 mo in the C-TKA group and 61 patients with an average follow-up period of 76 mo in the NT-TKA group. Six patients had constrained prosthesis, one had common peroneal nerve injury, and two had joint instability in the C-TKA group, but none of these occurred in the NT-TKA group. There were significant statistical differences in constrained prosthesis usage and complications between the groups (P = 0.002 and P = 0.034, respectively). The KSS at 1 mo post-operation for the C-TKA and NT-TKA groups were 11.2 ± 3.8 and 13.3 ± 2.9, respectively, with a significant difference (P = 0.007). However, the data of HKA, ROM, OKS KSS, and prosthesis survival rate were insignificant (P > 0.05) in both the preoperative and follow-up periods. Adopting 5°-7° valgus cut angle for VD and sacrificing 2° neutral FTMA for severe VD which cannot be completely corrected during TKA can reduce the need for soft tissue release, maintain early joint stability, reduce the use of constrained prostheses, and minimize postoperative complications.","human_intervention","christiaan"

It is estimated that at least 14,000 people die every year of CD. Since vaccines are not available, chemotherapy remains of pivotal relevance. About 30% of the treated patients cannot complete the therapy because of severe adverse reactions. Thus, the search for novel drugs is required. Here we tested the benznidazole (BZ) combination with the repositioned drug disulfiram (DSF) and its derivative diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) upon Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro and in vivo. DETC-BZ combination was synergistic diminishing epimastigote proliferation and enhancing selective indexes up to over 10-fold. DETC was effective upon amastigotes of the BZ- partially resistant Y and the BZ-resistant Colombiana strains. The combination reduced proliferation even using low concentrations (e.g., 2.5 µM). Scanning electron microscopy revealed membrane discontinuities and cell body volume reduction. Transmission electron microscopy revealed remarkable enlargement of endoplasmic reticulum cisternae besides, dilated mitochondria with decreased electron density and disorganized kinetoplast DNA. At advanced stages, the cytoplasm vacuolation apparently impaired compartmentation. The fluorescent probe H2-DCFDA indicates the increased production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced lipid peroxidation in parasites incubated with DETC. The biochemical measurement indicates the downmodulation of thiol expression. DETC inhibited superoxide dismutase activity on parasites was more pronounced than in infected mice. In order to approach the DETC effects on intracellular infection, peritoneal macrophages were infected with Colombiana trypomastigotes. DETC addition diminished parasite numbers and the DETC-BZ combination was effective, despite the low concentrations used. In the murine infection, the combination significantly enhanced animal survival, decreasing parasitemia over BZ. Histopathology revealed that low doses of BZ-treated animals presented myocardial amastigote, not observed in combination-treated animals.

Aminotransferase de aspartate, Aminotransferase de alanine, Creatine kinase, and urea plasma levels demonstrated that the combination was non-toxic. As DSF and DETC can reduce the toxicity of other drugs and resistance phenotypes, such a combination may be safe and effective.","rodent","christiaan"
"1120",35968476,"Perceived Stress, Resilience, and Wellbeing in Seasoned Isha Yoga Practitioners Compared to Matched Controls During the COVID-19 Pandemic.","Yoga practices, including breathing, meditation, and posture protocols (asanas), have been shown to facilitate physical and mental wellbeing. Seasoned yoga practitioners were recruited from the Isha Foundation. Recruitment of the comparison group was achieved using snowball sampling and were not yoga practitioners. Participants in the non-yoga group were randomized to a 3-min Isha practice or a comparator group asked to perform 15-min of daily reading. Participants completed a series of web-based surveys (REDCap) at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks. These surveys include validated scales and objective questions on COVID-19 infection and medical history. The validated questionnaires assess for: perceived stress (PSS), mood states [anxiety and depression (PHQ-4), joy (DPES-Joy subscale)], mindfulness attention and awareness (MAAS), resilience (BRS), mental wellbeing (WEMWBS) and recovery from traumatic event (PTGI). Weekly activity diaries were employed as a tool for collecting compliance information from study participants. Perceived stress scale scores were identified as primary outcome for this study. The median Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score for the yoga practitioners compared to the active and placebo comparators was significantly lower at all time-points: baseline: 11 [IQR 7-15] vs. 16 [IQR 12-21] in both the active and placebo comparators (p < 0.0001); 6 weeks: 9 [IQR 6-13] vs. 12 [IQR 8-17] in the active comparator and 14 [IQR 9-18] in the placebo comparator (p < 0.0001); and 12 weeks: 9 [IQR 5-13] vs. 11.5 [IQR 8-16] in the active comparators and 13 [IQR 8-17] in the placebo comparator (p < 0.0001). Among the randomized participants that were compliant for the full 12 weeks, the active comparators had significantly lower median PSS scores than the placebo comparators 12 weeks [10 (IQR 5-14) vs. 13 (IQR 8-17), p = 0.017]. Further, yoga practitioners had significantly lower anxiety at all three-time points (p < 0.0001), lower depression at baseline and 6 weeks (p < 0.0003), and significantly higher wellbeing (p < 0.0001) and joy (p < 0.0001) at all three-time points, compared to the active and placebo comparator groups. The lower levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and higher level of wellbeing and joy seen in the yoga practitioners compared to the active and placebo comparators illustrate the impact of regular yoga practices on mental health even during the pandemic.

"1130",35968364,"Histopathological modeling of status epilepticus-induced brain damage based on in vivo diffusion tensor imaging in rats.","Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have proved useful in the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the interpretation of imaging outcomes in terms of tissue pathology is still challenging. This study goes beyond the current interpretation of in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) by constructing multivariate models of quantitative tissue microstructure in status epilepticus (SE)-induced brain damage. We performed in vivo DTI and histology in rats at 79 days after SE and control animals. The analyses focused on the corpus callosum, hippocampal subfield CA3b, and layers V and VI of the parietal cortex. Comparison between control and SE rats indicated that a combination of microstructural tissue changes occurring after SE, such as cellularity, organization of myelinated axons, and/or morphology of astrocytes, affect DTI parameters. Subsequently, we constructed a multivariate regression model for explaining and predicting histological parameters based on DTI. The model revealed that DTI predicted well the organization of myelinated axons (cross-validated R = 0.876) and astrocyte processes (cross-validated R = 0.909) and possessed a predictive value for cell density (CD) (cross-validated R = 0.489). However, the morphology of astrocytes (cross-validated R > 0.05) was not well predicted. The inclusion of parameters from CA3b was necessary for modeling histopathology. Moreover, the multivariate DTI model explained better histological parameters than any univariate model. In conclusion, we demonstrate that combining several analytical and statistical tools can help interpret imaging outcomes to microstructural tissue changes, opening new avenues to improve the non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of brain tissue damage.","rodent","christiaan"
"1151",35978508,"Sirt6 inhibits vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis by regulation of the Lin28b/let-7 pathway in atherosclerosis.","Our previous study showed that Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) plays an important role in the regulation of vascular endothelial cell inflammation. Recently, studies have reported that the RNA binding protein Lin28b directly regulates the let-7 microRNA (miRNA), which participates in the process of atherosclerosis (AS) by regulating inflammation. Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is accompanied by inflammation and is critical for AS. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the role of Sirt6 and Lin28b in vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis and the related mechanism. The present study showed that Lin28b expression was upregulated in the aortic intima and aorta of apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 or 12 weeks. Then, in vitro study found Lin28b was involved in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis, as indicated by the increased number of PI-positive cells and gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, as well as the increased release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and interleukin (IL)-1β. Further studies demonstrated that TNF-α significantly decreased the expression of let-7, while Lin28b knockdown significantly increased the expression of let-7a, let-7d and let-7g. In addition, Sirt6 overexpression decreased Lin28b expression. Moreover, Sirt6 overexpression suppressed pyroptosis by decreasing the number of PI-positive cells and GSDMD cleavage, as well as by decreasing the release of LDH and IL-1β in TNF-α-induced vascular endothelial cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that Sirt6 directly interacted with and deacetylated Lin28b. Taken together, these findings indicate that Sirt6 inhibits vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis by negatively regulating the Lin28b/let-7 pathway in AS.","rodent","christiaan"

Conflicting reports of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) necessitate the exploration of novel therapeutic interventions using bioactive natural products having the least toxicity and a holistic mode of action for the preservation of metabolic homeodynamics with aging in women. The present study was planned to investigate the effects of aging and/or a high-fat diet (HFD) on cognitive impairments and anxiety and further their management by dietary supplement with the Tinospora cordifolia stem powder (TCP). Acyclic female rats were included in this study as the model system of the perimenopause phase of women along with young 3-4 months old rats as controls. Rats were fed on with and without TCP supplemented normal chow or HFD for 12 weeks. Animals fed on a TCP supplemented normal chow showed consistent management of body weight over a 12-week regimen although their calorie intake was much higher in comparison to their age-matched controls. Post-regimen, neurobehavioral tests, such as novel object recognition and elevated plus maze, performed on these animals showed improvement in their learning and memory abilities as well as the anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, due to the presence of multiple components, TCP was observed to modulate the expression of key marker proteins to ameliorate neuroinflammation and apoptosis and promote cell survival and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions of the brain. These findings suggest that TCP supplementation in diet during the midlife transition period in women may be a potential interventional strategy for the management of menopause-associated anxiety and cognitive impairments and healthy aging.","rodent","christiaan"
"1174",35978498,"High glucose promotes IL-17A-induced gene expression through histone acetylation in retinal pigment epithelium cells.","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) that can cause visual impairment and blindness. Inflammation plays a critical role in its development and progression. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells secrete inflammatory factors that modulate ocular immune response. However, it is unclear how diabetes regulates the expression of inflammatory factors in RPE cells. In this study, streptozocin (STZ) was applied to induce diabetic alterations in the retinas of mice, and RPE cells were further purified to profile gene expressions. The IL-17 signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched and the only enriched inflammation pathway in the profile via KEGG analysis. IL-17A induced the expression of targeted genes, which was enhanced by high glucose levels, suggesting a synergistic effect of IL-17A and high glucose. High glucose did not affect the mRNA stability of IL-17A-targeted genes or the activity of IL-17A signaling transduction, but it boosted the histone acetylation on IL-17A-targeted genes. Curcumin, an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase, abolished high glucose-enhanced histone acetylation of IL-17A-targeted genes and blocked the promotion of high glucose levels on gene expression induced by IL-17A. In conclusion, high glucose levels promote IL-17A-induced gene expression via histone acetylation in RPE cells.","rodent","christiaan"

No reliable solution to stenosis CD exists so far. Therefore, we generated carboxymethyl chitosan oligosaccharide (CMCOS) as a new promising therapy and investigate its efficacy in an improved rat CD model. CMCOS was synthesized by enzymatic hydrolysis, and its biosafety was evaluated in vivo. The rat model of stenosis CD was optimized by an orthogonal experiment of 75 or 100 mg/kg trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) in a 50 or 75% ethanol enema. The therapeutic efficacy of CMCOS on the rat model of stenosis CD was investigated and compared with the commercial drug 5-aminosalicylic acid over a 28 day period of disease progression. The rat model of stenosis CD was well established by intracolonic administration of 75 mg/kg TNBS in 75% ethanol. CMCOS significantly alleviated CD symptoms morphologically, hematologically, and pathologically, promoting functional recovery of intestinal epithelium in a dose-dependent manner. CMCOS reduced infiltrations of inflammatory cells by regulating the IL-17A/PPAR-γ pathway and reduced fibro-proliferation and fibro-degeneration of the colon tissue by downregulating the TGF-β1/WT1 pathway. 75 mg/kg TNBS in a 75% ethanol enema induces a rat model of stenosis CD suitable for preclinical pathology and pharmacological studies. The safety, antifibrosis, and functional repair performance of CMCOS make it a promising candidate for the treatment of stenosis CD.","rodent","christiaan"

Thirty lumbar laminectomized adult rats were randomly assigned to three groups. The control group received normal saline, the HCA group received HA-CMC-alginate gel, and the HA group received pure HA gel soaked over the dura of the laminectomized area before closing the surgical wound. All rats were housed for eight weeks, then epidural fibrosis (EF) was histologically graded. In addition, the fibroblast and inflammatory cell density were computerized for evaluation. The mean fibroblast densities were 32.03 × 102 ± 488, 13.22 × 102 ± 200, and 14.52 × 102 ± 368 cell/mm2 in the control, HCA, and HA groups, respectively. The mean inflammatory cell density was 30.74 × 102 ± 459, 5.90 × 102 ± 129, and 11.08 × 102 ± 282 cell/mm2 in the control, HCA, and HA groups, respectively. The mean fibroblast and inflammatory cell densities in the HCA and HA groups were significantly lower than in the control group (P < 0.05). The HCA group had a significantly lower inflammatory cell density than the HA group (P < 0.05). The fibrous adherence grading of HCA and HA was significantly lower than the control (P < 0.05). HA-CMC-alginate gel and HA hydrogels seem to have a better preventative effect on EF than no treatment (control). HA-CMCalginate can exhibit a better anti-inflammatory effect than HA.

However, the radiation-associated cognitive disability is poorly understood and there is no effective prevention or long-term treatment. Here, we demonstrate that neurogenesis and neuroinflammation disorder are primarily involved in the pathophysiological basis of irradiation-induced cognitive decline. Furthermore, we discovered that tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside (TSG), a natural active ingredient from Heshouwu that has been well known for its unique anti-aging effect as the Chinese herb, can be a promising mitigator to improve learning-memory ability by facilitating the neurogenesis in the proliferation and differentiation of the surviving neural progenitor cells via AMPK/Tet2, and attenuating the neuroinflammation in the microglial NLRP3 inflammasomes activation via AMPK in vivo. Additionally, TSG was also revealed to activate AMPK by molecular docking and kinase enzyme system assay in vitro. Taken together, our findings identify TSG, as the AMPK activator, prevents radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction by regulating neurogenesis and neuroinflammation via AMPK/Tet2 in rodents, and represents a very promising candidate for developing drugs that can be used for radiation-associated brain injury.","rodent","christiaan"

All consecutive patients undergoing the uniportal VATS wedge resection between January 2019 and March 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty consecutive patients in Group A underwent the uniportal VATS wedge resection without intraoperative intercostal nerve block. The other 20 consecutive patients in Group B underwent the uniportal VATS wedge resection with intraoperative intercostal nerve block. The numeric pain rating scale (NRS) scores were recorded at 1, 12, and 24 h, postoperatively. The number of opioid consumption was also recorded until the time to chest tube removal. There was no difference between groups with regard to sex, age, chest tube duration, length of stay, operative time, laterality time, and diagnosis. There was a significant difference in postoperative NRS scores at 1 h (P = 0.001) and 12 h (P = 0.022) between the groups. The opioid consumption was significantly in Group B lower than those in Group A (P = 0.025).

This study aimed to evaluate the benefits of Lactobacillus plantarum (LP)-derived postbiotics on ameliorating Salmonella-induced neurological dysfunctions. Mice were pretreated with LP postbiotics (heat-killed bacteria or the metabolites) or active bacteria, and then challenged with Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (ST). Results showed that LP postbiotics, particularly the metabolites, effectively prevented ST infection in mice, as evidenced by the inhibited weight loss, bacterial translocation, and tissue damages. The LP postbiotics markedly suppressed brain injuries and neuroinflammation (the decreased interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, and the increased IL-4 and IL-10). Behavior tests indicated that LP postbiotics, especially the metabolites, protected mice from ST-induced anxiety and depressive-like behaviors and cognitive impairment. A significant modulation of neuroactive molecules (5-hydroxytryptamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dopamine, acetylcholine, and neuropeptide Y) was also found by LP postbiotic pretreatment. Microbiome analysis revealed that LP postbiotics optimized the cecal microbial composition by increasing Helicobacter, Lactobacillus and Dubosiella, and decreasing Mucispirillum, norank_f_Oscillospiraceae, and Eubacterium_siraeum_group. Moreover, LP postbiotics inhibited the reduction of short-chain fatty acids caused by ST infection. Pearson's correlation assays further confirmed the strong relationship of LP postbiotics-mediated benefits and gut microbiota.

In this study, we sought to determine if inhibiting EZH2 would ameliorate SS-like disease in NOD/Ltj (NOD) mice. We analyzed RNA-SEQ data of SGs of patients with SS from data obtained from the GEO database to explore the correlation between EZH2 gene expression and the progression of SS. Inhibition of EZH2 in the NOD mice was achieved by intraperitoneal administration of GSK343 using both a preventative and a therapeutic model. The effects of GSK343 on SGs secretion and pathological damage, as well as the levels and functions of T cells, B cells, Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and other immune cells were evaluated. The expression levels of the gene encoding EZH2 in the SGs of SS patients were significantly higher than the non-SS sicca patients, and the expression levels were positively correlated with the severity of the SGs pathological damage. GSK343 treatment significantly increased the salivary flow rate and pathological damage of the SGs in the NOD mice compared to the control mice. In addition, GSK343 significantly inhibited the number and pro-inflammatory-factor secretion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and inhibited the increase in the Th1/Th2 cell ratio caused by SS. RNA-SEQ data also showed that EZH2 inhibited several inflammatory pathways during the pathogenesis of SS.

"1293",35968392,"Stress Affects Central Compensation of Neural Responses to Cochlear Synaptopathy in a cGMP-Dependent Way.","In light of the increasing evidence supporting a link between hearing loss and dementia, it is critical to gain a better understanding of the nature of this relationship. We have previously observed that following cochlear synaptopathy, the temporal auditory processing (e.g., auditory steady state responses, ASSRs), is sustained when reduced auditory input is centrally compensated. This central compensation process was linked to elevated hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). We further observed that, independently of age, central responsiveness to cochlear synaptopathy can differ, resulting in either a low or high capacity to compensate for the reduced auditory input. Lower central compensation resulted in poorer temporal auditory processing, reduced hippocampal LTP, and decreased recruitment of activity-dependent brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in hippocampal regions (low compensators). Higher central compensation capacity resulted in better temporal auditory processing, higher LTP responses, and increased activity-dependent BDNF expression in hippocampal regions. Here, we aimed to identify modifying factors that are potentially responsible for these different central responses. Strikingly, a poorer central compensation capacity was linked to lower corticosterone levels in comparison to those of high compensators. High compensators responded to repeated placebo injections with elevated blood corticosterone levels, reduced auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave I amplitude, reduced inner hair cell (IHC) ribbon number, diminished temporal processing, reduced LTP responses, and decreased activity-dependent hippocampal BDNF expression. In contrast, the same stress exposure through injection did not elevate blood corticosterone levels in low compensators, nor did it reduce IHC ribbons, ABR wave I amplitude, ASSR, LTP, or BDNF expression as seen in high compensators. Interestingly, in high compensators, the stress-induced responses, such as a decline in ABR wave I amplitude, ASSR, LTP, and BDNF could be restored through the memory-enhancing drug phosphodiesterase 9A inhibitor (PDE9i). In contrast, the same treatment did not improve these aspects in low compensators. Thus, central compensation of age-dependent cochlear synaptopathy is a glucocorticoid and cyclic guanosine-monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent neuronal mechanism that fails upon a blunted stress response.","rodent","christiaan"

The objective was to study available, natural, and inexpensive ways to improve oral health status among the studied group. Materials and methods A randomized clinical trial was performed on 50 children with cerebral palsy aged from three to six years. Participants were divided into two groups (n=25, apple cider vinegar, manual brushing without toothpaste). Plaque accumulation and gingival status were evaluated using Turesky of the Quigley-Hein plaque index (TQHPI) and modified gingival index (MGI) seven times: pre-intervention baseline (T0), post-intervention at one month (T1), two months (T2), three months (T3), four months (T4), five months (T5), six months (T6). Results Plaque accumulation and gingivitis decreased significantly for the ACV group between T0 and T6 (p<0.05) and demonstrated significantly lower plaque accumulation and gingivitis compared to the manual brushing group (p<0.05) at T5 and T6. The manual brushing group showed decreasing in TQHPI between T0 and T3, then TQHPI increased significantly (p<0.05) at T4, T5, and T6. Conclusions To sum up, this in vitro study has demonstrated the possibility of using apple cider vinegar to reduce plaque and gingivitis. In addition, without additives, apple cider vinegar has both mechanical and chemical effects on dental plaque, and it may be a natural, available, inexpensive, and harmless substance that can improve the quality of oral care for difficult groups of children and people with special needs.

Even though the biological functions of intestine epithelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles (I-Evs) have been well documented, the role of I-Evs in the process of CDI is still unknown. The protective effect of I-Evs against C. difficile TcdB was investigated both in cultured murine colon carcinoma MC38 cells and a mouse model used in this study. Mouse I-Evs with mean diameter ranging from 100 to 200 nm and a density of 1.09-1.17 g/mL were obtained and confirmed containing the Ev-associated specific surface markers CD63 and TSG101 as well as high level of TGF-β1. In MC38 cells, I-Evs were able to decrease the gene expression of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-22 induced by C. difficile TcdB, but to increase both the gene expression and protein levels of TGF-β1. I-Evs treatment via intraperitoneal administration alleviates C. difficile TcdB-induced local colon inflammation in mice and increased their survival rate from 50% up to 80%. Furthermore, I-Evs induced an increase in the proportion of CD4+Foxp3+Tregs in vitro and in vivo through a TGF-β1-dependent mechanism by activating the TGF-β1 pathway and prompting phosphorylation of the downstream proteins Smad 2/3. For the first time, our study demonstrated that I-Evs originated from intestine epithelial cells can alleviate inflammation induced by C. difficile TcdB both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, I-Evs might be potentially a novel endogenous candidate for effective treatment of CDI.","rodent","christiaan"

The authors therefore modified previous models of orthopedic trauma and developed the tibial fracture-pin model. This modified fracture model consists of a unilateral open tibial fracture with intramedullary nail (IMN) internal fixation and simultaneous tibialis anterior (TA) muscle injury, resulting in mechanical allodynia that lasts up to 5 weeks post injury. This series of protocols outlines the detailed steps to perform the clinically relevant orthopedic trauma tibial fracture-pin model, followed by a modified hot plate assay to examine nociceptive changes after orthopedic injury.

Furthermore, the assessment of bacterial burden in different organs and the flow cytometric analysis of increased neutrophil numbers in the peritoneal lavage is presented. Salmonella Typhimurium-induced sepsis in mice leads to an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and rapid infiltration of neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity, leading to lower survival. Every step in this protocol has been optimized, resulting in high reproducibility of the pathogenesis of septic peritonitis. This model is useful for studying immunological responses during bacterial sepsis, the roles of different genes in disease progression, and the effects of drugs to attenuate sepsis.","rodent","christiaan"

This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of depression in rats. Thirty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to model depression, and CUMS+FMT. For the CUMS and CUMS+FMT groups, after CUMS intervention (four weeks), the rats were given normal saline or FMT (once/week for three weeks), respectively. Behavior, colonic motility, 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, and untargeted metabolomics on fecal samples were compared between the three rat groups. The following markers were analyzed: 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus; glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the serum; and GLP-1, GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) levels in colonic tissues. FMT improved symptoms of depression and colonic motility in rats exposed to CUMS. The expression levels of 5-HT, GABA, BDNF, and other biochemical indices, significantly differed among the three groups. Meanwhile, the intestinal microbiota in the CUMS+FMT group was more similar to that of the control group with a total of 13 different fecal metabolites. FMT exerted antidepressant effects on CUMS-induced depression in rats, and the mechanism involved various neurotransmitters, inflammatory factors, neurotrophic factors, and glucagon-like peptides.","rodent","christiaan"

Insulin receptors of cells subjected to hyperinsulinemic treatment demonstrate splice variation towards decreased IR-A mRNA expression and demonstrate a higher membrane-localized proportion. This corresponded with decreased autophosphorylation at sites critical for receptor internalization and signaling. Claramine restored signaling and receptor internalization in cells treated with hyperinsulinemia. In conclusion, hyperinsulinemia impacts brain microvascular endothelial cell insulin receptor signaling and internalization, likely via alternative splicing and increased negative feedback from PTP1B.","rodent","christiaan"

AEE had various pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic, anti-oxidative stress and so on. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effect of AEE on the acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. In vitro experiments evaluated the protective effect of AEE on the LPS-induced A549 cells. The tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured in the cell supernatant. The Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 8): control group, model group (LPS group), LPS + AEE group (AEE, 54 mg·kg-1), LPS + AEE group (AEE, 108 mg·kg-1), LPS + AEE group (AEE, 216 mg·kg-1). The lung wet-to-dry weight (W/D) ratio and immune organ index were calculated. WBCs were counted in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and total protein concentration was measured. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining of lung tissue was performed. Glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), macrophage mobility inhibitory factor (MIF), TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β activity were measured. The metabolomic analysis of rat serum was performed by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. From the results, compared with LPS group, AEE improved histopathological changes, reduced MDA, CRP, MPO, MDA, and MIF production, decreased WBC count and total protein content in BALF, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, immune organ index and lung wet-dry weight (W/D), increased antioxidant enzyme activity, in a dose-dependent manner. The results of serum metabolomic analysis showed that the LPS-induced ALI caused metabolic disorders and oxidative stress in rats, while AEE could ameliorate it to some extent. Therefore, AEE could alleviate LPS-induced ALI in rats by regulating abnormal inflammatory responses, slowing down oxidative stress, and modulating energy metabolism.","rodent","christiaan"

The study aims to radiolabel 17-oxo-17a-aza-D-homo-5-androsten-3β-yl phenoxyacetate (17a-aza steroid) with Tc-99m to evaluate its targeted uptake in experimentally induced prostate carcinogenesis in rats. The prediction of the optimal interaction and binding affinity of Tc-99m-17-oxo-17a-aza-D-homo-5-androsten-3 β-ylphenoxyacetate (Tc-99m-17a-aza steroid) toward 5AR inhibitor was done using Biopredicta Vlife MDS tool. Tc-99m-17a-aza steroid was developed by direct radiolabeling protocol. The radio-pharmacological characteristics (serum stability, plasma protein-binding ability, and lipophilicity) of the complex were evaluated. Further, the bio-distribution studies of the complex were performed in rats with experimentally induced prostate carcinogenesis. The in-silico analysis exhibits favorable binding of Tc-99m-17a-aza toward 5AR with D score-130.97. The radiochemical purity of Tc-99m-17a-aza was 96.79%.

The pathogenesis of TM6SF2-efficient NAFLD remains unclear, resulting in a lack of therapeutic strategies for TM6SF2-deficient patients. To investigate the role of TM6SF2 in fatty acid metabolism in the context of fatty liver and propose possible therapeutic strategies for NAFLD caused by TM6SF2 deficiency. Liver samples collected from both NAFLD mouse models and human participants (80 cases) were used to evaluate the expression of TM6SF2 by using western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RNA-seq data retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were used to confirm the over-expression of TM6SF2. Knockdown and overexpression of TM6SF2 were performed to clarify the mechanistic basis of hepatic lipid accumulation in NAFLD. MK-4074 administration was used as a therapeutic intervention to evaluate its effect on NAFLD caused by TM6SF2 deficiency. Hepatic TM6SF2 levels were elevated in patients with NAFLD and NAFLD mouse models. TM6SF2 overexpression can reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, suggesting a protective role for TM6SF2 in a high-fat diet (HFD). Downregulation of TM6SF2, simulating the TM6SF2 E167K mutation condition, increases intracellular lipid deposition due to dysregulated fatty acid metabolism and is characterized by enhanced fatty acid uptake and synthesis, accompanied by impaired fatty acid oxidation. Owing to the potential effect of TM6SF2 deficiency on lipid metabolism, the application of an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor (MK-4074) could reverse the NAFLD phenotypes caused by TM6SF2 deficiency. TM6SF2 plays a protective role in the HFD condition; its deficiency enhanced hepatic lipid accumulation through dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, and MK-4074 treatment could alleviate the NAFLD phenotypes caused by TM6SF2 deficiency.","rodent","christiaan"
"1409",35967353,"Susceptibility to Infections During Acute Liver Injury Depends on Transient Disruption of Liver Macrophage Niche.","Kupffer cells are the primary liver resident immune cell responsible for the liver firewall function, including clearance of bacterial infection from the circulation, as they are strategically positioned inside the liver sinusoid with intimate contact with the blood. Disruption in the tissue-resident macrophage niche, such as in Kupffer cells, can lead to a window of susceptibility to systemic infections, which represents a significant cause of mortality in patients with acetaminophen (APAP) overdose-induced acute liver injury (ALI). However, how Kupffer cell niche disruption increases susceptibility to systemic infections in ALI is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of ALI induced by APAP overdose, we found that Kupffer cells upregulated the apoptotic cell death program and were markedly reduced in the necrotic areas during the early stages of ALI, opening the niche for the infiltration of neutrophils and monocyte subsets. In addition, during the resolution phase of ALI, the remaining tissue macrophages with a Kupffer cell morphology were observed forming replicating cell clusters closer to necrotic areas devoid of Kupffer cells. Interestingly, mice with APAP-induced liver injury were still susceptible to infections despite the dual cellular input of circulating monocytes and proliferation of remaining Kupffer cells in the damaged liver. Therapy with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) was shown to be effective in occupying the niche devoid of Kupffer cells following APAP-induced ALI. The rapid BMDM migration to the liver and their positioning within necrotic areas enhanced the healing of the tissue and restored the liver firewall function after BMDM therapy. Therefore, we showed that disruption in the Kupffer cell niche and its impaired function during acute liver injury are key factors for the susceptibility to systemic bacterial infections. In addition, modulation of the liver macrophage niche was shown to be a promising therapeutic strategy for liver injuries that reduce the Kupffer cell number and compromise the organ function.","rodent","christiaan"

However, their roles in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production remain unclear. By screening 11 zinc-dependent HDACs with chemical inhibitors, we found that HDAC1 inhibitor, 4-(dimethylamino)-N-[6-(hydroxyamino)-6-oxohexyl]-benzamide (DHOB), enhanced IL-1β production by macrophage and dendritic cells upon TLR4 stimulation or Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection through IL-1β maturation via elevated NLRP3 expression, increased cleaved caspase-1, and enhanced ASC oligomerization. DHOB rescued defective IL-1β production by dendritic cells infected with M. tuberculosis with ESAT-6 deletion, a virulence factor shown to activate NLRP3 inflammasome. DHOB increased IL-1β production and NLRP3 expression in a tuberculosis mouse model. Although DHOB inhibited HDAC activities of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 by direct binding, knockdown of HDAC2, but not HDAC1, increased IL-1β production and NLRP3 expression in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages. These data suggest that HDAC2, but not HDAC1, controls IL-1β production through NLRP3 inflammasome activation, a mechanism with a significance in chronic inflammatory diseases including tuberculosis.","rodent","christiaan"

The NLRP3 inflammasome has attracted the attention of the pharmaceutical industry because it promotes the pathogenesis of many diseases, making it a promising target for drug development. Litsea cubeba (Lour.) is a plant traditionally used as a seasoning in Taiwan and in other Asian countries. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory activity of the leaves of L. cubeba against the NLRP3 inflammasome. We found that the ethanol extract of L. cubeba leaves (MLE) inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages by reducing caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. MLE reduced pyroptosis in macrophages and inhibited the release of NLRP3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). In a mechanistic study, MLE reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and preserved mitochondrial integrity, which led to reduced mitochondrial DNA release into the cytosol. MLE did not reduce the expression levels of NLRP3, IL-1β precursor or TNF-α in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. These results indicated that MLE inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome by suppressing the activation signals of the NLRP3 inflammasome but not by reducing the priming signal induced by LPS. In addition, oral administration of MLE (20-80 mg/kg) ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a mouse model. Notably, mice that received MLE (1 and 2 g/kg) daily for 7 days did not exhibit visible side effects. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis found that α-Terpinyl acetate (27.2%) and 1,8-Cineole (17.7%) were the major compounds in MLE. These results indicated that L. cubeba leaves have the potential to be a nutraceutical for preventing and improving NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases.","rodent","christiaan"

However, the protective effect of VV ECMO on the lung, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are still unknown. We investigated the role of VV ECMO in preventing lung injury in vivo using a rat model. Additionally, the effects of Hippo/YAP signaling on alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2)-mediated alveolar epithelial recovery in VV ECMO rats were also investigated. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, RNA sequencing, lung injury, edema, and cytokine expression were evaluated. VV ECMO significantly improved severe hypoxemia, reduced lung edema, and inflammatory response, and altered alveolar epithelial function, as indicated by reduced protein concentrations in BALF. This was associated with Hippo/YAP signaling activation, according to RNA sequencing analysis. Furthermore, we discovered that after VV ECMO, AT2 cells proliferated and differentiated, and this increase in AT2 cell activity was correlated to the increased nuclear expression of YAP, which is critical for alveolar epithelial recovery from lung injury. During VV ECMO, verteporfin-induced YAP inhibition and the loss of the oxygenator delayed lung alveolar epithelial recovery and led to a prolonged inflammatory response. These findings suggest that VV ECMO protects against lung injury by activating the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. Strategies aimed at increasing YAP activity in AT2 cells could thus aid alveolar epithelial recovery, making VV ECMO easier for lung transplantation.","rodent","christiaan"

Cardiac fibrosis in the mouse MI model was mitigated by TRIM38 overexpression, but aggravated by its depletion. Consistently, in vitro overexpression or knockdown of TRIM38 ameliorated or aggravated the proliferation and secretion of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) exposed to fibrotic stimulation, respectively. Mechanistically, TRIM38 suppressed cardiac fibrosis progression by attenuating TAK1/MAPK signaling. Inhibiting TAK1/MAPK signaling with a pharmacological inhibitor greatly reversed the effects of TRIM38 knockdown on CF secretion. Specifically, TRIM38 interacted with and targeted TAB2 and TAB3 for degradation, subsequently inhibiting TAK1 phosphorylation and negatively regulating MAPK signaling.

Several recent studies have reported the involvement of low-grade inflammation and immunological dysfunction in PI-IBS. T helper 17 (Th17) polarization occurs in IBS. Adenosine and its receptors participate in intestinal inflammation and immune regulation. To investigate the role of Th17 polarization of CD4+ T cells regulated by adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) in PI-IBS. A PI-IBS model was established by infecting mice with Trichinella spiralis. The intestinal A2AR and CD4+ T lymphocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry, and the inflammatory cytokines were detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay. CD4+ T lymphocytes present in the animal's spleen were separated and cultured with or without A2AR agonist and antagonist. Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed to determine the effect of A2AR on the cells and intestinal tissue. Cytokine production was determined. The protein and mRNA levels of A2AR associated signaling pathway molecules were also evaluated. Furthermore, A2AR agonist and antagonist were injected into the mouse model and the clinical features were observed. The PI-IBS mouse model showed increased expression of ATP and A2AR (P < 0.05), and inhibition of A2AR improved the clinical features in PI-IBS, including the abdominal withdrawal reflex and colon transportation test (P < 0.05). The number of intestinal CD4+ T cells and interleukin-17 (IL-17) protein levels increased during PI-IBS, which was reversed by administration of the A2AR antagonist (P < 0.05). CD4+ T cells expressed A2AR and produced IL-17 in vitro, which was regulated by the A2AR agonist and antagonist. The A2AR antagonist increased the production of IL-17 by CD4+ T cells via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription-receptor-related orphan receptor γ signaling pathway. The results of the present study suggested that the upregulation of A2AR increases PI-IBS by promoting the Th17 polarization of CD4+ T cells.","rodent","christiaan"

FOSL1 and MMP13 mRNA and protein expression levels in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced HT29 cells and colon tissues of a UC mice model were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. MMP13 promoter activity was determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay, the relationship between FOSL1 and MMP13 promoter was determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation, inflammatory factor levels were quantified using ELISA, cell monolayer permeability analysis was performed using transepithelial electrical resistance measurements and tight junction protein expression levels were determined by western blotting. After constructing a UC mice model, mice colonic injury was determined with the quantification of colon length, H&E staining and disease activity index. The results demonstrated that FOSL1 and MMP13 were upregulated in DSS-induced HT29 cells and tissues. FOSL1 was also determined to be bound to the MMP13 promoter region and was demonstrated to upregulate MMP13 expression levels. Furthermore, FOSL1 knockdown inhibited DSS-induced inflammation and barrier damage in HT29 cells via MMP13 downregulation. FOSL1 knockdown also ameliorated colonic injury, inflammation and barrier damage in the tissues of the UC mice model via MMP13 downregulation.

Lymphatic vessels are vital for IBD development and progression to colorectal cancer (CRC), as an occluded conduit for lymphatic fluid to return to the blood. The mechanism involved remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the therapeutic effect of hucMSC-Ex in a mouse model of IBD during the modulation of lymphangiogenesis. We established a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD model in BALB/c mice and observed the influence of hucMSC-Ex on tissue repair, intestinal lymphatic function, changes in lymphangiogenesis, and infiltration of macrophages. We also evaluated the functional changes of human lymphatic endothelial cells (hLECs) in vitro to determine the mechanism by which hucMSC-Ex regulate lymphangiogenesis. Finally, we identified key molecules in hucMSC-Ex by sequencing, database comparison, and cell validation. Results showed that hucMSC-Ex alleviates IBD in mice by improving intestinal lymphatic drainage, inhibiting lymphangiogenesis, and infiltration of macrophages. Mechanistically, the miRNA sequencing results showed that miR-302d-3p was highly expressed in hucMSC-Ex and played an important role in inhibiting lymphangiogenesis by targeting Fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4). At the same time, the phosphorylation of AKT was inhibited and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) was reduced. Collectively, our study suggests that hucMSC-Ex can regulate lymphangiogenesis via the miR-302d-3p/VEGFR3/AKT axis to ameliorate IBD. Our findings identify VEGFR3 as a potential therapeutic target in IBD, where tightly regulated lymphangiogenesis is crucial in its pathogenesis and progression.","rodent","christiaan"

These measurements are uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), corneal indices based on Scheimpflug tomography, and higher-order aberrations (HOAs) based on (Sirius, Schwind) tomography. There were significant improvements in logMAR (UDVA and CDVA) and reduction in sphere, manifest cylinder, MRSE, maximal keratometry, and mean keratometry after ICRS implantation in the first stage. After TPRK and ACXL as the second stage, there were significant improvements in visual acuity of both logMAR UDVA and CDVA.

Remote transponders are surgically implanted within the muscle of mice and rats, and the animals are given time to recover. Mice and rats must then be repeatedly habituated to the testing environment and procedure. Changes in muscle temperature are measured in response to pharmacological or contextual stimuli in the home cage. Muscle temperature can also be measured during prescribed physical activity (i.e., treadmill walking at a constant speed) to factor out changes in activity as contributors to the changes in muscle temperature induced by these stimuli. This method has been successfully used to elucidate mechanisms underlying muscle thermogenic control at the level of the brain, sympathetic nervous system, and skeletal muscle. Provided are demonstrations of this success using predator odor (PO; ferret odor) as a contextual stimulus and injections of oxytocin (Oxt) as a pharmacological stimulus, where predator odor induces muscle thermogenesis, and Oxt suppresses muscle temperature.

PTP scaffold inherited all advantages of PT scaffold in structural, mechanical, and biodegradation, meanwhile puerarin stably and continuously released from PTP scaffold and lasted for 5 months in vitro. At 8 weeks after implantation, the PTP scaffold triggered new bone formation in the macro-pores of the scaffold and inside the scaffold accompanied by the degrading materials. The underlying mechanism revealed that the PTP scaffold induced vascular infiltration and recruit repair cells through stimulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) expressions to promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Puerarin-enriched porous PTP scaffold was a promising local delivery system with sustained release of puerarin for facilitating defect repair through getting synergistic angiogenic and osteogenic effects.

Unlike traditional, reflex-based pain assays, operant pain assays can produce more clinically relevant results by addressing the cognitive and motivational aspects of pain in rodents. This paper presents a protocol for assessing mechanical hypersensitivity following chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerves (CCI-ION) in rats using an orofacial operant pain system. Before CCI-ION surgery, rats were trained in an orofacial pain assessment device (OPAD) to drink sweetened condensed milk while making facial contact with the metal spiked bars and lick-tube. In this assay, rats can choose between receiving milk as a positive reinforcer or escaping an aversive mechanical stimulus that is produced by a vertical row of small pyramid-shaped spikes on each side of the reward access hole. Following 2 weeks of training in the OPAD and before the CCI-ION surgery, baseline mechanical sensitivity data were recorded for 5 days for each rat during a 10 min testing session. During a session, the operant system automatically records the number of reward bottle activations (licks) and facial contacts, contact duration, and latency to the first lick, among other measures. Following baseline measurements, rats underwent either CCI-ION or sham surgery. In this protocol, mechanical hypersensitivity was quantified by measuring the number of licks, latency to the first lick, the number of contacts, and the ratio of licks to facial contacts (L/F). The data showed that CCI-ION resulted in a significant decrease in the number of licks and the L/F ratio and an increase in the latency to the first lick, indicating mechanical hypersensitivity. These data support the use of operant-based pain assays to assess mechanical pain sensitivity in preclinical pain research.","rodent","christiaan"

Decreased bone formation due to osteoblast dysfunction may be one of the causes of aging-related bone loss. With increasing evidence suggesting that multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in osteoblast function, the relationship between miRNAs and senile osteoporosis has become a popular research topic. Previously, we confirmed that mechanoresponsive miR-138-5p negatively regulated bone anabolic action. In this study, the miR-138-5p level was found to be negatively correlated with BMD and osteogenic markers in bone specimens of senile osteoporotic patients by bioinformatic analysis and experimental verification. Furthermore, high miR-138-5p levels aggravated the decrease of aged osteoblast differentiation in vitro and led to worse bone loss in aged osteoblastic miR-138-5p transgenic mice in vivo. We also previously identified that the target of miR-138-5p, microtubule actin cross-linking factor 1 (MACF1), could attenuate senile osteoporosis. Here, miR-138-5p was demonstrated to regulate aged osteoblast differentiation by targeting MACF1. Finally, the therapeutic inhibition of miR-138-5p counteracted the decrease in bone formation and aging-related bone loss in aged mice.

Here we show pICLC increased serum protein and intravenously injected FITC-dextran in the lung airspace suggesting pICLC induces vascular permeability.

T1IFN also induced MDA5 and other MDA5 signaling components suggesting that positive feedback contributes to t1IFN dependent expression of the pro-inflammatory signature. Vascular permeability, induced by pICLC or another compound, inhibited Cg by limiting iron. These data suggest that pICLC induces t1IFN which potentiates pICLC-MDA5 signaling increasing IL-1 and IL-6 resulting in leakage of antimicrobial serum factors into lung airspace.

Luciferase assay was used to determine the adsorption of miR-548d-3p by TPTEP1 sponge, the targeting of miR-548d-3p to KLF9, and the binding of KLF9 to the promoter of PER1. immunohistochemical assay and H&E staining prove the function of TPTEP1 and miR-548d-3p in nude mice model of gastric cancer. TPTEP1 inhibited its expression by sponge adsorption of miR-548d-3p. miR-548d-3p targets KLF9 3'UTR to inhibit its expression, and KLF9 binds to the PER1 promoter to promote its expression.TPTEP1/KLF9/PER1 inhibits gastric cancer cell migration and invasion, and miR-548d-3p does the opposite. Our data suggest that TPTEP1 affects gastric cancer progression by regulating the miR-548d-3p/KLF9/PER1 axis. Targeting this pathway may provide new therapeutic opportunities for gastric cancer.","rodent","christiaan"

Here, we describe the avidin-biotin conjugate (ABC) method used to stain T cells (CD4 and CD8), B cells (CD19), macrophages (F4/80), and cells bound by the in vivo administered rat anti-mouse antibodies for chromogenic immunohistochemistry (IHC). Using a biotinylated goat anti-rat antibody, we detected the localization of cells bound to the in vivo antibodies for PD-1 and CTLA-4. IHC has advantages over other techniques, namely antibody availability, resistance to photobleaching, and greater sensitivity. Additionally, detection and localization of in vivo antibodies can be used in mice models to infer their therapeutic efficacy, stability, and function. Graphical abstract.","rodent","christiaan"
"1845",35967317,"B cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors impacting memory recall responses to SRBC challenge.","MBCs (MBCs) generated in T-dependent immune responses can persist for a lifetime and rapidly react upon secondary antigen exposure to differentiate into plasma cells (PCs) and/or to improve the affinity of their BCR through new rounds of hypermutation in germinal centers (GCs). The fate of a MBC in secondary immune reactions appears to depend upon multiple parameters, whose understanding is mandatory for the design of efficient vaccine strategies. We followed the behavior of MBCs in recall responses to SRBCs using an inducible AID fate mapping mouse model in which B cells engaged in a germinal center (GC) response are irreversibly labeled upon simultaneous tamoxifen ingestion and immunization. We used different schemes of mouse immunization and tamoxifen feeding in adoptive-transfer experiments of total splenic B cells into congenic mice that have been pre-immunized or not, to assess the contribution of the different effector subsets in a physiological competitive context. We were able to show that naive B cells can differentiate into GC B cells with kinetics similar to MBCs in the presence of previously activated T follicular helper (TFH) cells and a primed microenvironment. We also showed that MBCs are recruited into secondary GCs, together with naive B cells. In contrast, PC differentiation, which dominated secondary MBC responses, was not dependent upon a previous TFH activation. We observed that the presence of persisting germinal centers and circulating antibody levels are key factors determining the germinal center versus plasma cell fate in a recall response. Notably, disruption of persistent germinal center structures by a lymphotoxin beta-receptor fusion protein or a longer timing between the prime and the boost, which correlated with reduced antigen-specific immunoglobulin levels in serum, were two conditions with an opposite impact, respectively inhibiting or promoting a GC fate for MBCs. Altogether, these studies highlight the complexity of recall responses, whose outcome varies according to immunization contexts.","rodent","christiaan"

MicroRNAs (miRs) are associated with IVD degeneration. This study expounded the mechanism of microRNA (miR)-25-3p carried by extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in interleukin (IL)-1β-induced NP cell degeneration. Methods: Platelet-rich plasma from mouse blood was obtained, and EVs were isolated from PRP (EVs derived from PRP [PRP-EVs]) and identified. Nucleus pulposus cells were isolated from the mouse lumbar IVD and treated with IL-1β to induce NP cell degeneration. Extracellular vesicles derived from PRP were added into NP cell culture medium. Afterward, intracellular miR-25-3p, sex determining region Y-related high-mobility-group box 4 (SOX4), and CXC chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) levels were examined. Nucleus pulposus cell viability, apoptosis, and inflammation were detected. Extracellular vesicles derived from PRP were labeled by PKH67 to obverse the uptake of EVs by NP cells. The binding relations between SOX4 and miR-25-3p and CXCR7 were predicted and examined. Functional rescue experiments were performed to investigate the roles of miR-25-3p, SOX4, and CXCR7 in NP cell degeneration. Results: miR-25-3p was downregulated, whereas SOX4 and CXCR7 were upregulated in IL-1β-induced NP cells. Extracellular vesicles derived from PRP increased the cell viability, and decreased apoptosis and inflammation. miR-25-3p carried by PRP-EVs into NP cells alleviated NP cell degeneration. miR-25-3p inhibited SOX4 expression and limited CXCR7 transcription. Silencing miR-25-3p or overexpressing SOX4 or CXCR7 reversed the alleviating role of PRP-EVs in NP cell degeneration. Conclusion: miR-25-3p carried by PRP-EVs into NP cells elevated intracellular miR-25-3p expression, which suppressed SOX4 expression and further limited CXCR7 transcription, thus alleviating IL-1β-induced NP cell degeneration. Extracellular vesicles derived from PRP containing miR-25-3p may be a new method for IVD treatment.","rodent","christiaan"

While suckling mice prove to be highly useful small animal models of RV infection and pathogenesis, direct visualization tools are lacking to track the temporal dynamics of RV replication and transmissibility in vivo. Here, we report the generation of the first recombinant murine-like RV that encodes a Nano-Luciferase reporter (NLuc) using a newly optimized RV reverse genetics system. The NLuc-expressing RV was replication-competent in cell culture and both infectious and virulent in neonatal mice in vivo. Strong luciferase signals were detected in the proximal and distal small intestines, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes. We showed, via a noninvasive in vivo imaging system, that RV intestinal replication peaked at days 2 to 5 post infection. Moreover, we successfully tracked RV transmission to uninoculated littermates as early as 3 days post infection, 1 day prior to clinically apparent diarrhea and 3 days prior to detectable fecal RV shedding in the uninoculated littermates. We also observed significantly increased viral replication in Stat1 knockout mice that lack the host interferon signaling. Our results suggest that the NLuc murine-like RV represents a non-lethal powerful tool for the studies of tissue tropism and host and viral factors that regulate RV replication and spread, as well as provides a new tool to facilitate the testing of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in the future.","rodent","christiaan"
"1931",35983499,"Mesenchymal stem cells pretreated with proinflammatory cytokines accelerate skin wound healing by promoting macrophages migration and M2 polarization.","Numerous studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote cutaneous wound healing via paracrine signaling. Our previous study found that the secretome of MSCs was significantly amplified by treatment with IFN-γ and TNF-α (IT). It has been known that macrophages are involved in the initiation and termination of inflammation, secretion of growth factors, phagocytosis, cell proliferation and collagen deposition in wound, which is the key factor during wound healing. In the present study, we used a unique supernatant of MSCs from human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) pretreated with IT, designated S-IT MSCs, to explore whether S-IT MSCs have a better effect on improving wound healing by improving the biological function of macrophages than the control supernatant of MSCs (S-MSCs). In the present study, we used a unique supernatant of MSCs pretreated with IT subcutaneously injected into a mice total skin excision. We evaluated the effect of S-IT MSCs on wound healing and the quality of wound repair via promoting macrophages migration and M2 polarization in vivo. In addition, the effect of S-IT MSCs on macrophages migration, converting toward M2 phenotype and phagocytosis were also investigated in vitro. Indeed, S-IT MSCs were found to be more potent in promoting macrophage migration, M2 polarization, phagocytosis, and promoting wound closure than S-MSCs during the wound repair. High levels of CCL2 and IL-6 were found in S-IT MSCs, which indicated that the optimization of macrophage function by S-IT MSCs may be achieved through their high expression of CCL2 and IL-6. Our results suggest that the beneficial paracrine effect of MSCs on wound healing can be amplified by pretreatment with IT, which may represent a new strategy for optimizing the therapeutic effect of MSCs on wound healing.","rodent","christiaan"
"1985",35978505,"Histamine H3R antagonist counteracts the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in Lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation.","Adult neurogenesis in hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) is associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases such as aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Overactivation of microglia induced neuroinflammation is well acknowledged to contribute to the impaired neurogenesis in pathologies of these diseases and then leading to cognitive dysfunction. Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) is a presynaptic autoreceptor regulating histamine release via negative feedback way. Recently, studies show that H3R are highly expressed not only in neurons but also in microglia to modulate inflammatory response. However, whether inhibition of H3R is responsible for the neurogenesis and cognition in chronic neuroinflammation induced injury and the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we found that inhibition of H3R by thioperamide reduced the microglia activity and promoted a phenotypical switch from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 in microglia, and ultimately attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation in mice. Additionally, thioperamide rescued the neuroinflammation induced impairments of neurogenesis and cognitive function. Mechanically, the neuroprotection of thioperamide was involved in histamine dependent H2 receptor (H2R) activation, because cimetidine, an H2R antagonist but not pyrilamine, an H1R antagonist reversed the above effects of thioperamide. Moreover, thioperamide activated the H2R downstream phosphorylated protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway but inhibited nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling. Activation of CREB by thioperamide promoted interaction of CREB-CREB Binding Protein (CBP) to increase anti-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release but inhibited NF-κB-CBP interaction to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-1β, Interleukin-6 and Tumor necrosis factor α) release. H89, an inhibitor of PKA/CREB signaling, abolished effects of thioperamide on neuroinflammation and neurogenesis. Taken together, these results suggested under LPS induced neuroinflammation, the H3R antagonist thioperamide inhibited microglia activity and inflammatory response, and ameliorated impairment of neurogenesis and cognitive dysfunction via enhancing histamine release. Histamine activated H2R and reinforced CREB-CBP interaction but weakened NF-κB-CBP interaction to exert anti-inflammatory effects. This study uncovered a novel histamine dependent mechanism behind the therapeutic effect of thioperamide on neuroinflammation.","rodent","christiaan"
"1992",35967447,"BSL2-compliant lethal mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern to evaluate therapeutics targeting the Spike protein.","Since first reported in 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly acquiring mutations, particularly in the spike protein, that can modulate pathogenicity, transmission and antibody evasion leading to successive waves of COVID19 infections despite an unprecedented mass vaccination necessitating continuous adaptation of therapeutics. Small animal models can facilitate understanding host-pathogen interactions, target selection for therapeutic drugs, and vaccine development, but availability and cost of studies in BSL3 facilities hinder progress. To generate a BSL2-compatible in vivo system that specifically recapitulates spike protein mediated disease we used replication competent, GFP tagged, recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus where the VSV glycoprotein was replaced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (rVSV-SARS2-S). We show that infection requires hACE2 and challenge of neonatal but not adult, K18-hACE2 transgenic mice (hACE2tg) leads to productive infection of the lungs and brains. Although disease progression was faster in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, infection with both viruses resulted in neuronal infection and encephalitis with increased expression of Interferon-stimulated Irf7, Bst2, Ifi294, as well as CxCL10, CCL5, CLC2, and LILRB4, and both models were uniformly lethal. Further, prophylactic treatment targeting the Spike protein (Receptor Binding Domain) with antibodies resulted in similar levels of protection from lethal infection against rVSV-SARS2-S and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Strikingly, challenge of neonatal hACE2tg mice with SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (SARS-CoV-2-α, -β, ϒ, or Δ) or the corresponding rVSV-SARS2-S viruses (rVSV-SARS2-Spike-α, rVSV-SARS2-Spike-β, rVSV-SARS2-Spike-ϒ or rVSV-SARS2-Spike-Δ) resulted in increased lethality, suggesting that the Spike protein plays a key role in determining the virulence of each variant. Thus, we propose that rVSV-SARS2-S virus can be used to understand the effect of changes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on infection and to evaluate existing or experimental therapeutics targeting spike protein of current or future VOC of SARS-CoV-2 under BSL-2 conditions.","rodent","christiaan"

Despite the biological functions of miR-144/451 have been extensively studied in erythropoiesis and tumorigenesis, few studies have been conducted in immune responses. In this study, we showed that miR-144/451-/- DCs exhibit increased activation. Mechanistically, the miR-144 directly targets the 3`-UTR of IRF5 and represses the expression of IRF5 in DCs. Ectopic expression of miR-144/451 by lentiviruses downregulates the levels of IRF5 and suppresses DCs function. In addition, knockdown of IRF5 by shRNA significantly inhibits activities of the miR-144/451-/- DCs. Expression of miR144/451 was decreased in DCs from both patients with IBD and mice with DSS-colitis compared with controls. Human PBMC derived DCs were downregulated expression of miR144/451 after LPS stimulation. In the DSS-induced colitis mice model, we showed that ablation of the miR-144/451 gene causes severe colitis, and their DCs from both periphery and MLN expressed higher co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines than wild-type mice. In addition, DCs isolated from miR-144/451-/- mice transfusion exacerbates mice colitis. In the bone marrow transplanted chimeric mice model, we show that miR-144/451-/- bone marrow transplantation deteriorated DSS-induced colitis. At last, we treat the mice with miR-144/451 delivered by chitosan nanoparticles revealing protective effects in DSS-induced colitis mice. Thus, our results reveal a novel miR144/451-IRF5 pathway in DCs that protects experimental colitis. The manipulation of miR-144/451 expression and DCs activation in IBD patients may be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.","rodent","christiaan"

However, the role of ILC2s in acute rejection after liver transplantation (LT) remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed the frequency, counts, and signature cytokines of ILC2s in liver transplant recipients by flow cytometric analysis and multiplex immunofluorescence assay. We also assessed the spatial distribution and correlation between hepatic ILC2s and Treg cells. The changes of ILC2s were dynamically monitored in the mouse LT model. We found that the frequencies of circulating ILC2s were comparable in liver transplant recipients with either rejection or non-rejection compared with the control group. The hepatic ILC2s counts were significantly increased in the rejection group than in the non-rejection and control groups, and a similar trend was observed for Treg cells. In the mouse LT model, allograft infiltrating ILC2s dramatically increased within 14 days post-transplant. The frequency of ILC2s in bone marrow significantly increased at 7 days post-transplant and rapidly decreased at 14 days after LT. Similarly, there was a significant increase in the frequency of splenic ILC2s within two weeks post-transplant. Multiplex immunofluorescence assay showed a close correlation between hepatic ILC2s and Treg cells by analyzing their spatial distribution and distance. In conclusion, the number of allograft infiltrating ILC2s was closely related to rejection after LT. Allograft infiltrating ILC2s may play inhibitory roles in posttransplant immune homeostasis, favoring resolution of liver allograft rejection by interacting with Treg cells or promoting the migration of Tregs cells into the liver allograft.","rodent","christiaan"

GFPA efficiently decreased adipocyte size and ameliorated inflammatory infiltration in the three types of white adipose tissue and alleviated steatosis, fat accumulation and inflammatory infiltration in the livers of HFD-fed mice. GFPA also decreased the concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and pro-inflammatory factors in the sera and livers of HFD-treated mice. Furthermore, GFPA was found to regulate lipid metabolism via the inhibition of ceramide levels in HFD-treated mice. GFPA exhibited strong anti-obesity effects via the modulation of chronic inflammation through Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa-B signaling, which supports the use of GFPA for the treatment of obesity.","rodent","christiaan"

This is especially important for the direct aspiration technique because of the large aspiration catheters that can reach an inner diameter of 0.072 in. A strategy that strikes a balance between stable proximal vessel support and distal navigation for aspiration is conceptually attractive. To describe a series of transradial posterior circulation thrombectomy procedures in which the aspiration catheter served a dual role of guide support and clot aspiration in a coaxial configuration, thus obviating a larger guide catheter. Patients selected in the series underwent radial artery access and direct over-the-wire navigation of the aspiration catheter into the vertebral artery. With coaxial microcatheter navigation, the aspiration catheter reached distal enough to ingest the clot successfully. Along with clinical and angiographic data, imaging features such as angle of vertebral artery origin were calculated. Five patients underwent a stand-alone aspiration catheter technique for basilar artery occlusion through transradial access. All procedures resulted in thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 3 recanalization. The mean time to basilar artery recanalization was 10 minutes. No access site complications or vertebral artery dissection were noted. The mean subclavian artery-vertebral origin angle was 84.06° (range 78.2-90.2°). For patients selected properly based on vascular anatomy and a careful technique, a large bore aspiration catheter can fulfil a stand-alone dual-role, thus obviating the need for a guide catheter. This can potentially improve the technical feasibility and success of transradial vertebrobasilar thrombectomy.","human_intervention","christiaan"
"2063",35967789,"CircRNA-mediated regulation of brown adipose tissue adipogenesis.","Adipose tissue represents a candidate target for the treatment of metabolic illnesses, such as obesity. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), an important heat source within the body, promotes metabolic health through fat consumption. Therefore, the induction of white fat browning may improve lipid metabolism. Currently, the specific roles of circRNA in BAT and white adipose tissue (WAT) remain elusive. Herein, we conducted circRNA expression profiling of mouse BAT and WAT using RNA-seq. We identified a total of 12,183 circRNAs, including 165 upregulated and 79 downregulated circRNAs between BAT and WAT. Differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs were associated with the mitochondrion, mitochondrial part, mitochondrial inner membrane, mitochondrial envelope, therefore, these circRNAs may affect the thermogenesis and lipid metabolism of BAT. Moreover, DE circRNAs were enriched in browning- and thermogenesis-related pathways, including AMPK and HIF-1 signaling. In addition, a novel circRNA, circOgdh, was found to be highly expressed in BAT, formed by back-splicing of the third and fourth exons of the Ogdh gene, and exhibited higher stability than linear Ogdh. circOgdh was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm and could sponge miR-34a-5p, upregulating the expression of Atgl, a key lipolysis gene, which enhanced brown adipocyte lipolysis and suppressed lipid droplet accumulation.

"2097",35967295,"A hierarchy of selection pressures determines the organization of the T cell receptor repertoire.","We systematically examine the receptor repertoire in T cell subsets in young, adult, and LCMV-infected mice. Somatic recombination generates diversity, resulting in the limited overlap between nucleotide sequences of different repertoires even within the same individual. However, statistical features of the repertoire, quantified by the V gene and CDR3 k-mer frequency distributions, are highly conserved. A hierarchy of immunological processes drives the evolution of this structure. Intra-thymic divergence of CD4+ and CD8+ lineages imposes subtle but dominant differences observed across repertoires of all subpopulations in both young and adult mice. Differentiation from naive through memory to effector phenotype imposes an additional gradient of repertoire diversification, which is further influenced by age in a complex and lineage-dependent manner. The distinct repertoire of CD4+ regulatory T cells is more similar to naive cells in young mice and to effectors in adults. Finally, we describe divergent (naive and memory) and convergent (CD8+ effector) evolution of the repertoire following acute infection with LCMV. This study presents a quantitative framework that captures the structure of the repertoire in terms of its fundamental statistical properties and describes how this structure evolves as individual T cells differentiate, migrate and mature in response to antigen exposure.","rodent","christiaan"

Alkaline phosphatase (AP), an endogenous enzyme that de-phosphorylates extracellular ATP, likely plays an anti-inflammatory role in immune responses. We hypothesized that ilofotase alfa, a human recombinant AP, protects kidneys from ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), a model of acute kidney injury (AKI), by metabolizing extracellular ATP to adenosine, which is known to activate adenosine receptors. Ilofotase alfa (iv) with or without ZM241,385 (sc), a selective adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonist, was administered 1 h before bilateral IRI in WT, A2AR KO (Adora2a-/- ) or CD73-/- mice. In additional studies recombinant alkaline phosphatase was given after IRI. In an AKI-on-chronic kidney disease (CKD) ischemic rat model, ilofotase alfa was given after the three instances of IRI and rats were followed for 56 days. Ilofotase alfa in a dose dependent manner decreased IRI in WT mice, an effect prevented by ZM241,385 and partially prevented in Adora2a-/- mice. Enzymatically inactive ilofotase alfa was not protective. Ilofotase alfa rescued CD73-/- mice, which lack a 5'-ectonucleotidase that dephosphorylates AMP to adenosine; ZM241,385 inhibited that protection. In both rats and mice ilofotase alfa ameliorated IRI when administered after injury, thus providing relevance for therapeutic dosing of ilofotase alfa following established AKI. In an AKI-on-CKD ischemic rat model, ilofotase alfa given after the third instance of IRI reduced injury. These results suggest that ilofotase alfa promotes production of adenosine from liberated ATP in injured kidney tissue, thereby amplifying endogenous mechanisms that can reverse tissue injury, in part through A2AR-and non-A2AR-dependent signaling pathways.","rodent","christiaan"

The current study used a lumbar spinal disk puncture (DP) model of low back pain in wild-type (WT) and muMT mice to evaluate pronociceptive adaptive immune responses. Spinal disks and cords were collected 3 weeks after DP for polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analyses. Wild-type DP mice developed 24 weeks of hindpaw mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia, grip weakness, and a conditioned place preference response indicative of spontaneous pain, but pain responses were attenuated or absent in muMT DP mice. Spinal cord expression of inflammatory cytokines, immune cell markers, and complement components were increased in WT DP mice and in muMT DP mice. Dorsal horn immunostaining in WT DP mice demonstrated glial activation and increased complement 5a receptor expressionin spinal neurons. Serum collected from WT DP mice and injected into muMT DP mice caused nociceptive sensitization, as did intrathecal injection of IgM collected from WT DP mice, and IgM immune complexes were observed in lumbar spinal disks and cord of WT DP mice. Serum from WT tibia fracture mice was not pronociceptive in muMT DP mice and vice versa, evidence that each type of tissue trauma chronically generates its own unique antibodies and targeted antigens.

Estrogen can protect the cardiovascular system, but its exact molecular mechanism is unknown. Here we report that 17β-estradiol (E2) suppressed vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation and inflammation. qRT-PCR and Western blot demonstrated that E2 decreased NF-κB p50 expression and reduced VSMCs proliferation and inflammation. Mechanistically, a dual luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested that KLF5 promoted NF-κB p50 expression by binding to the NF-κB p50 promoter, whereas E2 reduced the effect of KLF5 binding to the NF-κB p50 promoter and inhibited NF-κB p50 expression. Furthermore, a coimmunoprecipitation assay and immunofluorescence staining showed that the interaction between KLF5 and ERα increased in VSMCs treated with E2, which in turn decreased NF-κB p50 expression levels. Altogether, we reveal that E2 inhibits VSMCs proliferation and inflammation by reducing NF-κB expression induced by an increased interaction between KLF5 and ERα. These data provide further insights into how E2 inhibits vascular proliferation and inflammation.","rodent","christiaan"
"2306",35975241,"Neuronal density in the brain cortex and hippocampus in Clsnt2-KO mouse strain modeling autistic spectrum disorder.","Autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) represent conditions starting in childhood, which are characterized by diff iculties with social interaction and communication, as well as non-typical and stereotyping models of behavior. The mechanisms and the origin of these disorders are not yet understood and thus far there is a lack of prophylactic measures for these disorders. The current study aims to estimate neuronal density in the prefrontal cortex and four hippocampal subf ields, i. e. СA1, СA2, СA3, and DG in Clstn2-KO mice as a genetic model of ASD. In addition, the level of neurogenesis was measured in the DG area of the hippocampus. This mouse strain was obtained by a knockout of the calsinthenin-2 gene (Clsnt2) in C57BL/6J mice; the latter (wild type) was used as controls. To estimate neuronal density, serial sections were prepared on a cryotome for the above-mentioned brain structures with the subsequent immunohistochemical labeling and confocal microscopy; the neuronal marker (anti-NeuN) was used as the primary antibody. In addition, neurogenesis was estimated in the DG region of the hippocampus; for this purpose, a primary antibody against doublecortin (anti-DCX) was used. In all cases Goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody. The density of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was lower in Clstn2-KO mice of both sexes as compared with controls. Moreover, in males of both strains, neuronal density in this region was lower as compared to females. Besides, the differences between males and females were revealed in two other hippocampal regions. In the CA2 region, a lower density of neurons was observed in males of both strains, and in the CA3 region, a lower density of neurons was also observed in males as compared to females but only in C57BL/6J mice. No difference between the studied groups was revealed in neurogenesis, nor was it in neuronal density in the prefrontal cortex or DG hippocampal region. Our new f indings indicate that calsyntenin-2 regulates neuronal hippocampal density in subf ield-specif ic manner, suggesting that the CA1 neuronal subpopulation may represent a cellular target for early-life preventive therapy of ASD. Расстройства аутистического спектра (РАС) – это группа состояний, возникающих в детском возрасте, для которых характерны трудности с социальным взаимодействием и общением, a также нетипичные модели поведения и склонность к стереотипии. Механизмы возникновения этой группы расстройств до сих пор не вполне понятны, и, следовательно, отсутствуют соответствующие методы профилактики. Целью исследования была оценка плотности нейронов в медиальной префронтальной коре и четырех областях гиппокампа, а именно СA1, СA2, СA3 и зубчатой извилины (DG) у мышей линии Clstn2-KO, которая может выступать в качестве генетической модели РАС. Кроме того, охарактеризовали уровень нейрогенеза в области DG гиппокампа. Данная линия получена путем нокаута гена кальсинтенина-2 (Clstn2) на основе мышей линии С57BL/6J; последняя была использована в настоящем исследовании в качестве контроля. Для определения плотности нейронов изготавливали серийные срезы соответствующих областей мозга на криотоме с последующим иммуногистохимическим окрашиванием и конфокальной микроскопией, для чего использовали нейрональный маркер (anti-NeuN) в качестве первичного антитела. Наряду с этим в области DG гиппокампа оценивали нейрогенез, для чего проводили иммуногистохимическое окрашивание с применением антитела против даблкортина (anti-DCX). В обоих случаях в качестве вторичного антитела был Goat anti-rabbit IgG. Плотность нейронов в области гиппокампа СА1 была снижена как у самцов, так и самок мышей Clstn2-KO по сравнению с контролем; у самцов обеих линий плотность нейронов была ниже в этой области по сравнению с самками. Помимо этого, были обнаружены различия между самцами и самками в двух других областях гиппокампа: в области CA2 – у мышей обеих исследованных линий, а в области CA3 лишь у мышей C57BL/6J плотность нейронов была меньше у самцов по сравнению с самками. Различий между исследованными группами в уровне нейрогенеза, а также в плотности нейронов в префронтальной коре и области DG гиппокампа не обнаружено. Полученные результаты показывают, что нокаут по гену Clstn2 приводит к избирательному снижению плотности нейронов в CA1-области гиппокампа, что может представлять собой клеточную мишень для ранней профилактики и возможной терапии РАС.","rodent","christiaan"
"2333",35969057,"A Protocol for the Induction of Posttraumatic Stress-Disorder (PTSD)-like Behavior in Mice.","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric condition that precipitates in ~10% of individuals exposed to a traumatic event (TE). Symptoms include recurrent and intrusive thoughts, sleep disturbance, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, and reckless or destructive behavior. Given the complex and heterogeneous nature of the disease, animal models for PTSD-like symptomatology are of increasing interest to the field of PTSD research. Because resilience to PTSD-like symptomatology is an important epidemiologic aspect of PTSD, animal models that resolve vulnerable and resilient animals are of particular value. Due to the complex nature of the PTSD phenotype and the potential overlaps between PTSD-like behavior and behaviors associated with other stress-induced psychopathologies such as anxiety or depression, animal models that utilize multiple readouts for PTSD-like behavior are also of increasing value. We utilize a paradigm developed by Lebow et al. 2012 for the induction and identification of PTSD-like symptomatology in mice. This paradigm utilizes inescapable electric foot shock, administered in two decontextualized sessions over two consecutive days. Stressed mice perform four behavioral tests - dark/light transfer, marble burying, acoustic startle, and home cage activity - to generate five behavioral readouts of PTSD-like behavior: % risk assessment (%RA), % marbles buried (%MB), % prepulse inhibition (%PPI), latency to peak startle amplitude (LPSA), and % light phase activity (%LPA). PTSD-like symptomatology is characterized by decreased %RA, increased %MB, decreased %PPI, decreased LPSA, and increased %LPA. The 20% of animals displaying the most PTSD-like behavior in each test are awarded a certain number of points depending on the test, and animals scoring sufficient points are designated as PTSD-like, while animals scoring no points are designated PTSD-resilient. This paradigm identifies PTSD-like behavior in ~15% of animals, a rate comparable to that observed in humans. This protocol represents a robust and reproducible paradigm for the induction of PTSD-like behavior in mice.","rodent","christiaan"

The head-tracking movement associated with OKN is commonly used as a measure of visual function in rodents. To record OKN responses in normal and experimental rats, a simple and inexpensive apparatus has been developed. This setup uses two tablet screens to display the OKN visual stimulus consisting of high contrast black and white stripes generated using the OKN Stripes Visualization Web Application, a freely available software. The rat is placed inside a clear Plexiglass holder that limits movement so that the rat's head continuously faces the OKN display screen. The position of the rat holder can be changed to adjust the distance between the rat and the display screen. A micro-camera positioned above the rat holder is used to record the rat's visual activities. These recordings can be used for quantitative assessments. Based on the presence or absence of clear head-tracking, the OKN responses at different spatial frequencies can be determined. The collected data demonstrates a novel technique for reliable measurement of visual acuity in normal and retinal degenerate rats.","rodent","christiaan"

"2393",35968459,"Occupational Exposure to Poorly Soluble Low Toxicity Particles and Cardiac Disease: A Look at Carbon Black and Titanium Dioxide.","Environmental particulate exposure and the potential risk to people with various types of cardiac diseases, most notably cardiovascular disease, have aroused scientific and regulatory interest worldwide. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between exposure to airborne environmental particulate matter (PM) and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). The associations reported, however, are complex and may not involve a direct role for PM, since air pollutants are diverse and highly correlated. This study examines the potential role of occupational exposure to two types of particles, namely, manufactured carbon black (CB) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), on the risk of cardiovascular disease. To address the risk of cardiovascular disease from exposure to carbon black and titanium dioxide, as reflective of poorly soluble low toxicity particles, we reviewed the published cohort mortality studies of occupational exposure to carbon black and titanium dioxide. Mortality studies of carbon black have been conducted in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Five mortality studies related to workers involved in the manufacture of titanium dioxide in the United States and Europe have also been conducted. In addition, a meta-analysis of the three-carbon black mortality studies was performed. In the random-effects meta-analysis, full cohort meta-SMRs were 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79-1.29) for heart disease; 1.02 (95% CI: 0.80-1.30) for ischemic heart disease; and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.74-1.59) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality. A small but imprecise increased AMI mortality risk was suggested for cumulative exposure by a meta-HR = 1.10 per 100 mg/m3-years (95% CI: 0.92-1.31) but not for lugged exposures, that is, for recent exposures. Results of five cohort mortality studies of titanium dioxide workers in the United States and Europe showed no excess in all heart disease or cardiovascular disease. In the most recent study in the United States, an internal analysis, that is, within the cohort itself, with no lag time, showed that the exposure group 15-35 mg/m3-years yielded a significantly increased risk for heart disease; however, there was no evidence of increasing risk with increasing exposure for any of the exposure categories. In contrast to environmental studies, the results of cohort mortality studies do not demonstrate that airborne occupational exposure to carbon black and titanium dioxide particulates increases cardiovascular disease mortality. The lack of a relationship between carbon black and titanium dioxide and CVD mortality suggests that the associations reported in air pollution studies may not be driven by the particulate component.","meta_analysis","christiaan"

The primary outcome was the summary risk of T1DM related to ICIs, a meta-analysis was conducted to obtain Peto odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % CIs. In pharmacovigilance study, ICI-T1DM cases were extracted from FAERs. Disproportionality analyses were performed by calculating reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information components (IC). A total of 29 RCTs (20,234 patients) were included, treatment with ICIs significantly increased the risk of all-grade ICI-T1DM (OR: 4.54, 95 % CI: 2.66-7.72), and high-grade (grade 3 or above) ICI-T1DM (OR: 4.26, 95 % CI: 2.12-8.58). No significant differences among subgroup analyses were observed: ICIs treatment schedule, tumor type, case of events (T1DM vs F-T1DM), study design (double blind vs open label) or median PFS (PFS favours ICIs vs PFS favours Control). A total of 978 case reports form FAERS was extracted, treatment with ICIs significantly increased the reporting of ICI-T1DM (n = 978; ROR = 38.45, 95 %CI:35.70-41.41; IC = 4.77, 95 %CI:4.43-5.14).

Approximately 80% to 90% of patients with depression suffer from insomnia, which is associated with substantial personal and social costs. Despite these costs, insomnia is often underdiagnosed and viewed as a symptom that disappears when depression abates. However, research indicates that insomnia and depression are distinct but overlapping disorders. Thus, it is important to treat both disorders simultaneously, as improving sleep may, in turn, ease core symptoms of depression. Optimal care and treatment rely on patients' experiences of insomnia and their attitudes toward treatment options.

Persistent dysphagia following primary chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancers can have a devastating effect on a patient's quality of life. Many studies have shown that the dosimetric sparing of critical structures which were included in swallowing such as the pharyngeal constrictor muscle and larynx can provide improved functional outcomes and better quality of life. However, there are no current randomized studies confirming the benefits of such swallowing-sparing strategies. The aim is to evaluate late dysphagia after chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer and to examine its correlation with clinical and dosimetric parameters. Materials and methods The period of this prospective study was from November 2018 to March 2020. Patients were divided randomly in 1:1 ratio into two groups, group 1 and group 2, each with 25 patients. Group 1 was planned by three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) technique and group 2 was planned by intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique (IMRT) technique. Treatment was delivered after approval of radiotherapy plan. To evaluate the dose to dysphagia aspiration-related structures (DARS), these structures were contoured and dose-volume histograms were generated. Various dosimetric parameters of DARS were evaluated. Swallowing status was clinically evaluated based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5. Results A significant advantage was seen with intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique (IMRT) in comparison to three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in terms of mean dose delivered to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles (66.03 Gy vs 68.77 Gy, p=0.003). The mean dose delivered to the combined dysphagia/aspiration-related structures (DARS) was statistically significantly lower in IMRT compared to 3D-CRT (66.15 Gy vs. 70.09 Gy, p<0.001). Other dose-volumes were also reduced in IMRT group (V30: {98.64% vs. 99.88%, p=0.05}; V50: {90.49% vs. 99.02%, p=0.0002}; V60: {83.92% vs. 95.04, p=0.0002}; D50: {70 Gy vs. 71.16 Gy, p=0.001); and D80: {61.18 Gy vs. 67.39 Gy, p=0.01}. Futhermore, the clinical worsening of dysphagia was less common in IMRT group (48% vs. 80%, p=0.039). Conclusion IMRT can reduce the high-dose volumes received by the DARS receiving high doses by sparing these structures through optimization. This may provide a significant additional benefit that could improve dysphagia and hence the quality of life of patients with head and neck cancer.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

"2425",35967008,"Patient and public involvement in stroke research: a scoping review protocol.","Background: Growing consensus supports public and patient involvement (PPI) in research as the lived experience of patients, family carers and users of health and social care services bring unique insights to healthcare research. The impact and burden of stroke present ongoing challenges for those living with its consequences and could potentially limit PPI activity. This review aims to explore PPI in published stroke research to identify and describe the extent, nature and design of PPI activities, the type/s of studies involved and the profile of PPI participants engaged in stroke research. Methods: This systematic scoping review, guided by the Arksey & O'Malley five step framework, will be reported according to the PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines. PPI is embedded at each stage of this proposed scoping review from conceptualisation, participation, contribution and collaboration. The Population, Concept, Context (PCC) structure defines the research question which asks - How is PPI in stroke research currently being conducted and how do the study authors report their PPI activities and its impact? A comprehensive range of electronic databases including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will generate a broad range of studies. Grey literature (e.g. OpenGrey, Lenus) and internationally recognised stroke organisation websites will be searched for additional research reports. Data extraction will adhere to the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, with results collated and mapped to the research cycle stage/s. Conclusions: The outlined scoping review protocol will comprehensively identify and map the existing scientific literature that reports PPI in stroke research. Findings will be presented in relation to PPI conceptualisation, participant profiles and activities in stroke research, volume, type and range of approaches. Knowledge gaps may be identified thereby offering opportunities and recommendations for future priorities for PPI in stroke research.","protocol","christiaan"

Additional objectives include summarizing what outcomes are evaluated and what gaps remain within the literature. By consolidating this information, health care administrators may more easily reference transition to practice methods to enhance their own programs for advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants. Transition to practice involves two program types: onboarding and postgraduate training. However, no existing reviews describe the state of the literature regarding these program types, and how they compare with regard to location, setting, and outcomes. Because transition to practice programs may improve workforce outcomes, understanding how these programs differ, and what gaps exist, is needed to help these programs grow. This review will include articles describing transition to practice for advanced practice registered nurses and/or physician assistants, including onboarding and fellowship/residency programs. Articles will be included regardless of geographic location if they take place within a professional, clinical setting. The scoping review will follow the JBI approach. Databases to be searched include MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Scopus, and Web of Science.

"2447",35967617,"Hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy with online sessions to reduce fatigue in patients undergoing chemotherapy for a metastatic colorectal cancer: Rational and study protocol for a feasibility study.","In metastatic colorectal cancer (CRCm), fatigue is pervasive, reduces quality of life, and is negatively associated with survival. Its course is explained in part by psychosocial variables such as emotional distress, coping strategies, or perceived control. Thus, to reduce fatigue, psychosocial interventions appear to be relevant. In some cancers, Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT) reduce fatigue. Hypnosis is also used as a complementary therapy to reduce the side effects of cancer. While CBT requires specific training often reserved for psychologists, hypnosis has the advantage of being increasingly practiced by caregivers and is therefore less expensive (Montgomery et al., 2007). On the other hand, CBT and hypnosis remain understudied in the CRC, do not focus on the symptom of fatigue and in Europe such programs have never been evaluated. Implementing an intervention in a healthcare setting is complex (e.g., economic and practical aspects) and recruiting participants can be challenging. The primary objective will therefore be to study the feasibility of two standardized interventions (hypnosis and CBT) that aim to reduce fatigue in patients with CRCm treated in a French cancer center. A prospective, single-center, randomized interventional feasibility study, using mixed methods (both quantitative and qualitative). A total of 60 patients will be allocated to each intervention group [Hypnosis (n = 30) and CBT (n = 30)]. Participants will be randomized into two parallel groups (ratio 1:1). Both programs will consist of 6 weekly sessions focusing on the CRF management over a period of 6 weeks. Trained therapists will conduct the program combining 3 face-to-face sessions and 3 online sessions. The feasibility and experience of interventions will be evaluated by the outcome variables, including the adhesion rate, the reasons for acceptability, relevance or non-adherence, the satisfaction, the fatigue evolution (with ecological momentary assessments), and the quality of life. All questionnaires will be self-assessment using an online application from the cancer center. Results will highlight the barriers/facilitators to the implementation of the program and the relevance of the program to the patients, and will be used to generate hypotheses for a randomized control trial.

Infra-slow Neurofeedback (ISF-NF) training is a recent development focusing on modulating cortical slow-wave activity to improve pain outcomes. A parallel, two-armed double-blinded, randomized sham-controlled, feasibility clinical trial aimed to determine the feasibility and safety of a novel electroencephalography-based infraslow fluctuation neurofeedback (EEG ISF-NF) training in people with KOA and determine the variability of clinical outcomes and EEG changes following NF training. Eligible participants attended nine 30-min ISF-NF training sessions involving three cortical regions linked to pain. Feasibility measures were monitored during the trial period. Pain and functional outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up after 2 weeks. Resting-state EEG was recorded at baseline and immediate post-intervention. Participants were middle-aged (61.7 ± 7.6 years), New Zealand European (90.5%), and mostly females (62%) with an average knee pain duration of 4 ± 3.4 years. The study achieved a retention rate of 91%, with 20/22 participants completing all the sessions. Participants rated high levels of acceptance and moderate to high levels of perceived effectiveness of the training. No serious adverse events were reported during the trial. Mean difference (95% CI) for clinical pain and function measures are as follows for pain severity [active: 0.89 ± 1.7 (-0.27 to 2.0); sham: 0.98 ± 1.1 (0.22-1.7)], pain interference [active: 0.75 ± 2.3 (-0.82 to 2.3); Sham: 0.89 ± 2.1 (-0.60 to 2.4)], pain unpleasantness [active: 2.6 ± 3.7 (0.17-5.1); sham: 2.8 ± 3 (0.62-5.0)] and physical function [active: 6.2 ± 13 (-2.6 to 15); sham: 1.6 ± 12 (-6.8 to 10)]. EEG sources demonstrated frequency-specific neuronal activity, functional connectivity, and ISF ratio changes following NF training. The findings of the study indicated that the ISF-NF training is a feasible, safe, and acceptable intervention for pain management in people with KOA, with high levels of perceived effectiveness. The study also reports the variability in clinical, brain activity, and connectivity changes following training.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

The current study compared the effectiveness of HFNO in patients with hypercapnic RF with conventional oxygen therapy (COT). The primary objective was to compare changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) between those receiving COT and HFNO. The secondary objectives were to compare changes in the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate (RR), serum bicarbonate level, base excess, lactate level, and incidence of the need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and mechanical ventilation (MV). We recruited 30 patients with mild to moderate hypercapnic RF in the HFNO group, and data of 30 patients from historical controls, who matched the inclusion criteria, were obtained from medical records for comparison (COT group). The study was terminated after two hours, and patients were managed per the existing protocol after that. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis was repeated at the baseline, first, second, and third hours. In the COT group, the mean RR at the baseline, first, second, and third hours was 24.5 ± 2.61, 24.9 ± 3.03, 26.03 ± 3.4, and 22.90 ± 1.86, whereas, in the HFNO group, it was 25.93 ± 3.91, 23.00 ± 3.54, 22.50 ± 3.38, and 21.90 ± 3.57, respectively. The mean PaCO2 in the COT vs. HFNO groups was 54.45 ± 5.83 vs. 62.22 ± 9.15, 57.74 ± 6.05 vs. 58.65 ± 10.43, 60.79 ± 7.48 vs. 60.41 ± 11.24, and 55.23 ± 6.63 vs. 56.95 ± 10.31. The mean SpO2 in the COT group at these points of time was 94.50 ± 1.46, 95.4 ± 1.28, 96.10 ± 1.84, and 97.53 ± 2.05, whereas, in the HFNO group, it was 95.40 ± 2.55, 98.63 ± 1.43, 99.00 ± 1.66, and 99.50 ± 1.31, respectively. The patients who needed NIV after the study period were 50% and 36.67% in the COT and HFNO groups, respectively. There was no change in PaCO2 levels with HFNO, but there was a significant improvement in SpO2 and PaO2 levels and a decreased RR. Following the termination of the study protocol, more patients in the COT group needed NIV than those in the HFNO group.","human_intervention","christiaan"

However, it is still unknown whether SFN intake alone has beneficial effects on cognition as well as mood. We investigated whether a SFN intake intervention improved cognitive performance and mood states in healthy older adults. In a 12-week, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT), we randomly assigned 144 older adults to a SFN group or a placebo group. We asked the participants to take a supplement (SFN or placebo) for 12 weeks. We measured several cognitive functions, mood states, and biomarkers before and after the intervention period. The SFN group showed improvement in processing speed and a decrease in negative mood compared to the placebo group. In addition, the SFN group exhibited a higher SFN-N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) level compared to the placebo group. However, there were no significant results in other biomarkers of oxidant stress, inflammation, or neural plasticity. These results indicate that nutrition interventions using SFN can have positive effects on cognitive functioning and mood in healthy older adults.","randomized_trial","christiaan"

Therefore, this study aimed to assess this relationship, and to evaluate the associated factors of diabetes self-care, social support, and glycemic control in Egyptian PHC patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). A cross-sectional study was conducted on 320 T2DM patients at four PHC settings in Port Said city, affiliated with the General Authority of Healthcare. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data, including demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status scale, disease profile, the Arabic versions of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities, and the received social support scales. Data were collected from January 2020 to June 2020. Diabetes self-care activities, and self-monitoring of blood glucose had a very weak negative correlations with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (rho = - 0.125, p = 0.025, rho = - 0.112, p = 0.044, respectively). Receiving social support on following a meal correlated positively and very weakly with HbA1c levels (rho = 0.145, p = 0.010). Hardly positive correlation was found between receiving emotional support on feelings about diabetes, and following a specific diet (rho = 0.169, p = 0.002). Diabetes self-care activities were positively associated with higher education levels, and elevated BMI. Received social support was negatively associated with having coronary artery disease, and marital status e.g. divorced and widow. Increased age, and female gender were the predictors of good glycemic control. Diabetes self-care activities were linked with reduced HBA1c levels. Further studies are needed to evaluate the buffering effect of social support on glycemic outcomes in PHC patients with T2DM.","misc","christiaan"

This study aimed to assess the linear growth of patients with pediatric IBD and to detect the frequency and the possible risk factors of LGI. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional review of medical records of patients with pediatric IBD was conducted in the pediatrics department, Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain, from 1984 to 2019. Demographic and anthropometric data were gathered. World Health Organization (WHO) standards and references were used to define LGI. According to WHO, stunting and severe stunting were defined as length/height for age of <-2 standard deviations and <-3 standard deviations from age and sex-specific reference means, respectively. To determine the possible risk factors for LGI, stunted patients were compared with normal height patients in regard to demographic data, clinical presentations, and treatment used. Results Out of 130 patients with pediatric IBD, 88 (67.7%) had anthropometric data available. Fifty-five (62.5%) were males. Forty-seven (53.4%) had Crohn's disease and 41 (46.6%) had ulcerative colitis. The mean age at presentation was 10.7±3.8 years. The median age at the time of growth measurement was 14.2 (interquartile range=12.1-24.4) years. Fifteen (17%) patients were stunted, and seven (46.7%) of those stunted patients were severely stunted. Weight at presentation was lower in stunted patients (21.6±5.9 kilograms) compared to normal height patients (31±13.4 kilogram) (p=0.048). Sex, delivery type, birth weight, height at presentation, age at presentation, age at growth measurements, IBD type, disease duration, presence of extraintestinal manifestations, and prednisolone and biologic therapy use were not significant factors of stunting. Conclusion Patients with pediatric IBD have a high prevalence of LGI compared to the general population. Low weight at disease presentation is the only significant risk factor for LGI. This might indicate that IBD as a disease by itself is having the main negative impact on linear growth.","misc","christiaan"
"2066",35967431,"Protective role of Cav-1 in pneumolysin-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction.","Pneumolysin (PLY) is a bacterial pore forming toxin and primary virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumonia, a major cause of pneumonia. PLY binds cholesterol-rich domains of the endothelial cell (EC) plasma membrane resulting in pore assembly and increased intracellular (IC) Ca2+ levels that compromise endothelial barrier integrity. Caveolae are specialized plasmalemma microdomains of ECs enriched in cholesterol. We hypothesized that the abundance of cholesterol-rich domains in EC plasma membranes confers cellular susceptibility to PLY. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found increased PLY-induced IC Ca2+ following membrane cholesterol depletion. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is an essential structural protein of caveolae and its regulation by cholesterol levels suggested a possible role in EC barrier function. Indeed, Cav-1 and its scaffolding domain peptide protected the endothelial barrier from PLY-induced disruption. In loss of function experiments, Cav-1 was knocked-out using CRISPR-Cas9 or silenced in human lung microvascular ECs. Loss of Cav-1 significantly enhanced the ability of PLY to disrupt endothelial barrier integrity. Rescue experiments with re-expression of Cav-1 or its scaffolding domain peptide protected the EC barrier against PLY-induced barrier disruption. Dynamin-2 (DNM2) is known to regulate caveolar membrane endocytosis. Inhibition of endocytosis, with dynamin inhibitors or siDNM2 amplified PLY induced EC barrier dysfunction. These results suggest that Cav-1 protects the endothelial barrier against PLY by promoting endocytosis of damaged membrane, thus reducing calcium entry and PLY-dependent signaling.","misc","christiaan"
"1333",35967864,"Healed Lesions of Human Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Caused By Leishmania major Do Not Shelter Persistent Residual Parasites.","In human cutaneous leishmaniasis (HCL) caused by Leishmania (L.) major, the cutaneous lesions heal spontaneously and induce a Th1-type immunity that confers solid protection against reinfection. The same holds true for the experimental leishmaniasis induced by L. major in C57BL/6 mice where residual parasites persist after spontaneous clinical cure and induce sustainable memory immune responses and resistance to reinfection. Whether residual parasites also persist in scars of cured HCL caused by L. major is still unknown. Cutaneous scars from 53 volunteers with healed HCL caused by L. major were biopsied and the tissue sample homogenates were analyzed for residual parasites by four methods: i) microscope detection of amastigotes, ii) parasite culture by inoculation on biphasic medium, iii) inoculation of tissue exctracts to the footpad of BALB/c mice, an inbred strain highly susceptible to L. major, and iv) amplification of parasite kDNA by a highly sensitive real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Our results show that the scars of healed lesions of HCL caused by L. major do not contain detectable residual parasites, suggesting that this form likely induces a sterile cure at least within the scars. This feature contrasts with other Leishmania species causing chronic, diffuse, or recidivating forms of leishmaniasis where parasites do persist in healed lesions. The possibility that alternative mechanisms to parasite persistence are needed to boost and maintain long-term immunity to L. major, should be taken into consideration in vaccine development against L. major infection.","misc","christiaan"

Although many of the mechanisms that control αβ- and γδ-lineage differentiation are shared between human and mouse, important differences have also been observed. Here, we studied the regulatory dynamics of the E and ID protein encoding genes during pediatric human T cell development by evaluating changes in chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and bulk and single cell gene expression. We profiled patterns of ID/E protein activity and identified up- and downstream regulators and targets, respectively. In addition, we compared transcription of E and ID protein encoding genes in human versus mouse to predict both shared and unique activities in these species, and in prenatal versus pediatric human T cell differentiation to identify regulatory changes during development. This analysis showed a putative involvement of TCF3/E2A in the development of γδ T cells. In contrast, in αβ T cell precursors a pivotal pre-TCR-driven population with high ID gene expression and low predicted E protein activity was identified. Finally, in prenatal but not postnatal thymocytes, high HEB/TCF12 levels were found to counteract high ID levels to sustain thymic development. In summary, we uncovered novel insights in the regulation of E and ID proteins on a cross-species and cross-developmental level.","misc","christiaan"

It has been hypothesized that cumulative impairments in multiple domains affect functional reserve of swallowing with age, but the multifactorial etiology and postulated compensatory strategies of the brain are incompletely understood. This study investigates presbyphagia and its neural correlates, focusing on the clinical determinants associated with adaptive neuroplasticity. 64 subjects over 70 years of age free of typical diseases explaining dysphagia received comprehensive workup including flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), magnetoencephalography (MEG) during swallowing and pharyngeal stimulation, volumetry of swallowing muscles, laboratory analyzes, and assessment of hand-grip-strength, nutritional status, frailty, olfaction, cognition and mental health. Neural MEG activation was compared between participants with and without presbyphagia in FEES, and associated clinical influencing factors were analyzed. Presbyphagia was defined as the presence of oropharyngeal swallowing alterations e.g., penetration, aspiration, pharyngeal residue pooling or premature bolus spillage into the piriform sinus and/or laryngeal vestibule. 32 of 64 participants showed swallowing alterations, mainly characterized by pharyngeal residue, whereas the airway was rarely compromised. In the MEG analysis, participants with presbyphagia activated an increased cortical sensorimotor network during swallowing. As major clinical determinant, participants with swallowing alterations exhibited reduced pharyngeal sensation. Presbyphagia was an independent predictor of a reduced nutritional status in a linear regression model. Swallowing alterations frequently occur in otherwise healthy older adults and are associated with decreased nutritional status. Increased sensorimotor cortical activation may constitute a compensation attempt to uphold swallowing function due to sensory decline. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the swallowing alterations observed can be considered physiological per se or whether the concept of presbyphagia may need to be extended to a theory with a continuous transition between presbyphagia and dysphagia.","misc","christiaan"

The catalyst-substrate interaction is described using a dispersion-driven induced-fit model, in which the conformational changes of the catalyst and of the substrate in the transition states are governed to a large extent by London dispersion forces. The distortion energy of the catalyst is dominated by the change in the intramolecular dispersion interactions, while intermolecular catalyst-substrate dispersion interactions are the major stabilizing contribution in the transition state. This model provides a new general framework in which to discuss the stereoselectivity of transformations catalyzed by such confined organocatalysts.","misc","christiaan"

The [RuII(terpy)(ampy)Cl]Cl (terpy = 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine, ampy = 2-(aminomethyl)pyridine) complex was employed as the catalyst. The reactions were studied in a water/ethanol mixture as a function of formate, catalyst, and NAD+ concentrations at 37 °C. The overall process was found to be 11 to 18 times slower than for the corresponding ethylenediamine (en) complex as the result of π-back bonding effects of the ampy ligand. The mechanistic studies revealed a complete set of reactions that accounted for the overall catalytic cycle based on a formate-induced hydride transfer reaction to form the reduced coenzyme, NADH. The geometries of the ruthenium(ii)-ampy complexes involved in the catalytic cycle and free energy changes for the main steps were predicted by DFT calculations. Similar calculations were also performed for the analogues ruthenium(ii)-en and ruthenium(ii)-bipy complexes (bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine). The DFT calculated energies show that both the solvent-formato exchange and the formato-hydrido conversion reactions have negative (favourable) energies to proceed spontaneously. The reactions involving the en complex have the more negative (favourable) reaction energies, followed by the ampy complex, in agreement with faster reactions for en complexes and slower reactions for bipy complexes than for ampy complexes.","misc","christiaan"

High reliability for daily vitality measures (with lower vitality rates in the morning) was found in study 2, but no substantial variation was found between working days and days off. The SVS-GM shows good psychometric properties in different settings and provides researchers with a 3-item (for cross-sectional or longitudinal studies) and 1-item (for short screenings) version to measure subjective vitality in German-speaking populations.","misc","christiaan"
"1128",35973773,"Proteome analysis reveals the molecular basis of honeybee brain and midgut response to sulfoxaflor.","Sulfoxaflor is a widely used pesticide in agriculture. However, the molecular effects of sublethal sulfoxaflor on honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) remain elusive. Here, the effects of a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor (0.05 μg/bee) on the brain and midgut proteome response of the honeybee were investigated. Exposure to sublethal sulfoxaflor doses did not cause significant honeybee death, but it induced significant alterations in the brain and midgut proteomes. After sulfoxaflor challenge, 135 and 28 proteins were differentially regulated in the brain and midgut, respectively. The up-regulated proteins were mainly implicated in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter transport and drug metabolism processes, and included in particular enzymes of the citrate cycle and cellular respiration process, such as ATP citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunits, and NADH dehydrogenase. These findings suggest that honeybees enhance energy metabolism in the midgut and brain to resist sulfoxaflor challenge. Notably, treatment with sulfoxaflor resulted in a 6.8 times increase in expression levels of the major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJP1) in the brain, and knockdown of MRJP1 mRNA expression using RNA interference significantly decreased the survival rate, indicating that MRJP1 may play an important role in sulfoxaflor tolerance. Our data reveals that sulfoxaflor influences multiple processes related to both metabolism and the nervous system, and provides novel insights into the molecular basis of the honeybee brain and midgut response to sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor.","misc","christiaan"

Herein, we describe our experience in neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and subsequent surgery for the treatment of UESL in children. To evaluate the efficacy of NAT and explore a new choice for successful operation of UESL in children. We retrospectively analyzed six patients newly diagnosed with unresectable UESL who received NAT and then surgery at our center between January 2004 and December 2019. The tumor was considered unresectable if it involved a large part of both lobes of the liver or had invaded the main hepatic vessels or inferior vena cava. The NAT included preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and systemic chemotherapy. The patients were 4 boys and 2 girls with a mean age of 7 years. The longest tumor at presentation ranged from 8.6 to 14.8 cm (mean, 12 cm). Extrahepatic metastases were present in 2 cases. Preoperative systemic chemotherapy was administered 3 wk after TACE. Tumor resection was performed 3 wk after one or two cycles of NAT. The patients received systemic chemotherapy after surgery. All patients successfully underwent NAT and complete resection. The tumor volumes decreased by 18.2%-68.7%, with a mean decrease of 36% after 1 cycle of NAT (t = 3.524, P = 0.017). According to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria, 4 patients had a partial response and underwent surgery, while 2 had stable disease and received another cycle of NAT before surgery. Massive tumor necrosis was seen on pathological examination of the surgical specimen: > 90% necrosis in two, > 50% necrosis in three, and 25% necrosis in 1, with an average of 71.8%. Post-NAT complications included fever, nausea and vomiting, and mild bone marrow suppression. Elevated alanine transaminase levels occurred in all patients, which returned to normal within 7-10 d after treatment. No cardiac or renal toxicity, severe hepatic dysfunction, bleeding and non-target embolization were observed in the patients. The median follow-up period was 8 years with an overall survival of 100%. NAT effectively reduced tumor volume, cleared the tumor margin, and caused massive tumor necrosis. This may be a promising choice for successful surgery of UESL in children.","misc","christiaan"

Here, a 3D culture system is modified to study a phospholipid mediator-induced (Platelet Activating Factor, PAF) transformation. Immunomodulators and other secreted molecules play a major role in tumor initiation and progression in the breast. In the present study, 3D acinar cultures of breast epithelial cells are exposed to PAF exhibited transformation characteristics such as loss of polarity and altered cellular characteristics. This 3D culture system will assist in shedding light on genetic and/or epigenetic perturbations induced by various small molecule entities in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, this system will also provide a platform for the identification of novel as well as known genes that may be involved in the process of transformation.","misc","christiaan"

We experimentally study bilayer strips as they swell and fold, and we propose a simple model to explain the emergence of ratchetlike behavior. Experiments and model predictions are then compared to simulations, which enable calculation of elastic energy during swelling. We investigate the dependence of this steplike behavior as a function of elastic boundary condition strength, strip length, and strip shape; interestingly, V-shape strips with the same boundary conditions fold smoothly.","misc","christiaan"

In this report, on the other hand, three types of sterically demanding organic dyes trapped by a polyaromatic cage were investigated by spectroscopic analyses on the basis of supramolecular interactions. Coumarins with two bulky substituents are bound by the cage in aqueous solution. The resultant caged dyes show unusual emission enhancement, depending on the difference of a single heteroatom in their substituents. The color of perylene bisimides with two bulky substituents is remarkably changed from yellow to red upon caging. This peculiarity stems from the twist of the substituents in the cage, revealed by the combination of absorption and theoretical studies. Furthermore, tetrasubstituted, bulky porphyrins are caught by the cage in aqueous solution. The caged bulky dyes also display altered color and absorption properties, which remain intact even under acidic conditions. In contrast to typical covalent functionalization and previous host-guest studies toward small and non-bulky dyes, the unusual, non-covalent spectroscopic modulation of the large and bulky dyes can be accomplished for the first time by the present cage, featuring a prolate polyaromatic framework with four openings.","misc","christiaan"

The virulence plasmids have emerged as the predominant vehicles carrying the major pathogenic determinants of hypermucoviscosity and hypervirulence phenotypes. In the present study, we characterized a novel virulence plasmid in AP8555, an ST23 hvKP strain, which induced a metastatic infection and fatal septic shock in a critically ill patient. The serum killing assay, the quantitative biofilm formation assay, the G.mellonella infection model, and the mouse lethality assay demonstrated that AP8555 was almost as virulent as the hvKP strain NUTH-K2044. The plasmid pAP855 could be conjugated to Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ATCC700603 and E. coli J53 at a frequency of 7.2× 10-5 and 8.7× 10-7, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis confirmed that the plasmid was novel, clustered to the incompatibility type of IncHI1B/IncFIB/IncFII and presented high similarity to the pK2044 plasmid. In contrast, a 130-kb large-fragment insertion was observed on the plasmid, which introduced a genetic hybrid zone with multiple conjugation-related genes of type IV secretion systems (T4SS) and CcdAB toxin-antitoxin systems (TAS) to the plasmid. In the transconjugants, the presence of pAP855 had a negative impact on bacterial fitness, but enhancing the virulence-associated phenotypes. In vitro evolution experiments showed that pAP855 in the transconjugants could not be stably inherited after 10 days of passage. Our study not only reports a novel hybrid plasmid but also highlights the putative pathway of conjugative virulence plasmid formation and evolution by means of genetic rearrangement through sequence insertion. These findings indicate that structural versatility could contribute to the dissemination of cointegrate virulence plasmid, although the plasmid incurred a fitness cost. Therefore, continuous monitoring the acquisition of conjugative virulence plasmids may have critical value for plasmid research and increase awareness of hvKP.","misc","christiaan"

As outcomes, we evaluated the 1-year American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Constant shoulder scores, postoperative shoulder range of motion, intra- and postoperative complications, and cumulative revision rate. The patients were grouped based on preoperative diagnosis to compare postoperative outcomes across two broad groups. The median follow-up period was 32.8 months (interquartile range, 12.6-66.6 months). The 1-year visual analog scale, range of motion, and Constant and ASES functional scores were comparable between RSAs performed to treat shoulder trauma and that performed for arthritis. The overall complication rate was 20.4%, with patients with a preoperative diagnosis of arthritis having significantly more complications than those with a preoperative diagnosis of trauma (34.8% vs. 7.7%).

The BRG may be modulated by participants' subjective familiarity with words as previous studies found smaller regional activations in the brain as they become proficient. It can be assumed that visual recognition of words with high subjective familiarity indicates skilled performance in visual recognition. Thus, this study examined the subjective familiarity effect of visual words on the BRG during lateralized lexical decision performances. It showed that the significant BRG of response times was only observed in the most familiar word condition (F4 level); on the other hand, accuracy results revealed the significant BRGs in all the subjective familiarity levels (F1, F2, F3, and F4 levels). These results suggest that the bilateral presentation of identical words with higher subjective familiarity facilitates the recognition led by cooperative interactions between cerebral hemispheres. Therefore, the subjective familiarity with visual words modulates the efficiency of hemispheric interactions in visual word recognition.","misc","christiaan"

We collected COVID-19 patient data from the Korean public health authorities and estimated the incubation period by fitting three different distributions, including log-normal, gamma, and Weibull distributions, after stratification by gender and age groups. To identify any temporal impact on the incubation period, we divided the study period into two different epidemic periods (Period-1: 19 January-19 April 2020 and Period-2: 20 April-16 October 2020), and assessed for any differences. We identified the log-normal as the best-fit model. The estimated median incubation period was 4.6 (95% CI: 3.9-4.9) days, and the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95% CI: 10.2-12.2) days. We found that the incubation period did not differ significantly between males and females (p = 0.42), age groups (p = 0.60), and the two different epidemic periods (p = 0.77).

The centrally expressed melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC3R and MC4R) possess overlapping but distinct roles in energy homeostasis.

At the third position, d-amino acids were required for melanocortin agonist activity, while both l- and d-residues resulted in MC4R antagonist activity. These results indicate that l-indoylated phenylalanine residues at the third position of the scaffold can generate MC4R over MC3R selective antagonist ligands, resulting in a substitution pattern that may be exploited for novel MC4R ligands that can be used to probe the in vivo activity of the MC4R without involvement of the MC3R.","misc","christiaan"

In contrast, the downregulation of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in T helper (Th) 1-dominant skin disorders may lead to more adverse events, given the crucial role of IFN-γ in antiviral and antitumoral immunity. Modulating Th17 and Th2 cell differentiation is performed by blocking IL-23 and IL-4, respectively, whereas anti-IL-12 antibodies are only moderately effective in downregulating Th1 lymphocyte differentiation. Therefore, a targeted approach of IFN-γ-driven disorders remains challenging. Recent literature suggests that certain pathogenic Th17 cell subsets with Th1 characteristics, such as CD4+CD161+CCR6+CXCR3+IL-17+IFN-y+ (Th17.1) and CD4+CD161+CCR6+CXCR3+IL-17-IFN-y+ (exTh17), are important contributors in Th1-mediated autoimmunity. Differentiation to a Th17.1 or exTh17 profile results in the upregulation of IFN-y. Remarkably, these pathogenic Th17 cell subsets are resistant to glucocorticoid therapy and the dampening effect of regulatory T cells (Treg). The identification of Th17.1/exTh17 cells in auto-immune disorders may explain the frequent treatment failure of conventional immunosuppressants. In this review, we summarize the current evidence regarding the cellular plasticity of Th17 cells in inflammatory skin disorders. A deeper understanding of this phenomenon may lead to better insights into the pathogenesis of various skin diseases and the discovery of a potential new treatment target.","misc","christiaan"

"2020",35968103,"Recognition of a translocation motif in the regulator HpaA from Xanthomonas euvesicatoria is controlled by the type III secretion chaperone HpaB.","The Gram-negative plant-pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas euvesicatoria is the causal agent of bacterial spot disease in pepper and tomato plants. Pathogenicity of X. euvesicatoria depends on a type III secretion (T3S) system which translocates effector proteins into plant cells and is associated with an extracellular pilus and a translocon in the plant plasma membrane. Effector protein translocation is activated by the cytoplasmic T3S chaperone HpaB which presumably targets effectors to the T3S system. We previously reported that HpaB is controlled by the translocated regulator HpaA which binds to and inactivates HpaB during the assembly of the T3S system. In the present study, we show that translocation of HpaA depends on the T3S substrate specificity switch protein HpaC and likely occurs after pilus and translocon assembly. Translocation of HpaA requires the presence of a translocation motif (TrM) in the N-terminal region. The TrM consists of an arginine-and proline-rich amino acid sequence and is also essential for the in vivo function of HpaA. Mutation of the TrM allowed the translocation of HpaA in hpaB mutant strains but not in the wild-type strain, suggesting that the recognition of the TrM depends on HpaB. Strikingly, the contribution of HpaB to the TrM-dependent translocation of HpaA was independent of the presence of the C-terminal HpaB-binding site in HpaA. We propose that HpaB generates a recognition site for the TrM at the T3S system and thus restricts the access to the secretion channel to effector proteins. Possible docking sites for HpaA at the T3S system were identified by in vivo and in vitro interaction studies and include the ATPase HrcN and components of the predicted cytoplasmic sorting platform of the T3S system. Notably, the TrM interfered with the efficient interaction of HpaA with several T3S system components, suggesting that it prevents premature binding of HpaA. Taken together, our data highlight a yet unknown contribution of the TrM and HpaB to substrate recognition and suggest that the TrM increases the binding specificity between HpaA and T3S system components.","misc","christiaan"

This model was developed from theoretical inputs from three fundamental disciplines for understanding interspecies interactions: neuroscience, psychology and ethology, with the objective of providing a transdisciplinary approach on which field professionals and researchers can build and collaborate. Seminal works in affective neuroscience offer a common basis between humans and animals and, as such, can be applied to the study of interspecies interactions from a One Health-One Welfare perspective. On the one hand, Jaak Panksepp's research revealed that primary/basic emotions originate in the deep subcortical regions of the brain and are shared by all mammals, including humans. On the other hand, several works in the field of neuroscience show that the basic physiological state is largely determined by the perception of safety. Thus, emotional expression reflects the state of an individual's permanent adaptation to ever-changing environmental demands. Based on this evidence and over 5 years of action research using grounded theory, alternating between research and practice, the IMHAI proposes a systemic approach to the study of primary-process emotional affects during interspecies social interactions, through the processes of emotional transfer, embodied communication and interactive emotional regulation. IMHAI aims to generate new hypotheses and predictions on affective behavior and interspecies communication. Application of such a model should promote risk prevention and the establishment of positive links between humans and animals thereby contributing to their respective wellbeing.","misc","christiaan"

Following the Programme Design, Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation (DIME) protocol, we used a two-step qualitative research design to interview frontline HCWs, mental health experts, administrators, and service planners in Spain. We used Free List (FL) interviews to identify problems experienced by frontline HCWs and Key informant (KI) interviews to describe them and explore their determinants and consequences, as well as the strategies considered useful to overcome these problems. We used a thematic analysis approach to analyze the interview outputs and framed our results into a five-level social-ecological model (intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public health). We recruited 75 FL and 22 KI interviewees, roughly balanced in age and gender. We detected 56 themes during the FL interviews and explored the following themes in the KI interviews: fear of infection, psychological distress, stress, moral distress, and interpersonal conflicts among coworkers. We found that interviewees reported perceived causes and consequences across problems at all levels (intrapersonal to public health). Although several mental health strategies were implemented (especially at an intrapersonal and interpersonal level), most mental health needs remained unmet, especially at the organizational, community, and public policy levels. In keeping with available quantitative evidence, our findings show that mental health problems are still relevant for frontline HCWs 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic and that many reported causes of these problems are modifiable. Based on this, we offer specific recommendations to design and implement mental health strategies and recommend using transdiagnostic, low-intensity, scalable psychological interventions contextually adapted and tailored for HCWs.","misc","christiaan"
"1514",35975831,"Analytic description of nanowires II: morphing of regular cross sections for zincblende- and diamond-structures to match arbitrary shapes.","Setting out from our recent publication [König & Smith (2021). Acta Cryst. B77, 861], we extend our analytic description of the regular cross sections of zincblende- and diamond-structure nanowires (NWires) by introducing cross section morphing to arbitrary convex shapes featuring linear interfaces as encountered in experiment. To this end, we provide add-on terms to the existing number series with their respective running indices for zinc-blende- (zb-) and diamond-structure NWire cross sections. Such add-on terms to all variables yield the required flexibility for cross section morphing, with main variables presented by the number of NWire atoms NWire(dWire[i]), bonds between NWire atoms Nbnd(dWire[i]) and interface bonds NIF(dWire[i]). Other basic geometric variables, such as the specific length of interface facets, as well as widths, heights and total area of the cross section, are given as well. The cross sections refer to the six high-symmetry zb NWires with low-index faceting frequently occurring in the bottom-up and top-down approaches of NWire processing. The fundamental insights into NWire structures revealed here offer a universal gauge and thus enable major advancements in data interpretation and the understanding of all zb- and diamond-structure-based NWires with arbitrary convex cross sections. We corroborate this statement with an exact description of irregular Si NWire cross sections and irregular InGaAs/GaAs core-shell NWire cross sections, where a radially changing unit-cell parameter can be included.","misc","christiaan"

Cadmium (Cd) affects the quality of S. miltiorrhiza, posing serious threats to human health. To reveal the metabolic mechanisms of S. miltiorrhiza's resistance to Cd stress, metabolite changes in S. miltiorrhiza roots treated with 0 (CK), 25 (T1), 50 (T2) and 100 (T3) mg kg-1 Cd by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were investigated. A total of 305 metabolites were identified, and most of them were amino acids, organic acids and fatty acids, which contributed to the discrimination of CK from the Cd-treated groups. Among them, S. miltiorrhiza mainly upregulated o-tyrosine, chorismate and eudesmic acid in resistance to 25 mg kg-1 Cd; DL-tryptophan, L-aspartic acid, L-proline and chorismite in resistance to 50 mg kg-1 Cd; and L-proline, L-serine, L-histidine, eudesmic acid, and rosmarinic acid in resistance to 100 mg kg-1 Cd. It mainly downregulated unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid, linoleic acid) in resistance to 25, 50, and 100 mg kg-1 Cd and upregulated saturated fatty acids (especially stearic acid) in resistance to 100 mg kg-1 Cd. Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, isoquinoline alkaloid, betalain, aminoacyl-tRNA, and tyrosine metabolism were the significantly enriched metabolic pathways and the most important pathways involved in the Cd resistance of S. miltiorrhiza. These data elucidated the crucial metabolic mechanisms involved in S. miltiorrhiza Cd resistance and the crucial metabolites that could be used to improve resistance to Cd stress in medicinal plant breeding.","misc","christiaan"

The purpose of this research was to examine the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in HCC. We investigated the HCC TIME by integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk-tissue sequencing data to reveal the landscape of major immune cell types. Regulatory T(Treg) cells were found to be specifically distributed in the TIME of HCC. Several immune checkpoints, including TNFRSF4, TIGIT and CTLA4, were found to be uniquely overexpressed in Treg cells, and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway was enriched in Treg cells. We also discovered the presence of two NK-cell subsets with different cytotoxic capacities, one in an activated state with antitumor effects and another with an exhausted status. In addition, memory B cells in HCC were found to exist in a unique state, with high proliferation, low differentiation, and low activity, which was induced by overexpression of PRAP1 and activation of the MIF-CD74 axis. We revealed the TIME landscape in HCC, highlighting the heterogeneity of major immune cell types and their potential mechanisms in the formation of an immunosuppressive environment. Hence, blocking the formation of the TIME could be a useful therapeutic strategy for HCC.","misc","christiaan"

The routine blood test (RBT) results of 617 healthy men aged 18-45 years old of the Li, Tibet, and Han nationalities living in the city of Sanya, Hainan Province (200 m), the city of Xining, Qinghai Province (2,300 m), and Maduo County of Qinghai Province (4,300 m) for a long time were studied. Eight indexes, such as the red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and platelet (PLT) counts, were compared and analyzed. With an increase in altitude, the RBT index values and change trends of the different ethnic groups were different. When the altitude increased by 2,000 m, the RBC and Hb increased by 6.6 and 8.1%, respectively, and the PLT decreased by 16.8%. However, the RBC, Hb, and PLT of the Tibetan subjects decreased by 7.4, 5.1, and 3.0%, respectively. In the same region, there were also significant differences in the RBT index values among the ethnic groups. The RBC increased, Hb decreased, and PLT did not change in the Li nationality in Sanya compared with the Han nationality. The RBC, Hb, and PLT of Tibetans in the Xining area were significantly higher than those of the Han population. Referring to the current RBT reference value range in China, the abnormal rates of the various RBT index values of the enrolled population were high. By utilizing Hb as an example, 27.7% of the Li nationality in Sanya was low, 67.0% of the Tibetan nationality in Xining was high, and 89.4% of the Maduo Han nationality was high. The PLT was lower in the Sanya Li nationality (13.8%) and the Maduo Han nationality (88.3%).

"222",35968026,"Veterinary Guidelines for Electrochemotherapy of Superficial Tumors.","Electrochemotherapy (ECT) consists in the application of electric pulses to increase chemotherapeutic drug intake (bleomycin, cisplatin, or calcium) into the tumor cells. It has become a very valuable treatment option in veterinary oncology. It is an effective and safe treatment modality, which is not only beneficial as a palliative treatment, but also for a curative approach. Performing the treatment adequately will ensure the best results possible, in the minimum number of sessions, and reduce complications. Usually, only one session is enough to achieve excellent results, but the treatment can be repeated. Several sessions can be necessary in the case of incompletely treated or very extended lesions, as well as in the occurrence of new lesions. ECT is effective for superficial or oral tumors of any histology that are accessible to the electrodes. Intravenous bleomycin is the preferred drug and route of administration, leaving other ways of administration and drugs for selected cases. The guidelines presented here are destined to veterinarians who want to develop their understanding of the basis of ECT and wish to perform it adequately and effectively. In this paper, we also discuss common problems and how to solve them, and we include practical tips to improve the treatment results based on common questions and mistakes of beginner users.","misc","christiaan"

However, the results are contradictory and the effect of multitarget anodal stimulation over both brain regions has never been investigated. The present study aimed to investigate the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of different forms of anodal high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) on improving response inhibition, including HD-tDCS over the rIFG or pre-SMA and multitarget HD-tDCS over both areas. Ninety-two healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive single-session (20 min) anodal HD-tDCS over rIFG + pre-SMA, rIFG, pre-SMA, or sham stimulation. Before and immediately after tDCS intervention, participants completed a stop-signal task (SST) and a go/nogo task (GNG). Their cortical activity was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the go/nogo task. The results showed multitarget stimulation produced a significant reduction in stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) relative to baseline. The pre-to-post SSRT change was not significant for rIFG, pre-SMA, or sham stimulation. Further analyses revealed multitarget HD-tDCS significantly decreased SSRT in both the high-performance and low-performance subgroups compared with the rIFG condition which decreased SSRT only in the low-performance subgroup. Only the multitarget condition significantly improved neural efficiency as indexed by lower △oxy-Hb after stimulation. In conclusion, the present study provides important preliminary evidence that multitarget HD-tDCS is a promising avenue to improve stimulation efficacy, establishing a more effective montage to enhance response inhibition relative to the commonly used single-target stimulation.","misc","christiaan"

In the current study, we characterized the landscape of genomic alterations in CRC patients. Based on the results of whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified 31 significantly mutated genes. Among them, several genes including TP53, KRAS, APC, PI3KCA, and BRAF were reported as significantly mutated genes in previous studies. In the current study, the most frequently mutated gene was TP53, which encodes tumor suppressor p53, affecting approximately 60% of CRC patients. In addition, we performed the expression profiles of significantly mutated genes between the normal group and tumor groups and identified 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs); among them, CSMD3, DCHS2, LRP2, RYR2, and ZFHX4 were significantly negatively correlated with PFS. Moreover, consensus clustering analysis for CRC based on the expression of significantly somatic mutated genes was performed. In total, three subtypes of CRC were identified in CRC, including cluster1 (n = 453), cluster2 (n = 158), and cluster 3 (n = 9), based on expression level of significantly somatic mutated genes. Clinicopathological features analysis showed subtype C1 had the longest progression-free survival (PFS) with median time of 8.2 years, while subtypes C2 and C3 had 4.1 and 2.7 years of PFS, respectively. Moreover, we found three subtypes related to tumor infiltration depth, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. Immune infiltration analysis showed the tumor infiltration levels of B cell native, T cell CD8+, T cell CD4+ memory activated, T cell gamma delta, NK cell resting, macrophage M0, macrophage M2, myeloid dendritic cell activated, mast cell activated, and mast cell resting significantly changed among the three groups, demonstrating the three subgroups classified by 22 somatically significantly mutated genes had a high capacity to differentiate patients with different immune statuses, which is helpful for the prediction of immunotherapy response of CRC patients. Our findings could provide novel potential predictive indicators for CRC prognosis and therapy targets for CRC immunotherapy.","misc","christiaan"

In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence technologies such as sentiment analysis and incentive theory, emotional management and incentive theory have been applied to the management of college students. The emotional management and incentive model is a way to help college students get rid of psychological obstacles and guide students to establish positive and correct values by predict and analyze the psychological state of college students through language emotion recognition and BP neural network. This paper compares the college student management work model based on emotional management and incentives with the traditional college management work mode through experiments. The results show that the students' learning enthusiasm is better than the traditional college student management work mode based on emotional management and incentives. The student management work model in colleges and universities is 15.8% better, and the students' grades have improved by 12.5%; the college student management work model based on emotional management and incentives also has a positive role in helping students' mental health. The way of emotional management and motivation can make better use of college students' psychology to effectively manage students and guide students to develop in a good direction.","misc","christiaan"

As systemic therapies, including molecular targeted agents, have a strong impact on sarcopenia, we aimed to review the impact of sarcopenia in patients receiving systemic therapies, especially sorafenib and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). Several studies have demonstrated that sarcopenia is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients receiving sorafenib or lenvatinib, while HAIC has no association with overall survival (OS) and sarcopenia. Furthermore, based on our previous study, we developed the management of sorafenib score (MS score) to stratify patients' survival according to the positivity of three parameters (skeletal MM, disease control of sorafenib, and post-sorafenib therapy), ranging from 0 to 3. Patients with an MS score ≥2 (median survival time [MST], 16.4 months) showed significantly longer survival than those with an MS score ≤1 (MST, 8.4 months) (p < 0.001). This result indicates that patients need at least two positive parameters to prolong OS. Although performance status (PS) has been used in the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system, we consider that the assessment of sarcopenia has the potential to replace PS. Sarcopenia is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients of HCC receiving sorafenib or lenvatinib. The MS score, based on the positivity of three prognostic factors, including skeletal MM, in patients receiving sorafenib, can be a reliable indicator of prolonged survival.","misc","christiaan"

The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), VEGF-D, and circulating soluble VEGF receptor-2 (sVEGFR-2) as possible markers of resistance or response to ramucirumab administered with paclitaxel in pretreated metastatic GC patients. Plasma samples were collected at different time points (on days 1 and 15 of the first 3 cycles, at best radiologic response and at disease progression). VEGF-A, VEGF-D and sVEGFR-2 were analysed by ELISA. Correlations of biomarker baseline levels or dynamic changes with outcome measures were assessed. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint of the study. Forty-one patients were enrolled. VEGF-A and VEGF-D, but not sVEGFR-2, values significantly increased during treatment compared to baseline (P < 0.001). A positive correlation between VEGF-A and sVEGFR-2 at cycle 2 was found (P=0.045). At univariate analysis, higher baseline levels of VEGF-A were associated with worse OS (P=0.015). Early increase of sVEGFR-2 levels after the first treatment cycle was the only factor associated with longer PFS (6.6 vs. 3.6 months, P=0.049) and OS (18.6 vs. 5.2 months, P=0.008). Significance of sVEGFR-2 early increase was retained at multivariate analysis for OS (HR 0.32; 95% CI 0.12-0.91; P=0.032). The reported results confirmed the prognostic role of baseline VEGF-A and, with the limitations of the limited sample size and the lack of a control arm, suggested that the early increase of sVEGFR-2 after 1 cycle of treatment could be a potential predictive biomarker of benefit from second-line ramucirumab plus paclitaxel in GC.","misc","christiaan"

These guidelines consist of 1 treatment algorithm, 5 background statements, 16 clinical questions, and 1 clinical topic, including etiology, staging, pathology, diagnosis, and treatments. Globally, a high incidence of ICC has been reported in East and Southeast Asian countries, and the incidence has been gradually increasing in Japan and also in Western countries. Reported risk factors for ICC include cirrhosis, hepatitis B/C, alcohol consumption, diabetes, obesity, smoking, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and liver fluke infestation, as well as biliary diseases, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatolithiasis, congenital cholangiectasis, and Caroli disease. Chemical risk factors include thorium-232, 1,2-dichloropropane, and dichloromethane. CA19-9 and CEA are recommended as tumor markers for early detection and diagnostic of ICC. Abdominal ultrasonography, CT, and MRI are effective imaging modalities for diagnosing ICC. If bile duct invasion is suspected, imaging modalities for examining the bile ducts may be useful. In unresectable cases, tumor biopsy should be considered when deemed necessary for the differential diagnosis and drug therapy selection. The mainstay of treatment for patients with Child-Pugh class A or B liver function is surgical resection and drug therapy. If the patient has no regional lymph node metastasis (LNM) and has a single tumor, resection is the treatment of choice. If both regional LNM and multiple tumors are present, drug therapy is the first treatment of choice. If the patient has either regional LNM or multiple tumors, resection or drug therapy is selected, depending on the extent of metastasis or the number of tumors. If distant metastasis is present, drug therapy is the treatment of choice. Percutaneous ablation therapy may be considered for patients who are ineligible for surgical resection or drug therapy due to decreased hepatic functional reserve or comorbidities. For unresectable ICC without extrahepatic metastasis, stereotactic radiotherapy (tumor size ≤5 cm) or particle radiotherapy (no size restriction) may be considered. ICC is generally not indicated for liver transplantation, and palliative care is recommended for patients with Child-Pugh class C liver function.","misc","christiaan"

The swimming is due to a propulsion force, and the fluctuations are typically thermal in origin. We present a two-dimensional model where the fluctuations arise from nonthermal noise in a propelling force acting at a single point, such as that due to a flagellum. We take the overdamped limit and find several modifications to the traditional ABP model. Since the fluctuating force causes a fluctuating torque, the diffusion tensor describing the process has a coupling between translational and rotational degrees of freedom. An anisotropic particle also exhibits a mass-dependent noise-induced drift, which does not disappear in the overdamped limit. We show that these effects have measurable consequences for the long-time diffusivity of active particles, in particular adding a contribution that is independent of where the force acts.","misc","christiaan"

In the stable configuration, the perturbation damping effect due to angular momentum conservation becomes destroyed for sufficiently high values of the elastic modulus or of the viscosity of the media. For the unstable configuration, Rayleigh-Taylor instability can be suppressed by the elasticity or mitigated by the viscosity, but without practically affecting the perturbation growth due to the geometrical convergence. However, the convergence effects manifest themselves in a manner somewhat different from the classical Bell-Plesset effect by making the process more sensitive to the media compressibility than in the case involving ideal media.","misc","christiaan"

Antipsychotic (AP) treatment, including long-acting injectable (LAI) AP in subjects with poor compliance, is prescribed to manage behavioural and psychotic symptomatology. We describe a 70-year-old woman who was hospitalised after experiencing new-onset delusions of infestation with visual and tactile hallucinations that led to bizarre behaviours and progressive social withdrawal. She was diagnosed with ES and was initially treated with risperidone 3 mg; however, due to poor compliance and a lack of insight, she was switched to LAI palmitate paliperidone (LAI-PP). She was followed up for 8 months, administering Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Global Assessment of Functioning, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, neurocognitive assessment, and neuroimaging. After a progressive cognitive deterioration, she was diagnosed with an ES secondary to Lewy body dementia (DLB). The LAI-PP treatment determined a complete clinical remission of psychotic symptoms despite the emergence of an iatrogenic akinetic-rigid syndrome. The delay of confirmatory neurological diagnosis, the associated risky behaviours of the patient, and poor treatment adherence led clinicians to prescribe LAI-PP following a good clinical response to oral paliperidone. However, in the case of a suspected DLB diagnosis, the prescription of an LAI-PP as a first-line strategy should be carefully evaluated.","misc","christiaan"

A correlational study was carried out using online tools with suitable psychometrics parameters (content-construct validity and reliability). The first one was a scale that measured social abilities, and the second one evaluated racist or xenophobic cyberbullying, differentiating the victim and aggressor profiles. The results indicated five main findings: (1) generally, the participants analyzed present all their social abilities; (2) for the most part, these participants do not normally experience cyberbullying; (3) a positive correlation exists between the majority of social abilities analyzed and the cybervictim profile. It was also observed a negative correlation between the social ability associated with the ability of making requests and this profile; (4) there is a positive correlation among the six social abilities analyzed and the cyberaggressor profile; (5) the racist or xenophobic cyberbullying are driven not only by the absence of social abilities, but in some cases, they are also driven by socio-demographic variables (i.e., age and gender). Likewise, this work shows how the absence of some social abilities in some participants involve racist or xenophobic experiences as victims and as aggressors, which may be of interest for the analysis of teenagers' behavior in intercultural contexts, as well as according to age and gender. More transcultural research need to be carried out to know the global perspective of the link between social abilities and the different profiles of racist and xenophobic cyberbullying, framed in the context of social psychology and studies of mass communication.","misc","christiaan"

Built on the current literature, this research asks: How might teachers' self-images or self-conceptualizations be renegotiated when they are located within their own mainstream cultural and educational system, yet comprised of students from various cultural backgrounds? The data were collected from a group of CFL teachers in a South China university. The research found that students' backgrounds largely impacted on, and led to, the teachers' dichotomous relational identities, but did not dramatically change the teachers' perception on what or how much subject knowledge to be possessed to make an ideal CFL teacher. This attribute of their identity was sustained even though the teaching content was modified at a practical level in response to groups' differences. Further, the CFL teachers' pedagogical identity remained stable with only minor modifications when teaching ingroups and outgroups of students.","misc","christiaan"

Based on TCGA database, we screened for CPNE8 and analyzed the expression of CPNE8 in GC. The correlations between CPNE8 and clinical features were analyzed using TCGA and GEO databases. The prognostic value of CPNE8 was assessed using Cox analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves. The results showed that increased expression of CPNE8 was positively correlated with metastasis and can be considered an independent prognostic risk factor for poor survival. We found that CPNE8 can promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness in GC using in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our study demonstrated that CPNE8 promotes tumor progression via regulation of focal adhesion, and these effects can be rescued by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor GSK2256098 or knockdown of FAK. In addition, CPNE8 was correlated significantly with the infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells, as demonstrated by various algorithms, and high CPNE8 expression predicted poor efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy. Our findings suggest that CPNE8 modulates focal adhesion and tumor microenvironment to promote GC progression and invasiveness and could serve as a novel prognostic biomarker in GC.","misc","christiaan"

The complex relationship between these variables has not been assessed. We wanted to assess first the prevalence of depression among MI survivors and whether depression mediates the effect of PSS on QoL and, second, whether the physical and social domains of QoL mediated the effect of depression and PSS on the emotional domain. This cross-sectional study was done among MI survivors using Cardiac Depression Scale, MacNew Quality of Life After Myocardial Infarction Questionnaire and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support to assess for depression, QoL and PSS respectively. A total of 103 MI survivors were included in the study, and the mean age was 59.66 (± 10.42) years. Depression was found in 21.36% of the participants. The indirect effect of PSS on QoL with depression as a mediator was significant (b = 0.15, p < 0.001, 95% CI 0.12, 0.18). The direct effect of PSS on QoL controlling for depression was also significant (b = 0.05, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.07). Depression as a mediator in the relationship explained 75.3% of the effect of PSS on QoL. PSS and depression did not have a significant direct effect on emotional QoL, but it became significant when the physical and social domains were included in the model. The total indirect effects of PSS and depression on emotional QoL were b = 0.16, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.17 and b = - 0.05, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.06, - 0.03, respectively. Depression and poor PSS impair physical and social domains, which impairs the emotional domain of QoL; as such, overall QoL is undermined. As limited physical and social activity because of depression and poor PSS may increase the risk of further cardiovascular events, a holistic approach which includes mental health care is warranted.","misc","christiaan"

"2348",35974540,"Brownian motion theory of the two-dimensional quantum vortex gas.","A theory of Brownian motion is presented for an assembly of vortices. The attempt is motivated by a realization of Dyson's Coulomb gas in the context of quantum condensates. By starting with the time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg (LG) theory, the dynamics of the vortex gas is constructed, which is governed by the canonical equation of motion. The dynamics of point vortices is converted to the Langevin equation, which results in the generalized Fokker-Planck (GFP) (or Smolkovski) equation using the functional integral on the ansatz of the Gaussian white noise. The GFP, which possesses a non-Hermitian property, is characterized by two regimes called the overdamping and the underdamping regimes. In the overdamping regime, where the dissipation is much larger that the vortex strength, the GFP becomes the standard Fokker-Planck equation, which is transformed into the two-dimensional many-particle system. Several specific applications are given of the Fokker-Planck equation. An asymptotic limit of small diffusion is also discussed for the two-vortices system. The underdamping limit, for which the vortex charge is much larger than the dissipation, is briefly discussed.","misc","christiaan"

The particle under consideration has the main characteristic of carrying a light sensor in an eccentric location. For the chosen experimental conditions, the emerging trajectories are orbital, and, more interestingly, they suggest the existence of bistability. A mathematical model incorporating the key experimental components is introduced. By means of numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, it is found that, in addition to the orbiting behavior, the sensor location could produce trapped or diffusive behaviors. Furthermore, the study reveals that stochastic perturbation and the eccentric location of the sensor are responsible for inducing bistability in the orbital trajectories, supporting experimental observations.","misc","christiaan"

Insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms that amplify neutrophil extravasation has limited innovation in therapeutic targeting of neutrophil mediated pathology. Attention has focussed on neutrophil interactions with endothelia, but data from mouse models also point to a role for the underlying pericyte layer, as well as perivascular macrophages, the only other cell type found within the perivascular space in the cerebral microvasculature. We tested the hypothesis that human brain vascular pericytes (HBVP) contribute to neutrophil extravasation in a transwell model of the cerebral post-capillary venule. We show that pericytes augment endothelial barrier formation. In response to inflammatory cues, they significantly enhance neutrophil transmigration across the endothelial barrier, without increasing the permeability to small molecules. In our model, neither pericytes nor endothelia responded directly to bacterial stimulation. Instead, we show that paracrine signalling by multiple cytokines from monocyte derived macrophages drives transcriptional upregulation of multiple neutrophil chemokines by pericytes. Pericyte mediated amplification of neutrophil transmigration was independent of transcriptional responses by endothelia, but could be mediated by direct chemokine translocation across the endothelial barrier. Our data support a model in which microbial sensing by perivascular macrophages generates an inflammatory cascade where pericytes serve to amplify production of neutrophil chemokines that are translocated across the endothelial barrier to act directly on circulating neutrophils. In view of the striking redundancy in inflammatory cytokines that stimulate pericytes and in the neutrophil chemokines they produce, we propose that the mechanism of chemokine translocation may offer the most effective therapeutic target to reduce neutrophil mediated pathology in pyogenic meningitis.","misc","christiaan"

Combining the information encoded in functional traits and metacommunities provides a new perspective to predict the abundance of species in communities. We applied a community assembly via trait selection model to predict quadrat-scale species abundances using functional trait variation on ontogenetic stages and metacommunity information for over 490 plant species in a subtropical forest and a lowland tropical forest in Yunnan, China. The relative importance of trait-based selection, mass effects, and stochasticity in shaping local species abundances is evaluated using different null models. We found both mass effects and trait selection contribute to local abundance patterns. Trait selection was detectable at all studied spatial scales (0.04-1 ha), with its strength stronger at larger scales and in the subtropical forest. In contrast, the importance of stochasticity decreased with spatial scale. A significant mass effect of the metacommunity was observed at small spatial scales. Our results indicate that tree community assembly is primarily driven by ontogenetic traits and metacommunity effects. Our findings also demonstrate that including ontogenetic trait variation into predictive frameworks allows ecologists to infer ecological mechanisms operating in community assembly at the individual level.","misc","christiaan"

The American Cancer Society estimated about 34,500 deaths from prostate cancer in the United States in year 2022. The Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a major pathway that sustains local and metastatic prostate tumor growth. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer patient and can suppress the tumor growth for a median of 2-3 years. Unfortunately, the malignancy inevitably progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which is more aggressive and no longer responsive to ADT. Surprisingly, for most of the CPRC patients, cancer growth still depends on androgen receptor signaling. Accumulating evidence suggests that CRPC cells have rewired their transcriptional program to retain AR signaling in the absence of androgens. Besides AR, other transcription factors also contribute to the resistance mechanism through multiple pathways including enhancing AR signaling pathway and activating other complementary signaling pathways for the favor of AR downstream genes expression. More recent studies have shown the role of transcription factors in reconfiguring chromatin 3D structure and regulating topologically associating domains (TADs). Pioneer factors, transcription factors and coactivators form liquid-liquid phase separation compartment that can modulate transcriptional events along with configuring TADs. The role of AR and other transcription factors on chromatin structure change and formation of condensate compartment in prostate cancer cells has only been recently investigated and appreciated. This review intends to provide an overview of transcription factors that contribute to AR signaling through activation of gene expression, governing 3D chromatin structure and establishing phase to phase separation. A more detailed understanding of the spatial role of transcription factors in CRPC might provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of CRPC.","misc","christiaan"

These patients are treated with selective ER down regulators (SERDs) such as the ERα antagonist fulvestrant. Previous studies show that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors downregulate ERα and since some dietary derived short chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate and acetate) exhibit HDAC inhibitory activity we investigated their effects as SERDs in MCF-7 and T47D cells expressing wild-type and mutant ERα-D538G and ERα-Y537S. The SCFAs exhibited SERD-like activity in both cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant ERα. The results for propionate and butyrate correlated with parallel induction of histone acetylation and this was also observed for the HDAC inhibitors Panobinostat, Vorinostat and Entinostat which also downregulated wild-type and mutant ERα and induced histone acetylation. Although acetate induced ERα degradation the mechanisms may be independent of the HDAC inhibitory activity of this compound. These results suggest that high fibre diets that induce formation of SCFAs may have some clinical efficacy for treating ER-positive endocrine resistant breast cancer patients and this is currently being investigated.","misc","christiaan"

The Richmond Stress and Sugar Study includes a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort of adults at risk for type 2 diabetes (n = 125; mean age 57 years, 48% black, and 61% high neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES)). Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity was assessed by salivary cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a laboratory stressor. Higher perceived stress was associated with a lower cortisol response to the TSST [-7.5%; 95% CI: -13.1%, -1.5%], but was not associated with cortisol recovery after the TSST [3%; 95% CI: -0.6%, 6.8%]. In contrast, domain-specific stress was not associated with cortisol response [-2.1%; 95%CI: -20.7%, 20.9%], but was inversely associated with cortisol recovery [3.7%; 95%CI: 0.6%, 7.0%]. SES modified these associations: both perceived stress and domain-specific stress were associated with TSST cortisol response only among participants from high SES neighborhoods. There was minimal evidence of effect-modification by race. Both self-report measures of psychosocial stress were associated with HPA-axis reactivity to an acute stressor. These associations varied by perceived vs. domain-specific measurement scales and by neighborhood SES.

In this longitudinal study, we followed outpatients with cardiometabolic diseases for a maximum of 6 years (median, 3 years) and evaluated the association of baseline DTI data of seven white matter tracts with the incidence of frailty. The modified version of the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria and the Kihon Checklist were used as indices of frailty; fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were used as indices of white matter changes. Patients who developed frailty based on both indices had low FA and high MD in many of the tracts tested, with the most significant difference found in the MD of the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR). Cox proportional hazard model analysis revealed a significantly high risk of frailty defined by both indices in the groups with high MD values in the left ATR. Similar results were found in patients with diabetes mellitus but not in those without diabetes mellitus.

In this experiment, seedlings of 97 olive germplasm with 1.0-3.0 cm roots and two leaves were treated with 50 μM Al3+ (pH = 5.0). By factor analysis of the traits of defoliation rate, rooting rate, length of extended root, and length of new root, 97 germplasm were classified into five different groups according to their diverse responses to aluminum stress: 5 highly resistant (5.15%), 30 moderately resistant (30.93%), 31 general (31.96%), 23 moderately sensitive (23.71%), and 8 highly sensitive (8.25%) germplasm. The three most sensitive and three most resistant germplasm were further used for metabolome and transcriptome analysis. Exposed to aluminum stress, 96 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs)/4,845 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 66 DAMs/2,752 DEGs were identified in highly sensitive and resistant germplasm, respectively. Using multi-omics technology, the pathways and related DAMs/DEGs involved in cell wall/cytoplasm receptors, reactive oxygen species balance, hormone induction, synthesis of organic acids, Al3+ transport, and synthesis of metabolites were identified to mainly regulate the response to aluminum stress in olive.

"2210",35977788,"Stochasticity Leads to Coexistence of Generalists and Specialists in Assembling Mutualistic Communities.","AbstractSpecies interaction networks are subject to natural and anthropogenic disturbances that lead to their disassembly, while natural regeneration or restoration efforts facilitate their reassembly. Previous models for assembling ecological networks did not include stochasticity at the level of population dynamics (e.g., demographic noise, environmental noise) and focused mainly on food webs. Here, we present a model for the assembly of mutualistic bipartite networks, such as plant-pollinator networks, and examine the influence of demographic noise on the trajectory of species and strategy diversity, that is, the range of present strategies from specialism to generalism. We find that assembled communities show at intermediate assembly stages a maximum of species diversity and of average generalization. Our model thus provides a mechanism for nonlinear, hump-shaped diversity trajectories at intermediate succession, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Long-term coexistence of specialists and generalists emerges only in the presence of demographic noise and is due to a persistent species turnover. These findings highlight the importance of stochasticity for maintaining long-term diversity.","misc","christiaan"

The questionnaires were employed by the researchers to gather the data from chosen respondents. The preservice English students are the respondents of the study. These are selected using purposive sampling. These questionnaires were forwarded to them by personal visits. The researchers have sent 690 surveys but only received 360 surveys and used them for analysis. These surveys represented a 52.17% response rate. The SPSS-AMOS was applied to test the relationships among variables and also test the hypotheses of the study. The results revealed that self-efficacy and resistance to innovation have a significant and a positive linkage with demotivation and insufficient learning capabilities. The findings also indicated that demotivation significantly mediates self-efficacy, resistance to innovation, and insufficient learning capabilities. The article helps the policymakers to establish the regulations related to the improvement of learning capabilities using innovation adoption and motivation of the students.","misc","christiaan"

Herein, we applied for the first-time protein-templated dynamic combinatorial chemistry on RAD51 as a hit identification strategy. Upon design of N-acylhydrazone-based dynamic combinatorial libraries, RAD51 showed a clear templating effect, amplifying 19 N-acylhydrazones. Screening against the RAD51-BRCA2 protein-protein interaction via ELISA assay afforded 10 inhibitors in the micromolar range. Further 19F NMR experiments revealed that 7 could bind RAD51 and be displaced by BRC4, suggesting an interaction in the same binding pocket of BRCA2. These results proved not only that ptDCC could be successfully applied on full-length oligomeric RAD51, but also that it could address the need of alternative strategies toward the identification of small-molecule PPI inhibitors.","misc","christiaan"

This study investigated patterns of structural disconnections associated with chronic language impairments using disconnectome maps. Seventy-six individuals with post-stroke aphasia underwent a battery of language assessments and a structural MRI scan. Support-vector regression disconnectome-symptom mapping analyses were performed to examine the correlations between disconnectome maps, representing the probability of disconnection at each white matter voxel and different language scores. To further understand whether significant disconnections were primarily representing focal damage or a more extended network of seemingly preserved but disconnected areas beyond the lesion site, results were qualitatively compared to support-vector regression lesion-symptom mapping analyses. Part of the left white matter perisylvian network was similarly disconnected in 90% of the individuals with aphasia. Surrounding this common left perisylvian disconnectome, specific structural disconnections in the left fronto-temporo-parietal network were significantly associated with aphasia severity and with lower performance in auditory comprehension, syntactic comprehension, syntactic production, repetition and naming tasks. Auditory comprehension, repetition and syntactic processing deficits were related to disconnections in areas that overlapped with and extended beyond lesion sites significant in SVR-LSM analyses. In contrast, overall language abilities as measured by aphasia severity and naming seemed to be mostly explained by focal damage at the level of the insular and central opercular cortices, given the high overlap between SVR-DSM and SVR-LSM results for these scores. While focal damage seems to be sufficient to explain broad measures of language performance, the structural disconnections between language areas provide additional information on the neural basis of specific and persistent language impairments at the chronic stage beyond lesion volume. Leveraging routinely available clinical data, disconnectome mapping furthers our understanding of anatomical connectivity constraints that may limit the recovery of some language abilities in chronic post-stroke aphasia.","misc","christiaan"

Genetic polymorphisms of several lncRNAs affecting HBV replication or oncogenesis have also been studied. The prognosis of HCC remains poor. It is important to identify novel tumor markers for early diagnosis and find more therapeutic targets for effective treatments of HCC. Some dysregulated lncRNAs in HBV-related HCC may become biomarkers for early diagnosis and/or the therapeutic targets of HCC.

We aimed to analyse the characteristics of patients hospitalised because of ECOPD in a real-life setting using a big data approach. The study population included all patients over 40 years old with a diagnosis of COPD (n=69 359; prevalence 3.72%) registered from 1 January 2011 to 1 March 2020 in the database of the public healthcare service (SESCAM) of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) (n=1 863 759 subjects). We used natural language processing (Savana Manager version 3.0) to identify those who were hospitalised during this period for any cause, including ECOPD. During the study 26 453 COPD patients (38.1%) were hospitalised (at least once). Main diagnoses at discharge were respiratory infection (51%), heart failure (38%) or pneumonia (19%). ECOPD was the main diagnosis at discharge (or hospital death) in 8331 patients (12.0% of the entire COPD population and 31.5% of those hospitalised). In-hospital ECOPD-related mortality rate was 3.11%. These patients were hospitalised 2.36 times per patient, with a mean hospital stay of 6.1 days. Heart failure was the most frequent comorbidity in patients hospitalised because of ECOPD (52.6%). This analysis shows that, in a real-life setting, ECOPD hospitalisations are prevalent, complex (particularly in relation to heart failure), repetitive and associated with significant in-hospital mortality.","misc","christiaan"

The constitutionally isomeric O-acyl benzisothiazol-3-ols, in contrast, show little or no antimycobacterial activity in vitro. The structures of the four compounds were investigated by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy.

Fifty consecutive hospitalized PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who underwent chest CT scan and LUS on the first day of admission were enrolled. The LUS score was calculated based on the presence, severity, and distribution of parenchymal abnormalities in 14 regions. The participants' mean age was 54.60 ± 19.93 years, and 26 (52%) were female. All patients had CT and LUS findings typical of COVID-19. The mean value of CT and LUS severity scores were 11.80 ± 3.89 (ranging from 2 to 20) and 13.74 ± 6.43 (ranging from 1 to 29), respectively. The LUS score was significantly higher in females (p = 0.016), and patients with dyspnoea (p = 0.048), HTN (p = 0.034), immunodeficiency (p = 0.034), room air SpO2 ≤ 93 (p = 0.02), and pleural effusion (p = 0.036). LUS findings were strongly correlated with CT scan results regarding lesion type, distribution, and severity in a region-by-region fashion (92-100% agreement). An LUS score of 14 or higher was predictive of room air SpO2 ≤ 93 and ICU admission, while an LUS score ≥ 12 was predictive of death (p = 0.011, 0.023, and 0.003, respectively). Our results suggested that LUS can be used as a valuable tool for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia and determining high-risk hospitalized patients, helping to triage and stratify high-risk patients, which waives the need to undertake irradiating chest CT and reduces the burden of overworked CT department staff.","misc","christiaan"

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are the most promising eco-friendly beneficial microorganisms that can be used to improve plant responses against biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, a previously identified B. thuringiensis PM25 showed tolerance to salinity stress up to 3 M NaCl. The Halo-tolerant Bacillus thuringiensis PM25 demonstrated distinct salinity tolerance and enhance plant growth-promoting activities under salinity stress. Antibiotic-resistant Iturin C (ItuC) and bio-surfactant-producing (sfp and srfAA) genes that confer biotic and abiotic stresses were also amplified in B. thuringiensis PM25. Under salinity stress, the physiological and molecular processes were followed by the over-expression of stress-related genes (APX and SOD) in B. thuringiensis PM25. The results detected that B. thuringiensis PM25 inoculation substantially improved phenotypic traits, chlorophyll content, radical scavenging capability, and relative water content under salinity stress. Under salinity stress, the inoculation of B. thuringiensis PM25 significantly increased antioxidant enzyme levels in inoculated maize as compared to uninoculated plants. In addition, B. thuringiensis PM25-inoculation dramatically increased soluble sugars, proteins, total phenols, and flavonoids in maize as compared to uninoculated plants. The inoculation of B. thuringiensis PM25 significantly reduced oxidative burst in inoculated maize under salinity stress, compared to uninoculated plants. Furthermore, B. thuringiensis PM25-inoculated plants had higher levels of compatible solutes than uninoculated controls. The current results demonstrated that B. thuringiensis PM25 plays an important role in reducing salinity stress by influencing antioxidant defense systems and abiotic stress-related genes. These findings also suggest that multi-stress tolerant B. thuringiensis PM25 could enhance plant growth by mitigating salt stress, which might be used as an innovative tool for enhancing plant yield and productivity.","misc","christiaan"

Ureteral entrapment with consequent obstructive uropathy is one of the most common complications which can lead to acute renal failure and, in the long term, to varying degrees of chronic kidney disease. Common symptoms at onset include lower back, abdominal or flank pain. Pain is frequently referred to the hip, to the groin and to the lateral regions of the leg, often with nocturnal exacerbations and not responding to position changes. The disease is commonly associated with signs of systemic inflammatory response (malaise, fever, and anorexia and weight loss). Glucocorticoids are considered the cornerstone of the therapy. The use of other immunosuppressive agents, including cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and biological agents such as rituximab, tocilizumab and infliximab have been reported as a valuable option mostly in case reports, cases series and small studies. These agents allowed to reduce cumulative dose of glucocorticoids and their adverse effects. Combined therapy is preferable for all patients who suffer from significant glucocorticoid- related toxicity or in cases where glucocorticoids alone are insufficient to treat the condition.","misc","christiaan"

Publicly available epidemiological data ranging from 3 February 2021 to 30 September 2021 were used to construct GAMLSS models that explain the beneficial effect of up to two doses of vaccination on the following COVID-19-related outcomes: new cases per day, daily active cases, daily occupied ICU beds and daily deaths. Administered first and second vaccine doses, and the statistical interaction between the two, are strong, statistically significant predictors for COVID-19-related new cases per day (R2 = 0.847), daily active cases (R2 = 0.903), ICU hospitalizations (R2 = 0.767), and deaths (R2 = 0.827). Our models stress the importance of completing vaccination schedules to reduce the adverse outcomes during the pandemic. Future work will continue to assess the influence of vaccines, including booster doses, as the pandemic progresses, and new variants emerge. This work highlights the importance of attaining full (two-dose) vaccination status and reinforces the notion that a second dose provides increased non-additive protection. The trends we observed may also support the inclusion of booster doses in vaccination plans.

We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who underwent keratoplasty at the center from January 2006 to March 2021. The keratoplasty indications and types of surgery were evaluated after classification into three groups (period I - January 2006-December 2012; period II - January 2013-March 2020; COVID-19 period - April 2020-March 2021). A total of 5016 corneal transplants were performed in 3862 patients. Lamellar keratoplasty (LK) techniques were found to demonstrate a statistically significantly increasing trend compared to penetrating keratoplasty in the period between 2006 and 2021 (χ2 = 240.55, P < 0.001). The top 4 indications over the 15-year period were aphakic/pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (BK) (1105, 22%), keratoconus (1085, 21.6%), regraft (1084, 21.6%), and keratitis (645, 12.8%).

Here, we expressed monomeric and dimeric receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the spike protein of prototype SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron variant in E. coli and investigated the reactivity of anti-sera from Chinese subjects immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to these recombinant RBDs. In 106 human blood samples collected from 91 participants from Jiangxi, China, 26 sera were identified to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies by lateral flow dipstick (LFD) assays, which were enriched in the ones collected from day 7 to 1 month post-boost (87.0%) compared to those harvested within 1 week post-boost (23.8%) (P < 0.0001). A higher positive ratio was observed in the child group (40.8%) than adults (13.6%) (P = 0.0073). ELISA results showed that the binding activity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive sera to Omicron RBDs dropped by 1.48- to 2.07-fold compared to its homogeneous recombinant RBDs. Thus, our data indicate that current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines provide restricted humoral protection against the Omicron variant.","misc","christiaan"

The present study comparatively evaluated the impact performance of hardhat helmets, climbing-style safety helmets, and helmets with novel rotation-damping technologies to determine if advanced designs deliver improved protection. Six helmet designs from three categories of safety helmets were tested: two traditional hardhat helmets (HH Type I, HH Type II), two climbing-style helmets (CS Web, CS Foam), and two helmets with dedicated rotation-damping technologies (MIPS, CEL). Helmets were first evaluated in impacts of 31 J energy representing a falling object according to standard Z89.1-2014. Subsequently, helmets were evaluated in impacts representing a fall by dropping a helmeted head-neck surrogate at 275 J impact energy. The resulting head kinematics were used to calculate the probability of sustaining a head or brain injury. Crown impacts representative of a falling object resulted in linear acceleration of less than 50 g in all six helmet models. Compared to crown impacts, front, side and rear impacts caused a several-fold increase in head acceleration in all helmets except HH Type II and CEL helmets. For impacts representative of falls, all helmets except the CEL helmet exhibited significantly increased head accelerations and an increased brain injury probability compared to the traditional HH Type I hardhat. Neck compression was 35%-90% higher in the two climbing-style helmets and 80% higher in MIPS helmets compared to the traditional HH type I hardhat. Contemporary helmets do not necessarily deliver improved protection from impacts and falls compared to traditional hardhat helmets.","misc","christiaan"

SEH has rarely been caused by venous congestion. We report a case of SEH in a 78-year-old male who presented to our emergency department with sudden-onset back pain, followed by complete paraplegia with bladder and rectal disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a dorsally placed extradural hematoma extending from T10 to L1. An urgent laminectomy from T11 to L2 was performed. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) performed 1 week after the operation showed compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery with dilation of the surrounding veins, including the spinal epidural venous plexus, at the same level as the hematoma. This was diagnosed as Nutcracker syndrome (NCS), which was consistent as a cause of SEH. The patient's symptoms gradually improved, and after 6 months, he regained normal strength in his lower extremities, but bladder and rectal disturbance remained and required intermittent self-catheterization.

The MUICs for pregnant women and adults of iodine supplements with IF (iodine-rich food) and ISF (IS + iodine-rich food) were lower. For pregnant women, thyroid nodule (11.90%) and peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) positive (9.32%) were high prevalent thyroid diseases, and habitation (urban/rural), gestation, annual income, and drinking water type would affect them. Pregnant women and adults had adequate iodine nutrition in four provinces. Their iodine supplement measures were different, the consumption of iodine preparations in pregnant women was higher, and their dietary iodine intake was lower than adults. ISFP was an effect measure for pregnant women to supplement iodine.","misc","christiaan"

In a cohort of community-dwelling older Black adults (N = 611), we investigated the relationship between John Henryism and cognitive decline. John Henryism was measured using the John Henryism Active Coping Scale (JHACS), a 9-item validated measure of self-reported high-effort coping (mean = 16.9, sd = 4.8, range: 4-27). We implemented a three-step modeling process using mixed effect models to assess the relationship between the JHACS and global cognitive function as well as five cognitive domains. We adjusted for demographics and for factors known to be associated with cognitive function and decline including vascular risk factors, discrimination, and income. The trait of high-effort active coping was associated with lower average cognitive function (β = -0.07, 95% CI: -0.10, -0.03), but not with decline. The results remained after further adjustment for experiences of discrimination, income, and vascular risk factors. In domain specific analyses, we found that the JHACS was associated with baseline levels of working memory, semantic memory and visuospatial ability, but not decline. These results highlight the importance of using culturally specific measures in considering the heterogeneity of cognitive health outcomes in minoritized populations. Understanding how stress responses relate to late-life cognition among older Black adults could help promote aspects of behavioral resilience along with healthful coping responses.","misc","christiaan"

Three different cyclometalating ligands and two different pyridyl-containing coumarin types were used to prepare six target complexes with tunable excited-state energies. Three of the complexes display dual emission, with fluorescence arising from the coumarin ligand, and phosphorescence from either the cyclometalated iridium center or the coumarin. These dual-emitting complexes function as ratiometric oxygen sensors, with the phosphorescence quenched under O2 while fluorescence is unaffected. The use of blue-fluorescent coumarins results in good signal resolution between fluorescence and phosphorescence. Moreover, the sensitivity and dynamic range, measured with Stern-Volmer analysis, can be tuned two orders of magnitude by virtue of our ability to synthetically control the triplet excited-state ordering. The complex with cyclometalated iridium 3MLCT phosphorescence operates under hyperoxic conditions, whereas the two complexes with coumarin-centered phosphorescence are sensitive to very low levels of O2 and function as hypoxic sensors.","misc","christiaan"

To prevent the transmission of the virus, a mandatory mask-wearing rule in public areas has been enforced. Owing to the use of face masks in communities at different workplaces, an effective surveillance seems essential because several security analyses indicate that face masks may be used as a tool to hide the identity. Therefore, this work proposes a framework for the development of a smart surveillance system as an aftereffect of COVID-19 for recognition of individuals behind the face mask. For this purpose, transfer learning approach has been employed to train the custom dataset by YOLOv3 algorithm in the Darknet neural network framework. Moreover, to demonstrate the competence of YOLOv3 algorithm, a comparative analysis with YOLOv3-tiny has been presented. The simulated results verify the robustness of YOLOv3 algorithm in the recognition of individuals behind the face mask. Also, YOLOv3 algorithm achieves a mAP of 98.73% on custom dataset, outperforming YOLOv3-tiny by approximately 62%. Moreover, YOLOv3 algorithm provides adequate speed and accuracy on small faces.","misc","christiaan"

The modified version of the Food Standard Agency Nutrient Profiling System Dietary Index (FSAm-NPS DI) underpinning the Nutri-Score front-of-pack label has been used in public health strategies to address the deleterious consequences of poor diets. This study aimed to assess the association between the FSAm-NPS DI and some CVD risk factors including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, plasma glucose levels, triglyceride levels, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline and after 1 year of follow-up using a 143-item validated semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Dietary indices based on FSAm-NPS applied at an individual level were computed to characterize the diet quality of 5,921 participants aged 55-75 years with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome from the PREDIMED-plus cohort. Associations between the FSAm-NPS DI and CVD risk factors were assessed using linear regression models. Compared to participants with a higher nutritional quality of diet (measured by a lower FSAm-NPS DI at baseline or a decrease in FSAm-NPS DI after 1 year), those participants with a lower nutritional quality of diet (higher FSAm-NPS DI or an increase in score) showed a significant increase in the levels of plasma glucose, triglycerides, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and waist circumference (β coefficient [95% confidence interval]; P for trend) (1.67 [0.43, 2.90]; <0.001; 6.27 [2.46, 10.09]; <0.001; 0.56 [0.08, 1.05]; 0.001; 0.51 [0.41, 0.60]; <0.001; 1.19 [0.89, 1.50]; <0.001, respectively). No significant associations in relation to changes in HDL and LDL-cholesterol nor with systolic blood pressure were shown. This prospective cohort study suggests that the consumption of food items with a higher FSAm-NPS DI is associated with increased levels of several major risk factors for CVD including adiposity, fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, and diastolic blood pressure. However, results must be cautiously interpreted because no significant prospective associations were identified for critical CVD risk factors, such as HDL and LDL-cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure.","misc","christiaan"
"2498",35968346,"Research progress in breast cancer stem cells: characterization and future perspectives.","More and more studies have proved that there are a small number of cells with self-renewal and differentiation ability in breast tumors, namely breast cancer stem cells. Such cells play a key role in the initiation, development and migration of breast tumors. The properties of breast tumor stem cells are regulated by a range of intracellular and extracellular factors, including important signaling pathways, transcription factors, non-coding RNAs, and cytokines such as Hedgehog, Wnt, Notch, microRNA93, microRNA100, and IL-6. Tumor microenvironment (such as mesenchymal stem cells, macrophages and cytokines) plays an important role in the regulation of breast tumor stem cells. Using the keywords including breast cancer stem cells, signal pathway, chemotherapy tolerance, and non-coding RNA, triple negative breast cancer, inhibitors, this study retrieved the original articles and reviews published before October 3, 2021, from PubMed and WEB OF SCI database and this study performed a comprehensive review of them. After treatment, there is a correlation between the metastasis-prone nature and recurrence with breast cancer stem cells. The signaling pathway of breast cancer stem cells plays a significant role in activating the function of breast cancer cells, regulating the differentiation of breast cancer cells and controlling the division of breast cancer cells. This imbalance leads to the uncontrolled growth and development of breast cancer cells. Targeted therapy that blocks the corresponding pathway may become a new perspective for breast cancer treatment. In addition, corresponding therapeutic strategies can be used according to the expression characteristics of different molecular types of breast cancer stem cells. For ER-positive breast cancer, simultaneous endocrine therapy and targeted therapy of tumor stem cells may improve the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Trastuzumab therapy significantly reduces the risk of recurrence of HER2-positive breast cancer. For drug-resistant patients, combination therapy is required due to the different phenotypes of epithelial-mesenchymal transforming tumor stem cells. This study briefly reviews the research progress of breast cancer stem cell-related signaling pathways and their inhibitors, in order to provide a reference for breast cancer patients to obtain more effective clinical treatment.","misc","christiaan"

The inner cavity of the capsule can host the trityl carbocation, which catalyses the Diels-Alder reaction between dienes and unsaturated aldehydes. Experimental results and in silico calculations show that the hexameric resorcinarene capsule C6 can promote the formation of the trityl carbocation from trityl chloride through the cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond promoted by OH⋯X- hydrogen bonding. Here it is shown that the combination of the nanoconfined space and the latent carbocation catalysis provides a convenient complementary strategy for the typical carbocation catalysis. The latent strategy bypasses the typical pitfalls associated with active carbocations and provides control of the reaction efficiency in terms of reaction rate, conversion, and selectivity.","misc","christiaan"

To evaluate the de novo cytokines gene expression in the transition of atopic dermatitis symptoms to psoriasiform erythema during dupilumab treatment in children. Two 17-year-old teenage twin patients with AD were included in this study who developed psoriasiform erythema after initiation of dupilumab. The lesional skin biopsy specimens were obtained for the histopathological investigation and RNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (RNA-FISH). Dermoscopy, cytometry (cytokine detection in the blood), and blood investigations were completed for the pedigree and the lesioned descriptions. Two twin patients with AD presented with erythematic scaly plaques on the back, scalp, abdomen, and extensor extremities after 20 weeks of dupilumab treatment. The transitional change of AD to psoriasiform erythema treated with dupilumab was observed. Our subjects' dermoscopy showed pinpoint bleeding and white scales on pink background. Histopathology features showed psoriasiform hyperplasia, epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis), ectatic capillaries, perivascular lymphocytes infiltration, and parakeratosis, with the absence of the granular cell layer. mRNA (RNA-FISH) cytokines gene expression showed a significantly high concentration of IL-17A. Blood investigation results showed a high concentration of (Immunoglobulin E) IgE and Eosinophils, and cytokines detection in blood showed IL-5,6 and IL-17 in one patient; however, only IL-5 in another patient. The dupilumab was discontinued and initiated with Baricitinib. Baricitinib showed a significant reduction in skin lesions. Psoriasiform erythema can appear during dupilumab treatment in atopic dermatitis children. Potently, by suppressing skewed Th2 activation in patients with AD, the balance might shift toward Th1/Th17 predominance, and psoriasis develops. Baricitinib is a potential drug for psoriasiform erythema with significant therapeutic effects.","misc","christiaan"

However, about one-third of RA patients are negative for ACPAs, which presents a challenge to the early diagnosis of RA. The purpose of this study was to analyze differences in lymphocyte subsets and CD4+ T cell subsets between ACPA+ and ACPA- RA patients, and to evaluate the value of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) as a diagnostic and monitoring marker in ACA- RA patients. A total of 145 ACPA+ RA patients, 145 ACPA- RA patients, and 38 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. Peripheral lymphocyte subsets were detected using flow cytometry, and serum MMP-3 was detected using chemiluminescence. Information about joint symptoms, other organ involvement, and related inflammatory markers was also collected. The results showed that, compared to ACPA- RA patients, ACPA+ cases had greater imbalances between peripheral CD4+ T cell subsets, mainly manifested as an increase in T-helper 1 (Th1) cells (p < 0.001) and decrease in regulatory T (Treg) cells (p = 0.029). This makes these patients more prone to inflammatory reactions and joint erosion. MMP-3 levels in ACPA+ and ACPA- RA patients were significantly higher than in HCs (p < 0.001), and MMP-3 could effectively distinguish between ACPA- RA patients and HCs (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.930, sensitivity 84.14%, specificity 92.11%). MMP-3 was also a serum marker for distinguishing between RA patients with low and high disease activities. Further analysis showed that MMP-3 was positively correlated with the levels of inflammatory markers and disease activity, and negatively correlated with the levels of lymphocyte subsets. In addition, with improvements in the disease, MMP-3 levels decreased, and further increased as the patients started to deteriorate. In summary, our research showed that there was a mild imbalance between peripheral CD4+ T cell subsets in ACPA- RA patients. MMP-3 may be used as a potential marker for early diagnosis of ACPA- RA. MMP-3 was an important index for RA disease evaluation, disease activity stratification, and prognosis.","misc","christiaan"

Since endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in viral sensing, we investigated the impact of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within TLR3 and TLR9 genes on the occurrence of overall and high-level (≥1,000 IU/ml) CMV infection in a cohort of 197 KT recipients. Homozygous carriers of the minor allele of TLR3 (rs3775291) had higher infection-free survival compared with reference allele carriers (60.0% for TT versus 42.3% for CC/CT genotypes; P-value = 0.050). Decreased infection-free survival was observed with the minor allele of TLR9 (rs352139) (38.2% for TC/CC versus 59.3% for TT genotypes; P-value = 0.004). After multivariable adjustment, the recessive protective effect of the TLR3 (rs3775291) TT genotype was confirmed (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.327; 95% CI: 0.167-0.642; P-value = 0.001), as was the dominant risk-conferring effect of TLR9 (rs352139) TC/CC genotypes (aHR: 1.865; 95% CI: 1.170-2.972; P-value = 0.009).

With 29 vehicles tested in 10 cities and different boundaries applied for calculation, this study quantitively analyzed the problem, causes, and impacts of the light-duty MAW method. The instantaneous utilization factor (IUF) is proposed for reason analysis. The current MAW method could weaken the supervision of real driving tests as more than 75% of the tests underestimated MAW results, with the largest underestimation being around 100%. The data exclusion could lead to biased MAW results. But without the exclusion, the MAW result couldn't always get an increase due to the IUF and window weighting factor variation. With the extended factors removed, the MAW result bias is significantly reduced. The MAW will lead to a lower IUF of the data at the start/end of the tests, and when the cold-start data is considered, this low utilization must be noticed. The effect from the data exclusion, extended factors, and the window characteristics are closely coupled and they should be taken into consideration simultaneously to consummate the calculation method.

The Sclerotinia disease (SD) caused by the soil-borne fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating disease affecting most oil crops such as Brassica napus. Here, we identified 130 legume lectin (LegLu) genes in B. napus, which could be phylogenetically classified into seven clusters. The BnLegLu gene family has been significantly expanded since the whole-genome duplication (WGD) or segmental duplication. Gene structure and conserved motif analysis suggested that the BnLegLu genes were well conserved in each cluster. Moreover, relative to those genes only containing the legume lectin domain in cluster VI-VII, the genes in cluster I-V harbored a transmembrane domain and a kinase domain linked to the legume lectin domain in the C terminus. The expression of most BnLegLu genes was relatively low in various tissues. Thirty-five BnLegLu genes were responsive to abiotic stress, and 40 BnLegLu genes were strongly induced by S. sclerotiorum, with a most significant up-regulation of 715-fold, indicating their functional roles in SD resistance. Four BnLegLu genes were located in the candidate regions of genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) results which resulted from a worldwide rapeseed population consisting of 324 accessions associated with SD. Among them, the positive role of BnLegLus-16 in SD resistance was validated by transient expression in tobacco leaves.

Commonly, the transition statistics are power-law distributed, implying that quantum dots possess at least trivial memories. By investigating the temporal correlations in the blinking data, we demonstrate with high statistical confidence that there is nontrivial memory between the on and off brightness duration data of blinking quantum dots. We define nontrivial memory to be statistical complexity greater than one. We show that this memory cannot be discovered using the transition distribution. We show by simulation that this memory does not arise from standard data manipulations. Finally, we conclude that at least three physical mechanisms can explain the measured nontrivial memory: (1) storage of state information in the chemical structure of a quantum dot; (2) the existence of more than two intensity levels in a quantum dot; and (3) the overlap in the intensity distributions of the quantum dot states, which arises from fundamental photon statistics.","misc","christiaan"

We find that the temporal evolution of the GPE data is accurately predicted by the WKE, with no adjustable parameters, for about two nonlinear kinetic times. Qualitative agreement between the GPE and the WKE persists also for longer times with some quantitative deviations that may be attributed to the combination of a breakdown of the theoretical assumptions underlying the WKE as well as numerical issues. Furthermore, we study how the wave statistics evolves toward Gaussianity in a timescale of the order of the kinetic time. The excellent agreement between direct numerical simulations of the GPE and the WKE provides a solid foundation to the theory of weak wave turbulence.","misc","christiaan"

Starting from the ground state, and considering chains of different numbers of dipoles, we introduce single site excitations with excess energy ΔK. The time evolution of the chaoticity of the system and the energy localization along the chain is analyzed by computing, up to a very long time, the statistical average of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent λ(t) and the participation ratio Π(t). For small ΔK, the evolution of λ(t) and Π(t) indicates that the system becomes chaotic at approximately the same time as Π(t) reaches a steady state. For the largest considered values of ΔK the system becomes chaotic at an extremely early stage in comparison with the energy relaxation times. We find that this fact is due to the presence of chaotic breathers that keep the system far from equipartition and ergodicity. Finally, we show numerically and analytically that the asymptotic values attained by the participation ratio Π(t) fairly correspond to thermal equilibrium.","misc","christiaan"

Moreover, FACS-based Annexin-V/PI double staining and cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) showed that siGR enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis, which was mediated by p38 MAP kinase. Collectively, our findings established that the combination of high GR and FoxP3 was associated with cervical cancer progression and platinum resistance, suggesting a potential predictive biomarker for clinical management in patients with cervical cancer.","misc","christiaan"

Herein we report a unique one composed of the f-block element moiety of uranyl (UO2 2+) through a global-minimum structure search. Its geometry is found to be similar to that of graphene with a honeycomb-like hexagonal unit composed of six uranyl ligands, where each uranyl is bridged by two superoxido groups and a pair of hydroxyl ligands. All the uranium and bridging oxygen atoms form an extended planar 2D structure, which shows thermodynamic, kinetic and thermal stabilities due to σ/π bonding as well as electrostatic interactions between ligands. Each superoxido ligand has one unpaired (2pπ*)1 electron and is antiferromagnetically coupled through uranyl bridges with 2pπ*-5f δ -2pπ* superexchange interactions, forming a rare type of one-dimensional Heisenberg chain with p-orbital antiferromagnetism, which might become valuable for application in antiferromagnetic spintronics.","misc","christiaan"

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and Fc-effector functions of ACE2-Fc decoy proteins, formatted with or without the ACE2 collectrin domain, were optimized by Fc-modification. The different Fc-modifications resulted in distinct effects on neutralization and effector functions. H429Y, a point mutation outside the binding sites for FcγRs or complement caused non-covalent oligomerization of the ACE2-Fc decoy proteins, abrogated FcγR interaction and enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Another Fc mutation, H429F did not improve virus neutralization but resulted in increased C5b-C9 fixation and transformed ACE2-Fc to a potent mediator of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) expressing cells. Furthermore, modification of the Fc-glycan enhanced cell activation via FcγRIIIa. These different immune profiles demonstrate the capacity of Fc-based agents to be engineered to optimize different mechanisms of protection for SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other viral pathogens.","misc","christiaan"

Second, it aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of subsequent pregnancies following ectopic pregnancy treatment. Methods A retrospective cohort study was carried out at a tertiary care centre in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The sample for this study comprised 59 patients who were diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy and treated with MTX at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, between 2016 and 2021. The data were stored in the Microsoft Office Excel format and analyzed using the SPSS software. Results There were 10 reported cases of ruptured ectopic pregnancy; seven of these underwent surgery, while three were successfully treated conservatively using MTX. Success rates of 55.9% and 93.8% were recorded after administering the first and second dose of MTX, respectively, based on beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) drop between day 4 and day 7. Among those treated with MTX, 37.3% of the patients reported a successful subsequent pregnancy, of which 54.5% delivered a live, healthy infant and 13.6% had a second ectopic pregnancy. Conclusion MTX proved effective in treating ectopic pregnancy, with a β-hCG drop of more than 15%. Patients who received a second dose of MTX showed a higher drop in β-hCG level, indicating greater success as a cumulative effect. The clinical outcome after MTX treatment of ectopic pregnancy was shown to be significant with a p-value <0.05.","misc","christiaan"

Less emphasis is given to the change of the state of the bath. However, as previously shown for some specific models, during the thermalization the environment may undergo a nontrivial dynamics, indicated by the the change of its von Neumann entropy, at timescales even longer than the relaxation time of the system; here such a behavior is called post-thermalization. We provide a more detailed analysis of this phenomenon by simulating the full dynamics of a variety of systems together with their environment. In particular, the post-thermalization is qualitatively explained as a result of reconversion of the initially built up correlation between the system and the bath into the correlation between the degrees of freedom in the environment. We also present exemplary systems in which such a reconversion is suppressed due to non-Markovian dynamics or the presence of interactions.","misc","christiaan"

The results showed that 36.3% passed the knowledge assessment, 86.7% passed the attitude assessment, and 24% passed the practical assessment. There were differences in average knowledge scores among gender (men higher than women, p = 0.006), ethnicities (Kinh higher than Dao and Tay, p < 0.001), and educational level (higher education, higher knowledge score, p < 0.001).

Eating raw fish and/or undercooked fish, raw vegetables, and drinking untreated water from Thac Ba lake in Yen Bai province were identified as FZTi risk behaviors. The occurrence of these risky habits can be explained by the lack of knowledge on FZTi, poor economic conditions and typical social features of local people. The current knowledge of local people in regard to safe eating practices is poor. They keep performing unsafe practices, which lead to infection with FZTi; therefore, an integrated control of FZTi is essential.","misc","christiaan"

The current work aims to provide a richer understanding of DM1 imbalance. Standing balance in 16 patients and 40 controls was tested in two posturographic tests (EquiTest™). In the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), standstill balance was challenged by combining visual (eyes open vs. closed) and environmental conditions (fixed vs. sway-tuned platform and/or visual surround). In the react test, reflexes induced by sudden shifts in the support base were studied. Oscillations of the body centre of mass (COM) were measured. In the SOT, COM sway was larger in patients than controls in any condition, including firm support with eyes open (quiet standing). On sway-tuned support, COM oscillations when standing with closed eyes were larger in patients than controls even after taking into account the oscillations with eyes open. In the react paradigm, balance reflexes were delayed in patients. Results in both experimental paradigms (i.e., SOT and react test) are consistent with leg muscle weakness. This, however, is not a sufficient explanation. The SOT test highlighted that patients rely on vision more than controls to maintain static balance. Consistently enough, evidence is provided that an impairment of proprioceptive and vestibular systems contributes to falls in DM1. Rehabilitation programs targeted at reweighting sensory systems may be designed to improve safe mobility in DM1.","misc","christiaan"

In Argentina, however, despite the high prevalence of subgenotype F1b infection, this relationship has not been described. To unravel the observed differences in the progression of the infection, an in-depth molecular and biological characterization of the subgenotype F1b was performed. Phylogenetic analysis of subgenotype F1b full-length genomes revealed the existence of two highly supported clusters. One of the clusters, designated as gtF1b Basal included sequences mostly from Alaska, Peru and Chile, while the other, called gtF1b Cosmopolitan, contained samples mainly from Argentina and Chile. The clusters were characterized by a differential signature pattern of eight nucleotides distributed throughout the genome. In vitro characterization of representative clones from each cluster revealed major differences in viral RNA levels, virion secretion, antigen expression levels, as well as in the localization of the antigens. Interestingly, a differential regulation in the expression of genes associated with tumorigenesis was also identified. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the molecular and biological characteristics of the subgenotype F1b clusters and contributes to unravel the different clinical outcomes of subgenotype F1b chronic infections.","misc","christiaan"

"766",35966791,"Dynamic modeling of practice effects across the healthy aging-Alzheimer's disease continuum.","Standardized tests of learning and memory are sensitive to changes associated with both aging and superimposed neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, repeated behavioral test administration can be confounded by practice effects (PE), which may obscure declines in level of abilities and contribute to misdiagnoses. Growing evidence, however, suggests PE over successive longitudinal measurements may differentially predict cognitive status and risk for progressive decline associated with aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. Thus, when viewed as a reflection of neurocognitive plasticity, PE may reveal residual abilities that can add to our understanding of age- and disease-related changes in learning and memory. The present study sought to evaluate differences in PE and verbal recall in a clinically characterized aging cohort assessed on multiple occasions over 3 years. Participants included 256 older adults recently diagnosed as cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 126), or with MCI of amnestic (n = 65) or non-amnestic MCI (n = 2085), and multi-domain amnestic dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT; n = 45). We applied a continuous time structural equation modeling (ctsem) approach to verbal recall performance on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test in order to distinguish PE from individual occasion performance, coupled random changes, age trends, and differing measurement quality. Diagnoses of MCI and dementia were associated with lower recall performance on all trials, reduced PE gain per occasion, and differences in non-linear dynamic parameters. Practice self-feedback is a dynamic measure of the decay or acceleration in PE process changes over longitudinal occasions. As with PE and mean recall, estimated practice self-feedback followed a gradient from positive in CU participants to null in participants with diagnosed MCI and negative for those with dementia diagnoses. Evaluation of sensitivity models showed this pattern of variation in PE was largely unmodified by differences in age, sex, or educational attainment. These results show dynamic modeling of PE from longitudinal performance on standardized learning and memory tests can capture multiple aspects of behavioral changes in MCI and dementia. The present study provides a new perspective for modeling longitudinal change in verbal learning in clinical and cognitive aging research.","misc","christiaan"

It is key to well-being and human development. From infancy to adulthood, human interactions ceaselessly contribute to the flourishing or impairment of intersubjectivity. In this work, we first describe intersubjectivity as a hallmark of quality dyadic processes. Then, using parent-child relationship as an example, we propose a dyadic active inference model to elucidate an inverse relation between stress and intersubjectivity. We postulate that impaired intersubjectivity is a manifestation of underlying problems of deficient relational benevolence, misattributing another person's intentions (over-mentalizing), and neglecting the effects of one's own actions on the other person (under-coupling). These problems can exacerbate stress due to excessive variational free energy in a person's active inference engine when that person feels threatened and holds on to his/her invalid (mis)beliefs. In support of this dyadic model, we briefly describe relevant neuroimaging literature to elucidate brain networks underlying the effects of an intersubjectivity-oriented parenting intervention on parenting stress. Using the active inference dyadic model, we identified critical interventional strategies necessary to rectify these problems and hereby developed a coding system in reference to these strategies. In a theory-guided quantitative review, we used this coding system to code 35 clinical trials of parenting interventions published between 2016 and 2020, based on PubMed database, to predict their efficacy for reducing parenting stress. The results of this theory-guided analysis corroborated our hypothesis that parenting intervention can effectively reduce parenting stress if the intervention is designed to mitigate the problems of deficient relational benevolence, under-coupling, and over-mentalizing. We integrated our work with several dyadic concepts identified in the literature. Finally, inspired by Arya Nagarjuna's Buddhist Madhyamaka Philosophy, we described abstract expressions of Dependent Origination as a relational worldview to reflect on the normality, impairment, and rehabilitation of intersubjectivity.","misc","christiaan"

In Canada, caregivers of older adults receiving home care face difficult decisions that may lead to decision regret. We assessed difficult decisions and decision regret among caregivers of older adults receiving home care services and factors associated with decision regret. Methods. From March 13 to 30, 2020, at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted an online survey with caregivers of older adults receiving home care in the 10 Canadian provinces. We distributed a self-administered questionnaire through Canada's largest and most representative private online panel. We identified types of difficult health-related decisions faced in the past year and their frequency and evaluated decision regret using the Decision Regret Scale (DRS), scored from 0 to 100. We performed descriptive statistics as well as bivariable and multivariable linear regression to identify factors predicting decision regret. Results. Among 932 participants, the mean age was 42.2 y (SD = 15.6 y), and 58.4% were male. The most frequently reported difficult decisions were regarding housing and safety (75.1%). The mean DRS score was 28.8/100 (SD = 8.6). Factors associated with less decision regret included higher caregiver age, involvement of other family members in the decision-making process, wanting to receive information about the options, and considering organizations interested in the decision topic and health care professionals as trustworthy sources of information (all P < 0.001). Factors associated with more decision regret included mismatch between the caregiver's preferred option and the decision made, the involvement of spouses in the decision-making process, higher decisional conflict, and higher burden of care (all P < 0.001). Discussion. Decisions about housing and safety were the difficult decisions most frequently encountered by caregivers of older adults in this survey. Our results will inform future decision support interventions. This is one of the first studies to assess decision regret among caregivers of older adults receiving home and community care services and to identify their most frequent difficult decisions.Difficult decisions were most frequently about housing and safety. Most caregivers of older adults in all 10 provinces of Canada experienced decision regret.Factors associated with less decision regret included higher caregiver age, the involvement of other family members in the decision-making process, wanting to receive information about the options, considering organizations interested in the decision topic, and health care professionals as trustworthy sources of information. Factors associated with more decision regret included mismatch between the caregiver's preferred option and the decision made, the involvement of spouses in the decision-making process, higher decisional conflict, and higher burden of care.","misc","christiaan"

This approach always reveals a copper bond valence excess relative to the unit value, correlated to an equivalent ligand bond valence deficit. In stoichiometric chalcogenides, this corresponds to one ligand electron in excess per formula unit relative to the valence equilibrium considering only CuI. This ligand electron in excess is 50/50 shared between all or part of the Cu-atom positions, and all or part of the ligand-atom positions. In Cu3Se2, only one of the two Cu positions is involved in this sharing. It would indicate a special type of multicentre bonding (`one-electron co-operative bonding'). Calculated and ideal structural formulae according to this bond valence distribution are presented. At the crystal structure scale, Cu-ligand bonds implying the single electron in excess form one-, two- or three-dimensional subnetworks. Bond valence distribution according to two two-dimensional subnets is detailed in covellite, CuS. This bond valence description is a formal crystal-chemical representation of the metallic conductivity of holes (mixing between Cu 3d bands and ligand p bands), according to published electronic band structures.

A glass optical fiber inserted into the electron column above the objective lens polepiece, and a laser, an adjustable light source, was used to fabricate the device. After the illuminator has been calibrated using an external measuring system, it allows one to adjust the intensity of the lighting to the needs of the observed process. This lighting system was utilized to image antimicrobial photodynamic therapy phenomena, which are currently the subject of intense research. The sample was prepared by spotting a suspension of bacteria on a carbon, graphene, or silicon nitride substrate, blotting the excess solution, spotting the photosensitizer solution, blotting the excess liquid again, and then assembling the liquid cell with a second substrate or graphene film. The process of the imaging experiment itself includes choosing the right place for observation with the use of low magnification and a minimum dose of electrons, and then cyclical activation of the light source to capture subsequent images at specified intervals with the minimum amount of electrons necessary. The electron dose of each exposure and the time and intensity of lighting used need to be carefully recorded due to the complexity of the observed phenomena as, at the same time, the process is both light- and electron-driven. After the actual experiment is performed, additional control observations must be made, in which the same doses of electrons are used but without additional light influence and smaller doses of electrons are used for higher doses of light. This makes it possible to distinguish light-induced microstructural effects from those caused by electrons in both the fields of life and materials science.","misc","christiaan"

This study was conducted using data from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study (KFACS). The KFACS participants were classified as robust or frail based on Fried's frailty phenotype and excluded if they did not properly answer the questions, resulting in 1,066 robust and 165 frail participants. We then selected influential features through feature selection and trained the model using support vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms with the prepared dataset. Due to the imbalanced distribution in the dataset with a low sample size, holdout was applied with stratified 10-fold and cross-validation for estimating the model performance. The reliability of the constructed model was validated using an unseen test set. The model was then trained with hyperparameter optimization. During the feature selection process, 27 features were identified as meaningful factors for frailty. The model was trained based on the selected features, and the weighted average F1-score reached 95.30% with the random forest algorithm. The results of the study demonstrated the possibility of adopting machine learning to strengthen existing frailty criteria. As the method analyzes questionnaire responses in a short time, it can support higher volumes of data on participants' health conditions and alert them regarding potential risks in advance.","misc","christiaan"

Modern lifestyle, the inappropriate use of antibiotics, and exposure to pollution have significantly affected the composition of commensal microorganisms. The intestinal microbiota has been shown to sustain inappropriate autoimmune responses at distant sites in animal models of disease, and may also have a role in immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). We studied the composition of the gut mycobiota in fecal samples from 27 persons with MS (pwMS) and in 18 healthy donors (HD), including 5 pairs of homozygous twins discordant for MS. We found a tendency towards higher fungal abundance and richness in the MS group, and we observed that MS twins showed a higher rate of food-associated strains, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then found that in pwMS, a distinct population of cells with antibacterial and antifungal activity is expanded during the remitting phase and markedly decreases during clinically and/or radiologically active disease. These cells, named MAIT (mucosal-associated invariant T cells) lymphocytes, were significantly more activated in pwMS compared to HD in response to S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans strains isolated from fecal samples. This activation was also mediated by fungal-induced IL-23 secretion by innate immune cells. Finally, immunofluorescent stainings of MS post-mortem brain tissues from persons with the secondary progressive form of the disease showed that MAIT cells cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. These results were in agreement with the hypothesis that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota might determine the inappropriate response of a subset of pathogenic mucosal T cells and favor the development of systemic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.","misc","christiaan"

This applied research used a scientometric approach. The related MeSH-driven terms in internal medicine were selected as search phrases and searched in the SCImago database. SPSS and Excel software packages were used for statistical analysis. Geographical mapping was done with Google Maps for depicting country geographical distribution. Out of all 4,972,258 papers published by 230 countries worldwide in the field, about 60% belonged to the USA and Western European countries. These countries were at top of citation and self-citation counts as well as the h-index indicator. The citations per paper indicator were 27.1 and about 25.1% of total citations were self-citations. A significant positive correlation was found between the number of papers, citation count, and self-citation rate, and h-index in the field (p<0.001). The research status of internal medicine in developed regions and countries was quantitatively and qualitatively better than that of developing countries, including Iran.","misc","christiaan"

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the standard treatment for OSA. However, its effects on systemic inflammation and glucocorticoid responsiveness in OSA patients with asthma are largely unknown. To examine the potential role of CPAP therapy in reducing systemic inflammation and improving glucocorticoid responsiveness in asthmatic patients with OSA. A case-control study was conducted at the respiratory and sleep clinics involving patients with OSA and patients with asthma and OSA. The levels of inflammatory asthma biomarkers (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-17A, IL-8, IL-2, and interferon-γ [IFN-γ]), and glucocorticoid receptors (GR)-α and GR-β, were determined to compare systemic inflammation and glucocorticoid responsiveness between pre- and post-1-month CPAP treatment in both groups. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare inflammatory biomarkers before and after CPAP therapy. P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The analysis was performed using SPSS. Recruited patients (n = 47), 51% (n = 24) had OSA and 49% (n = 23), had OSA with asthma. Interestingly, the blood levels of IL-17 and IL-8 were significantly decreased post-CPAP therapy in OSA patients, whereas IL-4, IL-17, and IFN-γ were significantly reduced post-CPAP treatment in OSA patients with asthma. Remarkably, CPAP therapy improved glucocorticoid responsiveness in asthmatic patients with OSA, but not in the OSA group and an increase in the GR-α/GR-β ratio was noted post-CPAP therapy. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy improved responsiveness to glucocorticoid treatment and demonstrated a suppressive effect on proinflammatory cytokines in asthmatics with OSA.","misc","christiaan"

This article aimed to assess the predictors of problem-solving skills among emergency medical services staff in Iran. This study was cross-sectional correlational research. Using convenience sampling methods, 140 emergency medical services (EMS) staff were enrolled in the study. Response time was assessed using ASAYAR software, problem-solving skills (PSS) were measured using the Hepner Petersen Problem Solving Questionnaire (PSI), and cognitive emotion regulation strategies were assessed using the Garnfsky Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson's r correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression analysis were applied using SPSS 14.0. The results of our study showed that the total mean score for problem-solving skills was 136.84 (14.65) (range, 175-107 points). Multiple linear regression indicated that refocusing on planning, positive evaluation, stress management courses, delays and their causes, positive refocusing, catastrophizing, and acceptance were effective predictors of problem-solving skills in emergency personnel, accounting for 54% of the total variances. This study is one of the first studies in this field. Based on our findings, individuals who consider their emotions and feelings when solving problems are better able to use the process of thinking and problem-solving skills. Therefore, by training people in the field of emotional regulation skills, the skills to solve problems technicians can be increased.","misc","christiaan"
"757",35978506,"Role of Cancer-Associated fibroblast in the pathogenesis of ovarian Cancer: Focus on the latest therapeutic approaches.","Ovarian cancer (OC) is the seventh most common malignancy in women globally. This type of cancer can occur at any age, but it is more frequent in women over 50 and is usually diagnosed late. Despite platinum-based chemotherapy and optimal cytoreductive surgery, OC cells tend to metastasize, and patients with OC experience recurrent relapses and poor prognosis. Therefore, the emergence of novel therapies is essential for treating these patients. On the other hand, it has been shown that the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its components play an important role in the pathogenesis of OC. One of these components is cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), which is involved in the growth and development of tumor cells by inducing tumor cells growth, proliferation, angiogenesis and inhibiting anti-tumor responses. Due to the importance of these cells in the TME, various therapeutic approaches such as direct targeting of CAFs, reprogramming of CAFs, and CAF-associated genes and molecules targeting have been suggested for OC treatment. This review summarizes the role of CAFs in the pathogenesis of OC and therapeutic approaches based on the mentioned therapeutic approaches.","misc","christiaan"

This study used an unbiased approach to evaluate a broad range of pathologies in an unselected European community-dwelling ageing cohort of 101 individuals (77-90 years). Pathological alterations observed included neurofibrillary tangles and corpora amylacea in all cases, ARTAG (79%), Thal amyloid-β phase >1 (60%), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (39%), Lewy bodies (22%), LATE-NC (21%), oligodendroglial tau-positive coiled bodies (33%), and argyrophilic grains (15%). We demonstrate association of LATE-NC with the previously unappreciated age-related tau oligodendrogliopathy (ARTOG) and highlight the association of LATE-NC with various ARTAG types pointing toward common pathogenic aspects. Only neurofibrillary tangles and LATE-NC were associated with cognitive decline.

Plasma fetuin-A levels were significantly lower in patients with sepsis, but data regarding CAP are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of fetuin-A as a prognostic biomarker of CAP. A multicenter cohort study on CAP was conducted between January 2017 and December 2018. Demographic and clinical data were recorded for all enrolled patients. Plasma fetuin-A levels were determined using a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to analyse the effect of variables on 30-day mortality. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors associated with severe CAP (SCAP) and 30-day mortality. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to verify the association between variables and CAP prognosis. Correlations were assessed using Spearman's test. Survival curves were constructed and compared using the log-rank test. A total of 283 patients with CAP were enrolled in this study. Fetuin-A levels were decreased in patients with CAP, especially in SCAP and non-survivors. A cox regression analysis showed that CURB-65 and fetuin-A levels were independent prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality. Via a multiple logistic regression analysis, plasma level of fetuin-A (<202.86 mg/L) was determined to be the strongest independent predictor of 30-day mortality considered (odds ratio, 57.365), and also was also determined to be an independent predictor of SCAP. The area under the curve (AUC) of fetuin-A for predicting 30-day mortality was 0.871, and accuracy was high (P < 0.05). Plasma fetuin-A levels were negatively correlated with WBC, NE%, Glu, CRP, PCT, CURB-65, and pneumonia severity index scores and positively correlated with albumin level. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that lower plasma levels of fetuin-A levels were associated with increased 30-day mortality levels (P < 0.0001). Plasma fetuin-A levels were decreased in patients with CAP. Fetuin-A can reliably predict mortality in patients with CAP, and is a useful diagnostic indicator of SCAP.","misc","christiaan"

Most pharmacological studies were based on the essential oil and the crude extracts of the plant and the bioactive compounds responsible for the bioefficacy have not been well-identified. Further investigations are required to transform the experience-based claims on the use of S. anquetilia in traditional medicine practices into evidence-based information. Detailed in-vitro and in-vivo studies on the mechanisms of action of pure bioactive compounds and more elaborate toxicity studies to ensure plant safety for human use should be conducted.

Rapid responses from fertility subspecialist doctors may reduce patients' anxiety levels, but fertility subspecialist doctors' high workload and their patients' worsening health conditions make them unable to handle IVF patients' complaints quickly. Research suggests that smart systems using case-based reasoning (CBR) can help doctors handle patients quickly. However, a prior study reported enhanced accuracy by modifying the CBR similarity formula based on Lin's similarity theory to generate the Chris case-based reasoning (CCBR) similarity formula. The data were validated through interviews with two fertility subspecialist doctors, interviews with two IVF patients, a questionnaire administered to 17 community members, the relevant literature, and 256 records with data on IVF patients' complaints and how they were handled. An experiment compared the performance of the CBR similarity formula algorithm with the CCBR similarity formula algorithm. A confusion matrix showed that the CCBR similarity formula had an accuracy value of 52.58% and a precision value of 100%. Fertility subspecialist doctors stated that 89.69% of the CCBR similarity formula recommendations were accurate. We recommend applying a combination of the CCBR similarity formula and a minimum reference value of 80% with a CBR smart system for handling IVF patients' complaints. This recommendation for an accurate system produced by the CBR similarity formula may help fertility subspecialist doctors handle IVF patients' complaints.","misc","christiaan"

The HRES under consideration consists of solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, lithium-ion batteries, and diesel generators. The islands were identified from Google Maps™, Bing Maps™, and the study of Meschede and Ocon et al. (2019) [1]. The peak loads of these islands were acquired from National Power Corporation - Small Power Utilities Group (NPC-SPUG), if available, or estimated from the island population otherwise. Hourly-resolution load profiles were synthesized using the normalized profiles reported by Bertheau and Blechinger (2018) [2]. Existing diesel generators in the islands were compiled from reports by NPC-SPUG, while monthly average global horizontal irradiance and wind speeds were taken from the Phil-LIDAR 2 database. Islands that are electrically interconnected were lumped into one microgrid, so the 634 islands were grouped into 616 microgrids. The HRES were optimized using Island System LCOEmin Algorithm (ISLA), our in-house energy systems modeling tool, which sized the energy components to minimize the net present cost. The component sizes and corresponding techno-economic metrics of the optimized HRES in each microgrid are included in the dataset. In addition, the net present value, internal rate of return, payback period, and subsidy requirements of the microgrid are reported at five different electricity rates. This data is valuable for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders who are working to provide sustainable energy access to off-grid communities.

Several researchers have conducted some experiments for a fishbone well strategy with mixed results. Our objective in this work is to study the impact of the different fishbone well patterns, such as branch angle, on the distribution of remaining oil after water flooding. In this paper, the interference effect between branches on oil recovery is studied in three steps. First, the interferences between fishbone wells with different branch angles were measured by hydro-electric simulation experiments. Second, two-dimensional visualization water flooding experiments were carried out to clarify the remaining oil distribution at different branch angles. Third, the distribution of oil and water in fishbone wells was verified by establishing a numerical model. The modeling results agree well with the experimental phenomena. At the same time, the variation trend of water and oil production in each branch is analyzed by numerical simulation results. The results indicate that the production is strongly dependent on the branch angles, and the highest recovery was 60.2% at a 45° branch angle.","misc","christiaan"

SP-D has a crucial immune function in detecting and clearing pulmonary pathogens; DC-SIGN is involved in facilitating dendritic cell interaction with naïve T cells to mount an anti-viral immune response. SP-D and DC-SIGN have been shown to interact with various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped RNA virus that causes COVID-19. A recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) comprising of α-helical neck region, carbohydrate recognition domain, and eight N-terminal Gly-X-Y repeats has been shown to bind SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by preventing viral entry in Vero cells and HEK293T cells expressing ACE2. DC-SIGN has also been shown to act as a cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 independent of ACE2. Since rfhSP-D is known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and DC-SIGN, this study was aimed at investigating the potential of rfhSP-D in modulating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Coincubation of rfhSP-D with Spike protein improved the Spike Protein: DC-SIGN interaction. Molecular dynamic studies revealed that rfhSP-D stabilised the interaction between DC-SIGN and Spike protein. Cell binding analysis with DC-SIGN expressing HEK 293T and THP- 1 cells and rfhSP-D treated SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotypes confirmed the increased binding. Furthermore, infection assays using the pseudotypes revealed their increased uptake by DC-SIGN expressing cells. The immunomodulatory effect of rfhSP-D on the DC-SIGN: Spike protein interaction on DC-SIGN expressing epithelial and macrophage-like cell lines was also assessed by measuring the mRNA expression of cytokines and chemokines. RT-qPCR analysis showed that rfhSP-D treatment downregulated the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-α, IFN-α, IL-1β, IL- 6, IL-8, and RANTES (as well as NF-κB) in DC-SIGN expressing cells challenged by Spike protein. Furthermore, rfhSP-D treatment was found to downregulate the mRNA levels of MHC class II in DC expressing THP-1 when compared to the untreated controls. We conclude that rfhSP-D helps stabilise the interaction between SARS- CoV-2 Spike protein and DC-SIGN and increases viral uptake by macrophages via DC-SIGN, suggesting an additional role for rfhSP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","misc","christiaan"

Horizontal transmission of plant viruses by aphids occurs during distinct feeding behavioral events, such as probing for non-persistent viruses or phloem feeding for persistent viruses. We employed toxicity bioassays and electrical penetration graph (EPG) methodology to compare toxicity and quantify changes to feeding behavior and toxicity of A. gossypii after exposure to commercialized aphicides. Commercialized aphicides containing flupyradifurone, sulfoxaflor, thiamethoxam, thiamethoxam + lambda cyhalothrin, and bifenthrin induced >90% aphid mortality within 4 h of exposure. Flupyradifurone was the most acutely toxic aphicide studied with an LT50 of 8.9 min after exposure, which was approximately 3-fold lower than bifenthrin and thiamethoxam + lambda cyhalothrin. This was supported by our EPG results that showed a significant reduction in the proportion of aphids that continued to probe on cotton 4 h after exposure to flonicamid, thiamethoxam, flupyradifurone, bifenthrin, and thiamethoxam + lambda cyhalothrin.

Though bromocriptine's actions have been mainly attributed to the stimulation of brain dopamine D2 receptors (D2R), bromocriptine also targets the pancreas. Here, we employ bromocriptine as a tool to elucidate the roles of catecholamine signaling in regulating pancreatic hormone secretion. In β-cells, bromocriptine acts on D2R and α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2A-AR) to reduce glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Moreover, in α-cells, bromocriptine acts via D2R to reduce glucagon secretion. α2A-AR activation by bromocriptine recruits an ensemble of G proteins with no β-arrestin2 recruitment. In contrast, D2R recruits G proteins and β-arrestin2 upon bromocriptine stimulation, demonstrating receptor-specific signaling. Docking studies reveal distinct bromocriptine binding to α2A-AR versus D2R, providing a structural basis for bromocriptine's dual actions on β-cell α2A-AR and D2R. Together, joint dopaminergic and adrenergic receptor actions on α-cell and β-cell hormone release provide a new therapeutic mechanism to improve dysglycemia.","misc","christiaan"

The Expanded Socioecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness to Transition (Expanded SMART) offers a holistic view of factors that influence transition readiness and outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine conceptual congruency of transition readiness instruments with the Expanded SMART to determine the breadth and frequency of constructs measured. PubMed was searched to identify observational and experimental studies that measured transition readiness across chronic illnesses. Selected instruments were first evaluated on their development and psychometric properties. Next, reviewers independently mapped each instrument item to Expanded SMART constructs: knowledge, skills/self-efficacy, relationships/communication, psychosocial/emotions, developmental maturity, beliefs/expectations, goals/motivation. If items did not map to a construct, a new construct was named inductively through group discussion. Three instruments (TRAQ [20 items], STARx [18 items] and TRxANSITION Index [32 items]), reported in 74 studies, were identified. Across instruments, most items mapped to three constructs: skills/self-efficacy, developmental maturity, and knowledge. The psychosocial constructs of goals/motivation and psychosocial/emotions were underrepresented in the instruments. No instrument mapped to every model construct. Two new constructs: independent living and organization were identified. Constructs representing transition readiness in three frequently used transition readiness instruments vary considerably from Expanded SMART, a holistic conceptual model of transition readiness, suggesting that conceptualization and operationalization of transition readiness is not standardized. No instrument reflected all conceptual constructs of transition readiness and psychosocial constructs were underrepresented, suggesting that current instruments may provide an incomplete measurement of transition readiness.","misc","christiaan"
"1262",35983313,"Surface Nanostructure Effects on Dopamine Adsorption and Electrochemistry on Glassy Carbon Electrodes.","Dopamine (DA) adsorption and electron-transfer kinetics are strongly sensitive to the structure and composition of carbon electrodes. Activation of carbon surfaces is a popular method to improve DA detection, but the role of carbon structural features on DA behavior remains uncertain. Herein, we use scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) for local anodization of glassy carbon (GC) electrodes in acid media followed by electrochemical imaging of DA adsorption and electrochemistry covering both unmodified and anodized GC regions of the same electrode. Electrochemical measurements of adsorbed DA involve the delivery of DA from the SECCM meniscus (30 μM) for 1 s periods followed by voltammetric analysis at a reasonable sweep rate (47 V s-1). This general approach reduces effects from interelectrode variability and allows for considerable numbers of measurements and statistical analysis of electrochemical data sets. Localized electrode activity is correlated to surface structure and chemistry by a range of characterization techniques. Anodization enhances DA electron-transfer kinetics and provides more sites for adsorption (higher specific surface area). A consequence is that adsorption takes longer to approach completion on the anodized surface. In fact, normalizing DA surface coverage by the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) reveals that adsorption is less extensive on anodized surfaces compared to as-prepared GC on the same time scale. Thus, ECSA, which has often been overlooked when calculating DA surface coverage on carbon electrodes, even where different activation methods would be expected to result in different surface roughness and nanostructure, is an important consideration. Lower graphitic and higher oxygen content on anodized GC also suggest that oxygen-containing functional groups do not necessarily enhance DA adsorption and may have the opposite effect. This work further demonstrates SECCM as a powerful technique for revealing surface structure-function relationships and correlations at heterogeneous electrodes.","misc","christiaan"

Specifically, two physical models are considered. The first one is a well-known single-qubit Otto engine; the non-Markovian behavior is there implemented by replacing standard thermalization strokes with so-called extremal thermal operations which cannot be realized without the memory effects. The second one is a three-stroke engine in which the cycle consists of two extremal thermal operations and a single qubit rotation. It is shown that the non-Markovian Otto engine can generate more work-per-cycle for a given efficiency than its Markovian counterpart, whereas performance of both setups is superior to the three-stroke engine. Furthermore, both the non-Markovian Otto engine and the three-stroke engine can reduce the work fluctuations in comparison with the Markovian Otto engine, with their relative advantage depending on the performance target. This demonstrates the beneficial influence of non-Markovianity on both the average performance and the stability of operation of quantum heat engines.","misc","christiaan"

To overcome this limitation, we designed and evaluated the integration of robotic application for an automated endoscope processing pathway. Methods  We used an endoscope reprocessing pass through machine with drying cabinet and a Franka Emika Panda robot. The robot was programmed to interact with its environment in a compliant way, guaranteeing desired contact force thresholds and therefore ensuring safety of both robot and medical equipment. Results  In an initial phase we tested the robots' ability to handle a modified tray holding an endoscope as well as certain challenges (correct positioning, connection of tubing, undesired collisions). We added another Panda robot arm resulting in a device featuring two independent manipulators and tested the accuracy of each individual step. We evaluated 50 consecutive processing and transfer procedures, simulating the average daily throughput of an endoscopic unit. The endoscopes were removed in adapted tray using a specially designed lifting device and placed in an endoscope storage and venting cabinet. The mean time for the handling of the scope was 104.2 ± 1.2 seconds and an accuracy of 100 % (0 failures in 50 attempts) was achieved. Conclusions  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description and evaluation of an automated compliant robotic assistance in the processing of endoscopes. Further development could help to overcome shortcomings of the man handled endoscope processing and could lead to reproducible, standardized and certified endoscope processing.","misc","christiaan"
"1043",35983471,"Chronic Retronychia: Nonsurgical Treatment.","Retronychia is a particular form of post-traumatic ingrown nail associated with repeated microtrauma of the underside of the proximal nail fold. It is caused by the nail embedding backward into the underside of the proximal nail fold, forming multiple generations of nail plate. The study aims to evaluate the results of a novel nonsurgical treatment of retronychia. A review was performed on 20 patients who underwent the treatment, 16 having suffered from a chronic form of the condition, with the remaining 4 being afflicted with retronychia for less than a year prior to treatment. The treatment was a combination of eliminating the proximal sharp edge of the uppermost nail layer and thinning of the nail with fraises and drills of various sizes. This therapy was repeated every 7-14 days. The patients came for checkup every 6 weeks. Treatment duration varied from 2 to 14 months. The rate, at which the appearance of a healthy nail occurred depended on the length of the intact nail layer below the part of the nail affected by retronychia, the age of the patient, and cofactors such as obesity, diabetes, etc. The treatment result in our case study was completely healthy nail growth without relapse of retronychia in all the 20 patients for a follow-up period of 18 months. By combining a healthy nail growth and the simultaneous protection of the nail, we were able to achieve a normal nail in all cases. In order to maintain the achieved results, we recommended our patients to continue wearing protective tubes whenever they would wear closed shoes because recurrence of retronychia may occur even after minimal trauma.","misc","christiaan"

Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) and EQ-5D scores were measured preoperatively. At 6-8 years follow-up, these scores were repeated and TSK scores were also measured. According to the TSK, patients were divided into two groups for further comparisons and analysis: without kinesiophobia (TSK-score ≤ 36) and with kinesiophobia (TSK-score >36). There were 99 patients (61.5%) with no kinesiophobia (TSK score ≤ 36, TSK mean 28.4, SD 4.7) and 62 patients (38.5%) with kinesiophobia (TSK score > 36, TSK mean 42.8, SD 5.3). Patients with and without kinesiophobia were not statistically different regarding age, sex or body mass index. (P = 0.20, P = 0.99, P = 0.22, respectively). In the group with no kinesiophobia, the mean 6-8 years WOMAC was 12.4 (SD 15.6), while the absolute delta (Δ) value between preoperative and 6-8 years WOMAC was 46.2 (SD 20.4), compared to the group with kinesiophobia where the mean 6-8 years WOMAC was 32.2 (SD 23.4), while the absolute delta (Δ) value between preoperative and 6-8 years WOMAC was 32.3 (SD 25.5): both P < 0.001. The group with no kinesiophobia had a mean 6-8 years EQ-5D of 0.81 (SD 0.22), while the absolute delta (Δ) value between preoperative and 6-8 years EQ-5D was 0.44 (SD 0.26), compared to the group with kinesiophobia where the mean 6-8 years EQ-5D was 0.57 (SD 0.23), while the absolute delta (Δ) value between preoperative and 6-8 years EQ-5D was 0.33 (SD 0.26): P < 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively. TSK scores were associated with worse WOMAC and EQ-5D scores, higher proportion of dependence on walking aids and increased THArelated adverse events (all P < 0.05). This study has shown us that there is a high incidence of kinesiophobia 6-8 years after surgery and treating kinesiophobia early after THA might improve the outcome.

We study the preparations of quantum correlations from a system qubit and an auxiliary qubit, assisted by a demon who obtains information of the system qubit from measurements on its environment. The demon can affect the postmeasured states of system by choosing different measurements, which establishes the relationships between quantum steering and other correlations in the thermodynamic framework. We present the optimal protocols for creating mutual information, entanglement, and Bell-nonlocality. These maximal correlations are found to relate exactly to the steerable boundary of the system-environment state with maximally mixed marginals.

We analyzed calls to the British Columbia poison centre to describe caller-declared exposures to kratom and the acute health effects of these exposures. For this descriptive analysis, we accessed electronic records, including transcriptions and extracted variables, of calls specifying kratom exposure managed by the BC Drug and Poison Information Centre (DPIC) from 2012 to 2019. We describe changes in case numbers, reasons for exposure, concurrent drug exposures and clinical outcomes over the study period. We identified 32 cases during the study period. In 23 cases (72%), the DPIC was consulted by a health care worker. Case numbers increased from 0 in 2012 to 9 in 2019. Numbers were highest for males in their 20s (n = 17, 53%). A total of 27 cases (84%) involved ingestion, with online distributors and local stores named as sources of procurement. A concurrent drug exposure was identified in 13 (41%) cases. There were no deaths; in 1 case, the exposed individual was intubated to manage agitation following kratom withdrawal. We observed a steady increase in kratom-related poison centre calls from 2012 to 2019, especially in young adult males. Rising call numbers may reflect increasing availability of kratom and may be a consequence of BC's opioid crisis, with kratom used by some to lessen symptoms of opioid withdrawal.","misc","christiaan"

CWAs are a family of organic chemicals that are used as chemical weapons because of their enormous severity and lethal effects when faced with unforeseen challenges. To stop the spread of CWAs, it is critical to develop a platform that detects them in a sensitive, timely, selective, and minimally invasive manner. Rapid advances in the demand for on-site sensors, metal nanoparticles, and biomarker identification for CWAs have made it possible to use fluorescence as a precise real-time and point-of-care (POCT) testing technique. For POCT-based applications, the new capabilities of micro- and nanomotors offer enormous prospects. In recent decades, significant progress has been made in the design of fluorescent sensors and the further development of noble metal nanoparticles for the detection of organophosphorus CWAs, as described in this review. Through this work, recent attempts to fabricate sensors that can detect organophosphorus CWAs through changes in their fluorescence properties have been summarized. Finally, an integrated outlook on how noble metal nanoparticles could be used to develop smart sensors for organophosphorus CWAs that communicate with and control electronic devices to monitor and improve the health of individuals.","misc","christiaan"

However, lack of understanding of the cocrystallization mechanism leads to inefficiency in cocrystal preparation. Therefore, studying the effects of solvent on cocrystal is of great importance for the efficient application of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20). In this paper, the effect of solvent on cocrystallization is investigated by the CL-20/HMX cocrystal/solvent cluster model, the CL-20/HMX/solvent mixture model, the CL-20/HMX cocrystal/solvent interface model combined with quantum chemistry and molecular dynamic methods. The authors find that the hydrogen bond between CL-20 and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) is the strongest and the binding energy of cocrystal and solvent molecules is the weakest in ethyl acetate (EA) solvent, indicating that CL-20 and HMX tend to be combined together and there is less hindrance by solvent molecules. Analysis of the CL-20/HMX/solvent mixture and mass density distribution studies show that the solvent effect has a great influence on the crystal faces and the cocrystallization rate of CL-20 and HMX is the highest in EA solvent. The XRD and SEM characterization results are consistent with the theoretical calculations. The present work on the effects of solvent on CL-20/HMX cocrystals is beneficial for understanding the mechanism of the growth of energetic cocrystal materials. It is helpful in selecting more suitable theoretical and experimental conditions and makes access to excellent cocrystals more efficient.","misc","christiaan"

With the rapid progression of the disease course of C. glabrata infections, there is an urgent need for a rapid and sensitive on-site assay for clinical diagnosis. Isothermal amplification is a recently developed method for rapid nucleic acid detection that is being increasingly used for on-site detection, especially recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). RPA combined with lateral flow strips (LFS) can rapidly amplify and visually detect the target gene within 20 min. The whole detection process can be controlled within 30-60 min by rapid sample pre-treatment. In this study, RPA-LFS was used to amplify the internal transcribed spacer region 2 gene of C. glabrata. The primer-probe design was optimized by introducing base mismatches (probe modification of one base) to obtain a highly specific and sensitive primer-probe combination for clinical sample detection. RPA-LFS was performed on 23 common clinical pathogens to determine the specificity of the assay system. The RPA-LFS system specifically detected C. glabrata without cross-reaction with other fungi or bacteria. Gradient dilutions of the template were tested to explore the lower limit of detection of this detection system and to determine the sensitivity of the assay. The sensitivity was 10 CFU/µL, without interference from genomic DNA of other species. The RPA-LFS and qPCR assays were performed on 227 clinical samples to evaluate the detection performance of the RPA-LFS system. Eighty-five samples were identified as C. glabrata, representing a detection rate of 37.5%. The results were consistent with qPCR and conventional culture methods. The collective findings indicate a reliable molecular diagnostic method for the detection of C. glabrata, and to meet the urgent need for rapid, specific, sensitive, and portable clinical field-testing.","misc","christiaan"
"1629",35982568,"Paired denitrifying bioreactors with wide orientation for increased drainage flow capacity.","Denitrifying bioreactors are a conservation drainage practice for reducing nitrate loads in subsurface agricultural drainage. Bioreactor hydraulic capacity is limited by cross-sectional area perpendicular to flow through the woodchip bed, with excess bypass flow untreated. Paired bioreactors with wide orientations were built in 2017 in Illinois, USA, to treat drainage from a relatively large 29 ha field. The paired design consisted of: a larger, Main bioreactor (LWD: 6.1 × 18.3 × 0.9 m) for treating base flow, and 2) a smaller, Booster bioreactor (7.8 × 13.1 × 0.9 m) receiving bypass flow from the Main bioreactor during periods of high flow. Over three years of monitoring, the paired bioreactor captured 84-92% of the annual drainage discharge which demonstrated an expanded cross-sectional area could improve bioreactor flow capture, even for a large drainage area. However, the paired bioreactors removed 6-28% of the annual N load leaving the field (1.8-5.6 kg N ha-1 removed; 52-161 kg N), which was not a notable improvement compared to bioreactors treating smaller drainage areas. The design operated as intended at low annual flow-weighted hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of usually ≤2 h, but these short HRTs ultimately limited bioreactor nitrate removal efficiency. Daily HRTs of <2 h often resulted in nitrate flushing. The Main bioreactor had higher hydraulic loading as intended and was responsible for the majority of flow captured in each year although not always the most nitrate mass removal. The Booster bioreactor provided better nitrate removal than the Main at HRTs of 3.0-11.9 h, possibly due to its drying cycles which may have liberated more available carbon. This new design approach tested at the field-scale illustrated tradeoffs between greater flow capacity (via increased bioreactor width) and longer HRT (via increased length), given a consistent bioreactor surface footprint.","misc","christiaan"

KRM-II-81 is active against many seizure and pain models in rodents, where it exhibits improved pharmacological properties over standard-of-care agents. Since salts can be utilized to create opportunities for increased solubility, enhanced absorption, and distribution, as well as for efficient methods of bulk synthesis, a hydrochloride salt of KRM-II-81 was prepared. KRM-II-81·HCl was produced from the free base with anhydrous hydrochloric acid. The formation of the monohydrochloride salt was confirmed by X-ray crystallography, as well as 1H NMR and 13C NMR analyses. High water solubility and a lower partition coefficient (octanol/water) were exhibited by KRM-II-81·HCl as compared to the free base. Oral administration of either KRM-II-81·HCl or the free base resulted in high concentrations in the brain and plasma of rats. Oral dosing in mice significantly increased the latency to both clonic and tonic convulsions and decreased pentylenetetrazol-induced lethality. The increased water solubility of the HCl salt enables intravenous dosing and the potential for higher concentration formulations compared with the free base without impacting anticonvulsant potency. Thus, KRM-II-81·HCl adds an important new compound to facilitate the development of these imidazodiazepines for clinical evaluation.","misc","christiaan"

HS is characterized by aberrant activation of the innate immune system, resulting in activation of pathways that aim to protect against pathogenic microorganisms, and also contribute to failure to resolve inflammation. Imbalance in innate immunity is evident in deregulation of host antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and the complement system associated with the microbiome dysbiosis. The pathology is further complicated by ability of pathogens associated with HS to overcome host immune response. Potential roles of major AMPs, cathelicidin, defensins, dermcidin, S100 proteins, RNAse 7 and complement proteins are discussed.

In this paper, a series of Mo-modified pseudoboehmite supported Ni catalysts were developed and evaluated for efficient hydrogen production from formic acid. Pseudoboehmite (PB) as a catalyst carrier was used for the first time. Ni/PB and NiMo/PB possessed a mesostructure, and the pore size distribution was mainly concentrated between 2 and 20 nm. The oxygen vacancies caused by Mo enhanced Ni anchoring, thus inhibiting Ni sintering. Compared with Ni10/PB (7.62 nm), Ni10Mo1/PB had smaller Ni particles (5.08 nm). The Ni-O-Al solid solutions formed through the interaction of Ni with the PB improved the catalytic performance. Ni10Mo1/PB gave the highest conversion of 92.8% with a H2 selectivity of 98% at 300 °C, and the catalyst activity hardly decreased during the 50 h stability test. In short, Ni10Mo1/PB was a promising catalyst for hydrogen production from formic acid because of the oxygen vacancy anchoring effect as well as the formation of Ni-O-Al solid solutions which could effectively suppress the Ni sintering.","misc","christiaan"

Schistosomiasis has been a persistent problem in endemic areas as there is no vaccine available, currently used anti-helmintic medications do not prevent reinfection, and most concerning, drug resistance has been documented in laboratory and field isolates. Thus, alternative approaches to curtail this human disease are warranted. Understanding the immunobiology of the obligate intermediate host of these parasites, which include the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata, may facilitate the development of novel methods to stop or reduce transmission to humans. Molecules from the thioester-containing protein (TEP) superfamily have been shown to be involved in immunological functions in many animals including corals and humans. In this study we identified, characterized, and compared TEP transcripts and their expression upon S. mansoni exposure in resistant and susceptible strains of B. glabrata snails. Results showed the expression of 11 unique TEPs in B. glabrata snails. These transcripts present high sequence identity at the nucleotide and putative amino acid levels between susceptible and resistant strains. Further analysis revealed differences in several TEPs' constitutive expression levels between resistant and susceptible snail strains, with C3-1, C3-3, and CD109 having higher constitutive expression levels in the resistant (BS90) strain, whereas C3-2 and TEP-1 showed higher constitutive expression levels in the susceptible (NMRI) strain. Furthermore, TEP-specific response to S. mansoni miracidia exposure reiterated their differential expression, with resistant snails upregulating the expression of both TEP-4 and TEP-3 at 2 h and 48 h post-exposure, respectively. Further understanding the diverse TEP genes and their functions in invertebrate animal vectors will not only expand our knowledge in regard to this ancient family of immune proteins, but also offer the opportunity to identify novel molecular targets that could aid in the efforts to develop control methods to reduce schistosomiasis transmission.","misc","christiaan"

Typically, directional switching information propagation across the whole group obeys a linear dispersion law. However, conventional dynamic collective motion models, such as the Vicsek model and the Couzin model did not take into account ultrafast directional synchronous motions. In the present paper, a multiparticle model is proposed based on inertial spin self-propel action, which can provide adequate description of such group motion. By considering both spin mechanism and collision avoidance, the proposed self-propelled particle spin model can nicely describe collective motion with fast directional switching. By analyzing the order parameter of the group-velocity synchronization, a mechanism of group decision making is revealed, which is based on the difference between two clusters of divergent leaders, showing a transition from the compromising phase (i.e., following the group average) to the preferred phase (i.e., aligning to a leader cluster). The finding provides new insight to the decision-making process of followers when they face with divergent leaders in group motion.","misc","christiaan"

"1547",35968100,"The humidity level matters during the desiccation of Norway spruce somatic embryos.","In Norway spruce, as in many other conifers, the germination capacity of somatic embryos is strongly influenced by the desiccation phase inserted after maturation. The intensity of drying during desiccation eminently affected the formation of emblings (i.e., seedlings developed from somatic embryos). Compared to non-desiccated embryos, the germination capacity of embryos desiccated at 100% relative humidity was about three times higher, but the reduction of relative humidity to 95 and 90% had a negative effect on the subsequent embryo development. The water loss observed in these embryos did not lead to an increase in lipid peroxidation, as shown by malondialdehyde levels. Another metabolic pathway in plants that mediates a response to abiotic stresses is directed toward the biosynthesis of polyamines (PAs). The activities of PA biosynthetic enzymes increased steadily in embryos during desiccation at 100% relative humidity, whereas they decreased at lower humidity. The total content of free PAs in the embryos gradually decreased throughout desiccation. The increase in free putrescine (Put) and perchloric acid-insoluble Put conjugates was observed in embryos desiccated at lower humidity. These changes were accompanied to some extent by the transcription of the genes for the PA biosynthesis enzymes. Desiccation at 100% relative humidity increased the activity of the cell wall-modifying enzymes β-1,3-glucanases and chitinases; the activities of these enzymes were also significantly suppressed at reduced humidity. The same pattern was observed in the transcription of some β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase genes.

However, this is not the case under visible light, where it is necessary to combine titanium dioxide with other photosensitising nanomaterials. Unfortunately, most of the strategies aimed in this direction are chemically non-facile, energy-intensive, economically expensive, and not suitable for large-scale production. We herein describe a straightforward solvent-free approach for accessing visible-light-activated titanium-dioxide-based photocatalysts via the mechanochemical grinding of Degussa P25 with a second solid partner. Upon comparing several solid-material benchmarks, P25-graphene oxide is the best combination. The resulting material showed efficient performance for the adsorption and photodegradation of different dye pollutants, namely methylene blue, malachite green, Congo red, and methyl orange. The recorded performance was nearly comparable to that reached using sol-gel materials, with the ultimate advantage of being more sustainable and industrially scalable. The recyclability can be improved through a porous-bead configuration using biomass waste chitosan hydrogel, an approach that can further fulfill the requirement for more sustainable photocatalyst designs.","misc","christiaan"

His testicular ultrasound showed multiple echogenic calcifications through the right testicle consistent with microlithiasis. Biopsy of the retroperitoneal lesion revealed a mixed germ cell tumor of testicular origin composed of embryonal carcinoma and teratoma. The patient received four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin, followed by retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) and radical right testicular orchiectomy.

Both are muscular pain conditions along the spine, they have a preponderance in women, they may occur spontaneously or follow a trivial traumatic incident, and they both have a high risk of chronicity. The affected muscles are tender with tender points. EMG indicates diffuse hyperactivity and abnormal activation pattern, and motor control of the affected muscles and adjacent muscle groups is discoordinated. These shared features suggest analogous pathophysiology involving the neuromotor control of affected and adjacent muscle groups in the cervical and lumbar regions, respectively. As recently suggested for the whiplash disease, we suggest the term spinal dyssynergia for this specific pattern of pathology. This suggestion provides a new perspective for the understanding of these diseases by placing their cause within the central nervous system and not in the spine or spinal musculature. This perspective warrants further clinical, neurophysiological, and neuropharmacological studies of this 'family' of common yet poorly understood clinical muscular pain conditions along the spine.","misc","christiaan"

A behavioral and event-related potential study.","Color, as one of the most critical visual factors influencing consumer decisions, has been widely used in e-commerce marketing. However, the effects of product-background saturation combination on consumers' willingness to purchase products with different heaviness attributes (e.g., heaviness-positive products or heaviness-negative products) have not been conclusively determined. The current study demonstrated the effects of product-background saturation combination on product heaviness perception and its downstream consequences. Based on behavioral method, study 1 showed that a patch of color placed in a pale background (the saturation of the background is lower than the saturation of the color patch) was perceived as visually heavier than that in a colorful background (the saturation of the background is higher than the saturation of the color patch). Study 2 applied event-related potentials (ERPs) method to explore the underlying neural mechanisms of how the interactions between the presentation modes and the product types affect consumer decisions. Behaviorally, compared to the colorful background, the pale background would lead to a higher purchase rate for the heaviness-positive products, whereas the opposite results were found for the heaviness-negative products. Furthermore, for both the heaviness-positive and heaviness-negative products, a shorter reaction time would be observed in the pale background condition than in the colorful background condition. Neurophysiologically, the pale background would result in smaller N2 component and larger P3 component compared to the colorful background for the heaviness-positive products, while the reverse held for the heaviness-negative products. Smaller N2 component implies decreased perceptual conflicts and larger P3 component implies increased decision confidence, suggesting that e-retailers should present heaviness-positive products with pale backgrounds and heaviness-negative products with colorful backgrounds.","misc","christiaan"

Molecular biomarkers for gefitinib metabolism-related lncRNAs have not yet been elucidated. Here, we downloaded relevant genes and matched them to relevant lncRNAs. We then used univariate, LASSO, and multivariate regression to screen for significant genes to construct prognostic models. We investigated TME and drug sensitivity by risk score data. All lncRNAs with differential expression were selected for GO/KEGG analysis. Imvigor210 cohort was used to validate the value of the prognostic model.

"1541",35974595,"Boundary chaos.","Scrambling in many-body quantum systems causes initially local observables to spread uniformly over the whole available Hilbert space under unitary dynamics, which in lattice systems causes exponential suppression of dynamical correlation functions with system size. Here, we present a perturbed free quantum circuit model, in which ergodicity is induced by an impurity interaction placed on the system's boundary, that allows for demonstrating the underlying mechanism. This is achieved by mapping dynamical correlation functions of local operators acting at the boundary to a partition function with complex weights defined on a two-dimensional lattice with a helical topology. We evaluate this partition function in terms of transfer matrices, which allow for numerically treating system sizes far beyond what is accessible by exact diagonalization and whose spectral properties determine the asymptotic scaling of correlations. Combining analytical arguments with numerical results, we show that for impurities which remain unitary under partial transpose correlations are exponentially suppressed with system size in a particular scaling limit. In contrast, for generic impurities or generic locations of the local operators, correlations show persistent revivals with a period given by the system size.","misc","christiaan"
"968",35967515,"A comprehensive in silico exploration of the impacts of missense variants on two different conformations of human pirin protein.","Pirin, a member of the cupin superfamily, is an iron-binding non-heme protein. It acts as a coregulator of several transcription factors, especially the members of NFκB transcription factor family. Based on the redox state of its iron cofactor, it can assume two different conformations and thereby act as a redox sensor inside the nucleus. Previous studies suggested that pirin may be associated with cancer, inflammatory diseases as well as COVID-19 severities. Hence, it is important to explore the pathogenicity of its missense variants. In this study, we used a number of in silico tools to investigate the effects of missense variants of pirin on its structure, stability, metal cofactor binding affinity and interactions with partner proteins. In addition, we used protein dynamics simulation to elucidate the effects of selected variants on its dynamics. Furthermore, we calculated the frequencies of haplotypes containing pirin missense variants across five major super-populations (African, Admixed American, East Asian, European and South Asian). Among a total of 153 missense variants of pirin, 45 were uniformly predicted to be pathogenic. Of these, seven variants can be considered for further experimental studies. Variants R59P and L116P were predicted to significantly destabilize and damage pirin structure, substantially reduce its affinity to its binding partners and alter pirin residue fluctuation profile via changing the flexibility of several key residues. Additionally, variants R59Q, F78V, G98D, V151D and L220P were found to impact pirin structure and function in multiple ways. As no haplotype was identified to be harboring more than one missense variant, further interrogation of the individual effects of these seven missense variants is highly recommended. Pirin is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes and can play an important role in inflammatory responses. The variants predicted to be pathogenic in this study may thus contribute to a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of various inflammatory diseases. Future studies should be focused on clarifying if any of these variants can be used as disease biomarkers.

"1443",35969084,"Determining Intestinal Permeability using Lucifer Yellow in an Apical-Out Enteroid Model.","Enteroids are an emerging research tool in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). They are traditionally grown in the basolateral-out (BO) conformation, where the apical surface of the epithelial cell faces the inner lumen. In this model, access to the luminal surface of enteroids for treatment and experimentation is challenging, which limits the ability to study host-pathogen interactions. To circumvent this, a neonatal apical-out (AO) model for necrotizing enterocolitis was created. Since intestinal epithelial cell permeability changes are pathognomonic for NEC, this protocol outlines using lucifer yellow (LY) as a marker of paracellular permeability. LY traverses the intestinal epithelial barrier via all three major paracellular pathways: pore, leak, and unrestricted. Using LY in an AO model allows for a broader study of permeability in NEC. Following IRB approval and parental consent, surgical samples of intestinal tissue were collected from human preterm neonates. Intestinal stem cells were harvested via crypt isolation and used to grow enteroids. Enteroids were grown to maturity and then transformed AO or left in BO conformation. These were either not treated (control) or were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subjected to hypoxic conditions for the induction of in vitro NEC. LY was used to assess for permeability. Immunofluorescent staining of the apical protein zonula occludens-1 and basolateral protein β-catenin confirmed AO conformation. Both AO and BO enteroids treated with LPS and hypoxia demonstrated significantly increased paracellular permeability compared to controls. Both AO and BO enteroids showed increased uptake of LY into the lumen of the treated enteroids compared to controls. The utilization of LY in an AO enteroid model allows for the investigation of all three major pathways of paracellular permeability. It additionally allows for the investigation of host-pathogen interactions and how this may affect permeability compared to the BO enteroid model.","misc","christiaan"

In order to deepen the understanding of the structure of the STC gut microbiota and the relationship between the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, we first used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to evaluate the gut microbiota in 30 STC patients and 30 healthy subjects. The α-diversity of the STC group was changed to a certain degree, and the β-diversity was significantly different, which indicated that the composition of the gut microbiota of STC patients was inconsistent with healthy subjects. Among them, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Desulfovibrionaceae, and Ruminiclostridium were significantly upregulated, while Subdoligranulum was significantly downregulated. The metabolomics showed that different metabolites between the STC and the control group were involved in the process of bile acids and lipid metabolism, including taurocholate, taurochenodeoxycholate, taurine, deoxycholic acid, cyclohexylsulfamate, cholic acid, chenodeoxycholate, arachidonic acid, and 4-pyridoxic acid. We found that the colon histomorphology of STC patients was significantly disrupted, and TGR5 and FXR were significantly downregulated. The differences in metabolites were related to changes in the abundance of specific bacteria and patients' intestinal dysfunction. Analysis of the fecal genomics and metabolomics enabled separation of the STC from controls based on random forest model prediction [STC vs. control (14 gut microbiota and metabolite biomarkers)-Sensitivity: 1, Specificity: 0.877].

In this study we used 14 microsatellite loci to survey the genetic structure of 332 Juniperus squamata plants along elevation gradient from two sites in the Hengduan Mountains. We found that the genetic structure (single, clonal, mosaic) of J. squamata shrubs is affected by differences in elevational gradients of only 150 m. Shrubs in the mid-elevation plots rarely have a clonal or mosaic structure compared to shrubs in lower- or higher-elevation plots. Human activity can significantly affect genetic structure, as well as reproductive strategy and genetic diversity. Sub-populations at mid-elevations had the highest yield of seed cones, lower levels of asexual reproduction and higher levels of genetic diversity. This may be due to the trade-off between elevational stress and anthropogenic disturbance at mid-elevation since there is greater elevational stress at higher-elevations and greater intensity of anthropogenic disturbance at lower-elevations. Our findings provide new insights into the finer scale genetic structure of alpine shrubs, which may improve the conservation and management of shrublands, a major vegetation type on the Hengduan Mountains and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.","misc","christiaan"

Here we mapped at single-cell resolution the spatial distribution of quiescent and proliferative human ILCs within the vascular versus tissue compartment. For this purpose, we employed MISTRG humanized mice as an in-vivo model to study human ILCs. We uncovered subset-specific differences in the proliferative status between vascular and tissue ILCs within lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. We also identified CD117-CRTH2-CD45RA+ ILCs in the spleen that were highly proliferative and expressed the transcription factor TCF-1. These proliferative ILCs were present during the neonatal period in human blood and emerged early during population of the human ILC compartment in MISTRG mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Single-cell RNA-sequencing combined with intravascular cell labeling suggested that proliferative ILCs actively migrated from the local vasculature into the spleen tissue. Collectively, our comprehensive map reveals the proliferative topography of human ILCs, linking cell migration and spatial compartmentalization with cell division.","misc","christiaan"

We aimed to stratify HCC risk by non-invasive fibrosis index-based risk model. Of 1589 patients, 1363 (85.8%) patients achieved sustained virological response (SVR). Patients with SVR had 1, 3, 5 and 10-year cumulative HCC incidence rates of 0.55%, 1.87%, 3.48% and 8.35%, respectively. A Cox proportional hazards model revealed that non-SVR (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-3.12, p = 0.008), diabetes mellitus (aHR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.25-3.55, p = 0.005), and fibrosis (FIB)-4 at the end of follow-up (EOF; aHR: 5.60, 95% CI: 2.97-10.57, p < 0.0001) were independent predictors of HCC. Risk score models based on the three predictors were developed to predict HCC according to aHR. In model 1, the 10-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 43.35% in patients at high risk (score 9-10), 25.48% in those at intermediate risk (score 6-8), and 4.06% in those at low risk (score 3-5) of HCC. In model 2, the 10-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 39.64% in patients at high risk (at least two risk predictors), 19.12% in those at intermediate risk (with one risk predictor), and 2.52% in those at low risk (without any risk predictors) of HCC.

Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a marker of proliferative capacity and inflammatory responsiveness but the impact of LTL on the prognosis in AS remains elusive. The aim of this study was to analyse the association of LTL with inflammatory markers and prognosis of pts undergoing TAVR. LTL was analysed using quantitative real-time PCR in 285 consecutive pts (median age 82 years) undergoing TAVR and correlated with 18-month all-cause mortality. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in pts with the longest LTL (P = 0.017), paralleled by increased procalcitonin (PCT) serum levels (P = 0.0006). This inflammatory reaction was accompanied by increased myeloid cells in the highest LTL tertile, mainly a rise in circulating neutrophils (P = 0.0025) and monocytes (P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed LTL (HR 2.6, 95%CI 1.4-5.1,  P= 0.004) and PCT levels (HR 4.3, 95%CI 1.7-11.0, P = 0.003) as independent predictors of mortality.

However, the underlying mechanism of circRNA in OA progression remains unclear. The study aims to reveal the mechanism of circ_0128846 regulating OA. Human chondrocytes (C28/I2 cells) were treated with interleukin-1β (IL-1β) to mimic an OA cell model. The expression levels of circ_0128846, miR-940 and protein tyrosine phosphatase 12 (PTPN12) were detected by qRT-PCR. Protein expression was checked by Western blotting. Cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis were analyzed by a cell counting kit-8 assay, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-6 was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The binding relationship between miR-940 and circ_0128846 or PTPN12 was identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Circ_0128846 and PTPN12 expression were significantly upregulated, whereas miR-940 was downregulated in the cartilage tissues of OA patients and IL-1β-treated C28/I2 cells compared with controls. IL-1β treatment inhibited C28/I2 cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis and the production of inflammatory factors, TNF-α and IL-6; however, these effects were partly reversed after circ_0128846 depletion. In terms of mechanism, circ_0128846 acted as a miR-940 sponge, and miR-940 combined with PTPN12. Also, circ_0128846 depletion partly ameliorated IL-1β-induced C28/I2 cell disorders through miR-940. PTPN12 overexpression also partly relieved miR-940-mediated effects in IL-1β-treated C28/I2 cells. Further, circ_0128846 induced PTPN12 expression by interacting with miR-940.

Effective vaccines for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus exist; however, vaccination rates among EMS professionals remain largely unknown. Consequently, we sought to document vaccination rates of EMS professionals and identify predictors of vaccination uptake. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of North Carolina EMS professionals after the COVID-19 vaccines were widely available. The survey assessed vaccination status as well as beliefs regarding COVID-19 illness and vaccine effectiveness. Prediction of vaccine uptake was modeled using logistic regression. A total of 860 EMS professionals completed the survey, of whom 74.7% reported receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. Most respondents believed that COVID-19 is a serious threat to the population, that they are personally at higher risk of infection, that vaccine side effects are outweighed by illness prevention, and the vaccine is safe and effective. Despite this, only 18.7% supported mandatory vaccination for EMS professionals. Statistically significant differences were observed between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness, recall of employer vaccine recommendation, perceived risk of infection, degree of threat to the population, and trust in government to take actions to limit the spread of disease. Unvaccinated respondents cited reasons such as belief in personal health and natural immunity as protectors against infection, concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness, inadequate vaccine knowledge, and lack of an employer mandate for declining the vaccine. Predictors of vaccination included belief in vaccine safety (odds ratio [OR] 5.5, P=<0.001) and effectiveness (OR 4.6, P=<0.001); importance of vaccination to protect patients (OR 15.5, P=<0.001); perceived personal risk of infection (OR 1.8, P=0.04); previous receipt of influenza vaccine (OR 2.5, P=0.003); and sufficient knowledge to make an informed decision about vaccination (OR 2.4, P=0.024).

"2058",35979429,"Unraveling Origin, History, Genetics, and Strategies for Accelerated Domestication and Diversification of Food Legumes.","Domestication is a dynamic and ongoing process of transforming wild species into cultivated species by selecting desirable agricultural plant features to meet human needs such as taste, yield, storage, and cultivation practices. Human plant domestication began in the Fertile Crescent around 12,000 years ago and spread throughout the world, including China, Mesoamerica, the Andes and Near Oceania, Sub-Saharan Africa, and eastern North America. Indus valley civilizations have played a great role in the domestication of grain legumes. Crops, such as pigeon pea, black gram, green gram, lablab bean, moth bean, and horse gram, originated in the Indian subcontinent, and Neolithic archaeological records indicate that these crops were first domesticated by early civilizations in the region. The domestication and evolution of wild ancestors into today's elite cultivars are important contributors to global food supply and agricultural crop improvement. In addition, food legumes contribute to food security by protecting human health and minimize climate change impacts. During the domestication process, legume crop species have undergone a severe genetic diversity loss, and only a very narrow range of variability is retained in the cultivars. Further reduction in genetic diversity occurred during seed dispersal and movement across the continents. In general, only a few traits, such as shattering resistance, seed dormancy loss, stem growth behavior, flowering-maturity period, and yield traits, have prominence in the domestication process across the species. Thus, identification and knowledge of domestication responsive loci were often useful in accelerating new species' domestication. The genes and metabolic pathways responsible for the significant alterations that occurred as an outcome of domestication might aid in the quick domestication of novel crops. Further, recent advances in omics sciences, gene-editing technologies, and functional analysis will accelerate the domestication and crop improvement of new crop species without losing much genetic diversity. In this review, we have discussed about the origin, center of diversity, and seed movement of major food legumes, which will be useful in the exploration and utilization of genetic diversity in crop improvement. Further, we have discussed about the major genes/QTLs associated with the domestication syndrome in pulse crops and the future strategies to improve the food legume crops.","misc","christiaan"

After 2 months with no new COVID-19 cases in Shenzhen, on August 14, 2020, a supermarket employee living in the Luohu district of Shenzhen was tested positive in a nearby city. She has no any symptoms and signs, with unremarkable laboratory testing and radiological image, so she was soon diagnosed as asymptomatic COVID-19 positive case. Rapid contact tracing revealed that three of her relatives in Shenzhen were infected with COVID-19 and all of them were diagnosed as asymptomatic COVID-19 positive cases. To ensure residents' safety, Luohu hospital group (LHG) mounted a rapid organized response focusing on four measures: local environment management and residents' health monitoring, guidance for resumption of work, education and psychological counseling, and management of patients with fever in outpatient clinics. The LHG being structured as a people-centered, integrated organization responded to residents' medical and psychological needs rapidly, provided 6-hour results for COVID-19 testing, and recleared the city of COVID-19, as evidenced by the processing of 459,381 community samples within 15 days, with universally negative results beyond the originally identified case and her three close relatives. A quick and effective response from local organization to a new comeback COVID-19 positive case after clearance for a certain time is necessary in terms of ensuring the physical and psychological health of residents, as well as guarantying normal social work.","misc","christiaan"

Despite continuous experimental and computational investigations, several aspects of these materials remain challenging, including conductivity dimensionality and how it maps onto Li pathways. In this work, we use a refined version of our finite temperature molecular dynamics shooting approach, originally designed to enhance Li hopping probability. We perform a comparative analysis of ion mobility in both materials, focused on many-particle effects. Therein, we identify main [010] diffusion channels, as well as means of interchannel couplings, in the form of Li lateral [001] hopping, which markedly impact the overall mobility efficiency as measured by self-diffusion coefficients. This clearly supports the need of many-particle approaches for reliable mechanistic investigations and for battery materials benchmarking due to the complex nature of the diffusion and transport mechanisms.","misc","christiaan"

However, data are limited for the effect of comorbid AF on procedural and clinical outcomes of acute basilar artery occlusion (ABAO) after MT. This study aimed to investigate the effect of atrial fibrillation on outcomes after MT and long-term ischemic recurrence in patients with ABAO. We performed a registered study of the Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion Study (BASILAR, which is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, http://www.chictr.org.cn; ChiCTR1800014759) from January 2014 to May 2019, which included 647 patients who underwent MT for ABAO, 136 of whom had comorbid AF. Prospectively defined baseline characteristics, procedural outcomes, and clinical outcomes were reported and compared. On multivariate analysis, AF predicted a shorter puncture-to-recanalization time, higher first-pass effect rate, and lower incidence of angioplasty and/or stenting (p < 0.01). AF had no effect on intracranial hemorrhage incidence [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.093; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.451-2.652], 90-day functional outcomes (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.915; 95% CI, 0.588-1.424), or mortality (aOR, 0.851; 95% CI, 0.491-1.475) after MT. The main findings were robust in the subgroup and 1-year follow-up analyses. Comorbid AF was the remaining predictor of ischemic recurrence (aOR, 4.076; 95% CI, 1.137-14.612). The study revealed no significant difference in the safety and efficacy of MT for ABAO regardless of whether patients had comorbid AF. However, a higher proportion of patients with AF experienced ischemic recurrence within 1 year after MT.","misc","christiaan"

This cross-sectional analytical survey included data on older (≥ 60 years) HF patients obtained from the electronic medical record databases of secondary- and tertiary-care hospitals. The medication profiles of patients were assessed to examine whether they were prescribed any PIMHF after an HF diagnosis. For PIMHF detection, the HF-specific criteria, including 2014 St Vincent criteria, 2019 Beers criteria, and 2021 Thailand criteria were applied. The prevalence of PIMHF use was expressed as percentages. The associated factors were identified using a binary logistic regression analysis, expressed as the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). A total of 2,639 patients were included in the study. Thirty-two PIMHF were found to have been prescribed to these patients. The prevalence of PIMHF use identified by the ST Vincent criteria, the Beers criteria, the Thailand criteria, and the three combined criteria was 23.76%, 19.67%, 21.18%, and 25.16%, respectively. The factors associated with PIMHF use were secondary-care hospital (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.26-1.87), HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (aOR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.38-2.38), hypertension (HTN) (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.02-1.51), diabetes mellitus (DM) (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.10-1.75), chronic pulmonary diseases (CPD) (aOR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.56-2.80), and connective tissue diseases (CTD) (aOR = 5.10, 95% CI: 2.20-11.83).

When composite resin is illuminated with a wavelength of approximately 398 ± 5 nm, certain fluorescent components make the composite resin appear brighter than the tooth structure. Any fluorescence-inducing light source with the appropriate wavelength can be used for this method. Optimally, this technique is used without additional natural or artificial lighting. The application of FIT can be used for diagnostic purposes, for example, dental charts, and additionally for the complete and minimally invasive removal of composite resin restorations, bracket debonding, and trauma splint removal. The assessment of volumetric changes after composite removal can be provided by overlapping pre- and postoperative scans and subsequent calculation using suitable software.","misc","christiaan"

Certain honey types have well-established bioactive properties including antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. In addition, honey contains non-digestible carbohydrates in the form of oligosaccharides, and there is increasing evidence from in vitro, animal, and pilot human studies that some kinds of honey have prebiotic activity. Prebiotics are foods or compounds, such as non-digestible carbohydrates, that are used to promote specific, favorable changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota plays a critical role in human health and well-being, with disturbances to the balance of these organisms linked to gut inflammation and the development and progression of numerous conditions, such as colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and mental health issues. Consequently, there is increasing interest in manipulating the gut microbiota to a more favorable balance as a way of improving health by dietary means. Current research suggests that certain kinds of honey can reduce the presence of infection-causing bacteria in the gut including Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Clostridiodes difficile, while simultaneously stimulating the growth of potentially beneficial species, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. In this paper, we review the current and growing evidence that shows the prebiotic potential of honey to promote healthy gut function, regulate the microbial communities in the gut, and reduce infection and inflammation. We outline gaps in knowledge and explore the potential of honey as a viable option to promote or re-engineer a healthy gut microbiome.","misc","christiaan"

Gentian violet (GV) has recently been found to have anti-tumor properties with promising clinical applications. However, its anti-tumor effect and the underlying functional mechanisms in HCC have not been investigated. In this study, we found that GV induced ferroptosis and apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner in vitro, and significantly attenuated the growth of HCC in vivo. Both ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostain-1 (Fer-1) and apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-KFM (Z-VAD) partially attenuated GV-induced growth-inhibitory effects, while combined treatment of Fer-1 and Z-VAD completely abolished GV's activities. Increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected after GV treatment. Interestingly, GV elevated the expression levels of both p53 and its negative regulator MDM2, which was dependent on the expression of the dehydrogenase/reductase protein Hep27. Simultaneously silencing both the MDM2 and p53 genes by siRNAs abolished ROS production and partially rescued the cell death induced by GV treatment. Our data demonstrate a GV-Hep27-MDM2-p53 signaling cascade that regulates ferroptosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, our findings provide insights into understanding the anti-tumor function of GV and present the basis of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HCC.","misc","christiaan"

The formation of perihematomal edema (PHE) is presumed to reflect acute BBB permeability following ICH. We aimed to assess the association between cSVD burden and PHE formation in patients with spontaneous ICH. We selected patients with spontaneous ICH who underwent 3T MRI imaging within 21 days after symptom onset from a prospective observational multicenter cohort study. We rated markers of cSVD (white matter hyperintensities, enlarged perivascular spaces, lacunes and cerebral microbleeds) and calculated the composite score as a measure of the total cSVD burden. Perihematomal edema formation was measured using the edema extension distance (EED). We assessed the association between the cSVD burden and the EED using a multivariable linear regression model adjusting for age, (log-transformed) ICH volume, ICH location (lobar vs. non-lobar), and interval between symptom onset and MRI. We included 85 patients (mean age 63.5 years, 75.3% male). Median interval between symptom onset and MRI imaging was 6 days (IQR 1-19). Median ICH volume was 17.0 mL (IQR 1.4-88.6), and mean EED was 0.54 cm (SD 0.17). We found no association between the total cSVD burden and EED (B = -0.003, 95% CI -0.003-0.03, p = 0.83), nor for any of the individual radiological cSVD markers. We found no association between the cSVD burden and PHE formation. This implies that mechanisms other than BBB dysfunction are involved in the pathophysiology of PHE.","misc","christiaan"

To date, no more than 60 patients with choroidal involvement have been reported. A 37-year-old Chinese woman experienced decreased visual acuity bilaterally, accompanied by increasing periorbital swelling and severe conjunctival chemosis. Decreased breath sounds in both bases were detected via auscultation, as well as pitting edema in both ankles. SLE and lupus nephritis were diagnosed based on serositis, renal disorder, leukopenia and positive anti-Smith and anti-nuclear antibodies. Lupus choroidopathy was diagnosed based on ocular presentation and imaging. The patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids, spironolactone, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and intravenous immunoglobulin. After 4 wk of hospitalization, the patient was discharged. Indocyanine green angiography showed no leakage from choroidal vessels, and ocular coherence tomography detected low amounts of subretinal fluid right before discharge. The patient was prescribed oral methylprednisolone, HCQ, and MMF. Two months after the first visit, ophthalmological examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/20 bilaterally, and SLE disease activity was well controlled; her symptoms disappeared completely.

Classical karyotyping and three FISH assays were done in 153 girls and women previously diagnosed with TS in four university hospitals. The 45,X cell line fraction was determined for each method and correlated with the major phenotypic signs. Classical karyotyping identified 45,X/46,XX mosaicism in 77/153 subjects (50%), 45,X monosomy in 52/153 (34%), and other karyotypes in 24/153 (16%). FISH from lymphocytes verified 45,X in 47/52 original cases, whereas 4/52 had 45,X/46,XX and 1/52 45,X/47,XYY mosaicism. The 45,X cell line fraction was higher in FISH from lymphocytes compared to classical karyotyping (median 86.4% versus 70.0%; p<0.001), while there was no difference for FISH from buccal or rear-tongue smear cells. The mean 45,X cell line fraction was more abundant in patients with several of the characteristic phenotypic signs compared to patients without them (p<0.01), but the predictive power was insufficient. FISH analysis confirmed the findings of classical karyotyping; only a few 45,X monosomy cases were reclassified as mosaics.

The FtsZ protein is a bacterial tubulin homolog required for cell division in most species, including E. coli. Several agents that block cell division have been shown to mislocalise FtsZ, including the bacteriophage λ-encoded Kil peptide, resulting in defective cell division and a filamentous phenotype, making FtsZ an attractive target for antimicrobials. In this study, we have used an in vitro meningitis model system for studying the effect of bacteriophages on FtsZ using fluorescent E. coli EV36/FtsZ-mCherry and K12/FtsZ-mNeon strains. We show localisation of FtsZ to the bacterial cell midbody as a single ring during normal growth conditions, and mislocalisation of FtsZ producing filamentous multi-ringed bacterial cells upon addition of the known inhibitor Kil peptide. We also show that when bacteriophages K1F-GFP and T7-mCherry were applied to their respective host strains, these phages can inhibit FtsZ and block bacterial cell division leading to a filamentous multi-ringed phenotype, potentially delaying lysis and increasing progeny number. This occurs in the exponential growth phase, as actively dividing hosts are needed. We present that ZapA protein is needed for phage inhibition by showing a phenotype recovery with a ZapA mutant strain, and we show that FtsI protein is also mislocalised upon phage infection. Finally, we show that the T7 peptide gp0.4 is responsible for the inhibition of FtsZ in K12 strains by observing a phenotype recovery with a T7Δ0.4 mutant.","misc","christiaan"

Clinical data and histological material of nine patients suffering from S. aureus spondylodiscitis were retrospectively collected at a single center. To mirror the clinical findings experimentally, we developed a novel porcine ex vivo model mimicking acute S. aureus spondylodiscitis and assessed the interaction between S. aureus and IVD cells within their native environment. In addition, the inflammatory features underlying this interaction were assessed in primary human IVD cells. Finally, mirroring the clinical findings, we assessed primary human neutrophils for their ability to respond to secreted inflammatory modulators of IVD cells upon the S. aureus challenge. Acute S. aureus spondylodiscitis in patients was characterized by tissue necrosis and neutrophil infiltration. Additionally, the presence of empty IVD cells' lacunae was observed. This was mirrored in the ex vivo porcine model, where S. aureus induced extensive IVD cell death, leading to empty lacunae. Concomitant engagement of the apoptotic and pyroptotic cell death pathways was observed in primary human IVD cells, resulting in cytokine release. Among the released cytokines, functionally intact neutrophil-priming as well as broad pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines which are known for their involvement in IVD degeneration were found. In patients as well as ex vivo in a novel porcine model, S. aureus IVD infection caused IVD cell death, resulting in empty lacunae, which was accompanied by the release of inflammatory markers and recruitment of neutrophils. These findings offer valuable insights into the important role of inflammatory IVD cell death during spondylodiscitis and potential future therapeutic approaches.","misc","christiaan"

On a flat KBr surface, the two-dimensional solvation islands start nucleating at the step edges and grow with time and with increasing relative pressure. Solvation islands of water wet the terraces; however, solvation islands of methanol and ethanol are localized around the step edges and do not wet the terraces. Two processes are observed on nanostructured KBr surfaces: the movement of the atomic steps and the formation of solvation islands. The first process takes place at comparatively lower pressures at around 1% relative pressure, whereas the second process starts at higher pressures at around 25% relative pressure and above. Furthermore, the second process takes place only after the complete relocation of the step edges and thereby formation of a nearly flat surface. This implies that there is a competition between the restructuring of the atomic steps and solvation layer formation, as both processes require solvated ions. Unlike in the case of a flat surface, solvation islands of alcohols wet the restructured surface due to a higher density of low-coordination sites.","misc","christiaan"

However, the exact cell type contributing to metastasis remains elusive. Using a Rb1 L/L /Trp53 L/L mouse model, we identify the NCAMhiCD44lo/- subpopulation as the SCLC metastasizing cell (SMC), which is progressively transitioned from the non-metastasizing NCAMloCD44hi cell (non-SMC). Integrative chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling studies reveal the important role of the SWI/SNF complex, and knockout of its central component, Brg1, significantly inhibits such phenotypic transition and metastasis. Mechanistically, TAZ is silenced by the SWI/SNF complex during SCLC malignant progression, and its knockdown promotes SMC transition and metastasis. Importantly, ectopic TAZ expression reversely drives SMC-to-non-SMC transition and alleviates metastasis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses identify SMC as the dominant subpopulation in human SCLC metastasis, and immunostaining data show a positive correlation between TAZ and patient prognosis. These data uncover high SCLC plasticity and identify TAZ as the key molecular switch in orchestrating SCLC phenotypic transition and metastasis.","misc","christiaan"

In all cases, the distance from the anal verge to the anastomotic site was within 15 cm. Overall, AL was observed in 16 patients (8.0%). Univariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for AL included diabetes (P = 0.068), tumor location (P = 0.049), level of anastomosis (P = 0.002), number of linear stapler firings (P = 0.007), and intraoperative colonoscopy (IOCS; P = 0.069). Multivariate analysis revealed that the level of anastomosis (P = 0.029) and IOCS (P = 0.039) were significant and independent risk factors for AL. One of the 107 patients undergoing ALT without IOCS and 3 of the 94 patients undergoing ALT with IOCS were proven to be positive for air leak. However, these four patients underwent additional suturing intraoperatively and developed no AL following surgery. This study identified the level of anastomosis and ALT with IOCS as predictors for AL.

However, in the literature on foreign language (FL) writing, there is a dearth of studies that compare the effects of teacher feedback and automated feedback on both cognitive and psychological aspects of FL writing. To fill this gap, the current study compared the effects of teacher feedback and automated feedback on both revision quality and writing proficiency development (i.e., the cognitive aspects), and perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the feedback (i.e., the psychological aspects) in English writing among English learners as an FL (EFLs) in China. It also investigated students' perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the two types of feedback. The study adopted a mixed-methods design. The quantitative method collected the data through (1) a pre-test and a post-test, which measured the participants' English writing proficiency development; (2) a writing task, which received either teacher feedback or automated feedback; and (3) a close-ended questionnaire, which examined students' perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the feedback. The qualitative method collected the data through an open-ended questionnaire, which examined the participants' perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of teacher feedback or automated feedback depending on the type of feedback they received. Chinese university EFLs in two English classes (n = 35 in each class) taught by the same English teacher participated in the study: one class received teacher feedback while the other received automated feedback using Pigaiwang. While the students in the two classes did not differ significantly on the pre-test of students' writing proficiency, students who received teacher feedback scored significantly higher on revision than those who received automated feedback. Students in the teacher feedback class also had significantly higher ratings on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the feedback than those in the automated feedback class. However, students in the automated feedback class obtained significantly higher scores on the post-test of the writing proficiency. The qualitative results identified three themes of strengths and two themes of weaknesses for the teacher feedback and the automated feedback, respectively. The results suggest that while teacher feedback has a more positive effect on the psychological aspect of FL writing, automated feedback may be more effective in developing FL writing proficiency in the long run.","misc","christiaan"

Cross-sectional data from sixty-four participants with cSVD and mild cognitive impairment were analyzed. Myelin was assessed via MRI multi-echo gradient and spin echo T2 relaxation sequence, indexed as myelin water fraction (MWF). Gait was assessed using an electronic walkway. Hierarchical regression models adjusting for total intracranial volume, age, sex, Mini-Mental State Examination, and body mass index were conducted to determine associations between MWF and gait parameters. Significant models were further adjusted for white matter hyperintensities. Sixty-four participants were included (mean [SD], age = 75.2y [5.4], 62.5% female). In adjusted models, lower MWF in the cingulum (p = 0.015), superior longitudinal fasciculus (p = 0.034), posterior corona radiata (p = 0.039), and body of the corpus callosum (p = 0.040) was associated with higher cycle time variability. White matter hyperintensities weakened these associations. Lower myelin in specific white matter tracts may contribute to higher gait variability, increasing the overall risk of mobility impairment.","misc","christiaan"

The challenge remaining is establishing standardized protocols for its assessment in various extracellular compartments and identifying pathological situations associated with an increase in CGRP. We performed longitudinal measurements of CGRP plasma levels in 30 volunteers with the diagnosis of episodic migraine with and without aura under controlled circumstances during an induced migraine attack under a hypoxic challenge. Blood samples were collected from a cubital vein and CGRP plasma levels measured using ELISA. CGRP levels varied significantly between the subjects at baseline (15.48-1,889.31 pg/ml) but were neither associated with socio-demographic data nor with headache/migraine frequency or intensity collected before hypoxic exposure. CGRP levels during hypoxia fluctuated around baseline and increased with prolonged hypoxia but did not differ significantly in subjects with migraine or headache compared to those without. However, subjects experiencing migraine without aura showed significantly higher levels than those with aura. Ictal CGRP levels were increased in females, in subjects with a negative family history regarding headaches, in those older than 30 years of age or with a recent headache attack before the experiment (p < 0.05). CGRP plasma levels seem to be highly variable even at baseline in migraine patients and increased during hypoxic challenge and migraine attacks. This is the first in human longitudinal measurement of peripheral CGRP levels during induced migraine attacks using a highly standardized protocol.","misc","christiaan"

Severe complications of RBL include pain, hemorrhage and sepsis. Flexible endoscopic RBL (ERBL) is now more commonly used in RBL therapy but few severe complications have been reported. Here we report on a case of massive bleeding after ERBL. A 31-year-old female was admitted to the department of gastroenterology with a chief complaint of discontinuous hematochezia for 2 years. No previous history, accompanying diseases or drug use was reported. Physical examination and colonoscopy showed grade II internal hemorrhoids. The patient received ERBL therapy. Five days after ligation, the patient presented with mild hematochezia. On days 7 and 9 after ligation, she presented with a large amount of rectal bleeding, dizziness and weakness. Emergency colonoscopy revealed active bleeding and an ulcer in the anal wound. The patient received two sessions of hemoclipping on days 7 and 9 to treat the bleeding. No further bleeding was reported up to day 15 and she was discharged home. Although the hemorrhoid prolapse disappeared after ERBL, she was dissatisfied with the subsequent complications. ERBL therapy is an effective treatment for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids with satisfactory short and long-term recovery. Pain and anal bleeding are the most frequently reported postoperative complications. Coagulation disorders complicate the increased risk of bleeding. Although rarely reported, our case reminds us that those patients without coagulation disorders are also at risk of massive life-threatening bleeding and need strict follow-up after ligation.","misc","christiaan"

Many studies focused on vitamin D as a stroke risk factor, but only a few focused on its serum level as a predictor of stroke initial clinical severity and recovery with inconsistent results. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between serum vitamin D levels and stroke clinical severity at admission and functional independence and disability at discharge in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective cohort study of adult ischemic stroke patients who had their vitamin D tested and admitted within 7 days of exhibiting stroke symptoms at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Based on vitamin D level, the patients were categorized into normal [25(OH)D serum level ≥ 75 nmol/L], insufficient [25(OH)D serum level is 50-75 nmol/L], and deficient [25(OH)D serum level ≤ 50 nmol/L]. The primary outcome was to assess the vitamin D serum level of ischemic stroke patients' clinical severity at admission and functional independence at discharge. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was used to assess the clinical severity, whereas the modified Rankin scale (mRS) was used to assess functional independence and disability. The study included 294 stroke patients, out of 774, who were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean age of the participants was 68.2 ± 13.4 years, and 49.3% were male. The patients' distribution among the three groups based on their vitamin D levels is: normal (n = 35, 11.9%), insufficient (n = 66, 22.5%), and deficient (n = 196, 65.6%). After adjusting for potential covariates, regression analysis found a significant inverse relationship of NIHSS based on 25(OH)D serum level (beta coefficient: -0.04, SE: 0.01, p = 0.003). Patients with deficient serum vitamin D level also had significantly higher odds of worse functional independence in mRS score [OR: 2.41, 95%CI: (1.13-5.16), p = 0.023] when compared to participants with normal vitamin D level. Low vitamin D levels were associated with higher severity of stroke at admission and poor functional independence and disability at discharge in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Further randomized clinical and interventional studies are required to confirm our findings.","misc","christiaan"

CAPRIN1 encodes a ubiquitous protein that regulates the transport and translation of neuronal mRNAs critical for synaptic plasticity, as well as mRNAs encoding proteins important for cell proliferation and migration in multiple cell types. We identified twelve cases with loss-of-function CAPRIN1 variants, and a neurodevelopmental phenotype characterized by language impairment/speech delay (100%), Intellectual Disability (ID; 83%), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; 82%), and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; 67%). Affected individuals also had respiratory problems (50%), limb/skeletal anomalies (50%), developmental delay (42%) feeding difficulties (33%), seizures (33%) and ophthalmologic problems (33%). In patient-derived lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, we showed a monoallelic expression of the wild-type allele, and a reduction of the transcript and protein compatible with a half dose. To further study pathogenic mechanisms, we generated CAPRIN1+/- human iPSCs (hiPSCs) via CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis and differentiated them into neuronal progenitor cells and cortical neurons. CAPRIN1 loss caused reduced neuronal processes, overall disruption of the neuronal organization, and an increased neuronal degeneration. We also observed an alteration of mRNA translation in CAPRIN1+/- neurons, compatible with its suggested function as translational inhibitor. CAPRIN1+/- neurons also showed an impaired calcium signalling and increased oxidative stress, two mechanisms that may directly affect neuronal networks development, maintenance, and function. According to what was previously observed in the mouse model, measurements of activity in CAPRIN1+/- neurons via micro-electrode arrays (MEA) indicated lower spike rates and bursts, with an overall reduced activity. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CAPRIN1 haploinsufficiency causes a novel autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder and identify morphological and functional alterations associated with this disorder in human neuronal models.","misc","christiaan"

The vector-borne disease preparedness in two regions, Beijing and the Netherlands, were compared in order understand their similarities and differences leading to learning points on this complex topic. A comparative study was performed using interviews with vector-borne disease experts from Beijing and the Netherlands and supplemented by literature. In Beijing, syndromic surveillance is a priority for the identification of suspected vector-borne disease cases. In the Netherlands, the main surveillance emphasis is on laboratory confirmed vector-borne disease cases. Vector-surveillance at potential points of entry and other high-risk locations is performed according to the International Health Regulation (2005) in both settings. Beijing controls invasive and native mosquitos, which is not the case in the Netherlands. In Beijing, vector surveillance is performed to measure mosquito density around hospitals, this is not observed in the Dutch setting. Health risks posed by ticks are a priority in urban areas in the Netherlands, and the public is educated in self-protection. In contrast, ticks seem to occur less often in Beijing's urban areas. The vector-borne disease context framework allowed us to compare the vector-borne disease preparedness between Beijing and the Netherlands, despite differences in vector-borne disease challenges. We can learn valuable lessons concerning surveillance and early detection of emerging vector-borne diseases when comparing the preparedness between different regions.","misc","christiaan"

Flexible and inextensible active ring polymers navigate smoothly through the disordered media. In contrast, semiflexible rings undergo transient trapping inside the pore space; the degree of trapping is inversely correlated with the increase in activity. We discover that flexible rings swell while inextensible and semiflexible rings monotonically shrink upon increasing the activity.

Time-trend, monocentric study on MSM living with HIV who underwent HPV test at anal site from 2015 to 2019. Anal swabs were processed by multiplex real-time PCR to detect HPV genotypes. Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess linear trend in HPV prevalence over time and logistic regression models to estimate risk factors. Of the 1352 MSM living with HIV, 168 (12%) were not infected by any HPV genotypes and only 6 were infected with a maximum of 6 genotypes; prevalence of HR-HPV genotypes or those included in the 9-valent vaccine remained stable over time. At multivariable analysis, the risk of carrying at least one genotype classified as HR or included in Gardasil-9 was associated with younger age (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) for age< 30 vs > 45 (95% confidence interval) 2.714 (1.484-4.961), p=0.001 and 1.868 (1.141-3.060), p<0.013, respectively) and a history of gonorrhea (aOR 2.118 (1.100-4.078), p=0.025 and 1.785 (1.056-3.018), p=0.031, respectively).

The present study aimed to model hydrological strength (HS) to show the spatial difference and account for the degree and direction of hydrological alteration of Indian moribund deltaic wetland in three phases e.g. (1) phase I (1988-1997), (2) phase II (1998-2007) and phase III (2008-2017). Three key hydrological parameters, such as Water Presence Frequency (WPF), water depth, and hydro-period were considered for hydrological strength modelling using two ensemble Machine Learning (ML) techniques (Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost). Image algebra was employed for phasal change detection. Hydrological strength models show that around 75% of the wetland area was lost in-between phases I to III and the loss was found more intensive in moderate and weak HS zones. Existing wetland shows a clear spatial difference of HS between wetland core and periphery and river linked and delinked or not linked wetlands. Regarding the suitability of the ML models, both are acceptable, however, the XGBoost outperformed in reference to applied 15 statistical validation techniques and field evidence. HS models based on change detection clarified that more than 22% and 55% of the weak HS zone in phases II and III respectively were turned into non-wetland. The degree of alteration revealed that about 40% of wetland areas experienced a negative alteration during phases I to II, and this proportion increased to 63% in between phases II to III. Since the study figured out the spatial nature of HS, degree and direction of alteration at a spatial scale, these findings would be instrumental for adopting rational planning towards wetland conservation and restoration.","misc","christiaan"

To explore the characteristics its stalk strength, we conducted physiological, metabolic and transcriptomic analyses of J2416 and its parents Jing24 (J24) and 5237. At the kernel dent stage, the stalk rind penetrometer strength of J2416 was significantly higher than those of its two parents in multiple environments. The rind thickness, sclerenchyma tissue thickness, and cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents of J2416 were significantly higher than those of its parents. Based on the significant differences between J2416 and 5237, we detected metabolites and gene transcripts showing differences in abundance between these two materials. A total of 212 (68.60%) metabolites and 2287 (43.34%) genes were up-regulated in J2416 compared with 5237. The phenylpropanoid and glycan synthesis/metabolism pathways were enriched in metabolites and genes that were up-regulated in J2416.

Certain active dimers show both chemotactic and antichemotactic behavior, depending on the strength of the activity. Our coarse-grained Fokker-Planck approach yields an effective potential, which we use to construct a nonequilibrium phase diagram that classifies the dimers according to their tactic behavior.

A wide-ranging search in PubMed databases, Thomson Reuters and Scopus was done and different aspects of chemical properties of sulfur mustard, its mechanism of action and effects on eyes, clinical finding, diagnostic evaluation, initiate actions, pharmaceutical and surgical interventions was reported. Sulfur mustard can alkylate DNA and RNA strands and break down structures of protein and lipid of cell membrane. This may impair cell energy production, and leads to cell death. Exposure to sulfur mustard, therefore, causes such problems for organs, including irreversible damage to the eyes. Understanding the mechanism of the sulfur mustard effect and the early training in prevention injuries will cause fewer complications and damage to organs, including the eyes. Washing the eyes with tap water or eyewash solutions, using mydriatic drops, anti- inflammatory drugs, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and antibiotics may help to the management of poisoning.

In addition, stress-related illnesses cost $190 billion in healthcare costs per year. Currently, contact devices are required to extract most of an individual's physiological information, which can be uncomfortable for users and can cause discomfort. However, in recent years, remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology is gaining interest, which enables contactless monitoring of the blood volume pulse signal using a regular camera, and ultimately can provide the same physiological information as a contact device. In this paper, we propose a benchmark comparison using a new multimodal database consisting of 56 subjects where each subject was submitted to three different tasks. Each subject wore a wearable device capable of extracting photoplethysmography signals and was filmed to allow simultaneous rPPG signal extraction. Several experiments were conducted, including a comparison between information from contact and remote signals and stress state recognition. Results have shown that in this dataset, rPPG signals were capable of dealing with motion artifacts better than contact PPG sensors and overall had better quality if compared to the signals from the contact sensor.

To fully understand the importance of this post-transcriptional modification in HCC, a thorough investigation that combines different patterns of RNA methylation is urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the regulators of the three most common types of RNA methylation: m6A, N1-methyladenosine (m1A) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C). Based on the genomic and proteomic data, we constructed a classifier consisting of seven RNA methylation regulators. This classifier performed well and robustly predicted the prognosis of HCC patients. By analysis using this classifier, we found that the primary bile acid biosynthesis pathway was mostly downregulated in high-risk HCC patients. Furthermore, we found that the gene expression patterns regulated by several bile acids were similar to those regulated by some well-defined anti-tumor compounds, indicating that bile acid metabolism plays a crucial role in the progression of HCC, and the related metabolites can be used as the potential agents for HCC treatments.

In Spring 2020, we invited confirmed COVID-19 cases and their household members to four visits, where we collected nasopharyngeal and serum samples over 28 days after index case onset. We calculated SAR based on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAb) and assessed the persistence of NAb and IgG antibodies (Ab) against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleoprotein. SAR was 45% (39/87), including 35 symptomatic secondary cases. During the initial 28-day follow-up, 62% (80/129) of participants developed NAb. Of those that seroconverted, 90% (63/70), 85% (63/74), and 78% (45/58) still had NAb to early B-lineage SARS-CoV-2 3, 6, and 12 months after the onset of the index case. Anti-spike IgG Ab persisted in 100% (69/69), 97% (72/74), and 93% (55/59) of seroconverted participants after 3, 6, and 12 months, while anti-nucleoprotein IgG Ab levels waned faster, persisting in 99% (68/69), 78% (58/74), and 55% (39/71) of participants, respectively. Following detection of a COVID-19 case in a household, other members had a high risk of becoming infected.

The shape dependent diffusional properties have been incorporated into BCD using Perrin's factor and compared with analytical results of a one-component ellipsoidal system. We have investigated pathways to enhance the diffusivity of spheroids in the binary mixture by manipulating the phase behavior of the system through varying the fraction of spheres in the binary mixture. We show that at low volume fraction the spherical particles have a higher diffusion coefficient than the ellipsoids due to the higher friction coefficient. However, at a higher volume fraction, we show that the diffusion coefficient of the ellipsoids increases irrespective of the aspect ratio due to the anisotropic shape.","misc","christiaan"

Histamine released from activated and degranulating skin mast cells is held to play a key role in the pathogenesis of CIndU, but evidence to support this has, as of yet, not been reviewed systematically or in detail. We aim to characterize the role and relevance of histamine in CIndU. We systematically searched 3 electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Embase) for studies that reported increased serum or skin histamine concentration (direct evidence) or in vitro or ex vivo histamine release (indirect evidence) following trigger exposure. An initial total of 3,882 articles was narrowed down to 107 relevant studies of which 52 were in cold urticaria, 19 in cholinergic urticaria, 14 in heat urticaria, 10 in contact urticaria, 7 each in solar urticaria and vibratory angioedema, 4 each in symptomatic dermographism and aquagenic urticaria, and 3 in delayed pressure urticaria. The results of our review support that histamine has a key pathogenic role in the pathogenesis of all CIndUs, but it is not the sole mediator as evidenced by the often poor relationship between the level of histamine and severity of symptoms and the variable clinical efficacy of H1-antihistamines. Histamine released from skin mast cells is a key driver of the development of signs and symptoms and a promising therapeutic target in CIndU.","misc","christiaan"

Participants were asked whether they had ever experienced a blow to the head that caused a concussion, and medication adherence was measured by asking participants whether they had taken their psychiatric medication yesterday. The data were analyzed using univariate and multivariable logistic regressions. Results showed that more than half of the sample had a concussion history (61.9%), and homeless adults with a concussion history had higher odds of non-adherence to psychiatric medications compared with those who reported no concussion history [OR = 2.13 (95% CI = 1.08, 4.18)]. Findings suggest that medication non-adherence is associated with incurred concussions.

This could help build reasonable strategies when understanding the diagnostics, prognostics, and biological relevance of immune cells under alternative metabolic burdens. Search and analysis were conducted on published peer-reviewed papers on immune cell metabolism of a single pathogen infection from the four known types (bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses). Out of the 131 selected papers based on the PIC algorithm (pathogen type/immune cell/carbohydrate metabolism), 30 explored immune cell metabolic changes in well-studied bacterial infections, 17 were on fungal infections of known medical importance, and 12 and 57 were on parasitic and viral infections, respectively. While carbohydrate metabolism in immune cells is signaled by glycolytic shift during a bacterial or viral infection, it is widely evident that effector surface proteins are expressed on the surface of parasites and fungi to modulate metabolism in these cells. Carbohydrate metabolism in immune cells can be categorized according to the pathogen or the disease type. Accordingly, this classification can be used to adopt new strategies in disease diagnosis and treatment.","misc","christiaan"

In this study, we aimed to examine the occurrence rate of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among DM patients and its incidence rate between different treatments. This cohort study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 1997 and 2013 to evaluate the primary outcomes of the preventive role of sulfonylureas or biguanides in the development of RA. We used the Chi-square test for categorical variables and Cox proportional hazard regression and log-rank test to explore the time for development of RA in DM patients. Logistic regression was adopted to estimate the odds ratio of RA in different dosages of medication exposure. Our cohort study included 94,141 DM cases. The risk of RA development of non-sulfonylureas/biguanides users among the DM group in each analysis was set as the reference, and the adjusted hazard ratio of RA in DM patients who were using sulfonylureas or biguanides was 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.60-0.90). Within 1 year before the index date, compared with no-biguanides users, patients with more than 180 days of prescription of biguanides had a significantly lower RA risk. Similarly, the significantly lower risk of RA was still observed in DM patients who had more than 365 days of prescription of sulfonylurea within 2 or 3 years before the index date of first RA visit (all p < 0.05). Our data suggest that sulfonylureas or biguanides are associated with a lower rate of RA development in patients with DM; the effect of biguanides appeared more rapid than that of sulfonylureas, but the sulfonylureas might have a longer effect on lowering RA development incidence.","misc","christiaan"

To investigate potential differences, we performed a retrospective, comparative cohort analysis of adult patients undergoing deceased donor single or double LT in North America (NA) or Europe between January 2006 and December 2016. Data up to April 2019 were abstracted from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Thoracic Organ Registry.

In 3,115 well-matched pairs, though 30-day survival was similar between groups (NA 96.2% vs Europe 95.4%, p = 0.116), 5-year survival was significantly higher in European patients (NA 60.1% vs Europe 70.3%, p < 0.001). This survival difference persisted in a sensitivity analysis excluding Canadian patients. Prior observations suggest that these disparities are at least partly related to better access to care via universal healthcare models prevalent in Europe.

More than 44% of the US alfalfa is produced under rainfed conditions, although it requires a relatively high amount of water compared to major field crops. Considering that yield and production of rainfed alfalfa have been relatively stagnant in the country for decades, there is a need to better understand the magnitude of yield loss due to water limitation and how far from yield potential current yields are. In this context, the main objective of this study was to estimate the current yield gap of rainfed alfalfa in the US. We collected 10 year (2009-2018) county-level government-reported yield and weather data from 393 counties within 12 major US rainfed alfalfa producing states and delineated alfalfa growing season using probabilistic approaches based on temperature thresholds for crop development. We then calculated county-level growing season rainfall (GSR), which was plotted against county-level yield to determine attainable yield (Ya) using frontier function analysis, and water-limited potential yield (Yw) using boundary function analysis. Average and potential water use efficiencies (WUE) were estimated, and associated yield gap referring to attainable (YGa) or water-limited yields (YGw) were calculated. Finally, we used conditional inference trees (CIT) to identify major weather-related yield-limiting factors to alfalfa forage yield. The frontier model predicted a mean Ya of 9.6 ± 1.5 Mg ha-1 and an associated optimum GSR of 670 mm, resulting in a mean YGa of 34%. The boundary function suggested a mean Yw of 15.3 ± 3 Mg ha-1 at the mean GSR of 672 ± 153 mm, resulting in a mean yield gap of 58%. The potential alfalfa WUE was 30 kg ha-1 mm-1 with associated minimum water losses of 24% of mean GSR, which was three times greater than the mean WUE of 10 kg ha-1 mm-1. The CIT suggested that GSR and minimum temperature in the season were the main yield-limiting weather variables in rainfed alfalfa production in the US. Our study also revealed that alfalfa was only limited by water availability in 21% of the environments. Thus, future research on management practices to narrow yield gaps at current levels of water supply is necessary.","misc","christiaan"

There are few studies regarding STEMI admissions and outcomes during the ongoing pandemic after the initial lockdown. We aimed to study STEMI admissions and in-hospital outcomes after the COVID-19 lockdown period. Methods A retrospective single-center study was conducted, collecting data for all consecutive STEMI admissions from March 9th, (the first COVID-19 case) until April 30th, the corresponding period of 2020 total lockdown, for years 2019 and 2021. The control period was considered the year 2019 [pre-pandemic (PP)] and the study period was in 2021 [ongoing pandemic (OP)]. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to compare all-STEMI admissions, invasive procedures, and risk ratio (RR) 95% CI to compare the mortality and complications rate between the study and control period. Results The study included 217 STEMI patients admitted in 2019, and 234 patients during the 2021 period. The overall-STEMI admissions IRR is in a similar range during the 2021 OP compared to the 2019 PP period IRR=1.07 (95%CI 0.90-1.28). Similar invasive procedures were observed during OP compared to PP period, respectively for coronary-angiography IRR= 1.07; (0.87-1.31), for all-PCI [1.12 (0.92-1.35)], and primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) [1.09 (0.89-1.34)]. The STEMI death rate during OP compared to PP period was similar (7.3 vs. 7.4%), RR=1.01 (0.53-1.96), and a non-significant lower primary-PCI-death rate (4.0 vs 4.8%), RR= 0.83 (0.30-2.3)]. Conclusions After the initial reduction of admissions and invasive procedures in STEMI patients during the 2020 lockdown period and the increase of all-STEMI mortality, the number of hospitalizations, invasive procedures, and mortality returned to a similar range during OP compared to the PP period despite a highly incident ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","misc","christiaan"

A retrospective review of six patients undergoing surgical procedures for metastatic uLMS over seven years was conducted at a single center. All patients were reviewed for their primary malignancy and characteristics of bone metastasis during follow-up. Clinical presentation of bone metastasis, modality, and the type of treatment related to musculoskeletal involvement were also analyzed. The visual analog pain scale (VAS) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status scale were used pre-and postoperatively to evaluate the patient-reported outcome. Four patients had solitary bone metastases, whereas multiple bone metastases were diagnosed in two. Of those who had solitary bone metastasis, all of them were treated with wide resection. One of the two patients with multiple bone metastases was also treated with wide resection, and the other was treated with intralesional curettage. Four patients died from primary disease, and two were alive without evidence of disease recurrence. The median survival time following a diagnosis of bone metastasis was 15.0 months (95% CI, 0.6 to 29.4 months). The mean VAS scores for all six patients improved. However, the improvement in ECOG performance status was seen in only four patients. Although the prognosis of uLMS patients with bone metastasis seems poor, wide resection of the solitary bone metastasis may help prolong the overall survival. Performing orthopedic surgeries for the bone metastasis from uLMS in case of intractable pain after palliative radiotherapy, impending or pathological fracture, or solitary disease has been shown to decrease the pain significantly and improve the performance status in the majority.

A Probit model with instrumental variables method was used to analyze the influence of farming experience on urban residents' entrepreneurial decisions, while a mediating effect model was used to test its channels of action. The results show that: (1) farming experience can contribute to the entrepreneurial decision of urban residents relative to those without experience in farming. To overcome possible endogeneity issues, an Eprobit model based on the estimation of instrumental variables was used for testing. (2) Heterogeneity tests based on age, city type, and physical capital found that this effect was more significant in urban residents with non-capital cities, middle-aged groups, and high-material capital. (3) Farming experience indirectly drives entrepreneurial decisions through the mediating role of promoting positive personality traits, such as optimism and mutual aid consciousness. Therefore, the farming experience has a positive effect on urban residents' entrepreneurial decisions and helps to understand the deeper influence of micro-individual characteristics on entrepreneurial decisions in the urbanization process.","misc","christiaan"

However, its unwanted occurrence in any (eco)system can affect nontarget bacterial communities, which may also impair the performance of the natural or artificially established bioremediation system. The problem could be minimized by optimization of operational parameters via modeling of multifactorial tests. To this end, we used a Box-Behnken design in response surface methodology (RSM) to generate the experimental layout for testing the effect of the CFX biodegradation for four important parameters, that is, temperature (°C), pH, inoculum size (v/v %), and CFX concentration (mg L-1). For inoculation, a consortium of three bacterial strains, namely, Acenitobacter lwofii ACRH76, Bacillus pumilus C2A1, and Mesorihizobium sp. HN3 was used to degrade 26 mg L-1 of CFX. We found maximum degradation of CFX (98.97%; initial concentration of 25 mg L-1) at 2% inoculum size, 7 pH, and 35 °C of temperature in 16 days. However, minimum degradation of CFX (48%; initial concentration of 50 mg L-1) was found at pH 6, temperature 30 °C, and inoculum size 1%. Among different tested parameters, pH appears to be the main limiting factor for CFX degradation. Independent factors attributed 89.37% of variation toward CFX degradation as revealed by the value of the determination coefficient, that is, R 2 = 0.8937. These results were used to formulate a mathematical model in which the computational data strongly correlated with the experimental results. This study showcases the importance of parameter optimization via RSM for any bioremediation studies particularly for antibiotics in an economical, harmless, and eco-friendly manner.","misc","christiaan"

Biogen ONE™, an ongoing Canadian support program, facilitates access to DMF for patients with MS and maintains a database for the purposes of service provision. These data were utilized to assess adherence, persistence, discontinuations, and other outcomes between 2013 and 2021. This non-interventional, retrospective study examined real-world use of DMF prescribed to patients with MS in Canada who were enrolled in the program and received their first dose between April 1, 2013, and June 30, 2021. Follow-up visits and laboratory monitoring occurred based on local standards and per the Canadian product monograph. For adherence and persistence assessments, patients must have had DMF dispensed by specialty pharmacies. Data were collected at patient enrollment, program exit, and throughout the duration of the program. The primary objective was to assess treatment adherence rates to DMF. Secondary objectives included treatment persistence rates, reasons for discontinuation, absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs), and patient characteristics throughout the duration of the program. Overall, 12,608 DMF patients from the program were included between April 1, 2013, and June 30, 2021. At enrollment, mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 40.6 (10.7) years and mean (SD) Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was 2.2 (1.4). DMF was initiated as first-line DMT in 48.8% of patients. Of patients assessed (n = 6,848), 90.4% were adherent to DMF (based on medication possession ratio [MPR] ≥ 80%). Adherence (mean MPR) was marginally greater in DMT-naïve than switch patients, and in younger (< 40 years) than older (≥ 40 years) patients (both p < 0.001). Overall persistence on DMF at 24 months was 57.0%. Greater proportions of DMT-naïve patients persisted on DMF versus switch patients at all time points assessed. Persistence rates were comparable between female and male patients for up to 24 months, and between younger (< 40 years) and older (≥ 40 years) patients for up to 36 months. Older patients were more likely to discontinue for reasons related to lymphocytes (≥ 40 years, 16.1% vs. < 40 years, 6.1%) while efficacy reasons were reported with greater frequency in younger patients (≥ 40 years, 10.5% vs. < 40 years, 16.0%). Discontinuations due to gastrointestinal and flushing events occurred most frequently during the first month of treatment and decreased thereafter. Mean ALC decreased during the first year on treatment and subsequently plateaued. Over successive years, changes were observed in characteristics of patients starting on DMF, including decreases in EDSS score, age, and time since diagnosis. The proportion of DMT-naïve patients increased over the years (2013-2014, 26%-27%; 2018-2021, 62%-67%). High adherence was found in patients on DMF treatment within the Biogen support program with access to specialty pharmacies. The evolution of the patient population throughout the years suggests a shift towards earlier treatment. These real-world data may support the value of a support program in optimizing the management of patients on DMF treatment. Support programs provide personalized treatment monitoring, which can help minimize early discontinuations and improve adherence to treatment.","misc","christiaan"

The greenbug Schizaphis graminum is an important cereal aphid worldwide. However, the secreted effectors of S. graminum are still uncharacterized. Here, 76 salivary proteins were identified from the watery saliva of S. graminum using transcriptome and proteome analyses. Among them, a putative salivary effector Sg2204 was significantly up-regulated during aphid feeding stages, and transient overexpression of Sg2204 in Nicotiana benthamiana inhibited cell death induced by BAX or INF1. Delivering Sg2204 into wheat via the type III secretion system of Pseudomonas fluorescens EtAnH suppressed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI)-associated callose deposition. The transcript levels of jasmonic acid (JA)- and salicylic acid (SA)-associated defence genes of wheat were significantly down-regulated, and the contents of both JA and SA were also significantly decreased after delivery of Sg2204 into wheat leaves. Additionally, feeding on wheat expressing Sg2204 significantly increased the weight and fecundity of S. graminum and promoted aphid phloem feeding. Sg2204 was efficiently silenced via spray-based application of the nanocarrier-mediated transdermal dsRNA delivery system. Moreover, Sg2204-silenced aphids induced a stronger wheat defence response and resulted in negative impacts on aphid feeding behaviour, survival and fecundity. Silencing of Sg2204 homologues from four aphid species using nanocarrier-delivered dsRNA also significantly reduced aphid performance on host plants. Thus, our study characterized the salivary effector Sg2204 of S. graminum involved in promoting host susceptibility by suppressing wheat defence, which can also be regarded as a promising RNAi target for aphid control.","misc","christiaan"

Moreover, the DA receptor genotypes are also related to horse behaviors. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the DA concentration variations of horse plasma by breed, age, sex, or genotype of its receptor. The horses were divided by breed into Thoroughbred (n = 13), Pony (n = 9), Warmblood (n = 4), and Haflinger (n = 5). The age variable was divided into three different groups: post-pubertal (2-5 years, n = 6), adult (6-13 years, n = 19), and aged horses (15-24 years, n = 6). The sex variable was divided into geldings (n = 8) and mares (n = 23). Approximately 10 mL of blood was collected, and an ELISA kit was used to measure the plasma concentration of DA. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to identify the genetic variation in the DA D4 receptor gene (DRD4). SPSS statistical software was used for statistical analysis. The DA concentrations in geldings were significantly lower than those in mares. There was no significant difference in DA concentrations among breed and age groups. Horses with the GG and GA genotypes had significantly higher plasma concentrations of DA compared to horses with the AA genotype for the G292A gene. Briefly, the plasma concentration of DA varied depending on the sex and genotype of G292A. These factors should be considered when the concentration of DA is used as a biomarker for the behavioral characteristics of horses. In conclusion, the DA concentration or DRD4 genotype of horse plasma has the potential to be used as a biomarker that can predict the behavioral characteristics of horses.","misc","christiaan"
"1640",35974876,"Fatty Acid Taste Receptor GPR120 Activation by Arachidonic Acid, Eicosapentaenoic Acid, and Docosahexaenoic Acid in Chickens.","It has been reported that the supplementation of chicken diet with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) affects the qualities of eggs and meat. Previous studies have shown that a functional fatty acid taste receptor, G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120), is broadly expressed in chicken oral and gastrointestinal tissues, and chickens have a gustatory perception of oleic acid, which is a chicken GPR120 agonist. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of chicken GPR120 in response to PUFAs in chicken diets. Ca2+ imaging analyses revealed that chicken GPR120 was activated by AA, EPA, and DHA in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that chickens can detect PUFAs via GPR120 in the oral and gastrointestinal tissues, implying that chickens have a gustatory perception of PUFAs.","misc","christiaan"

Diagnosis is currently based on collective findings from clinical examinations and computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, the latter of which show a fat density mass and possible surrounding organ involvement. Surgical resection is the main therapeutic strategy. The efficacy and safety of further therapeutic choices, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are still controversial. A 61-year-old man presented with complaint of a large left inguinal mass that had appeared suddenly, after a slight exertion. Ultrasonography revealed an omental inguinal hernia. During further clinical examination, an enormous palpable abdominal mass, continuing from the left inguinal location, was observed. CT revealed a giant RLPS, with remarkable mass effect and wide visceral dislocation. After multidisciplinary consultation, surgical intervention was performed. Subsequent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy were precluded by the mass' large size and retroperitoneal localization, features typically associated with non-response to these types of treatment. Instead, the patient underwent conservative treatment via radical surgical excision. After 1 year, his clinical condition remained good, with no radiological signs of recurrence. Conservative treatment via surgery resulted in a successful outcome for a large RLPS.","misc","christiaan"
"658",35978515,"Inflammasome Complexes: Crucial mediators in osteoimmunology and bone diseases.","Inflammasome complexes play a vital role in the inflammatory response by producing interleukin-1β and inducing cell pyroptosis. During the long period of co-evolution of the skeletal and immune systems, inflammasome complexes bridged the bone-immune interaction, which is crucial for osteoimmunology and bone diseases. Additionally, the M1/M2 ratio, the Th17/Treg ratio, and osteoclastogenesis are regulated by inflammasomes in multiple bone diseases. Particularly, based on different disease features and inflammasome functions, osteoclastogenesis can be categorized as site-specific inflammation-related and system inflammation-related and is probably the most well-studied process in osteoimmunology. Research on inflammasomes includes multiple bone diseases and clinical therapies, including bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of jaws, periodontitis, arthritis, metal particle-induced osteolysis, bone fracture, osseointegration, and bone marrow inflammatory diseases. Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease is directly related to NLRP3 mutation. This review consolidates our basic knowledge about inflammasome structure and highlights the main cell subtypes and their functions in the bone-immune interaction. Furthermore, we discuss the inflammasome complexes and relevant bone diseases to provide insights for future studies on inflammasomes, osteoimmunology, and bone diseases.","misc","christiaan"

This study investigated the effects of different broiler ages and feed ingredients on AID and SID of AA in corn and soybean meal (SBM). Four hundred and eighty (age = 7 d; initial body weight [BW] = 173.4 ± 12.65 g) and 192 (age = 18 d; initial BW = 772.2 ± 62.13 g) birds were allocated to three dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design with eight replicate cages per treatment. Two diets were formulated based on corn or SBM as the sole source of AA in the diet. A nitrogen-free diet was also formulated to measure basal endogenous losses of AA. Experimental diets were given for 3 and 4 days in Exps. 1 and 2, respectively. An interaction was observed (p < 0.05) between the age of birds and the type of ingredient for the AID of most AA, except for methionine, valine, cysteine (Cys), and tyrosine; however, the effects of age and type of ingredients were diminished in the SID of AA, except for histidine, isoleucine, leucine (Leu), phenylalanine, alanine (Ala), and glutamic acid (Glu). The AID of AA, except for Leu and Cys and the SID of AA, except for Leu, Ala, Glu, and Pro in SBM were greater (p < 0.05) than in corn. As the age of birds increased from 10 to 22 d, digestibility of all AA increased (p < 0.05), regardless of the expression of AA digestibility (i.e., AID and SID). In conclusion, the AID and SID of AA in both corn and SBM increased with increasing age, and the AID and SID of AA in SBM were greater than in corn.","misc","christiaan"

In particular, innate, T- and B-cell specific responses were evaluated over time. Household contacts of COVID-19 cases screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal swab for surveillance purposes were enrolled (T0, n=42). Of these, 28 subjects returned for a follow-up test (T1). The innate response was assessed by detecting a panel of soluble factors by multiplex-technology in plasma samples. Cell-mediated response was evaluated by measuring interferon (IFN)-γ levels by ELISA in plasma harvested from whole-blood stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools, including spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins. The serological response was assessed by quantifying anti-Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD), anti-Nucleocapsid (N), whole virus indirect immunofluorescence, and neutralizing antibodies. At T0, higher levels of plasmatic IFN-α, IL-1ra, MCP-1 and IP-10, and lower levels of IL-1β, IL-9, MIP-1β and RANTES were observed in subjects with positive swab compared to individuals with a negative one (p<0.05). Plasmatic IFN-α was the only cytokine detectable in subjects with positive SARS-CoV-2 swabs with high accuracy for swab score positivity (0.93, p<0.0001). Among subjects with positive swabs, significant negative correlations were found among the RT-PCR cycle threshold values reported for genes S and N and IFN-α or IP-10 levels. At T0, the IFN-γ T-cell specific response was detected in 50% (5/10) of subjects with positive swab, while anti-RBD/anti-N antibodies showed a positivity rate of 10% (1/10). At T1, the IFN-γ T-cell specific response was detected in most of the confirmed-infection subjects (77.8%, 7/9), whereas the serological response was still observed in a minority of them (44.4%, 4/9). Overall, the swab test showed a moderate concordance with the T-cell response (78.6%, k=0.467), and a scarce concordance with the serological one (72.9%, k=0.194). Plasmatic IFN-α and the IFN-γ T-cell specific response appear early even in the absence of seroconversion, and show a greater positivity rate than the serological response in household contacts with positive swab.","misc","christiaan"
"1814",35983691,"Role of Genes in Regulating Host Plants Expansion in Tephritid Fruit Flies (Diptera) and Potential for RNAi-Based Control.","Host plant expansion is an important survival strategy for tephritids as they expand their range. Successful host expansion requires tephritids to adapt to the chemical and nonchemical properties of a novel host fruit, such as fruit color, phenology, and phytochemicals. These plant properties trigger a series of processes in tephritids, with each process having its own genetic basis, which means that various genes are involved in regulating host plant expansion by tephritids. This review summarizes current knowledge on the categories and roles of genes involved in host plant expansion in several important tephritid species, including genes related to chemoreception (olfactory and gustation), vision, digestion, detoxification, development, ribosomal and energy metabolism. Chemoreception- and detoxification- and digestion-related genes are stimulated by volatile chemicals and secondary chemicals of different hosts, respectively, which are involved in the regulation of nervous signal transduction that triggers behavioral, physical, and chemical responses to the novel host fruit. Vision-, nerve-, and development-related genes and metabolism-associated genes are activated in response to nonchemical stimuli from different hosts, such as color and phenology, to regulate a comprehensive adaptation of the extending host for tephritids. The chemical and nonchemical signals of hosts activate ribosomal and energy-related genes that result in the basic regulation of many processes of host expansion, including detoxification and development. These genes do not regulate novel host use individually, but multiple genes regulate multilevel adaptation to novel host fruits via multiple mechanisms. These genes may also be potential target genes for RNAi-based control of tephritid pests.","misc","christiaan"

Aconitine was more toxic than veratrine, with an LD50 of 157 ng/mg compared to 376 ng/mg, on the pyrethroid-susceptible Orlando strain, but only aconitine showed significant resistance in the pyrethroid-resistant Puerto Rico strain (RR = 14.6 in topical application and 8.8 in larval bioassay). When applied in mixtures with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and NP, large synergism values were obtained on the Orlando strain. Aconitine + PBO mixture synergized NP 21.8-fold via topical adult application and 10.2-fold in larval bioassays, whereas veratrine + PBO synergized NP 5.3-fold via topical application and 30.5-fold in larval bioassays. Less synergism of NP was observed on the resistant Puerto Rico strain, with acontine + PBO synergizing NP only 4.1-fold in topical application (8-fold in larval bioassays) and veratrine + PBO synergizing NP 9.5-fold in topical application (13.3-fold in larval bioassays). When alkaloids were applied directly to the mosquito larval nervous system, veratrine was nearly equipotent on both strains, while aconitine was less active on pyrethroid-resistant nerve preparations (no block at 10 μM compared to block at 1 μM on the susceptible strain). The nerve blocking effect of NP was significantly synergized by both compounds on the pyrethroid-susceptible strain by about 10-fold, however only veratrine synergized NP block on the pyrethroid-resistant strain, also showing 10-fold synergism). These results highlight the potential of site II sodium channel activators as insecticides and their ability to synergize pyrethroids, which may extend the commercial lifetime of these chemistries so essential to public health vector control.","misc","christiaan"

Patients were neurologicaly evaluated before and after surgery with systematic neurologic examinations. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) with SSEP and MEP was carried out. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under ROC curve (AUC) were used to identify the diagnostic accuracy of potential recovery. IONM alerting occurred in 12 surgeries (12/68, 17.6%), of which 6 were SSEP alerting, 2 MEP alerting, and 4 combinations of both SSEP and MEP. Among the 12 cases where there was IONM alerting, 3 (25%) had postoperative neurological deficits(PND), whereas one patient had PND without IONM alerting. IONM sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 (95% CI 0.22-0.99) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.74-0.93) respectively. Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 0.25 and 0.98 respectively. The AUC of evoked potential recovery in diagnosing PND was 0.884.

Imaging revealed pseudoarthrosis with multiple rod fractures resulting in an overriding spondyloptosis of T6 on T9. An AR-generated 3D model was useful in the intraoperative localization of rod breaks and other extensively embedded instrumentation. Real-time model thresholding expedited the safe explanation of the defunct system and correction of the spondyloptosis deformity.

Materials and methods This was a prospective study of 100 consecutive brain tumor patients admitted to a Greater London Tertiary Neurosurgical center for surgery between January 2021 and October 2021. All brain tumors were included. All patients have appropriately consented. Blood was tested to detect HIV antibodies and p24 antigen. Outcomes were noted at 30-day postoperative follow-up. Results In 100 patients, there was one case of a known HIV-positive, seronegative patient, and no new diagnosis was made, giving a prevalence of 1%. The mean age of patients included was 61.7 ± 13.3, with 57% female. The patient with HIV suffered a postoperative pseudomonas infection, requiring intensive care, additional surgery, and antibiotics. This resulted in an inpatient stay of 55 days - an increase of 274% compared to patients without HIV. Conclusion Literature regarding the prevalence of HIV in glioma patients is inconclusive, of low quality, and primarily out-of-date. Our literature search found no similar study of rates of HIV in brain tumor patients in the United Kingdom. The incidence of both HIV and brain tumors, particularly glioblastomas, is low.","misc","christiaan"

There is debate as to whether the APOE gene accounts for all genetic variation of the APOE locus. Another question which remains is whether APOE-ε4 carriers have other genetic factors influencing the progression of amyloid positive individuals to AD. We conducted a genome-wide association study in a sample of 5,390 APOE-ε4 homozygous (ε4ε4) individuals (288 cases and 5102 controls) aged 65 or over in the UK Biobank. We found no significant associations of SNPs in the APOE locus with AD in the sample of ε4ε4 individuals. However, we identified a novel genome-wide significant locus associated to AD, mapping to DAB1 (rs112437613, OR = 2.28, CI = 1.73-3.01, p = 5.4 × 10-9). This identification of DAB1 led us to investigate other components of the DAB1-RELN pathway for association. Analysis of the DAB1-RELN pathway indicated that the pathway itself was associated with AD, therefore suggesting an epistatic interaction between the APOE locus and the DAB1-RELN pathway.","misc","christiaan"

Similarly, there is an interest in using CBD, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) or cannabinoid-rich hemp products in the treatment of idiopathic epilepsy in dogs. We aimed to examine a small cohort in a pilot investigation using a CBD and CBDA-rich hemp product for the treatment of refractory epileptic seizures in dogs. Fourteen dogs were examined in a 24-week randomized cross-over study being provided placebo or CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract treatment at 2 mg/kg orally every 12 h for each 12-week arm of the study. Serum chemistry, complete blood counts, serum anti-seizure medication (ASM) concentrations and epileptic seizure frequency were followed over both arms of the cross-over trial. Results demonstrated that besides a mild increase in alkaline phosphatase, there were no alterations observed on routine bloodwork at 2, 6, and 12 weeks during either arm of the study. Epileptic seizure frequency decreased across the population from a mean of 8.0 ± 4.8 during placebo treatment to 5.0 ± 3.6 with CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract (P = 0.02). In addition, epileptic seizure event days over the 12 weeks of CBD/CBDA-rich hemp treatment were 4.1 ± 3.4, which was significantly different than during the 12 weeks of placebo treatment (5.8 ± 3.1; P =0.02). The number of dogs with a 50% reduction in epileptic activity while on treatment were 6/14, whereas 0/14 had reductions of 50% or greater while on the placebo (P = 0.02). No differences were observed in serum zonisamide, phenobarbital or bromide concentrations while on the treatment across groups. Adverse events were minimal, but included somnolence (3/14) and transient increases in ataxia (4/14) during CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract treatment; this was not significantly different from placebo. This further indicates that providing CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract during refractory epilepsy (only partially responsive to ASM), in conjunction with other ASM appears safe. Based on this information, the use of 2 mg/kg every 12 h of a CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract can have benefits in reducing the incidence of epileptic seizures, when used concurrently with other ASMs.","misc","christiaan"

The purpose of the present study was to identify potential pathogenic mutation leading to disease in a Chinese LVNC family. A 3-generation family affected by LVNC was recruited. Clinical assessments were performed on available family members, with clinical examination, ECG, echocardiography and cardiac MRI. The proband (I-2), the proband's daughter (II-1, affected) and mother (III-1, unaffected) were selected for WGS. Sanger sequencing were performed in all of the 4 surviving family members. Combined whole genome sequencing with linkage analysis identified a novel missense mutation in the giant protein obscurin (OBSCN NM_001098623, c.C19063T), as the only plausible disease-causing variant that segregates with disease among the four surviving individuals, with interrogation of the entire genome excluding other potential causes. This c.C19063T missense mutation resulted in p.R6355W in the encoded OBSCN protein. It affected a highly conserved residue in the C terminus of the obscurin-B-like isoform between the PH and STKc domains, which was predicted to affect the function of the protein by different bioinformatics tools. Here we present clinical and genetic evidence implicating the novel R6355W missense mutation in obscurin as the cause of familial LVNC. This expands the spectrum of obscurin's roles in cardiomyopathies. It furthermore highlights that rare obscurin missense variants, currently often ignored or left uninterpreted, should be considered to be relevant for cardiomyopathies and can be identiﬁed by the approach presented here.

However, the development of new strategies is needed to improve clinical efficacy and safety of NK cell-based immunotherapy. NK cell-mediated recognition and lysis of tumor cells are strictly dependent on the expression of ligands for NK cell-activating receptors NKG2D and DNAM-1 on tumor cells. Of note, the PVR/CD155 and Nectin-2/CD112 ligands for DNAM-1 are expressed primarily on solid tumor cells and poorly expressed in normal tissue cells. Here, we generated human NK cells expressing either the full length DNAM-1 receptor or three different DNAM-1-based chimeric receptor that provide the expression of DNAM-1 fused to a costimulatory molecule such as 2B4 and CD3ζ chain. Upon transfection into primary human NK cells isolated from healthy donors, we evaluated the surface expression of DNAM-1 and, as a functional readout, we assessed the extent of degranulation, cytotoxicity and the production of IFNγ and TNFα in response to human leukemic K562 cell line. In addition, we explored the effect of Nutlin-3a, a MDM2-targeting drug able of restoring p53 functions and known to have an immunomodulatory effect, on the degranulation of DNAM-1-engineered NK cells in response to human neuroblastoma (NB) LA-N-5 and SMS-KCNR cell lines. By comparing NK cells transfected with four different plasmid vectors and through blocking experiments, DNAM-1-CD3ζ-engineered NK cells showed the strongest response. Furthermore, both LA-N-5 and SMS-KCNR cells pretreated with Nutlin-3a were significantly more susceptible to DNAM-1-engineered NK cells than NK cells transfected with the empty vector.

Antibiotic stewardship in the community, or smart prescribing as we suggest, should factor in antibiotic efficacy, safety, local resistance rates, and overall cost, in addition to patient-specific factors and disease presentation, to arrive at an appropriate therapy. Here, we discuss some of the challenges, such as patient/parent pressure to prescribe, lack of data or resources for implementation, and a disconnect between guidelines and real-world practice, among others. We have assembled an easy-to-use best practice guide for providers in the outpatient setting who lack the time or resources to develop a plan or consult lengthy guidelines. We provide specific suggestions for antibiotic prescribing that align real-world clinical practice with best practices for antibiotic stewardship for two of the most common bacterial infections seen in the outpatient setting: community-acquired pneumonia and skin and soft-tissue infection.

Although ATK1 was a nuclear protein and ATK5 cytoplasmic prior to nuclear envelop breakdown, at later mitotic stages, the two motors shared similar localization patterns of uniform association with both spindle and phragmoplast MTs. We found that ATK1 and ATK5 were rapidly concentrated toward unified polar foci when cells were under hyperosmotic conditions. Concomitantly, spindle poles became perfectly focused as if there were centrosome-like MT-organizing centers where ATK1 and ATK5 were highly enriched and at which kinetochore fibers pointed. The separation of ATK1/ATK5-highlighted MTs from those of kinetochore fibers suggested that the motors translocated interpolar MTs. Our protein purification and live-cell imaging results showed that ATK1 and ATK5 are associated with each other in vivo. The stress-induced spindle pole convergence was also accompanied by poleward accumulation of the MT nucleator γ-tubulin. These results led to the conclusion that the two Kinesin-14A motors formed oligomeric motor complexes that drove MT translocation toward the spindle pole to establish acentrosomal spindles with convergent poles.","misc","christiaan"

Variable illumination conditions and different occlusion states are some of the essential issues that must be addressed for the accurate detection and localization of citrus in the orchard environment. In this paper, a novel method for the detection and localization of mature citrus using improved You Only Look Once (YOLO) v5s with binocular vision is proposed. First, a new loss function (polarity binary cross-entropy with logit loss) for YOLO v5s is designed to calculate the loss value of class probability and objectness score, so that a large penalty for false and missing detection is applied during the training process. Second, to recover the missing depth information caused by randomly overlapping background participants, Cr-Cb chromatic mapping, the Otsu thresholding algorithm, and morphological processing are successively used to extract the complete shape of the citrus, and the kriging method is applied to obtain the best linear unbiased estimator for the missing depth value. Finally, the citrus spatial position and posture information are obtained according to the camera imaging model and the geometric features of the citrus. The experimental results show that the recall rates of citrus detection under non-uniform illumination conditions, weak illumination, and well illumination are 99.55%, 98.47%, and 98.48%, respectively, approximately 2-9% higher than those of the original YOLO v5s network. The average error of the distance between the citrus fruit and the camera is 3.98 mm, and the average errors of the citrus diameters in the 3D direction are less than 2.75 mm. The average detection time per frame is 78.96 ms. The results indicate that our method can detect and localize citrus fruits in the complex environment of orchards with high accuracy and speed.

Our aim was to correlate the magnitude of the antibody response to vaccination with previous clinical conditions and AEFI. A multicentric comparative study where SARS-CoV-2 spike 1-2 IgG antibodies IgG titers were measured at baseline, 21-28 days after the first and second dose (when applicable) of the following vaccines: BNT162b2 mRNA, mRNA-1273, Gam-COVID-Vac, Coronavac, ChAdOx1-S, Ad5-nCoV and Ad26.COV2. Mixed model and Poisson generalized linear models were performed. We recruited 1867 individuals [52 (SD 16.8) years old, 52% men]. All vaccines enhanced anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgG antibodies over time (p<0.01). The highest increase after the first and second dose was observed in mRNA-1273 (p<0.001). There was an effect of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection; and an interaction of age with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, Gam-COVID-Vac and ChAdOx1-S (p<0.01). There was a negative correlation of Severe or Systemic AEFI (AEs) of naïve SARS-CoV-2 subjects with age and sex (p<0.001); a positive interaction between the delta of antibodies with Gam-COVID-Vac (p=0.002). Coronavac, Gam-COVID-Vac and ChAdOx1-S had less AEs compared to BNT162b (p<0.01). mRNA-1273 had the highest number of AEFIs. The delta of the antibodies showed an association with AEFIs in previously infected individuals (p<0.001). The magnitude of seroconversion is predicted by age, vaccine type and SARS-CoV-2 exposure. AEs are correlated with age, sex, and vaccine type. The delta of the antibody response only correlates with AEs in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

However, development of green processing methods that meet these criteria remains a major research challenge. Here, we harness microbial biofabrication of nanocellulose and draw inspiration from ancient textile techniques to engineer sustainable biotextiles with a circular life cycle. The unique molecular self-organization of microbial nanocellulose (MC) combined with bio-phosphorylation with a lecithin treatment yields a compostable material with superior mechanical and flame-retardant properties. Specifically, treatment of MC with a lecithin-phosphocholine emulsion makes sites available to modulate cellulose cross-linking through hydroxyl, phosphate and methylene groups, increasing the interaction between cellulose chains. The resultant bioleather exhibits enhanced tensile strength and high ductility. Bio-phosphorylation with lecithin also redirects the combustion pathway from levoglucosan production towards the formation of foaming char as an insulating oxygen barrier, for outstanding flame retardance. Controlled color modulation is demonstrated with natural dyes. Life cycle impact assessment reveals that MC bioleather has up to an order of magnitude lower carbon footprint than conventional textiles, and a thousandfold reduction in the carcinogenic impact of leather production. Eliminating the use of hazardous substances, these high performance materials disrupt linear production models and strategically eliminate its toxicity and negative climate impacts, with widespread application in fashion, interiors and construction. Importantly, the biotextile approach developed in this study demonstrates the potential of biofabrication coupled with green chemistry for a circular materials economy.","misc","christiaan"
"1322",35967001,"Alterations in motor modules and their contribution to limitations in force control in the upper extremity after stroke.","The generation of isometric force at the hand can be mediated by activating a few motor modules. Stroke induces alterations in motor modules underlying steady-state isometric force generation in the human upper extremity (UE). However, how the altered motor modules impact task performance (force production) remains unclear as stroke survivors develop and converge to the three-dimensional (3D) target force. Thus, we tested whether stroke-specific motor modules would be activated from the onset of force generation and also examined how alterations in motor modules would induce changes in force representation. During 3D isometric force development, electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded from eight major elbow and shoulder muscles in the paretic arm of 10 chronic hemispheric stroke survivors and both arms of six age-matched control participants. A non-negative matrix factorization algorithm identified motor modules in four different time windows: three exploratory force ramping phases (Ramps 1-3; 0-33%, 33-67%, and 67-100% of target force magnitude, respectively) and the stable force match phase (Hold). Motor module similarity and between-force coupling were examined by calculating the scalar product and Pearson correlation across the phases. To investigate the association between the end-point force representation and the activation of the motor modules, principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate multiple linear regression analyses were applied. In addition, the force components regressed on the activation profiles of motor modules were utilized to model the feasible force direction. Both stroke and control groups developed exploratory isometric forces with a non-linear relationship between EMG and force. During the force matching, only the stroke group showed abnormal between-force coupling in medial-lateral and backward-forward and medial-lateral and downward-upward directions. In each group, the same motor modules, including the abnormal deltoid module in stroke survivors, were expressed from the beginning of force development instead of emerging during the force exploration. The PCA and the multivariate multiple linear regression analyses showed that alterations in motor modules were associated with abnormal between-force coupling and limited feasible force direction after stroke. Overall, these results suggest that alterations in intermuscular coordination contribute to the abnormal end-point force control under isometric conditions in the UE after stroke.","misc","christiaan"
"1525",35974765,"Molecular basis for turnover inefficiencies (misses) during water oxidation in photosystem II.","Photosynthesis stores solar light as chemical energy and efficiency of this process is highly important. The electrons required for CO2 reduction are extracted from water in a reaction driven by light-induced charge separations in the Photosystem II reaction center and catalyzed by the CaMn4O5-cluster. This cyclic process involves five redox intermediates known as the S0-S4 states. In this study, we quantify the flash-induced turnover efficiency of each S state by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Measurements were performed in photosystem II membrane preparations from spinach in the presence of an exogenous electron acceptor at selected temperatures between -10 °C and +20 °C and at flash frequencies of 1.25, 5 and 10 Hz. The results show that at optimal conditions the turnover efficiencies are limited by reactions occurring in the water oxidizing complex, allowing the extraction of their S state dependence and correlating low efficiencies to structural changes and chemical events during the reaction cycle. At temperatures 10 °C and below, the highest efficiency (i.e. lowest miss parameter) was found for the S1 → S2 transition, while the S2 → S3 transition was least efficient (highest miss parameter) over the whole temperature range. These electron paramagnetic resonance results were confirmed by measurements of flash-induced oxygen release patterns in thylakoid membranes and are explained on the basis of S state dependent structural changes at the CaMn4O5-cluster that were determined recently by femtosecond X-ray crystallography. Thereby, possible molecular errors connected to the e - transfer, H+ transfer, H2O binding and O2 release are identified.","misc","christiaan"

As described by Schmidt et al., 3 parameters (ie, time from diagnosis to systemic therapy <3 vs. ≥3 years, Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] 80 vs. >80, and the presence of brain, liver, or bone metastasis) were used to divide the IMDC favorable risk group into 2 new categories: very favorable and favorable risk groups. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Time to treatment failure (TTF) and objective response rate (ORR) in the very favorable and favorable risk groups were the secondary endpoints. A total of 545 patients with mRCC from all IMDC risk groups and 112 patients from the favorable risk group were included in this study. According to the novel classification model, 44 (39.3%) and 68 (60.7%) patients with former favorable risk were categorized into very favorable and favorable risk groups, respectively. The median OS (55.8 months vs. 34.2 months, P = .025) and TTF (25.5 months vs. 15.5 months, P = .010) were longer in the very favorable risk group than in the favorable risk group. The concordance index of the new IMDC model in all patients was 0.65 for OS.

Data on quality of life and resource use for 613 patients, collected prospectively in the Therapeutic Interventions for Stones of the Ureter (TISU) randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN 92289221), were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of two care pathways, SWL and URS. A health provider (UK National Health Service) perspective was adopted to estimate the costs of the interventions and subsequent resource use. Quality-of-life data were calculated using a generic instrument, the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L. Results are expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The mean QALY difference (SWL vs URS) was -0.021 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.033 to -0.010) and the mean cost difference was -£809 (95% CI -£1061 to -£551). The QALY difference translated into approximately 10 more healthy days over the 6-month period for the patients on the URS care pathway. The probabaility that SWL is cost-effective is 79% at a society's willingness to pay (WTP) threshold for 1 QALY of £30,000 and 98% at a WTP threshold of £20,000. The SWL pathway results in lower QALYs than URS but costs less. The incremental cost per QALY is £39 118 cost saving per QALY lost, with a 79% probability that SWL would be considered cost-effective at a WTP threshold for 1 QALY of £30 000 and 98% at a WTP threshold of £20 000.

This has important implications for reducing treatment burden in diseases that require chronic prophylaxis, such as hemophilia. Clearance of PEG molecules with high molecular weights (≥ 40 kDa) has been reported to cause cellular vacuolation in mammals. Rurioctocog alfa pegol (PEGylated recombinant coagulation factor VIII) contains a 20-kDa PEG. This study investigated the effects of exposure to 20-kDa PEG (10 μg/ml to 10 mg/ml) on the morphology and function of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in vitro. Exposure to PEG for 24 hours was associated with significant vacuolation only at concentrations of 1 mg/ml or more, which far exceed the levels associated with clinically relevant doses of rurioctocog alfa pegol. Immunofluorescence staining of PEG was detected in the cytoplasm of MDMs, indicating uptake into the cells. No impairment of MDM phagocytic activity (ability to ingest fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli) was observed with 24-hour exposure to PEG, even at concentrations associated with significant vacuolation. Furthermore, PEG exposure did not have significant effects on cytokine secretion in resting or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated MDMs, or on the expression of cell surface markers in stimulated MDMs. Cell viability was not affected by 24-hour exposure to PEG. In conclusion, vacuolation of human MDMs after exposure to 20-kDa PEG only occurred with PEG concentrations far in excess of those equivalent to clinically relevant doses of rurioctocog alfa pegol and did not affect MDM viability or functionality. Together, these results support the concept that PEG-mediated vacuolation is an adaptive cellular response rather than a toxic effect.","misc","christiaan"

However, the underlying psychological mechanism remains unclear. This asymmetry of wise reasoning may be explained by the different mindsets of self-transcendence when people reason about various conflicts (personal vs. others'), and mood should play a fundamental role. To explore this issue, three hundred ninety-nine participants were recruited to test a hypothesized model. The results supported the effect of Solomon's paradox-that is, participants endorsed wise-reasoning strategies more strongly when resolving others' social conflicts than their own. Further mediation analysis showed that the sequential mediation model was supported. Solomon's paradox can be explained by the difference in positive affect and self-transcendence when reasoning about the two conflicts. This study directly verifies the mediating role of self-transcendence in Solomon's paradox. At the same time, reasoning about personal affairs reduces individuals' self-transcendence mindset, and positive affect can explain the differences. These results are helpful for understanding and effectively avoiding Solomon's wisdom dilemma.","misc","christiaan"

Childhood is a crucial period for body growth and development. However, it is unknown whether adherence to a plant-based diet is related to a healthy body composition in children. We aimed to assess the relationship between a plant-based diet and body composition in children. A total of 452 Chinese children aged 6-9 years old participated in this cross-sectional study. Lean mass (LM), fat mass, and fat mass percentage (FMP) were assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. An age- and sex-specific abdominal FMP ≥85th percentile was defined as abdominal obesity. Handgrip strength was measured using a hydraulic hand dynamometer. A validated 79-item food frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary information. Overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI) scores were calculated. After adjusting for potential covariates, a higher hPDI score (per 10-score increment) was associated with a higher LM in the android area (0.038 kg, 3.2%), gynoid area (0.048 kg, 1.9%), and trunk (0.102 kg, 1.2%) and with a lower FMP (1.18%) in the android area. In contrast, a higher uPDI score (per 10-score increment) was associated with a lower LM in the trunk (0.091 kg, 1.1%) and android area (0.023 kg, 1.9%) and with a higher FMP (0.74%) in the android area. No significant associations were observed between the overall PDI and body composition or abdominal obesity. After stratifying by sex, higher (vs. lower) hPDI scores was associated with lower abdominal obesity risk in girls and higher handgrip strength in boys. In conclusion, in this cross-sectional study, we found that stronger adherence to a healthful plant-based diet, and less adherence to an unhealthful plant-based diet was associated with better body composition in Chinese omnivorous children aged 6-9 years old. Our results highlight the need to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy plant foods within investigating how to obtain a healthy body composition in children.","misc","christiaan"

For in vitro tests, the scales were spread on microscope slides, hand pollinated, and incubated. Pollen germination was evaluated with the stereomicroscope and the tube growth was explored with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The in vivo tests were carried out by sprinkling the stigmas of the Crocus plants with Silica gel scales and immediately after having pollinated them by hand, the plants were incubated. Three hours later, the stigmas were removed and treated for observation with SEM. In vitro the pollen of both species germinated on Silica gel with percentages similar to those of the in vivo and in vitro controls, accumulating fibrillary material at the interface. The tubes grew perpendicular to the surface of the scales, trying to penetrate the scales to the point of flattening with the apex. On Crocus stigmas sprinkled with Silica gel scales, pollen developed tubes that grew to the scales rather than penetrating the papillae. The results underline the close interaction of pollen with nanoporous artificial material, so much so that its pollen tubes are attracted to the Silica scales more than to the stigma papillae that arises from a mechanism of natural selection.","misc","christiaan"

The groups were followed at 36, 48, and 60 months. Liver fibrosis was indicated by an APRI >0.5 or Fib-4≥1.45 score and advanced fibrosis by an APRI score >1.5 or Fib-4 >3.25. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to assess the predictors for the presence of liver fibrosis over time. During a median follow-up of 58.5 months the prevalence of liver fibrosis in all patients increased with 0.5% reaching 11.3% using an APRI score and with 0.9% reaching 10.8% using the Fib-4 score. At the visit corresponding to 60 months the prevalence of liver fibrosis was higher in all HIV-HBV patients compared with individuals with HIV mono-infection, namely: 16.1% on APRI and 12.9% on the Fib-4 score in HIV-HBV/HBsAg-positive individuals, 12.8% on both APRI and Fib-4 scores in HIV-HBV/HBsAg-negative individuals vs. 8.1 and 9%, respectively in HIV mono-infection. The presence of liver fibrosis over the study period was independently associated with plasma HIV RNA, CD4+T cell counts, HIV-HBV co-infection (for APRI >0.5) and ART non-adherence (for Fib-4 >1.45). At the final visit, non-adherence to ART and CD4+T cell counts remained associated with liver fibrosis. The study found a slow progression of APRI and Fib-4 scores over time in young PLWH with extensive ART. Liver fibrosis scores continued to increase in patients with HIV mono-infection yet remained lower than in HIV-HBV patients irrespective on the presence of HBsAg. The periodic follow-up using non-invasive scores on the long-term could help improve the surveillance in low-income settings and high scores should be followed by additional diagnostic methods.","misc","christiaan"

Recently, many other biological agents, including interleukin 17 inhibitors such as ixekizumab, have shown promise. Five severe HS (Hurley stage III) patients resistant to conventional treatments and adalimumab for at least 3 months were recruited. Patients were prescribed ixekizumab with a scheme approved for psoriasis (160 mg once, followed by 80 mg at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.) The primary outcome measure was achieving the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) score following 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included the patient-reported Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and visual analog scale (VAS). Four of 5 patients (80%) achieved HiSCR. While improvement was observed in the VAS and DLQI scores of 4 patients, the decline was limited in 1 patient. No adverse event was recorded related to ixekizumab. The result of our observation suggests that ixekizumab may be effective for HS, especially in challenging cases.","misc","christiaan"

It is unclear, however, whether increasing socio-economic inequalities are associated with increasing differences in survival in liver transplant (LT) recipients. Adults undergoing first time LT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between 2002 and 2017 recorded in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) were included and grouped into three cohorts. Patient survival and graft survival stratified by race/ethnicity were compared among the cohorts using unadjusted and adjusted analyses. White/Caucasians comprised the largest group (n=9,006, 64.9%), followed by Hispanic/Latinos (n=2,018, 14.5%), Black/African Americans (n=1,379, 9.9%), Asians (n=1,265, 9.1%) and other ethnic/racial groups (n=188, 1.3%). Compared to Cohort I (2002-2007), the 5-year survival of Cohort III (2012-2017) increased by 18% for Black/African Americans, by 13% for Whites/Caucasians, by 10% for Hispanic/Latinos, by 9% for patients of other racial/ethnic groups and by 8% for Asians (All P values<0.05). Despite Black/African Americans experienced the highest survival improvement, their overall outcomes remained significantly lower than other ethnic∕racial groups (adjusted HR for death=1.20; 95%CI 1.05-1.36; P=0.005; adjusted HR for graft loss=1.21; 95%CI 1.08-1.37; P=0.002).

Occasionally, tumor NGS also uncovers incidental apparent pathogenic germline variants (PGVs), with BRCA2 being among the most common of those. If germline testing confirms a BRCA2 PGV in a patient with NSCLC, therapies targeting that BRCA2 PGV might be considered, if the patient has exhausted standard NSCLC therapeutic options. Surveillance and preventive therapies for BRCA2-related cancers would be recommended or considered for that patient, as well as for family members found to carry that same BRCA2 PGV. Here, I offer my perspective related to the evidence supporting and against germline testing in patients with NSCLCs that show incidental BRCA2 apparent PGVs. I use an example to underscore how important it is to explain to patients, before tumor NGS, the possibility of uncovering an incidental PGV.

Since kidney biopsy is a relative hysteretic indicator, it is indispensable to investigate potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and predicting clinical outcomes of LN patients. Extracellular proteins may become the promising biomarkers by the secretion into body fluid. Our study linked extracellular proteins with lupus nephritis to identify the emerging biomarkers. The expression profiling data were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Meanwhile, the two gene lists encoding extracellular proteins were collected from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and UniProt database. Subsequently, the extracellular protein-differentially expressed genes (EP-DEGs) were screened out, and the key EP-DEGs were determined by MCODE, MCC, and Degree methods via the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The expression level, immune characteristics, and diagnostic value of these candidate biomarkers were investigated. Finally, the Nephroseq V5 tool was applied to evaluate the clinical significance of the key EP-DEGs. A total of 164 DEGs were acquired by comparing LN samples with healthy controls based on GSE32591 datasets. Then, 38 EP-DEGs were screened out through the intersection between DEGs and extracellular protein gene lists. Function enrichment analysis indicated that these EP-DEGs might participate in immune response and constitute the extracellular matrix. Four key EP-DEGs (LUM, TGFBI, COL1A2, and POSTN) were eventually identified as candidate biomarkers, and they were all overexpressed in LN samples. Except that LUM expression was negatively correlated with most of the immune regulatory genes, there was a positive correlation between the remaining three biomarkers and the immune regulatory genes. In addition, these biomarkers had high diagnostic value, especially the AUC value of the LUM-TGFBI combination which reached almost 1 (AUC = 0.973), demonstrating high accuracy in distinguishing LN from controls. Finally, we found a meaningful correlation of these biomarkers with sex, WHO class, and renal function such as glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine level, and proteinuria. In summary, our study comprehensively identified four key EP-DEGs exerting a vital role in LN diagnosis and pathogenesis and serving as promising therapeutic targets.","misc","christiaan"
"1284",35968468,"Spatiotemporal variations of public opinion on social distancing in the Netherlands: Comparison of Twitter and longitudinal survey data.","Social distancing has been implemented by many countries to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding public support for this policy calls for effective and efficient methods of monitoring public opinion on social distancing. Twitter analysis has been suggested as a cheaper and faster-responding alternative to traditional survey methods. The current empirical evidence is mixed in terms of the correspondence between the two methods. We aim to compare the two methods in the context of monitoring the Dutch public's opinion on social distancing. For this comparison, we quantified the temporal and spatial variations in public opinion and their sensitivities to critical events using data from both Dutch Twitter users and respondents from a longitudinal survey. A longitudinal survey on a representative Dutch sample (n = 1,200) was conducted between July and November 2020 to measure opinions on social distancing weekly. From the same period, near 100,000 Dutch tweets were categorized as supporting or rejecting social distancing based on a model trained with annotated data. Average stances for the 12 Dutch provinces and over the 20 weeks were computed from the two data sources and were compared through visualizations and statistical analyses. Both data sources suggested strong support for social distancing, but public opinion was much more varied among tweets than survey responses. Both data sources showed an increase in public support for social distancing over time, and a strong temporal correspondence between them was found for most of the provinces. In addition, the survey but not Twitter data revealed structured differences among the 12 provinces, while the two data sources did not correspond much spatially. Finally, stances estimated from tweets were more sensitive to critical events happened during the study period. Our findings indicate consistencies between Twitter data analysis and survey methods in describing the overall stance on social distancing and temporal trends. The lack of spatial correspondence may imply limitations in the data collections and calls for surveys with larger regional samples. For public health management, Twitter analysis can be used to complement survey methods, especially for capturing public's reactivities to critical events amid the current pandemic.","misc","christiaan"

Some epidemiologic studies have indicated that long-term metal exposures can modulate the levels of CRP and CAMs, but the associations between prenatal metal exposures and the levels of CRP and CAMs have yet to be studied more extensively. In this study, we assessed associations between maternal blood metal levels and CRP/CAMs among 617 pregnant women in the Puerto Rico PROTECT birth cohort. Blood samples were collected from participants at 16-20 (visit 1) and 24-28 (visit 3) weeks gestation. We measured concentrations of 11 metals using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). From the blood samples, CRP and CAMs intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) were also quantified using a customized Luminex assay. Linear-mixed effects models (LMEs) were used to regress CRP and CAMs on metals and included random intercepts for study participants to account for correlated repeated outcome measures. Fetal sex and visit effects were estimated using interaction terms between metal exposure variables and fetal sex, as well as visit indicators, respectively. We observed significant positive associations between nickel and CRP (Δ: 7.04, 95% CI = 0.75, 13.73) and between lead and VCAM (Δ: 4.57, 95% CI = 1.36, 7.89). The positive associations were mainly driven by mothers carrying male fetuses. We also observed various visit-specific associations. The significant associations between metals and CRP were predominantly driven by visit 3; however, the significant associations between metals and VCAM were mainly driven by visit 1. Certain maternal blood metal levels were significantly associated with CRP and CAMs and most of these associations were differentially driven by fetal sex, as well as by timing in pregnancy. Future studies should further explore metal-CRP/CAMs associations for a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of metal-induced adverse birth outcomes.","misc","christiaan"
"2265",35974590,"Determining the Kerr constant in optically isotropic liquid crystals.","A new scheme is investigated for evaluating the temperature dependence and dispersion relation of the Kerr constant (K) of an optically isotropic medium in isotropic and blue phases (BPs) liquid crystals. The scheme employs the measurement of the component of the transmitted light intensity of double modulated frequency using the modified in-plane-switching cell geometry (based on metallic film electrodes). It overcomes to a large extent the problem of a nonuniform electric field, employs relatively small driving voltages, and allows K to be measured directly. It is shown that the dispersion relation based on the single-band birefringence model describes well both blue and isotropic liquid crystal phases. It is found that the experimental data indicate that the temperature-dependent coefficients in this relation have a simple linear form in the isotropic phase, which allows a general model for the temperature and wavelength dependence of the Kerr constant in the isotropic liquid crystal phase to be formulated. In the BPs the temperature dependence of the experimental data deviate from the simple linear trend, but follow well an inverse exponential form.","misc","christiaan"

The heterogeneous nature of DC subsets follows their altered functions by interacting with other immune cells, Mtb, and its products, enhancing host defense mechanisms or facilitating pathogen evasion. Thus, a better understanding of the immune responses initiated, promoted, and amplified or inhibited by DCs in Mtb infection is an essential step in developing anti-tuberculosis (TB) control measures, such as host-directed adjunctive therapy and anti-TB vaccines. This review summarizes the recent advances in salient DC subsets, including their phenotypic classification, cytokine profiles, functional alterations according to disease stages and environments, and consequent TB outcomes. A comprehensive overview of the role of DCs from various perspectives enables a deeper understanding of TB pathogenesis and could be useful in developing DC-based vaccines and immunotherapies.","misc","christiaan"

Antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are highly specific, but sensitivity is variable.

To study the relationship between negative Ag-RDT results with virological, molecular, and serological parameters, we selected a cross-sectional and a follow-up dataset and analyzed virus culture, subgenomic RNA quantification, and sequencing to determine infectious viruses and mutations. We demonstrated that RT-qPCR positive while SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT negative discordant results correlate with the absence of infectious virus in nasopharyngeal samples. A decrease in sgRNA detection together with an expected increase in detectable anti-S and anti-N IgGs was also verified in these samples.

This study included 85 GDM and 85 age-matched normal pregnant women who visited our hospital from January 2019 to January 2020. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the expression of miR-221 and miR-320 in the plasma of pregnant women. The correlation analysis was used to detect the relationship between miR-221, miR-320, and risk factors of GDM, including homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the prepregnancy BMI. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to determine the diagnostic value of miR-320 and miR-221 in GDM. Compared with normal pregnant women, the expression of miR-221 and miR-320 in GDM was significantly higher (p < 0.05). The results also demonstrate that the expression of miR-221 and miR-320 increases grad-ually with the development of pregnancy in GDM at 24 weeks, 28 weeks, and 32 weeks (p < 0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis confirmed that the expression level of miR-221 and miR-320 in the plasma of GDM is positively correlated with the HOMA-IR and HbA1c, but has no significant correlation with pre-pregnancy BMI. The area under the curve (AUC) values of miR-221 and miR-320 were 0.862 and 0.853, respectively. Meanwhile, the area under the combined detection curve is 0.904. Plasma miR-221 and miR-320 are significantly elevated in GDM, and are positively correlated with HbA1c and HOMA-IR.

"1577",35977786,"Multituberculate Mammals Show Evidence of a Life History Strategy Similar to That of Placentals, Not Marsupials.","AbstractThe remarkable evolutionary success of placental mammals has been partly attributed to their reproductive strategy of prolonged gestation and birthing of relatively precocial, quickly weaned neonates. Although this strategy was conventionally considered derived relative to that of marsupials with highly altricial neonates and long lactation periods, mounting evidence has challenged this view. Until now the fossil record has been relatively silent on this debate, but here we find that proportions of different bone tissue microstructures in the femoral cortices of small extant marsupials and placentals correlate with length of lactation period, allowing us to apply this histological correlate of reproductive strategies to Late Cretaceous and Paleocene members of Multituberculata, an extinct mammalian clade that is phylogenetically stemward of Theria. Multituberculate bone histology closely resembles that of placentals, suggesting that they had similar life history strategies. A stem-therian clade exhibiting evidence of placental-like life histories supports the hypothesis that intense maternal-fetal contact characteristic of placentals is ancestral for therians. Alternatively, multituberculates and placentals may have independently evolved prolonged gestation and abbreviated lactation periods. Our results challenge the hypothesis that the rise of placental mammals was driven by unique life history innovations and shed new light on early mammalian diversification.","misc","christiaan"

The relevance of this in AD is largely unclear. To characterize the role of TIM-3 and Gal-9 in the pathogenesis of AD and underlying mechanisms. We assessed the expression of Gal-9 and TIM-3 in 30 AD patients, to compare them with those of 30 healthy controls (HC) and to explore possible links with disease features including AD activity (SCORAD), IgE levels, and circulating eosinophils and B cells. We also determined the effects of Gal-9 on T cells from the AD patients. Our AD patients had markedly higher levels of serum Gal-9 and circulating TIM-3-expressing TH1 and TH17 cells than HC. Gal-9 and TIM-3 were linked to high disease activity, IgE levels, and circulating eosinophils and/or B cells. The rates of circulating TIM-3-positive CD4+ cells were positively correlated with rates of TH2/TH22 cells and negatively correlated with rates of TH1/TH17 cells. Gal-9 inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of T cells in patients with AD, especially in those with severe AD. Our findings suggest thatGal-9, via TIM-3, contributes to the pathogenesis of AD by augmenting TH2/TH22 polarization through the downregulation of TH1/TH17immunity.

Programmed exercise interventions are used frequently to increase physical fitness in MS-patients. Studies investigating the effects of training on aerobic capacity, objective endurance and perceived fatigability have yielded heterogenous results, most likely due to the heterogeneity of interventions and patients, but probably also due to the non-uniform pathophysiology of fatigability among MS-patients.

We aimed to identify novel binding proteins of arginine-rich CPPs in serum to better understand their in vivo fate and develop more sophisticated drug delivery systems using CPPs. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis suggests that albumin, the most abundant protein in serum, binds to d-forms of oligoarginine; however, the dissociation constants are several tens of a micromolar. Candidate proteins with the potential of binding to arginine-rich CPPs in serum were then explored using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Studies using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy determined hemopexin as a potential binding partner of d-forms of arginine-rich CPPs, including d-octaarginine (r 8) and the d-form of the peptide, corresponding to HIV-1 Rev (34-50), with dissociation constants of submicromolar to micromolar range. Using flow cytometry and a split-luciferase-based system, the promotion effect of hemopexin on the total cellular uptake and cytosolic localization of cargos conjugated with these CPPs was confirmed.

The combination of PULL@CPB and PMIA could increase the one-step refining of protoplasmic beer as well as the ability of biocatalysis to lower the alcohol-to-ester ratio. The experimental results showed that the addition of PULL@CPB and the increase in the ratio of EtOH/water in the coagulation bath both increased the load of pullulanase on the membrane surface, while excessive addition decreased the activity of pullulanase. Under the amount of PULL@CPB is 0.5 g·L-1 and the ratio of EtOH/water is 60%, the relative activity of pullulanase in PULL@CPB modified PMIA membrane was the highest, which was 91.7% of the initial activity. The interception rates of protein and macromolecular β-glucan were 92.2% and 87.3%, respectively, under the condition of beer flux (162.3 L·m-2·h-1). At the same time, the PULL@CPB/PMIA membrane has strong antibacterial performance and thus plays a role in extending the shelf life of beer. Compared with free pullulanase, the thermal stability, pH stability, organic solvent stability, and storing stability of immobilized pullulanase were significantly improved. The effects of PULL@CPB dosage and operating temperature on biocatalysis efficiency were discussed. The immobilized pullulanase activity on the membrane remained at 70.8% after 10 continuous uses. Therefore, the PMIA membrane is an excellent carrier of pullulanase, so its bioactive membrane has a wide range of prospects in food, medicine, and other fields.","misc","christiaan"

Analysis of the serum and saliva samples from the healthy controls and DADA2 patients revealed that ADA2 enzyme concentration is significantly lower in patients than in healthy controls. In contrast, the concentration of ADA2 increases in the serum of patients with large granular leukocyte leukemia (LGLL) and patients' saliva with head and neck cancer.

The solid-state NMR data revealed that Aβ40Os adopt the structural motif of β-loop-β but the chemical shifts manifested that they may be structurally different from low-MW AβOs and mature fibrils. From the thioflavin-T results, we found that high-MW Aβ42Os can accelerate the fibrillization of Aβ40 monomers. Our protocol allows performing cross-seeding experiments among oligomeric species. By comparing the chemical shifts of Aβ40Os cross seeded by Aβ42Os and those of Aβ40Os prepared in the absence of Aβ42Os, we observed that the chemical states of E11, K16, and E22 were altered, whereas the backbone conformation of the β-sheet region near the C-terminus was structurally invariant. The use of reverse micelles allows hitherto the most detailed characterization of the structural variability of Aβ40Os.","misc","christiaan"

A 40-year-old woman with untreated metastatic breast cancer presented to an outpatient clinic in significant distress with symptoms of progressive shortness of breath and bilateral leg swelling. An urgent echocardiogram demonstrated a large pericardial effusion with echocardiographic evidence of cardiac tamponade. She underwent emergent pericardiocentesis of the effusion that was deemed to be malignant after cytologic evaluation. Subsequently, she opted for palliative treatment involving the surgical creation of a right pericardial window and placement of an indwelling pleural catheter.

"2303",35968383,"Developing a digital archive system for imperial Chinese robe in the Qing Dynasty.","The digital archive of cultural heritage provides new opportunities for the protection of the cultural heritage and the development of online museums. One of the essential requirements for the digitization is to achieve accurate color reproduction. Taking the Imperial Chinese robes in the Qing Dynasty as an example, this study aims to develop a digital achieve system to digitize the robes using a high-end imaging system and accurately reproduce their color properties on a display. Currently, there has been very limited study focused on the color reproduction of silk fabrics or other textile materials. The conventional color management process using a traditional color chart, however, may not be suitable for the reproduction of silk fabrics because they have very high gloss. To address this difficulty, a unique Qianlong Palette color chart, consisting of 210 silk fabric samples, has been specifically produced for optimizing the color reproduction of silk fabrics and a color image reproduction system has been developed for the digitization and archiving of the clothing fabric for the royal court. Color characterization models using both the Qianlong Palette color chart and the traditional color chart, and different mapping methods, are compared and the model with highest accuracy used in a self-programmed interface for automatically processing textile images in the future. Finally, the digital archive system has been validated using six garments of silk fabric relics. The color differences after the color image reproduction are all less than 3.00ΔE* ab , indicating acceptable color reproduction of the system. The images after color reproduction have also been evaluated subjectively by experts from the museum and the results are considered satisfactory. Our results show that the newly designed Qianlong Palette color chart exhibits superior performance over the conventional color chart in effectively predicting the color of the silk fabrics. The self-programmed graphical user interface for image color management can serve as a powerful tool to truly reproduce the color of various silk fabric relics in museums in the future and digitally archive those valuable cultural relics for different uses.","misc","christiaan"

Infected individuals include asymptomatic cases to severe disease leading to death, suggesting the involvement of the genetic constitution of populations and pathogens contributing to differential individuals' outcomes. To investigate shared immunogenic features between SARS-CoV-2 targets and other coronaviruses, we modeled their peptides in 3D structures of HLA-A*02:01 (pMHC), comparing their molecular surfaces These structures were also compared with a panel of epitopes from unrelated viruses, looking for potential triggers conferring cross-protection in uninfected individuals. As expected, SARS-CoV 1 and 2 peptides share molecular and physicochemical features, providing an explanation for the verified experimental immunogenicity among them. Surprisingly, even discordant sequences from human coronaviruses 229E, OC43 and epitopes from unrelated viruses involved in endemic human infections exhibit similar fingerprints of immunogenicity with SARS-CoV-2 peptides. The same approach indicates a conserved CD8+ T cell recognition between Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 sequences and altered peptides from Variants of Concern. Examination of structural data over epitope sequence analysis here could explain how previous infections may produce a heterologous immunity response in a global scale against emergent diseases such as Covid-19, mitigating its full lethal potential, and paves the way for the development of wide spectrum vaccine development.","misc","christiaan"

Intrathecal antibody production to measles virus (MeV) is a common finding in patients with MS. To measure serum IgG reactivity to EBV glycoprotein 350 (gp350) and MeV nucleocapsid protein (NCORE) in patients with MS and healthy controls and to determine if reactivity changed in patients during interferon beta (IFNβ) and/or natalizumab (NAT) treatment. A secondary aim was to determine the seroprevalence of EBV in patients and controls. Patients with MS (n=728) were included from the Swedish pharmacovigilance study for NAT. Paired serum samples from 714 patients drawn before and during NAT treatment and paired samples from 170 patients during prior IFNβ treatment were analysed. In total, 156 patients were included in both groups. Samples from 144 matched blood donors served as controls. Indirect ELISA was applied using recombinant EBVgp350 and MeV NCORE as antigens. EBVgp350 IgG seronegative samples were also analysed using EBV nuclear antigen 1 and viral capsid antigen (VCA). Patients with MS showed higher serum levels of anti-EBVgp350 and anti-MeV NCORE IgG compared with controls. During NAT treatment, the levels of anti-EBVgp350 and anti-MeV NCORE IgG declined, compared with the relatively stable levels noted during prior IFNβ treatment. Ten patients failed to demonstrate anti-EBVgp350 IgG but did show detectable anti-VCA IgG, indicating EBV seropositivity. In contrast, 10/144 controls were EBV seronegative. Treatment with NAT, which is considered a selective immunosuppressive agent with a compartmentalised effect on the central nervous system, appeared to be associated with a moderate decrease in circulating IgG levels to EBVgp350 and MeV NCORE. All patients with MS were EBV IgG seropositive, supporting the potential role of EBV in the pathogenesis of MS.","misc","christiaan"

In most cases, the condition is accompanied by associated traumas responsible for poor prognosis. Signs of diaphragmatic rupture are often masked by more serious manifestations of the associated trauma. The rupture is usually revealed by an X-ray of the chest or CT scan. However, a minor defect may be missed, especially if the patient is not indicated for urgent surgery. The authors present 2 case reports of patients treated for chronic diaphragmatic rupture at the Department of Surgery of the Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital in Pilsen between 01 January 2009 and 31 December 2021. The aim was to analyze the clinical data and to compare this data with literature. Both patients with the chronic diaphragmatic rupture were men in their productive age. The mechanism of their primary trauma was a traffic accident. In the first case, the rupture was diagnosed 6 years after the trauma. The second case was diagnosed 14 years after the primary trauma. The diaphragmatic rupture was present on the left side in the first case and on the right in the other. Both patients underwent suture of the diaphragmatic defect via thoracotomy. Unrecognized diaphragmatic rupture is a severe condition that can result in a life-threatening complication, namely incarceration of abdominal organs dislocated to the chest. It is necessary to keep this diagnosis in mind in patients with gastrointestinal or respiratory problems after a previous high-energy, blunt-force abdominal and thoracic injury, even many years after the trauma.","misc","christiaan"
"1870",35967642,"Using Spiritual Connections to Cope With Stress and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic.","During the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, stress and anxiety were pervasive among the masses due to high morbidity and mortality. Besides the fear of coronavirus was also particularly driven by social media. Many people started to look for faith and spiritual connections to gain comfort. The role of spiritual ties and religious beliefs in relation to coping with pandemic stress has acquired the attention of researchers in some parts of the world. This cross-sectional survey aimed at assessing the intensity of stress and anxiety symptoms experienced by people and how much they were alleviated by employing spiritual connections. The study sample comprises 795 respondents with 52% males and 48% females living in Saudi Arabia. The brief online study questionnaire collected data about background variables, anxiety and stress scale from DASS-21, and items from the WHOQOL (SRBP) instrument assessed the use of spiritual beliefs to cope. Multiple regression models were tested to determine the role of spiritual connections after adjusting demographic variables. Results illustrated that after adjusting for gender and age, participants' anxiety symptoms decreased by (β = -0.27; p = 0.000) units with each unit increase in the use of spiritual connections, and participants' stress symptoms reduce by (β = -0.36; p = 0.000) units with each unit increase in coping with spirituality. Additionally, females' risk to experience anxiety and stress symptoms was more than males [(β = 0.88; p = 0.01) and (β = 0.92; p = 0.000)], respectively. An increase in age decreases the likelihood of experiencing anxiety symptoms and stress symptoms by (β = -0.75; p = 0.02) and (β = -0.11; p = 0.000) units, respectively. Findings support the protective role of spiritual connections despite small beta coefficients. The social and cultural context in Saudi Arabia favors deep-rooted connections with spirituality and faith. Our findings support the fact that the reliance on spiritual connections helped older people to deal with exaggerated fear during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduces the risk of experiencing anxiety and stress symptoms. Females and younger participants were relatively vulnerable to developing these symptoms. We discussed these findings considering some recent studies that reported similar relationships and made recommendations for future research.","misc","christiaan"
"2217",35969095,"RNA Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) to Visualize Microbial Colonization and Infection in Caenorhabditis elegans Intestines.","The intestines of wild Caenorhabditis nematodes are inhabited by a variety of microorganisms, including gut microbiome bacteria and pathogens, such as microsporidia and viruses. Because of the similarities between Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian intestinal cells, as well as the power of the C. elegans system, this host has emerged as a model system to study host intestine-microbe interactions in vivo. While it is possible to observe some aspects of these interactions with bright-field microscopy, it is difficult to accurately classify microbes and characterize the extent of colonization or infection without more precise tools. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be used as a tool to identify and visualize microbes in nematodes from the wild or to experimentally characterize and quantify infection in nematodes infected with microbes in the lab. FISH probes, labeling the highly abundant small subunit ribosomal RNA, produce a bright signal for bacteria and microsporidian cells. Probes designed to target conserved regions of ribosomal RNA common to many species can detect a broad range of microbes, whereas targeting divergent regions of the ribosomal RNA is useful for narrower detection. Similarly, probes can be designed to label viral RNA. A protocol for RNA FISH staining with either paraformaldehyde (PFA) or acetone fixation is presented. PFA fixation is ideal for nematodes associated with bacteria, microsporidia, and viruses, whereas acetone fixation is necessary for the visualization of microsporida spores. Animals were first washed and fixed in paraformaldehyde or acetone. After fixation, FISH probes were incubated with samples to allow for the hybridization of probes to the desired target. The animals were again washed and then examined on microscope slides or using automated approaches. Overall, this FISH protocol enables detection, identification, and quantification of the microbes that inhabit the C. elegans intestine, including microbes for which there are no genetic tools available.","misc","christiaan"

Fibroblasts are salient mediators of both inflammation and fibrosis. Whereas the general outcome of IL-6 on the heart's function and muscle wasting has been intensively studied, the influence of IL-6 on fibroblasts of the heart and skeletal muscle (SM) has not been analyzed so far. We illustrate that SM-derived fibroblasts exhibit higher basal mRNA expression of α-SMA, extracellular matrix molecules (collagen1a1/3a1/5a1), and chemokines (CCL2, CCL7, and CX3CL1) as compared to the left ventricle (LV)-derived fibroblasts. IL-6 drives the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts as indicated by an increase in α-SMA expression and upregulates NLRP3 inflammasome activity in both LV- and SM-derived fibroblasts. IL-6 increases the release of CCL7 to CX3CL1 in the supernatant of SM-derived fibroblasts associated with the attraction of more pro(Ly6Chi) versus anti(Ly6Clo) inflammatory monocytes as compared to unstimulated fibroblasts. IL-6-stimulated LV-derived fibroblasts attract less Ly6Chi to Ly6Clo monocytes compared to IL-6-stimulated SM-derived fibroblasts. In addition, SM-derived fibroblasts have a higher mitochondrial energy turnover and lower glycolytic activity versus LV-derived fibroblasts under basal and IL-6 conditions. In conclusion, IL-6 modulates the inflammatory and metabolic phenotype of LV- and SM-originated fibroblasts.","misc","christiaan"
"1216",35974501,"Learning through atypical phase transitions in overparameterized neural networks.","Current deep neural networks are highly overparameterized (up to billions of connection weights) and nonlinear. Yet they can fit data almost perfectly through variants of gradient descent algorithms and achieve unexpected levels of prediction accuracy without overfitting. These are formidable results that defy predictions of statistical learning and pose conceptual challenges for nonconvex optimization. In this paper, we use methods from statistical physics of disordered systems to analytically study the computational fallout of overparameterization in nonconvex binary neural network models, trained on data generated from a structurally simpler but hidden network. As the number of connection weights increases, we follow the changes of the geometrical structure of different minima of the error loss function and relate them to learning and generalization performance. A first transition happens at the so-called interpolation point, when solutions begin to exist (perfect fitting becomes possible). This transition reflects the properties of typical solutions, which however are in sharp minima and hard to sample. After a gap, a second transition occurs, with the discontinuous appearance of a different kind of atypical structures: wide regions of the weight space that are particularly solution dense and have good generalization properties. The two kinds of solutions coexist, with the typical ones being exponentially more numerous, but empirically we find that efficient algorithms sample the atypical, rare ones. This suggests that the atypical phase transition is the relevant one for learning. The results of numerical tests with realistic networks on observables suggested by the theory are consistent with this scenario.","misc","christiaan"

The formed In2V2O7 is indexed as a tetragonal cell with a = b = 0.7417 nm and c = 2.1035 nm. Moreover, the formation mechanism of In2V2O7 through a shock synthesis process is carefully analyzed based on basic laws of shockwave. The experimental results also confirm that a high shock temperature and high shock pressure are the two key factors to synthesize the In2V2O7 nanopowder.

The low-field nuclear magnetic resonance equipment was used to characterize the peak area, pore size distribution, and pore number of each group of coal samples. The pore transformation effect of coal samples at different temperature intervals was compared, and the change characteristics of the pore structure of coal samples under the freeze-thaw action were explored. The research shows that the freeze-thaw cycles at different freezing temperature intervals have obvious differences in the effect of coal pore transformation. The area of each peak spectrum in the T 2 distribution curve of coal samples increased significantly under the action of freeze-thaw cycles in different freezing temperature intervals. The increased value of the number of mesopores and macropores shows the phenomenon of first increase and then decrease with the increase of the temperature difference. There is a quadratic function relationship between the temperature difference in the freezing temperature interval and the proportion change rate of the adsorption pore or seepage pore. The continuous increase of the temperature difference has a certain marginal effect on the proportion change rate of seepage pores and adsorption pores in coal.","misc","christiaan"

Traditional treatments of SARC include nasal corticosteroids, antihistamines, and mast cell membrane stabilizers. Biological agents such as omalizumab have also been proved effective in the treatment of SARC. We aim to certify the preventative efficacy of omalizumab for SARC and explore its influence factors. Medical records of 64 SARC patients were retrospectively analyzed, and generalized linear models were used to analyze influence factors of efficacy of omalizumab. Compared with forepassed pollen season without omalizumab treatment, the combined symptom and medication score (CSMS) of ARC with pre-seasonal omalizumab was significantly lower (with omalizumab: 0.67[0.00,1.83], without omalizumab: 4.00[2.83,4.96], p<0.001, max score=6). Subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the influence factor of preventative efficacy of omalizumab. The CSMS with omalizumab treatment were not significantly different among different age, gender, dosage, number of injections, and injection date subgroups (p>0.05). Pre-seasonal omalizumab treatment could significantly relieve SARC related symptoms and reduce medication use.

Herein, a true triaxial stress loading and permeability testing device was designed and fabricated, and a permeability evaluation model was established under various states, which can realize the accurate measurement of multiple faces and the total permeability of tight specimens before and after hydraulic fracturing. It can directly measure permeability under the conditions of the true triaxial fracture propagation experiment. The comparative experimental result shows that the new technique can quantitatively evaluate the fracture propagation experiment of true triaxial hydraulic fracturing. The overall permeability and the directional permeability of the five faces were obtained, and the fracture propagation was evaluated by comparing the change in permeability. The test permeability error rate is within ±10%. Furthermore, a more refined evaluation of hydraulic fracturing fracture propagation can be carried out based on the fracture observation and AE event results.

The correlation between these hormone levels and 90-day prognosis was analyzed, their value in assessing prognosis was compared with lesion volume and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and their correlation with conventional clinical variables was assessed. Levels of F, 24-h urinary free cortisol(UFC), E, NE, DA, and GH on days 1, 3, and 5 were significantly higher in stroke patients than in controls (P < 0.01), while ACTH and TSH decreased, gradually approaching normal within 5 days of onset. Levels of E, NE, F, and 24-h UFC were proportional to severity, and all gradually decreased within 5 days of onset in patients with a good prognosis and gradually increased or remained high in those with a poor prognosis. After adjustment for age, sex, NIHSS, or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, F > 13.6 μg/dL, ACTH > 22.02 pg/mL and NE > 123.5 μg/ 24 h were identified as risk factors for a poor prognosis 90 days after stroke (P < 0.05).

One essential question is whether collective effects may help to carry enhancements over larger scales, when increasing the number of systems composing the working substance of the engine. Such enhancements may consider not only power and efficiency, that is, its performance, but, additionally, its constancy, that is, the stability of the engine with respect to unavoidable environmental fluctuations. We explore this issue by introducing a many-body quantum heat engine model composed by spin pairs working in continuous operation. We study how power, efficiency, and constancy scale with the number of spins composing the engine and introduce a well-defined macroscopic limit where analytical expressions are obtained. Our results predict power enhancements, in both finite-size and macroscopic cases, for a broad range of system parameters and temperatures, without compromising the engine efficiency, accompanied by coherence-enhanced constancy for finite sizes.

Recent work showed that in amorphous granular systems these plastic events, that are typically quadrupolar in nature, can screen the elastic response. When the density of the quadrupoles is high, the gradients of the quadrupole field act as emergent dipole sources, leading to qualitative changes in the mechanical response, as seen for example in the displacement field. In this paper we examine the effect of screening in classical glass formers. These are made of point particles that interact via binary forces. Both inverse power law forces and Lennard-Jones interactions are examined, and it is shown that in both cases the elastic response can be strongly screened, in agreement with the novel theory. The degree of deviation from classical elasticity theory is parametrized by a proposed measure that is shown to have a functional dependence on the amount of energy lost to plastic responses.","misc","christiaan"

Pustules and brown spots are the main efflorescences of the disease and directly correlate with its activity. We propose an automated deep learning model (DLM) to quantify lesions in terms of count and surface percentage from patient photographs. In this retrospective study, two dermatologists and a student labeled 151 photographs of PP patients for pustules and brown spots. The DLM was trained and validated with 121 photographs, keeping 30 photographs as a test set to assess the DLM performance on unseen data. We also evaluated our DLM on 213 unstandardized, out-of-distribution photographs of various pustular disorders (referred to as the pustular set), which were ranked from 0 (no disease) to 4 (very severe) by one dermatologist for disease severity. The agreement between the DLM predictions and experts' labels was evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the test set and Spearman correlation (SC) coefficient for the pustular set. On the test set, the DLM achieved an ICC of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-0.98) for count and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92-0.94) for surface percentage. On the pustular set, the DLM reached a SC coefficient of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.60-0.74) for count and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83) for surface percentage.

An online survey was circulated amongst participants recruited via convenience sampling, and data were analysed using non-parametric statistical tests. The survey (n = 389) highlighted that participants who studied Science at General Certificate of Secondary Education level have a lower vaccine confidence than those with both lower and higher levels of science education. Participants with neutral/centrist political views expressed lower confidence than those with a libertarian social stance or a left-wing economic stance. A higher concern with the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with lower levels of science education, libertarian social views, and left-wing economic views. The present study provides novel insight on the educational and political factors associated with vaccine hesitancy and pandemic concern within a British population sample.","misc","christiaan"

To provide a consistent comparison between the systems described by different force fields, we determine the phase diagram and critical points of each system, characterize the morphology of high-density liquid phases at the same reduced temperature and density, and finally investigate their long-time relaxation dynamics. In particular, we detect an especially complex dynamics that reveals the existence of slow and fast nanotrimers and the resulting occurrence of non-Gaussianity, which develops at intermediate timescales. Deviations from Gaussianity are temporary and vanish within the timescales of the system's density fluctuations decay, when a Fickian-like diffusion regime is eventually observed.","misc","christiaan"
"2286",35968001,"A polymorphism in porcine miR-22 is associated with pork color.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional regulators that play key roles in meat color regulation. Changes in miRNA expression affect their target mRNAs, leading to multifunctional effects on biological processes and phenotypes. In this study, a G > A mutation site located upstream of the precursor miR-22 sequence in Suhuai pigs was significantly correlated with the meat color parameter a*(redness) of the porcine longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. AA genotype individuals had the highest average meat color a* value and the lowest miR-22 level. When G > A mutation was performed in the miR-22 overexpression vector, miR-22 expression significantly decreased. Considering that Ca2+ homeostasis is closely related to pig meat color, our results further demonstrated that ELOVL6 is a direct target of miR-22 in pigs. The effects of miR-22 on skeletal muscle intracellular Ca2+ were partially caused by the suppression of ELOVL6 expression.","misc","christiaan"

Current guidelines recommend screening for hypoglycemia in at-risk babies (late preterm, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, and infants of diabetic mothers). Past studies have suggested other potential risk factors, such as maternal obesity, gestational hypertension, cesarean section, etc. In this study, we aim to identify additional prenatal and perinatal maternal/fetal characteristics associated with early asymptomatic hypoglycemia in term and late preterm babies. We performed a retrospective review on medical charts of all newborns, born between January, 2017 and December, 2020, in the well-baby newborn nursery of a tertiary medical center. We identified newborns who had received blood glucose concentration monitor after birth. Detailed prenatal and perinatal maternal/newborn information were collected for analysis. In the study period, 841 newborns had received blood glucose screening after birth. After matching by sex and indication for postnatal blood glucose screen (SGA, LGA, and GDM), 148 newborns were included in the hypoglycemia group and 296 newborns were included in the euglycemia group. In the univariate analysis, parity, insulin treatment for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and cesarean section were associated with an increased risk for neonatal hypoglycemia. Factors associated with decreased risk included higher gestational age, longer duration of skin-to-skin contact, neonatal hyperthermia, higher maternal labor pain score, and epidural anesthesia administration. By multivariable analysis, insulin treatment for GDM was identified as an independent factor associated with increased risk for neonatal hypoglycemia. Our study showed insulin treatment for GDM to be independently associated with neonatal hypoglycemia. Other risk factors noted in the univariate analysis, such as decreased skin-to-skin contact duration, hypothermia, Cesarean section, and preterm delivery, would require further investigation to confirm the findings.","misc","christiaan"

The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of resident physicians and faculty related to teaching, learning and assessment during ambulatory virtual care encounters within the competency-based medical education model. In this qualitative phenomenological study, we recruited resident physicians (postgraduate year [PGY] 1-5 trainees) and faculty from the Departments of Surgery and Medicine at Queen's University, Ontario, via purposive sampling. Participants were not required to have exposure to virtual care. Interviews were conducted from September 2020 to March 2021 by 1 researcher, and 2 researchers conducted focus groups via Zoom to explore participants' experiences with the transition to virtual care. These were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim; qualitative data were analyzed thematically. There were 18 male and 19 female participants; 20 were resident physicians and 17 were faculty; 19 were from the Department of Surgery and 18 from the Department of Medicine. All faculty participants had participated in virtual care during ambulatory care; 2 PGY-1 residents in surgery had not actively participated in virtual care, although they had participated in clinics where faculty were using virtual care. The mean age of faculty participants was 38 (standard deviation [SD] 8.6) years, and the mean age of resident physicians was 29 (SD 5.4) years. Overall, 28 interviews and 4 focus groups (range 2-3 participants per group) were conducted, and 4 themes emerged: teaching and learning, assessment, logistical considerations, and suggestions. Barriers to teaching included the lack of direct observations and teaching time, and barriers to assessment included an absence of specific Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) and feedback focused on virtual care-related competencies. Logistical challenges included lack of technological infrastructure, insufficient private office space and administrative burdens. Both resident physicians and faculty did not foresee virtual care limiting resident physicians' ability to progress within competency-based medical education. Benefits of virtual care included increased accessibility to patients for follow-up visits, for disclosing patients' results and for out-of-town visits. Suggestions included faculty development, improved access to technology and space, educational guidelines for conducting virtual care encounters, and development of virtual care-specific competencies and EPAs. In the postgraduate program we studied, virtual care imposed substantial barriers on teaching, learning and assessment during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapting to new circumstances such as virtual care with suggestions from resident physicians and faculty may help to ensure the continuity of postgraduate medical education throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.","misc","christiaan"

The fugacity model has been widely used to quantify biogeochemical cycles of pesticides due to its clear compartments, simple structure, and easy-accessible data. However, the lack of detailed hydrological processes limits its application for large and heterogeneous watershed. In present study, a new framework was proposed through integration of hydrological processes of SWAT and pesticide fate of fugacity model, and was applied into a typical watershed in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. The results showed that surface runoff, soil erosion, and percolation varied spatiotemporally, which highlighted the importance of considering regional and seasonal heterogeneity of pesticide transport variables in the fugacity model. The amount of dichlorvos (DDV) and chlorpyrifos (CHP) in air, water, soil, and sediment phase were estimated as 0.26 kg, 19.77 kg, 1.06 × 104 kg, and 0.55 kg, respectively. Spatiotemporally, pesticide concentrations in water phase peaked in summer, while the middle and southwest regions of the watershed were identified as the hotspots for pesticide pollution. Compared with the classical model, the new framework provided technical support for the pesticide assessment at watershed scale with heterogeneous hydrological conditions, which can be easily extended to other watersheds, and integrated with other models for comprehensive agricultural management.","misc","christiaan"

They account for 5% of all primary bone tumors and 20% of all benign bone tumors. The clinical features of GCTB include local swelling, pain, and limitations in joint movement. Approximately half of GCTB arise around the knee joint, affecting either the distal femur or proximal tibia. Tissue biopsy reveals an excess of multinucleated giant cells on a stromal cell background, indicating a diagnosis. Intralesional curettage is used to treat GCTB and is associated with minimal disability; however, local recurrence may occur in many patients. Resection and endoprosthetic repair or bone graft reconstruction are often used to treat GCTB near the joint. To our knowledge, there are currently no studies on this topic in the city of Jeddah, where we conducted our study. Our aim was to evaluate the outcome of surgical resection accompanied by denosumab injection compared to that of surgery alone in treating GCTB. All cases of GCTB at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, between January 2008 and December 2018, that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. All cases of GCTB in the pre-specified period were classified as surgical resection with denosumab injection or surgical resection alone. The outcomes of the two modalities were compared. Recurrence was investigated in patients belonging to both the groups. Twenty-six cases that met the inclusion criteria were included in the study and the data were analyzed. The subjects were divided into two groups: denosumab and surgery (n = 7) and surgery alone (n = 19). Patients treated with denosumab and surgery had a higher recurrence rate (57%); however, the difference was not significant (p = 0.407). Our study showed that when comparing local recurrence after curettage in patients treated with denosumab and patients who did not receive it, preoperative denosumab therapy was associated with an increased incidence of local recurrence. We recommend a systematic review that can include more studies in this field to acquire more definitive results regarding this topic.","misc","christiaan"

A careful inspection of the diffraction pattern and subsequent structure refinements indicated that mimetite transforms from the monoclinic to the hexagonal polymorph with increasing temperature. At 123 K, a monoclinic superstructure, mimetite-2M, with cell parameters a = 20.4487 (9),  b = 7.4362 (2), c = 20.4513 (9) Å, β = 119.953 (6)°, V = 2694.5 (2) Å3 and space group P21 was observed. From 173 to 353 K, the reflections of the supercell were evident only along one direction of the corresponding hexagonal apatite-cell and the structure transforms to the polymorph mimetite-M with space group P21/b and unit-cell parameters a = 10.2378 (3), b = 20.4573 (7), c = 7.4457 (2) Å, β = 120.039 (5)°, V = 1349.96 (9) Å3. Only at higher temperature, i.e. 393 K, does mimetite adopt the hexagonal space group P63/m characteristic of apatite structure-types. The role of the electron lone pairs of Pb atoms in the phase transition was investigated through the analysis of the electron localization function (ELF) calculated based on the DFT-geometry optimized structures of the three polymorphs. The changes in spatial distribution of the 6s2 electron density during the phase transitions were explored by means of the Wannier Function Centres (WFCs) derived from ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. In the high-temperature hexagonal structure the 6s2 electrons are spherically symmetric relative to the position of Pb atoms. At low temperature the maximum of 6s2 electron density is displaced relative to the position of Pb atom contributing to the polar interaction in the monoclinic polymorphs.","misc","christiaan"

The World Health Organization estimates an increase in cases in the coming years. The risk factors of HCC are multiple, and the incidence in different countries is closely related to the different risk factors to which the population is exposed. The molecular mechanisms that drive HCC tumorigenesis are extremely complex, but understanding this multistep process is essential for the identification of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic markers. The development of multigenic next-generation sequencing panels through the parallel analysis of multiple markers can provide a landscape of the genomic status of the tumor. Considering the literature and our preliminary data based on 36 HCCs, the most frequently altered genes in HCCs are TERT, CTNNB1, and TP53. Over the years, many groups have attempted to classify HCCs on a molecular basis, but a univocal classification has never been achieved. Nevertheless, statistically significant correlations have been found in HCCs between the molecular signature and morphologic features, and this leads us to think that it would be desirable to integrate the approach between anatomic pathology and molecular laboratories.","misc","christiaan"
"685",35967338,"Plasma protein profiling reveals dynamic immunomodulatory changes in multiple sclerosis patients during pregnancy.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Pregnancy represents a natural modulation of the disease course, where the relapse rate decreases, especially in the 3rd trimester, followed by a transient exacerbation after delivery. Although the exact mechanisms behind the pregnancy-induced modulation are yet to be deciphered, it is likely that the immune tolerance established during pregnancy is involved. In this study, we used the highly sensitive and specific proximity extension assay technology to perform protein profiling analysis of 92 inflammation-related proteins in MS patients (n=15) and healthy controls (n=10), longitudinally sampled before, during, and after pregnancy. Differential expression analysis was performed using linear models and p-values were adjusted for false discovery rate due to multiple comparisons. Our findings reveal gradual dynamic changes in plasma proteins that are most prominent during the 3rd trimester while reverting post-partum. Thus, this pattern reflects the disease activity of MS during pregnancy. Among the differentially expressed proteins in pregnancy, several proteins with known immunoregulatory properties were upregulated, such as PD-L1, LIF-R, TGF-β1, and CCL28. On the other hand, inflammatory chemokines such as CCL8, CCL13, and CXCL5, as well as members of the tumor necrosis factor family, TRANCE and TWEAK, were downregulated. Further in-depth studies will reveal if these proteins can serve as biomarkers in MS and whether they are mechanistically involved in the disease amelioration and worsening. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved may identify new treatment strategies mimicking the pregnancy milieu.","misc","christiaan"

In particular, the binding grammar of TFs in relation to each other, as well as in the context of other genomic elements, is crucial for TF functionality. However, tools to easily uncover co-occurrence between DNA-binding proteins, and investigate the regulatory modules of TFs, are limited. Here we present TF-COMB (Transcription Factor Co-Occurrence using Market Basket analysis) - a tool to investigate co-occurring TFs and binding grammar within regulatory regions. We found that TF-COMB can accurately identify known co-occurring TFs from ChIP-seq data, as well as uncover preferential localization to other genomic elements. With the use of ATAC-seq footprinting and TF motif locations, we found that TFs exhibit both preferred orientation and distance in relation to each other, and that these are biologically significant. Finally, we extended the analysis to not only investigate individual TF pairs, but also TF pairs in the context of networks, which enabled the investigation of TF complexes and TF hubs. In conclusion, TF-COMB is a flexible tool to investigate various aspects of TF binding grammar.","misc","christiaan"

This was a prospective single-center study in which patients with severe symptomatic drug and diet refractory HTG were recruited. Peripheral venous access of upper extremities was used for DFPP. Blood flow rate was 100 - 120 mL/min and plasma separation rate was 800 - 1,000 mL/h. Plasma volume to treat in each case was calculated with the Kaplan formula. Anticoagulation was achieved by low molecular weight heparin. Treatment goal was triglyceride level decreased to normal (< 1.7 mmol/L). Epidemiological data, lipid, hematological parameters as well as side effects were evaluated before and after DFPP. Seven patients (6 males and 1 female) were consecutively enrolled to this trial. There was diabetes mellitus type 2 in four patients and obesity-associated nephropathy in one patient. The mean age was 42.5 years. The average TG level before plasmapheresis was 17.41 mmol/L (range 10.93 - 26.33 mmol/L). After one session, the levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL-c, HDL-c decreased significantly by 58.3%, 43.2%, 41.9%, 20.7%, respectively. The mean number of treatment sessions was 1.5 (range 1 - 3). DFPP was well-tolerated. Except for transient decrease of albumin, globulin and fibrinogen, liver and renal functions, hematological parameters did not change significantly.

It uses data from family firms that have issued A-shares from 2008 to 2018. They used pooled OLS regression for data analysis and Tobit regression for robustness checks. This study classifies family firm types into two categories, namely, the lone-controller family firms (LCFFs) and the multi-controller family firms (MCFFs), with each being further classified as excess or no excess voting rights. Both LCFFs without excess voting rights and MCFFs with excess voting rights have the ability and willingness toward R&D investment. LCFFs with excess voting rights and MCFFs without excess voting rights only have the ability but low willingness to invest in R&D. The study also establishes that Chinese family-controlled firms are heterogeneous toward risky investment. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to differentiate Chinese family firms by their unique ownership structure characteristics in investigating the effect of the family firm structure on R&D investment. The study is a novel attempt to test the willingness and ability framework of LCFFs and MCFFs.

Weight stigma is a significant barrier to delivering quality services and also impairs clinical progress. We intended to study the association of stigma with demographic and clinical variables in obese patients to identify the obstacles in treatment-seeking, so stigma could be adequately addressed to improve clinical outcomes. Methods This study was a retrospective chart review in a Bariatric clinic in a tertiary care hospital. The weight self-stigma questionnaire (WSSQ) was routinely used in the clinic. Demographic and clinical data were collected for 146 obese patients.  Results Female patients (73%) had higher stigma scores. The mean total stigma score was 41.6(SD 3.83), the total self-devaluation score was 21.88(SD 2.10), total fear of enacted stigma was 21.26(SD 2.33). Multivariate analysis revealed an association between stigma with multiple dysfunctional eating patterns like bingeing, overeating, and grazing (Adjusted aOR 3.86, 95% CI- 1.66-8.96) and psychiatric diagnosis (adjusted aOR 3.00, CI- 1.25-7.17). Conclusion This study found an association between stigma and certain clinical variables that maintain and worsen obesity and comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. This highlights the importance of an assessment of mental health and stigma in general practice when dealing with patients with obesity. Treating the underlying psychiatric comorbidities and addressing unhealthy eating behaviors can help reduce self-stigma.

The primary outcome was change in partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio after the first prone positioning session: first, using the entire cohort, and second, using subgroups of patients with diffuse ARDS matched 2 to 1 with patients with focal ARDS at baseline. Ninety-five patients were included (focal ARDS group, 23; diffuse ARDS group, 72). Before prone positioning, the focal ARDS group showed worse oxygenation than the diffuse ARDS group (median PaO2/FiO2 ratio, 79.9 mm Hg [interquartile range (IQR)], 67.7-112.6 vs. 104.0 mm Hg [IQR, 77.6-135.7]; P=0.042). During prone positioning, the focal ARDS group showed a greater improvement in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio than the diffuse ARDS group (median, 55.8 mm Hg [IQR, 11.1-109.2] vs. 42.8 mm Hg [IQR, 11.6-83.2]); however, the difference was not significant (P=0.705).

It is therefore vital to further understand its reproductive biology. We studied a captive troop consisting of five individuals hosted at Jersey Zoo during breeding and non-breeding periods over 1 year. We collected behavioural data (n = 318 h) using all occurrence of some behaviours and ad libitum sampling methods, as well as faecal (n = 54) and anogenital scent (n = 35) samples of the breeding female. We measured sex hormone levels using enzyme immunoassay technique and investigated the volatile component of odour signals using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We observed sexual and aggressive behaviours occasionally during the breeding period. Our regression analysis showed that only period significantly predicted rates of female anogenital scent-marking, whereby the female performed anogenital scent-marking more frequently during the breeding rather than the non-breeding period. In contrast, female hormone levels did not significantly explain variation in rates of neither male nor female olfactory, sexual and affiliative behaviours, suggesting that individuals' behaviour alone is not an effective indicator of the ovulation window. The volatile chemical profile of anogenital odour secretions changed over the study, with four compounds distinguishing the fertile window during the breeding period. In conclusion, our findings suggest that anogenital scent-marking may signal the reproductive status of captive female gentle lemurs.","misc","christiaan"
"1598",35968094,"Analyzing the effect of ion binding to the membrane-surface on regulating the light-induced transthylakoid electric potential (ΔΨm).","The transthylakoid membrane potential (ΔΨm) is essential because it can drive the ATP synthesis through the CF0-CF1 type of ATP-synthase in chloroplasts as an energetic equivalent similar to ΔpH. In addition, a high fraction of proton motive force (PMF) stored as the ΔΨm component is physiologically important in the acclimation of photosynthesis to environmental stresses. It has been shown that ΔΨm is the sum of the Donnan potential difference (ΔΨdn) and the diffusion potential difference (ΔΨd). Specifically, ΔΨdn, ΔΨd, and ΔΨm are strongly associated with the ionic activities near the membrane surface, particularly, the extent of ion binding to the charged/neutral sites adjacent to the membrane surface. However, an in-depth analysis of the effect of altered cationic binding to the membrane surface on adjusting the transthylakoid electric potentials (ΔΨdn, ΔΨd, and ΔΨm) is still missing. This lack of a mechanistic understanding is due to the experimental difficulty of closely observing cations binding to the membrane surface in vivo. In this work, a computer model was proposed to investigate the transthylakoid electric phenomena in the chloroplast focusing on the interaction between cations and the negative charges close to the membrane surface. By employing the model, we simulated the membrane potential and consequently, the measured ECS traces, proxing the ΔΨm, were well described by the computing results on continuous illumination followed by a dark-adapted period. Moreover, the computing data clarified the components of transthylakoid membrane potential, unraveled the functional consequences of altered cationic attachment to the membrane surface on adjusting the transthylakoid electric potential, and further revealed the key role played by Donnan potential in regulating the energization of the thylakoid membrane. The current model for calculating electric potentials can function as a preliminary network for the further development into a more detailed theoretical model by which multiple important variables involved in photosynthesis can be explored.","misc","christiaan"

Therefore, to better understand the impact of metabolic syndrome on age-related hearing loss from the perspective of mitochondrial dysfunction, we reviewed the literature related to the relationship between age-related hearing loss and metabolic syndrome and their components to discern the possible role of mitochondria in both conditions.","misc","christiaan"
"1410",35967606,"The role of legislation in K-12 school discipline: The silence of action.","Researchers have consistently identified the disparity between teachers' practical and legal knowledge regarding teachers' right to discipline students. However, few studies have investigated teachers' construction processes that form construction outcomes, which would help navigate the role of legislation in school discipline. This study contributes to a holistic picture of the neglected disciplinary rights that teachers construct in teaching practice and their underexplored attitude toward the law, using an interview-based constructionist method on twelve teachers of Lvliang city in a Chinese K-12 context. The findings suggest that the participants prefer to acquire discipline knowledge by interacting with multiple power relations in their local environment and that their knowledge is historically and culturally specific. Although the disciplinary right they construct is never static, balanced, or essentialised, the participants' constructions are commonly not in line with legal provisions or the aims of the law. Furthermore, school discipline legislation plays a silent role in empowering teachers to discipline students, but it is more visible in holding back teachers' use of corporal punishment. These findings illustrate the complexity of implementing school disciplinary law as a universal national policy.","misc","christiaan"

However, the lack of consensus on standard operating procedures (SOPs) for deriving, characterising and maintaining primary cells in two- or three-dimensional cultures from eutopic or ectopic endometrium may be hindering progress in this area of research. Guidance for unbiased in vitro research methodologies in the field of reproductive science remains essential to increase confidence in the reliability of in vitro models. We present herein the protocol for a Delphi process to develop a consensus on in vitro methodologies using endometrial cells (ENDOCELL Project). A steering committee composed of leading scientists will select critical methodologies, topics and items that need to be harmonised and that will be included in a Survey. An enlarged panel of experts (ENDOCELL Working Group) will be invited to patriciate in the Survey and provide their ratings to the items to be harmonised. According to Delphi, an iterative investigation method will be adopted. Recommended measures will be finalised by the steering committee. The study received full ethical approval from the Ethical Committee of the Maastricht University (ref. FHML-REC/2021/103).

"274",35969929,"Modelling the rate-dependency of the mechanical behaviour of the aortic heart valve: An experimentally guided theoretical framework.","A theoretical framework, based on extant experimental findings, is presented to devise a novel viscous dissipation function Wv in order to model the rate-dependent mechanical behaviour of the aortic heart valve. The experimental data encompasses Cauchy stress-stretch (σ-λ) curves obtained across a 10,000-fold range of stretch rates (λ˙), from quasi-static (λ˙= 0.001 s-1) to upper-range of physiological (λ˙= 12.4 s-1) deformation rates. The analysis of the data elicits two important trends: (i) the mechanical behaviour of the aortic valve across the tested rates is rate-dependent, with specimens becoming stiffer by increasing rate; and (ii) there appears to be a plateau in the rate-effects on the σ-λ curves; i.e. the rate-effects approach an asymptote with increase in the stretch rate λ˙. Guided by these empirical observations, we devise our new Wv function and demonstrate that the well-known form of the dissipation function commonly used in the literature is a special case of our proposed Wv. The ensuing model is then compared against the experimental σ-λ curves and is shown to provide favourable predictions. An important advantage of the employed modelling framework is that it allows the incorporation of the rate of deformation, which is a direct experimental control parameter, as an explicit modelling variable. The application of the proposed model is thereby recommended for heart valves and other soft tissues that exhibit similar rate-dependent features.","misc","christiaan"

It is shown that this technique can also be used for diffraction mapping in reciprocal space even if a highly collimated beam is not available. The application of the method is demonstrated for various types of epitaxial microcrystals on Si substrates.

A misplaced catheter is one of the reasons contributing to its dysfunction. The present study aimed to describe a case of misplaced PD catheter with an unusual location of the catheter tip. A 61-year-old man undergoing PD for 4 years was investigated for progressive nausea and fatigue of 3 mo. Dialysis adequacy studies indicated inefficient dialysis. Imaging discovered that the PD catheter tip was mispositioned in the pelvic cavity with its tip outside the peritoneal cavity. Despite the dialysate accumulating outside the peritoneal cavity, the patient had not developed perineal or scrotal edema. The patient had experienced a sustainable prolonged dialysis efficacy in this case until the renal function deteriorated further in view of the poor dialysis outcome and worsening health condition. The patient was subsequently transitioned to hemodialysis. Proper placement of the catheter in the peritoneal cavity should always be confirmed and re-checked when necessary in patients undergoing PD to ensure dialytic adequacy.","misc","christiaan"

The Wilcoxon test and linear regression were used to investigate the relationship between sex difference in age-standardized YLD rates and the Human Development Index (HDI). Between 1990 and 2019, the gender disparity in age-standardized YLD rates for NPB-related vision impairment remained stable, increasing from 10.2 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 6.7-14.6] to 10.4 (95% UI 6.9-15.0) for men and 10.3 (95% UI 6.8-14.7) to 10.7 (95% UI 7.2-15.1) for women, with women consistently having higher age-standardized YLD rates. Between the ages of 25 and 75, women had higher YLD rates than males, with the biggest disparity in the 60-64 age group.

There are reports of mood and affect changes in the general population and the suggestion that similar changes occur also in the pregnant population. The greater vulnerability of women during the COVID-19 restriction period may translate into a greater risk for mental disorders in the gestational period. We hypothesised that pregnant women in the pre-pandemic period would have less psychopathology and more psychological support than pregnant women during the pandemic restriction period. To compare pregnant women for anxiety, prenatal depression, psychopathology, and social support before and after the awareness of the pandemic. We administered to women willing to participate in their 2nd-3rd trimesters of pregnancy the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y (STAI-Y), and the Symptom CheckList-90-Revised (SCL-90R); we further collected sociodemographic variables and explored women's social support. The comparison was cross-sectional. The first sample was termed nonCOVID-19 because data were gathered before the COVID-19 outbreak (January 2020-February 2020) was declared, and the second sample termed COVID-19 because participants were already subjected to the COVID-19-related restrictive measures (January 2021-February 2021). Since normal distribution was not met (Shapiro-Wilk test applied), we applied nonparametric Mann-Whitney's U-test to compare psychometric tests. Ethical standards were met. The nonCOVID-19 group reported higher support from partners only, while the COVID-19 group reported multiple support (χ 2 = 9.7181; P = 0.021); the nonCOVID-19 group scored higher than the COVID-19 group only on state anxiety among psychometric scales [STAI-Y1, nonCOVID-19 median = 39 (95%CI: 39.19-51.10) vs COVID-19 median= 32 (95%CI: 30.83-38.90); Mann-Whitney's U=117.5, P = 0.00596]. Other measures did not differ meaningfully between the two groups. Scores on the EPDS, the state and trait subscales of the STAI-Y, and most SCL-90R subscales inter-correlated with one another. The anxiety component of the EPDS, EPDS-3A, correlated poorly with other measures, while it was the Global Symptom Index of the SCL-90-R that correlated most strongly with most measures. Our results are at odds with most literature and do not confirm increased depression and anxiety rates in pregnant women during the pandemic. The ability of pregnant women to deal with novel generalised threats involves mobilization of inner resources. Increasing sources of social support may have produced anxiolysis in the COVID-19 sample.","misc","christiaan"

Here, we introduce the concept of meta-nudging and illustrate its potential benefits in the context of promoting honesty. The meta-nudging approach implies that instead of nudging end-users directly, one would nudge them indirectly via social influencers. That is, one can arguably achieve better success by changing the behavior of those who have the ability to enforce other's behavior and norm adherence. We argue that this represents a promising new behavior change approach that helps overcome some of the challenges that the classical nudging approach has faced.

DSD children had significantly higher somatic anxiety, mental anxiety, and total anxiety scores than the control group (p < 0.001). The scores of the SCARED, anxiety, and depression subscales of DSD children were higher than those of control children (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). The correlation analysis showed that the score of generalized anxiety was positively related to age and entertainment. The regression analysis showed that age was a major factor that affected generalized anxiety in DSD children, and neuroticism was a major factor of anxiety disorder and separation anxiety in DSD children. Children with DSD have obvious anxiety problems, which are associated with family environmental factors (entertainment, success, and conflicts) and age. It is important to focus emphasis on emotional stability in children with DSD for detecting anxiety-related emotional disorders early.","misc","christiaan"

Three distinct initial crystalline geometries are selected as representative of mechanically isotropic materials with low connectivity, mechanically isotropic materials with high connectivity, and mechanically anisotropic materials with intermediate connectivity. Introducing disorder generates spatial fluctuations in the elasticity tensor at the local (joint) scale. Proper coarse-graining reveals a well-defined continuum-level scale elasticity tensor. Increasing disorder aids in making initially anisotropic materials more isotropic. The disorder impact on the material stiffness depends on the lattice connectivity: Increasing the disorder softens lattices with high connectivity and stiffens those with low connectivity, without modifying the scaling between elastic modulus and density (linear scaling for high connectivity and cubic scaling for low connectivity). Introducing disorder in lattices with intermediate fixed connectivity reveals both scaling: the linear scaling occurs for low density, the cubic one at high density, and the crossover density increases with disorder. Contrary to classical formulations, this work demonstrates that connectivity is not the sole parameter governing elastic modulus scaling. It offers a promising route to access novel mechanical properties in lattice materials via disordering the architectures.","misc","christiaan"

Generally, the generated ash is landfilled, particularly in BC, with only a small amount being used beneficially. It is anticipated that the difficulty associated with the management of ash will worsen over time as the industry increases its reliance on green fuel. Thus, there is a strong need to identify beneficial uses of pulp and paper boiler ash for the sake of environmental and economic sustainability. The purpose of this report is to provide the first step in this direction, a review of proposed or implemented uses for coal and hog (or wood) ash around the world. Considering both the properties of the ash and local opportunities, this could be the first step toward screening the applications that may apply to individual mills. Several large-scale practices use ash, such as land application (as a nutrient source or as a liming agent), use in the construction industry (as a replacement for cement or as a fill material), and reclamation of mine sites and stabilization of unpaved forest roads. In some cases, relatively small-scale applications have been used which included uses such as a compost component, agent for pH adjustment of liquid streams and slurries, blasting abrasive, and source of quartz for glass manufacturing to name a few. It is important to note that the chemical nature of both fly and bottom ashes can be quite variable due to the type of wood residues combusted as well as combustion equipment used and must be considered in identifying beneficial applications.","misc","christiaan"

Breast cancer is a major malignancy that is associated with dysregulation of the PI3K signaling pathway. PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss occur in every subtype of breast cancer. PI3K inhibitors are being evaluated in breast cancer after the success of an alpha isoform-specific PI3K inhibitor in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Some preclinical data indicate the potential for PI3K/mTOR targeting in combination with trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer with or without expression of the estrogen receptor. However, the role of this therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer with PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss remains unclear. We examined three HER2-positive, ER-negative breast cancer cell lines to determine the efficacy of a novel alpha isoform-specific PI3K inhibitor in combination with trastuzumab. The results indicated that this combination was effective in PIK3CA-mutant or PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of downstream proteins. PTEN loss by siRNA modulation in parental HER2-positive cancer cells with PI3K signaling pathway alterations could not confer resistance to alpelisib or GDC-0077 plus trastuzumab. We selected the CK-MB-1 cell line without alterations in the PI3K pathway to demonstrate that PI3K inhibitors plus trastuzumab represented a biomarker-specific treatment. In vivo effects of alpelisib plus trastuzumab were tested and confirmed in a mouse model, showing the combination strategy offered the best opportunity to achieve tumor volume reduction. With known safety profiles, this cytotoxic chemotherapy-free regimen warrants further attention as a biomarker-driven strategy for treating HER2-positive breast cancer.","misc","christiaan"

"1539",35967896,"Horse odor exploration behavior is influenced by pregnancy and age.","In spite of a highly developed olfactory apparatus of horses, implying a high adaptive value, research on equine olfaction is sparse. Our limited knowledge on equine olfaction poses a risk that horse behavior does not match human expectations, as horses might react fearful when exposed to certain odors, which humans do not consider as frightening. The benefit of acquiring more knowledge of equine olfaction is therefore twofold; (1) it can aid the understanding of horse behavior and hence reduce the risk of dangerous situations, and (2) there may be unexplored potential of using odors in several practical situations where humans interact with horses. This study investigated behavior and olfactory sensitivity of 35 Icelandic horses who were presented with four odors: peppermint, orange, lavender and cedar wood in a Habituation/Dishabituation paradigm. The response variables were sniffing duration per presentation and behavioral reaction (licking, biting, snorting, and backing), and data were analyzed for potential effects of age, sex and pregnancy. Results showed that habituation occurred between successive odor presentations (1st vs. 2nd and 2nd vs. 3rd presentations: P < 0.001), and dishabituation occurred when a new odor was presented (1st vs. 3rd presentations: P < 0.001). Horses were thus able to detect and distinguish between all four odors, but expressed significantly longer sniffing duration when exposed to peppermint (peppermint vs. orange, lavender and cedar wood: P < 0.001). More horses expressed licking when presented to peppermint compared to cedar wood and lavender (P = 0.0068). Pregnant mares sniffed odors less than non-pregnant mares (P = 0.030), young horses (age 0-5 years) sniffed cedar wood for longer than old horses (P = 0.030), whereas sex had no effect (P > 0.050). The results show that horses' odor exploration behavior and interest in odors varies with age and pregnancy and that horses naïve to the taste of a substrate, may be able to link smell with taste, which has not been described before. These results can aid our understanding of horses' behavioral reactions to odors, and in the future, it may be possible to relate these to the physiology and health of horses.","misc","christiaan"
"864",35982554,"The economics of sediment quality on barrier shoreline restoration.","This paper depicts a simulation-based assessment of sediment quality on the performance of dedicated dredging projects for barrier island restoration in coastal Louisiana, USA. The research involved the development and integration of two sub-models. In the first, geomorphic modeling was used to simulate sediment transport dynamics within a proxy barrier island template over a 50-year trajectory. The template was assumed to be nourished with one of two sources of dredged material: nearshore (NS) sediments of lower quality (smaller grain diameter, higher organic fines); or higher quality sediments from distal sources located on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). In the second model, agency project records and commercial bids were used to estimate project construction costs as a function of dredge material quantity, transport distance, and project target elevation. These sub-models were coupled within a net present value framework from which average annual break-even values for ecosystem services (EBEV) were derived as an efficiency metric for comparing the economic performance of NS- and OCS-sourced projects. Results indicate that in some cases, the physical resiliency afforded by even small increases in sand diameter (+4 μm d50) can translate to greater long-term economic viability (lower EBEV) for OCS-sourced sediment transported over longer distances. Moreover, projects constructed with much higher diameter OCS sediment (+44 μm d50) with low fines and transported over relatively long distances (200 μm, 5% fines, 15-20 miles) were found to be more cost-effective than all comparably-sized projects constructed with lower quality NS sediments obtained from proximal sources (156 μm, 20% fines, 3-5 miles). For some comparisons, this quality advantage yielded a lower EBEV for OCS-sourced projects with transport distances exceeding 30 miles. Under storm-punctuated simulations, these quality advantages were more pronounced, with greater physical and economic implications for earlier (Y5) versus later (Y20) occurring storms. Budgeting for dedicated dredging projects has traditionally centered on the value of sediment as a commodity, with a focus on material placement cost. The findings of this study, however, indicate that a more comprehensive accounting of sediment quality and performance is required to maximize the economic efficiency of coastal restoration spending.","misc","christiaan"

Patients diagnosed with primary hvKp pneumonia were included, and their clinical data were analyzed, including the baseline characteristics and CT imaging results. After hypermucoviscosity phenotyping, the strains, serological types, and virulence genes of hvKp were identified using multiplex PCR. Twelve patients with primary hvKp pneumonia were included (11 males, 1 female). All patients were infected via respiratory tract inhalation. Ten patients were long-term drinkers. Four patients (33.3%), who were long-term alcohol abusers, died within 30 days after diagnosis. No extrapulmonary metastatic infection was found in any patient. The imaging of lung lesions at the early disease stage exhibited an extensive consolidation in the lungs. As the disease progressed, the most common imaging features were pleural effusion (9/12), cavitation and necrosis (8/12), and pneumothorax (3/12). The serological typing of the capsular polysaccharides on hvKp strains were K1 (6/12) and K2 (6/12). Furthermore, the virulence genotyping showed rmpA (11/12), magA (11/12), ureA (12/12), mrkD (12/12), fim-1 (12/12), wabG (12/12), ybtS (12/12), and iucB (11/12). Primary severe community-acquired hvKp-associated pneumonia is more common in men, especially those with a long-term history of alcohol consumption. CT scanning at the early disease stage mostly showed extensive pulmonary consolidation, which was prone to be combined with cavitation, necrosis, and pleural effusion. K1 and K2 serotypes were identified among the hvKp strains, which were not prone to form extrapulmonary metastasis via the bloodstream.","misc","christiaan"

Existing data on prognostic imaging features, as well as the associated morbidity and mortality, are limited and variable. We therefore reviewed cases of tDSMs diagnosed on fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at our referral center to identify pre- and postnatal MRI imaging features associated with long-term outcomes. We searched our imaging database for fetal and postnatal MRI reports of tDSM cases. The electronic medical record was then reviewed for pre- and postnatal clinical data, including follow-up imaging. Neurological outcomes were characterized using the previously reported scale based on the Bicêtre Score. Imaging features association with outcome scores were compared using the Fisher exact test. Sixteen cases of tDMS diagnosed by fetal MRI with postnatal clinical follow-up were identified, 11 of whom underwent postnatal MRI. The majority of cases of tDSM (73%) decreased in size or resolved on postnatal follow-up study without treatment. Restricted diffusion and parenchymal hemorrhage on fetal MRI were the only imaging features identified significantly associated with unfavorable neurological outcome or death, present in two patients with poor outcomes (two of two) and only one with a normal outcome (one of 14) (P = 0.025). Findings of tDSM on fetal MRI most often regress and/or resolve with normal or mild neurological outcomes, with the most significant predictor of poor outcome being the presence of parenchymal injury on fetal MRI.

Thus, this study investigated changes in hydrolysable tannins, phenolic acids, sugar profile, standard physicochemical parameters, and antioxidant-scavenging capacity of wild-harvested Kakadu plum fruits at four different maturity stages, from immature to fully mature. Fruits harvested <25, 25-50, 50-75, and 75-100% degree of fullness were classified as highly immature (stage 1), immature (stage 2), semi-mature (stage 3), and fully mature (stage 4), respectively. Results showed that chebulagic acid, geraniin, chebulinic acid, castalagin, punicalagin, and gallic acid continuously decreased during fruit maturity, while elaeocarpusin, helioscopin B, corilagin, 3,4,6-tri-O-galloyl-S-glucose, and ellagic acid increased at the beginning of fruit growth (from stage 1 to 2), but decreased when the fruits reached their full maturity (stage 4). The levels of hydrolysable tannins and phenolic acids in fully mature fruits (stage 4) were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) lower than that in their immature counterparts (stages 1 and 2). Total phenolic content (TPC) and DPPH antioxidant radical-scavenging activity did not vary significantly between different maturity stages. Pearson's correlation coefficient test indicated that TPC and DPPH positively (p ≤ 0.05) correlate with most of the studied tannin compounds. Sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose), total soluble solid content, and titratable acidity increased during the fruit development. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the difference between the immature and mature samples, based on their nutritional profile and bioactive compounds. The PCA results also suggested a considerable variability between the individual trees, highlighting the challenges of wild-harvest practice.","misc","christiaan"
"214",35968381,"The effect of photobiomodulation on the brain during wakefulness and sleep.","Over the last seventy years or so, many previous studies have shown that photobiomodulation, the use of red to near infrared light on body tissues, can improve central and peripheral neuronal function and survival in both health and in disease. These improvements are thought to arise principally from an impact of photobiomodulation on mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial mechanisms in a range of different cell types, including neurones. This impact has downstream effects on many stimulatory and protective genes. An often-neglected feature of nearly all of these improvements is that they have been induced during the state of wakefulness. Recent studies have shown that when applied during the state of sleep, photobiomodulation can also be of benefit, but in a different way, by improving the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and the clearance of toxic waste-products from the brain. In this review, we consider the potential differential effects of photobiomodulation dependent on the state of arousal. We speculate that the effects of photobiomodulation is on different cells and systems depending on whether it is applied during wakefulness or sleep, that it may follow a circadian rhythm. We speculate further that the arousal-dependent photobiomodulation effects are mediated principally through a biophoton - ultra-weak light emission - network of communication and repair across the brain.","misc","christiaan"

However, current BCIs are unable to sufficiently use the information from time and frequency domains simultaneously. Thus, we proposed a novel hybrid time-frequency paradigm to investigate better ways of using the time and frequency information. We adopt multiple omitted stimulus potential (OSP) and steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP) to design the hybrid paradigm. A series of pre-experiments were undertaken to study factors that would influence the feasibility of the hybrid paradigm and the interaction between multiple features. After that, a novel Multiple Time-Frequencies Sequential Coding (MTFSC) strategy was introduced and explored in experiments. Omissions with multiple short and long durations could effectively elicit time and frequency features, including the multi-OSP, ERP, and SSVEP in this hybrid paradigm. The MTFSC was feasible and efficient. The preliminary online analysis showed that the accuracy and the ITR of the nine-target stimulator over thirteen subjects were 89.04% and 36.37 bits/min. This study first combined the SSMVEP and multi-OSP in a hybrid paradigm to produce robust and abundant time features for coding BCI. Meanwhile, the MTFSC proved feasible and showed great potential in improving performance, such as expanding the number of BCI targets by better using time information in specific stimulated frequencies. This study holds promise for designing better BCI systems with a novel coding method.","misc","christiaan"

"70",35967843,"Antibiotic and antifungal use in pediatric leukemia and lymphoma patients are associated with increasing opportunistic pathogens and decreasing bacteria responsible for activities that enhance colonic defense.","Due to decreased immunity, both antibiotics and antifungals are regularly used in pediatric hematologic-cancer patients as a means to prevent severe infections and febrile neutropenia. The general effect of antibiotics on the human gut microbiome is profound, yielding decreased diversity and changes in community structure. However, the specific effect on pediatric oncology patients is not well-studied. The effect of antifungal use is even less understood, having been studied only in mouse models. Because the composition of the gut microbiome is associated with regulation of hematopoiesis, immune function and gastrointestinal integrity, changes within the patient gut can have implications for the clinical management of hematologic malignancies. The pediatric population is particularly challenging because the composition of the microbiome is age dependent, with some of the most pronounced changes occurring in the first three years of life. We investigated how antibiotic and antifungal use shapes the taxonomic composition of the stool microbiome in pediatric patients with leukemia and lymphoma, as inferred from both 16S rRNA and metagenome data. Associations with age, antibiotic use and antifungal use were investigated using multiple analysis methods. In addition, multivariable differential abundance was used to identify and assess specific taxa that were associated with multiple variables. Both antibiotics and antifungals were linked to a general decline in diversity in stool samples, which included a decrease in relative abundance in butyrate producers that play a critical role in host gut physiology (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Anaerostipes, Dorea, Blautia),. Furthermore, antifungal use was associated with a significant increase in relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens. Collectively, these findings have important implications for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma patients. Butyrate is important for gastrointestinal integrity; it inhibits inflammation, reinforces colonic defense, mucosal immunity. and decreases oxidative stress. The routine use of broad-spectrum anti-infectives in pediatric oncology patients could simultaneously contribute to a decline in gastrointestinal integrity and colonic defense while promoting increases in opportunistic pathogens within the patient gut. Because the gut microbiome has been linked to both short-term clinical outcomes, and longer-lasting health effects, systematic characterization of the gut microbiome in pediatric patients during, and beyond, treatment is warranted.","misc","christiaan"
"1346",35967628,"The impact of implicit theories on resilience among Chinese nurses: The chain mediating effect of grit and meaning in life.","Implicit theories refer to assumptions people hold about different domains, also known as mindsets. There are two implicit theories on the malleability of one's ability: entity theory and incremental theory. They constrain and regulate people's understanding and responses to an individual's behavior, leading to different social cognitive patterns and behavioral responses. Resilience is a positive adaptation in highly stressful situations that represents mechanisms for coping with and transcending difficult experiences, i.e., a person's ability to successfully adapt to change, resist the adverse effects of stressors, avoid significant dysfunction, and be chronically affected by considered a protective factor for mental health. Although previous studies showed that individuals' implicit theories are associated with resilience, this relationship has received little attention in the nursing population. It is unclear which variables may contribute to explaining the relationship between implicit theories and resilience. Therefore, the current study aims to deeply explore the relationship between implicit theories and the resilience of Chinese nurses. In addition, we also seek to demonstrate the chain mediating effects of grit and meaning in life on this relationship. We surveyed 709 Chinese nurses through online questionnaires using the self-made demographic questionnaire, the Implicit Theories Scale, the Short Grit Scale, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. After controlling for demographic variables such as age, gender, educational background, marital status, professional title, and working years, the results reveal positive associations between Chinese nurses' implicit theories and their resilience, and grit and meaning in life play a partial mediating role in this relationship, respectively. Furthermore, grit and meaning in life play a chain mediating role between implicit theories and resilience. These findings contribute to understanding the psychological impact mechanism of implicit theories on nurses' resilience and provide a theoretical basis for nursing managers to formulate strategies to improve nurses' psychological resilience.","misc","christiaan"

We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2019 on a consecutive sample of children and adolescents (10-18 years) diagnosed with DM-T1. The outcome was a risk for DKD estimated using standard predictors: age, urinary albumin, eGFR, serum creatinine, DM-T1 duration, HbA1c, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI). We conducted the analysis using structural equation modeling. We enrolled 75 children, 36 girls and 39 boys with the median interquartile range (IQR) age of 14 (11-16) years and a median (IQR) duration of DM-T1 of 6 (4-9) years. The three focal predictors (cystatin C, resistance index, and urinary KIM-1) were significantly associated with the estimated risk for DKD. Raw path coefficients for cystatin C were 3.16 [95% CI 0.78; 5.53; p = 0.009, false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%], for renal resistance index were -8.14 (95% CI -15.36; -0.92; p = 0.027; FDR < 5%), and for urinary KIM-1 were 0.47 (95% CI 0.02; 0.93; p = 0.040; FDR < 5%).

Evidence has suggested that patients with mTBI can suffer from long-lasting cognitive deficits, persistent symptoms, and decreased quality of life. Sleep disorders are commonly observed after TBI, with the prevalence rate of sleep disturbances in persons with TBI being much higher than that in the general population. Poor sleep quality can impair cognitive functions in the general population. This effect of sleep disturbances may impede the recovery processes in the population with TBI. The objective of this study is to add to our understanding of the relationship between self-reported sleep problems and other post-concussion symptoms and look at the association between early sleep problems and long-term outcomes in mTBI. Post-concussion symptoms, neurocognitive functions, level of global outcomes, and rating of satisfaction of life were assessed in 64 patients with mTBI. The results revealed that the presence of sleep disturbances co-occur with an increased level of overall post-concussion symptoms at the subacute stage of mTBI, particularly with symptoms including poor concentration, memory problems, and irritability. In addition, sleep disturbance at the subacute stage is associated with persistent poor concentration and memory problems, as well as worse neurocognitive function, slower overall recovery, and lower satisfactory of life at the long term. Our findings suggest that sleep disturbance can be a prognostic factor of long-term outcomes after mTBI. Early interventions to improve sleep quality can have potential benefits to facilitate the recovery process from mTBI.","misc","christiaan"

This study sought to investigate the impact of number of GDMT medications prescribed for HFrEF on all-cause mortality in recipients of primary prevention ICD. A cohort of 4,972 recipients with primary prevention ICD (n = 3,210) or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) (n = 1,762) was studied. The association of number of GDMT medications prescribed at the time of device implantation and all-cause mortality at 2 years post implantation was examined. In our primary prevention cohort, 5%, 20%, 52%, and 23% of patients were prescribed 0, 1, 2, or 3-4 GDMT medications, respectively. After risk adjustment for age, sex, ejection fraction, body mass index, the Elixhauser comorbidity score, the type of cardiomyopathy, and the year of device implantation, each additional GDMT conferred a reduction in the risk of death of 36% in recipients of ICD (HR: 0.64; P < 0.001) and 30% in recipients of CRT-D (HR: 0.70; P < 0.001). A higher number of prescribed GDMT medications is associated with an incremental 1-year survival in recipients of primary prevention ICD with or without CRT. Initiation of maximum number of tolerated GDMT medications should therefore be the goal for all patients with HFrEF.

Between January 2010 to January 2020, out of 1,030 eligible patients requiring VA-ECMO, 427 with analyzable vascular screening were included. Duplex sonography and/or CT scan after decannulation were used to screen for thrombosis and pulmonary embolism as well as arterial complications. Near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) was established at the time of cannulation and was continuously monitored during the ECMO therapy. The prevalence of venous complications was 27%. Thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were observed in 21 and 7% of patients, respectively. Pulmonary embolism was more frequently diagnosed in patients with thrombosis (22 vs. 3%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, cannulation in the jugular vein was determined as a risk factor for venous thrombosis in contrast to the extent of anticoagulation. The prevalence of arterial complications was 37%, mainly ischemia followed by bleeding, dissection, and compartment syndrome. Vascular surgery was necessary for 19% of the patients, of whome 1% required major amputations. A distal perfusion cannula (DPC) was implanted at cannulation in 24% of patients and secondarily in 16% of patients after cannulation as required during ECMO support. In the multivariate analysis, risk factors for leg ischemia at the time of cannulation were elevated D-dimers, lower NIRS on the cannulated leg, and lack of a DPC. The best discriminative parameter was the difference in NIRS between the non-cannulated leg and the cannulated leg. In contrast, during ECMO support, only the lack of a DPC was associated with leg ischemia. A similar rate of complications associated with decannulation, mainly arterial thrombosis, ischemia, or bleeding, was seen with percutaneous and surgical approaches (18 vs. 17%, p = 0.295). Patients requiring VA ECMO should be routinely screened for vascular complications. The decision to insert a DPC should be evaluated individually. However, NIRS monitoring of the cannulated leg and the non-cannulated leg is essential to identify the legs at risk for critical ischemia. As complications associated with decannulation were equally distributed between percutaneous and surgical approaches, the applied method may be chosen according to local experience.","misc","christiaan"

Prescription data on antiviral drugs were extracted from the database of the Hospital Prescription Analysis Program of China according to the inclusion criteria. Yearly prescriptions and costs were calculated, and trends were analyzed. The trends were further stratified by age, sex, and specific drug use. The distribution of defined daily costs (DDCs) of valaciclovir and famciclovir were analyzed, and trends in the median DDCs were identified. A total of 132,911 prescriptions from 49 hospitals located in six major areas of China were included in the analysis. The yearly prescriptions containing antivirals increased from 8,819 in 2010 to 16,361 in 2019. The percentage of prescriptions for patients aged 65 years and above also increased (27.7% in 2010 to 31.0% in 2019), and the number of prescriptions for females was higher than those for males (P < 0.001). The average cost of antivirals per prescription decreased; thus, the yearly cost showed no increasing trend. The main prescribed antivirals were valaciclovir and famciclovir, which progressively increased in prescriptions. The use of acyclovir decreased during the study period. Prescriptions containing topical formulations, acyclovir and penciclovir, both increased. The DDCs of valaciclovir and famciclovir decreased dramatically. The use of antivirals has increased over the decade, while the cost has not. Antiviral treatments adhere well to recent recommendations, except for the use of topical antivirals. The findings of this study may benefit the healthcare source allocation and management of herpes zoster in China.","misc","christiaan"

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit and brain is the preferred imaging modality to diagnose and define extent of disease as well as to assess response to therapy. Sometimes, it may be difficult to differentiate the presence of active residual disease from therapy-related changes based on posttreatment completion MRI. RB patients who completed treatment between January 2017 and October 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. We evaluated the utility of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) to predict active disease in RB patients who continued to have residual disease on MRI at completion of treatment. Out of the 89 patients who completed treatment, dilemma regarding remission status was present in 11 children. All 11 patients underwent FDG-PET-CT. None of them had evidence of metabolically active disease in the orbit, optic nerve, brain, or rest of the body. After a median follow-up of 24 months, no children developed any evidence of disease progression in the form of local or distant relapse. Our results showed that in MRI doubtful cases, a nonavid FDG-PET is reassuring in avoiding further therapy as long as close follow-up can be ensured. FDG-PET-CT may emerge as a useful functional modality to predict disease activity in RB.","misc","christiaan"

The aim of the present study was to explore whether AKIP1 can affect the proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis of ccRCC cells via its interaction with Rac1. Furthermore, the influence of AKIP1 and therefore Rac1 on the expression of the downstream ERK/cellular (c)-Myc signaling pathway was explored. The interaction between AKIP1 and Rac1 was determined using co-immunoprecipitation. The mRNA and protein expression levels of AKIP1 and Rac1 in normal renal epithelial cell lines and ccRCC cell lines were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. The transfection efficiency of small interfering RNA-AKIP1 and the Rac1 overexpression vector were also confirmed using RT-qPCR and western blotting. The viability, proliferation, invasion and migration of ccRCC cells following transfection were analyzed using the Cell Counting Kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine staining, Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. The tube formation ability of HUVECs was assessed using the tube formation assay. The protein expression levels of proliferation, invasion, migration and tube-formation-associated proteins as well as proteins associated with the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway, were detected via western blotting. The results demonstrated that AKIP1 expression levels were increased in ccRCC cell lines. AKIP1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of ccRCC cells and HUVEC tube-formation. In addition, AKIP1 was demonstrated to bind to Rac1 in ccRCC cells and AKIP1 downregulation inhibited Rac1 expression. Furthermore, Rac1 overexpression reversed the effects of AKIP1 knockdown on ccRCC cells. AKIP1 knockdown also suppressed the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway, which was reversed by Rac1 overexpression. In conclusion, AKIP1 knockdown potentially suppressed the proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis of ccRCC cells and inhibited the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway by binding to Rac1.","misc","christiaan"

It has a prevailing transmission rate and continues to be a global burden. There is a paucity of data regarding the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in COVID-19. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate lncRNAs, particularly NEAT1 and TUG1, and their association with IL-6, CCL2, and TNF-α in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe disease. Methods: The study was conducted on 80 COVID-19 patients (35 with severe and 45 with moderate infection) and 40 control subjects. Complete blood count (CBC), D-dimer assay, serum ferritin, and CRP were assayed. qRT-PCR was used to measure RNAs and lncRNAs. Results: NEAT1 and TUG1 expression levels were higher in COVID-19 patients compared with controls (P<0.001). Furthermore, CCL2, IL-6, and TNF-α expressions were higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (P<0.001). CCL2 and IL-6 expression levels were significantly higher in patients with severe compared to those with moderate COVID-19 infection (P<0.001). IL-6 had the highest accuracy in distinguishing COVID-19 patients (AUC=1, P<0.001 at a cutoff of 0.359), followed by TUG1 (AUC=0.999, P<0.001 at a cutoff of 2.28). NEAT1 and TUG1 had significant correlations with the measured cytokines, and based on the multivariate regression analysis, NEAT1 is the independent predictor for survival in COVID-19 patients (P=0.02). Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients, significant overexpression of NEAT1 and TUG1 was observed, consistent with cytokine storm. TUG1 could be an efficient diagnostic biomarker, whereas NEAT1 was an independent predictor for overall survival.","misc","christiaan"

The present study aimed to investigate whether stool form consistency affected defecation pain after hemorrhoidectomy. A prospective, cohort, observational study where patients scheduled for hemorrhoidal surgery were analyzed. This study used two patient-reported scales to study parameters based on the first postoperative defecation. The Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) and visual analog scale (VAS) assessed stool consistency and defecation pain. The association between stool consistency and defecation pain intensity was assessed using multiple linear regression analysis. Where there was evidence of non-linearity, we applied a restricted cubic spline with three knots to explore the non-linear association. We performed a non-linear regression analysis to estimate the association. A total of 179 patients were analyzed. The regression model results demonstrated that these scales negatively correlated with statistical significance (p = 0.003). This study showed that the softer the stool, the less painful the defecation. Surgeons should attempt to induce a patient to avoid hard stool after surgery.

Combining conventional methods with newer biologically based treatments such as immunotherapy can be a promising approach to treating different tumors. The concept of cancer immunoediting that occurs in the field of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is the aspect of cancer therapy that has not been at the center of attention. One group of the role players of the so-called immunoediting process are the immune checkpoint molecules that exert either co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory effects in the anti-tumor immunity of the host. It involves alterations in a wide variety of immunologic pathways. Recent studies have proven that conventional cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of them, i.e., chemoradiotherapy, alter the immune compartment of the TME. The mentioned changes encompass a wide range of variations, including the changes in the density and immunologic type of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the alterations in the expression patterns of the different immune checkpoints. These rearrangements can have either anti-tumor immunity empowering or immune attenuating sequels. Thus, recognizing the consequences of various chemo(radio)therapeutic regimens in the TME seems to be of great significance in the evolution of therapeutic approaches. Therefore, the present review intends to summarize how chemo(radio)therapy affects the TME and specifically some of the most important, well-known immune checkpoints' expressions according to the recent studies in this field.","misc","christiaan"

Following ECDC protocol we surveyed 1382 patients across three years. Bivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between HAI and several variables. Those statistically significant were included in a stepwise multiple regression model. The goodness of fit of the latter model was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, ultimately constructing a probability curve to estimate the risk of developing HAIs. Three variables resulted statistically significant in the stepwise logistic regression model: length of stay (OR 1.03; 95% CI: 1.02-1.05), devices breaking the skin (i.e. peripheral or central vascular catheter, OR 4.38; 95% CI: 1.52-12.63), urinary catheter (OR 4.71; 95% CI: 2.78-7.98).

"1266",35982576,"Dynamics of soil organic carbon and nitrogen and their relations to hydrothermal variability in dryland.","Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles of terrestrial ecosystems play key roles in global climate change and ecosystem sustainability. In recent decades, climate change has threatened the nutrient balance of dryland ecosystems. However, its impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) in drylands of China are still unclear. In this study, the structural equation model (SEM) was used to explain the relationship between environmental variables used by the best model and SOC or STN. Then Adaptive Boosting Regressor (AdaBoost), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBRT), Extreme gradient boosting Regression (XGBoost) and Random Forest Regression (RF) were used to establish the prediction model of SOC and STN based on soil samples along with environmental variables. The performance of these models was assessed based on a 10-fold cross-validation method using three statistical indicators. Finally, we predicted the SOC and STN of soil samples from 2000 to 2019 based on the best model. Overall, the RF model performed better at predicting SOC and STN in drylands than the other three prediction models (AdaBoost, GBRT, XGBoost). Climate factors were the main factors affecting SOC and STN in the study area. In the Alashan, a dryland in northern China, the precipitation in the growing season increased from 2000 to 2019, at a rate of 12.9 mm/decade. During the same period, the annual sunshine duration significantly decreased by 66 h/decade. Along with interannual hydrothermal variability, SOC showed a fluctuating upward trend at a rate of 0.04 g/kg/decade, while STN exhibited a fluctuating downward trend at 0.003 g/kg/decade from 2000 to 2019. Due to the effects of climate change, dryland were considered as potential sites for carbon sequestration. However, due to the annual hydrothermal variance causing dynamic annual changes, it was deemed unstable. Moreover, it would cause STN loss, which might reduce soil fertility. More attention should be paid to STN monitoring in dryland in the future.","misc","christiaan"

A previous study by the authors indicated that TMEM121 is highly expressed in adult mouse hearts and acts as an inhibitor of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. In the present study, the association between TMEM121 and cancer was investigated using bioinformatics tools, including Tumour Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 2.0, cBioPortal, LinkedOmics analysis, Kaplan-Meier plotter and UALCAN analysis. The expression, genetic variation, gene interaction network and co-expression pattern of TMEM121 in tumours were analysed. The results revealed that TMEM121 was expressed in various tumours and significantly downregulated in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC) when compared with its expression in paracancerous tissues, whereas the methylation level of its promoter was increased in tumour tissues. Additionally, associations between TMEM121 and the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, as well as the expression of cancer-related molecules, were detected. The aforementioned bioinformatics analysis suggests that TMEM121 may be involved in the development of cervical cancer. Therefore, gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in HeLa cells were conducted to verify the role of TMEM121 in cervical cancer. The assay using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) revealed that the cell viability of HeLa cells with TMEM121 overexpression was significantly reduced. High TMEM121 expression inhibited HeLa cell migration, as indicated by the decrease in the cell scratch healing rate. The western blot assay revealed that TMEM121 overexpression downregulated the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), cyclin D1, cyclin E2 and phosphorylated (p)-AKT, while upregulating that of p27, E-cadherin and p-p38. When TMEM121 was knocked down, retinoblastoma protein (RB), p53, p27, E-cadherin, p-JNK and p-p38 were inhibited, but cyclin E1 was promoted. By combining bioinformatics and experimental biology in the present study, the results demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that TMEM121 may be a novel inhibitor of cervical cancer that is linked to multiple signalling pathways, paving the way for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","misc","christiaan"

Recent years effective chemotherapy have improved the 5-year survival in osteosarcoma patients to up to 60%-70%. Still, there is a lack of novel therapeutic strategies to enhance further survival. Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of pretreatment inflammatory-based parameters, including PLT, NLR, and SII, as prognostic indicators of survival in pediatric osteosarcoma patients. A total of 86 pediatric osteosarcoma patients between 2012 and 2021 in the Department of Orthopedics or tumor Surgery of Children's Hospital affiliated to Chongqing Medical University were retrospectively analyzed. The clinicopathological variables and systematic inflammatory biomarkers, including NLR, PLR and SII, was performed by the A Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Cox proportional risk regression model. According to the results of multivariate analysis, a prognostic nomogram was generated, and the concordance index (C-index) was calculated to predict the performance of the established nomogram. The survival curve was plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis showed that TNM stage, tumor size, NLR value, PLR value, SII value, neutrophil count and platelet count were related to CSS (p < 0.05). According to multivariate analysis, only TNM stage (p = 0.006) and SII values (p = 0.015) were associated with poor prognosis.To further predict survival in pediatric osteosarcoma patients, multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to predict cancer-specific survival at 1, 3 and 5 years. And constructed a nomogram model to predict children's CSS. The C-index of the nomogram is 0.776 (95%CI, 0.776-0.910), indicating that the model has good accuracy. Preoperative SII and TNM staging are independent prognostic markers for pediatric osteosarcoma patients. SII may be used in conjunction with TNM staging for individualized treatment of pediatric osteosarcoma patients in future clinical work.","misc","christiaan"

The spectra from both phases are interpreted with the assistance of high-level electronic structure and ab initio molecular dynamics calculations. In addition to the regular Auger-Meitner-electron features, we observe electron emission at kinetic energies of 374-388 eV, above the leading Auger-Meitner peak (3a1 2). Based on the electronic structure calculations, we assign this peak to a shake-up satellite in the gas phase, i.e., Auger-Meitner emission from an intermediate state with additional valence excitation present. The high-energy contribution is significantly enhanced in the liquid phase. We consider various mechanisms contributing to this feature. First, in analogy with other hydrogen-bonded liquids (noticeably water), the high-energy signal may be a signature for an ultrafast proton transfer taking place before the electronic decay (proton transfer mediated charge separation). The ab initio dynamical calculations show, however, that such a process is much slower than electronic decay and is, thus, very unlikely. Next, we consider a non-local version of the Auger-Meitner decay, the Intermolecular Coulombic Decay. The electronic structure calculations support an important contribution of this purely electronic mechanism. Finally, we discuss a non-local enhancement of the shake-up processes.","misc","christiaan"

This work is aimed to study the inter-annual variability of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations and chemical composition in an urban background site (Italy). A dataset of daily PM2.5 and PM10 was collected in the period 2016-2017, including the content of OC, EC, major water-soluble ions, main metals, and compared to a similar dataset collected in the period 2013-2014. Oxidative potential using DTT assay (dithiothreitol) was evaluated and expressed in DTTV as 0.39 nmol/min·m3 in PM10 and 0.29 in PM2.5 nmol/min·m3. PM source apportionment was computed using the EPA PMF5.0 model and source contributions compared with those of a previous dataset collected between 2013 and 2014. Multi linear regression analysis identified which source contributed (p < 0.05) to the oxidative potential of each size fraction. Inter-annual trends were more evident on PM2.5 with reductions of biomass burning contribution and increases in traffic contribution in the 2016-2017 period. Crustal contributions were similar for the two periods, in both size fractions. Carbonates were comparable in PM10 with a slight increase in PM2.5. Sea spray decreased in PM10. The DTTV of PM2.5 peaked during cold periods, while, the DTTV of the PM10-2.5 fraction peaked in summer, suggesting that different sources, with different seasonality, influence OP in the PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 fractions.

A 48-year-old female presented with cardiac arrest due to VF without any history of cardiovascular disease or family history of sudden cardiac death. Troponin I was elevated at 0.698 ng/mL, but coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease. Substance abuse testing showed elevated benzodiazepine and sertraline levels, which she was taking for anxiety. Electrocardiogram showed normal QRS complexes without prolonged PR or QTc intervals.

The present studies evaluate neurosteroid actions upon TLR activation in human macrophages from male and female healthy donors. Buffy coat leukocytes were obtained from donors at the New York Blood Center (http://nybloodcenter.org/), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and cultured to achieve macrophage differentiation. TLR4 and TLR7 were activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or imiquimod in the presence/absence of allopregnanolone or related neurosteroids and pro-inflammatory markers were detected by ELISA or western blotting. Cultured human monocyte-derived-macrophages exhibited typical morphology, a mixed immune profile of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers, with no sex difference at baseline. Allopregnanolone inhibited TLR4 activation in male and female donors, preventing LPS-induced elevations of TNF-α, MCP-1, pCREB and pSTAT1. In contrast, 3α,5α-THDOC and SGE-516 inhibited the TLR4 pathway activation in female, but not male donors. Allopregnanolone completely inhibited TLR7 activation by imiquimod, blocking IL-1-β, IL-6, pSTAT1 and pIRF7 elevations in females only. 3α,5α-THDOC and SGE-516 partially inhibited TLR7 activation, only in female donors. The results indicate that allopregnanolone inhibits TLR4 and TLR7 activation in cultured human macrophages resulting in diminished cytokine/chemokine production. Allopregnanolone inhibition of TLR4 activation was found in males and females, but inhibition of TLR7 signals exhibited specificity for female donors. 3α,5α-THDOC and SGE-516 inhibited TLR4 and TLR7 pathways only in females.

In a series of in vitro experiments to further investigate the mechanisms of MTX activity, we found that MTX did not inhibit effector cytokine production but inhibited T cell proliferation downstream of mTOR activation, mitochondrial function, and cell cycle entry. This inhibitory effect was reversible with folinic acid, suggesting low-dose MTX exerts anti-inflammatory effects in vivo in PWH largely by blocking T cell proliferation via dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, yet daily administration of folic acid did not rescue this effect in trial participants. Our findings identify the main mechanism of action of this widely used anti-inflammatory medicine in PWH and may provide insight into how MTX works in the setting of other inflammatory conditions.","misc","christiaan"
"1837",35975051,"A turn-on fluorescent probe with high selectivity for Hg2+ and its applications in living cells.","A novel fluorescent probe L with a rhodamine B lactam structure modified with 3-methyl-2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde has been prepared based on the thiophilicity of Hg2+. The probe L exhibits a unique response with an off-on-type mode towards Hg2+ among other biologically relevant metal cations. The limit of detection (LOD) for probe L is 1.5 ppb. In addition, in the presence of Hg2+, the probe L shows a colorimetric response from colorless to pink. The recognition behavior of probe L towards Hg2+ has been investigated by 1H NMR titration experiments, Job's plot, and MS and IR analyses. As a result, the ligation between the probe and Hg2+ leads to the scission of the spirolactam bond of free L and the restoration of its conjugated structure, which can give rise to the fluorescence enhancement of the probe L. Besides, it also can be used as a sensitivity probe in living cells for Hg2+ sensing, which can meet various needs in genetic and environmental samples.","misc","christiaan"
"1882",35967773,"Improving bioaccessibility and physicochemical property of blue-grained wholemeal flour by steam explosion.","Whole grain contains many health-promoting ingredients, but due to its poor bioaccessibility and processibility, it is not widely accepted by consumers. The steam explosion was exploited to modify the nutritional bioaccessibility and the physicochemical properties of wholemeal flour in this study. In vitro starch digestibility, in vitro protein digestibility of wholemeal flour, total flavonoids content, and total phenolics content of digestive juice were used to evaluate the bioaccessibility, and a significant variation (p < 0.05) was noted. Results showed that steam explosion enhanced the gastric protein digestibility ranged from 5.67 to 6.92% and the intestinal protein digestibility ranged from 16.77 to 49.12%. Steam-exploded wholemeal flour (0.5 MPa, 5 min) had the highest protein digestibility and rapidly digestible starch content. Compared with native flour, steam explosion (0.5 MPa, 5 min) contributed to a 0.72-fold and 0.33-fold increment of total flavonoids content and total phenolics content in digestible juice. Chemical changes of wholemeal flour, induced by steam explosion, caused the changes in the solvent retention capacity, rheological property of wholemeal flour, and altered the falling number (and liquefaction number). An increasing tendency to solid-like behavior and the gel strength of wholemeal flour was significantly enhanced by the steam explosion at 0.5 MPa for 5 min, while the gluten was not weakened. This study indicated that steam-exploded wholemeal flour (0.5 MPa, 5 min) could serve as a potential ingredient with the noticeable bioaccessibility and physicochemical properties in cereal products.","misc","christiaan"
"1125",35974607,"Inferring spatial source of disease outbreaks using maximum entropy.","Mathematical modeling of disease outbreaks can infer the future trajectory of an epidemic, allowing for making more informed policy decisions. Another task is inferring the origin of a disease, which is relatively difficult with current mathematical models. Such frameworks, across varying levels of complexity, are typically sensitive to input data on epidemic parameters, case counts, and mortality rates, which are generally noisy and incomplete. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a maximum entropy framework that fits epidemiological models, provides calibrated infection origin probabilities, and is robust to noise due to a prior belief model. Maximum entropy is agnostic to the parameters or model structure used and allows for flexible use when faced with sparse data conditions and incomplete knowledge in the dynamical phase of disease-spread, providing for more reliable modeling at early stages of outbreaks. We evaluate the performance of our model by predicting future disease trajectories based on simulated epidemiological data in synthetic graph networks and the real mobility network of New York State. In addition, unlike existing approaches, we demonstrate that the method can be used to infer the origin of the outbreak with accurate confidence. Indeed, despite the prevalent belief on the feasibility of contact-tracing being limited to the initial stages of an outbreak, we report the possibility of reconstructing early disease dynamics, including the epidemic seed, at advanced stages.","misc","christiaan"

Peripheral vascular disease is growing in its burden and impact; however it is currently under researched, and there are a lack of strong, non-invasive therapeutic options for the clinicians. Carnosine is a dipeptide stored particularly in muscle and brain tissue, which exhibits a wide range of physiological activities, which may be beneficial as an adjunct treatment for peripheral vascular disease. Carnosine's strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiglycating actions may aid in the prevention of plaque formation, through protective actions on the vascular endothelium, and the inhibition of foam cells. Carnosine may also improve angiogenesis, exercise performance and vasodilatory response, while protecting from ischemic tissue injury. Carnosine may have a role as an adjunct treatment for peripheral vascular disease alongside typical exercise and surgical interventions, and may be used in high risk individuals to aid in the prevention of atherogenesis. This review identifies a beneficial role for carnosine supplementation in the management of patients with peripheral vascular disease, in conjunction with exercise and revascularization. Carnosine as a supplement is safe, and associated with a host of beneficial effects in peripheral vascular disease and its key risk factors.","misc","christiaan"

The objective of this study is to analyze the clinical course of patients attended during the first months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a third-level pediatric hospital. Design: prospective cohort study. Patients with viral respiratory disease or suspected cases of COVID-19 were evaluated at the Pediatric Hospital, National Medical Center XXI Century, Mexico City, from 21 March 2020 to 13 January 2021. Statistical analysis: Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used for comparisons; a logistic regression model was constructed to identify clinical or laboratory characteristics associated with critical disease. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 697 patients met the operational definition of viral respiratory disease or suspected cases of COVID-19 and underwent real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 testing. Patients with a positive result were included. Of the 181 patients (26%), 121 (66.8%) had mild disease and were treated as outpatients and 60 (33.1%) were hospitalized. A total of six patients met the criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Of the 60 inpatients, 65% were males, and 82% had one or more comorbidities. The main comorbidities were cancer (42%) and overweight (15%). The median hospital stay was 9 days. The inpatients had a higher frequency of fever, general malaise, dyspnea, chills, polypnea, and cyanosis than the outpatients (p < 0.05). Only 21.4% of the outpatients had one or more comorbidities, which were lower than in the hospitalized patients (p < 0.001). Laboratory data at admission were similar between critically ill and those with moderate and severe disease. The patients who developed pneumonia were at higher risk of critical disease, while older age was associated with a better prognosis. A total of 13 of the 60 inpatients died (mortality 7.1%). All but one had one or more comorbidities: four had cancer, four congenital heart disease, one chronic kidney disease and epilepsy, one Epstein-Barr virus-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, one obesity, and one diabetes mellitus. Hospital mortality is high, especially in children with comorbidities. Despite 2 years having passed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the epidemiological and clinical data on children are still helpful to improve their prognosis.","misc","christiaan"

Correct interpretation of phenotypes depends upon knowledge of the Cre expression pattern in the chosen mouse driver line to ensure that appropriate cell types are targeted. For studies of the brain and neurological disease a pan-neuronal promoter that reliably drives efficient neuron-specific transgene expression would be valuable. Here we compare a widely used pan-neuronal mouse Cre driver line, Syn1-cre, with a little-known alternative, Snap25-IRES2-cre. Our results show that the Syn1-cre line broadly expresses in the brain but is indetectable in more than half of all neurons and weakly active in testes. In contrast the Snap25-IRES2-cre line expressed Cre in a high proportion of neurons (~85%) and was indetectable in all non-brain tissues that were analysed, including testes. Our findings suggest that for many purposes Snap25-IRES2-cre is superior to Syn1-cre as a potential pan-neuronal cre driver.","misc","christiaan"

As of now, the rate and pathophysiological relevance of impaired sweating in patients with CholU are ill-defined. To assess in CholU patients the rate and extent of impaired sweating and its links to clinical and pathophysiological features of CholU. We assessed sweating in patients with CholU (n = 13) subjected to pulse-controlled ergometry (PCE) provocation testing. Pre- and post-PCE biopsies of lesional (L) and non-lesional (NL) skin were analyzed for the expression of acetylcholine receptor M3 (CHRM3) and acetylcholine esterase (ACh-E) by quantitative histomorphometry and compared to those of healthy control subjects (HCs). CholU patients were assessed for disease duration and severity as well as other clinical features. Of the 13 patients with CholU, 10 showed reduced sweating in response to PCE provocation, and 3 had severely reduced sweating. Reduced sweating was linked to long disease duration and high disease severity. CholU patients with impaired sweating responses showed reduced sweat gland epithelial expression of CHRM3 and ACh-E. Reduced sweating is common in CholU patients, especially in those with long-standing and severe disease, and it can be severe. Reduced expression of CHRM3 and ACh-E may be the cause or consequence of CholU in patients with impaired sweating, and this should be explored by further studies.","misc","christiaan"

A total of 147 stations were investigated in the western, central and eastern North Sea as well as the Skagerrak and Kattegat. Sampling was conducted with a 13 m long Midwater Ring Net (MIK net, Ø 2 m, mesh size 1.6 mm, cod end with smaller mesh size of 500 µm), equipped with a flow meter. The MIK net was deployed in double oblique hauls from the surface to c. 5 m above the sea floor [1,2]. Samples were visually analysed unpreserved on a light table and/or with a stereomicroscope or magnifying lamp within 2 hours after catch. A total of 13,510 individuals were counted/sized. Twelve gelatinous macrozooplankton species or genera were encountered, namely the hydrozoan Aequorea vitrina, Aglantha digitale, Clytia spp., Leuckartiara octona, Tima bairdii, Muggiaea atlantica; the scyphozoans Cyanea capillata and Cyanea lamarckii and the ctenophores Beroe spp., Bolinopsis infundibulum, Mnemiopsis leidyi, Pleurobrachia pileus.

The roles of need for belonging (NTB) as a mediator and identification with one's group as a moderator of this relationship were examined. Perceived social support was also examined as both a potential moderator and mediator. We also included a measure of perceived in-group inclusion in the host society, the Circle of Ingroup Inclusion (CII), to examine its influence on the relationship between discrimination and wellbeing. Three types of coping styles-active constructive coping, passive constructive coping, and destructive coping-were controlled for in the analysis. Results showed that participants' educational level, socioeconomic status, and different coping styles predicted wellbeing; however, discrimination was the strongest (negative) predictor of wellbeing. Social support was both a moderator and mediator of the relationship between discrimination and wellbeing, suggesting that perceived social support not only buffers the negative effect of discrimination on wellbeing, but also partially explains the negative association between discrimination and wellbeing. NTB was not a significant mediator. Identification with one's ethnic group and perceived membership in one's group also did not affect the relationship. The results suggest that it is important to consider social support based on interpersonal relationships among members of minority groups in Japanese society. The psychological factors involved in acculturation processes may be different in different ethnic groups. This study calls for greater consideration of group-specific characteristics in understanding acculturation processes and interactions between groups in society.","misc","christiaan"

Both developed and developing nations have been equally affected and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) resulted in the death of millions of people worldwide. The virus is undergoing mutations and is evolving into variants that are responsible for wave after wave. This study was carried out to assess the clinical outcomes of people infected with the novel virus during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Methods The study was carried out between November 2021 and January 2022 and included 100 consecutive patients attending the hospital attached to the BLDE (Deemed to be University) Shri B.M. Patil Medical College, Bijapur, Karnataka, South India. All patients included in the study returned a positive report in a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patient details collected included age, sex, cycle threshold (Ct) values for envelope (E)/nucleocapsid (N), and Orf1b (open reading frame 1b) genes, hospitalization status, vaccine status, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and final clinical outcome. The data were entered into Microsoft Office Excel sheets, and statistical inferences were drawn using SPSS 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Of the 100 patients included in the study, only 14 (14%) patients were vaccinated. The patient's mean age was 34.22±17.50. Among the vaccinated patients, the majority had taken COVISHIELD™ (85.71%) compared to COVAXIN® (14.29%). Only 14% of patients were symptomatic, and the mean Ct values among all the patients were 29.92±3.74 (E gene/N gene) and 27.6±4.78 (Orf1B gene). Eight (8%) patients were hospitalized, and all the patients recovered from the infection. Among the hospitalized patients, six (75%) were vaccinated. The mean age of the hospitalized patients was 43.8±14.25 years.

Morphing through distortions might have a paramount feature: the resulting configurations might be stress-free; if this is the case, the distortions field is called compatible. We maintain that the morphing through compatible distortions is a key strategy exploited by many soft biological materials, which can exhibit very large shape-change in response to distortions controlled by stimuli such as chemicals or temperature changes, while keeping their stress state almost null. Thus, the study of compatible distortions, and of the related shape-changes, is quite important.

Data were abstracted on demographic characteristics, that is, length of hospital stay and mortality outcome. Admission and mortality rate trends were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall's trend test, whereas Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to compare gender survival rates. During the study period, 459 individuals were admitted with tetanus. Of these, 85.8% (394 of 459) were males, and 26.1% (120 of 459) were aged 20 years or less. Overall, 48.8% (224 of 459) participants died, 85.3% (191 of 224) of whom were males (85.3%, n = 191), although females had a higher mortality rate (50.8%, 33 of 65 vs 48.5%, 191 of 394).

However, the function of ATF2 in insects remains unknown. Here, we isolated the ATF2 gene from Apis cerana cerana (AccATF2) and found that AccATF2 was a main regulator of the honeybee response to oxidative stress. Our results showed that AccATF2 was highly expressed in the head, thorax and integument. AccATF2 was expressed throughout the development period of honeybees, and the highest AccATF2 transcript level was noted in brown-eyed pupae, indicating its indispensable roles in honeybee survival. Antioxidant function analysis showed that AccATF2 expression was markedly induced in response to oxidative stress caused by various environmental stresses. AccATF2 overexpression substantially enhanced the tolerance to oxidative stress of Escherichia coli cells compared with control cells. AccATF2 knockdown significantly increased the production of malondialdehyde (MDA), the transcription of antioxidant genes and the activity of antioxidant enzymes in honeybees, suggesting that AccATF2 knockdown resulted in oxidative damage to honeybees. Moreover, AccATF2 knockdown decreased honeybee resistance to oxidative stress caused by high temperature. Overall, AccATF2 plays an important role in maintaining redox homeostasis and protecting honeybees from oxidative stress caused by various environmental stimuli. Our discoveries add to a growing understanding of how honeybees cope with various adverse environmental conditions to ensure their survival.","misc","christiaan"

Recently, alternative classification models such as the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) proposed to assess traits to predict clinically-relevant outcomes. The current study directly compared personality traits and past diagnoses as predictors of future mental health and functioning in three independent, prospective samples. Regression analyses found that personality traits significantly predicted future first onsets of psychiatric disorders (ΔR2=06-.15), symptom chronicity (ΔR2=.03-.06), and functioning (ΔR2=.02-.07), beyond past and current psychiatric diagnoses. Conversely, past psychiatric diagnoses did not provide an incremental prediction of outcomes when personality traits and other concurrent predictors were already included in the model. Overall, personality traits predicted a variety of outcomes in diverse settings, beyond diagnoses. Past diagnoses were generally not informative about future outcomes when personality was considered. Together, these findings support the added value of personality traits assessment in case formulation, consistent with HiTOP model.","misc","christiaan"

Cuproptosis is a recently reported form of cell death, which appears to result in the progression of various diseases. Therefore, our study aimed to explore cuproptosis-related molecular clusters in Alzheimer's disease and construct a prediction model. Based on the GSE33000 dataset, we analyzed the expression profiles of cuproptosis regulators and immune characteristics in Alzheimer's disease. Using 310 Alzheimer's disease samples, we explored the molecular clusters based on cuproptosis-related genes, along with the related immune cell infiltration. Cluster-specific differentially expressed genes were identified using the WGCNA algorithm. Subsequently, the optimal machine model was chosen by comparing the performance of the random forest model, support vector machine model, generalized linear model, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Nomogram, calibration curve, decision curve analysis, and three external datasets were applied for validating the predictive efficiency. The dysregulated cuproptosis-related genes and activated immune responses were determined between Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's disease controls. Two cuproptosis-related molecular clusters were defined in Alzheimer's disease. Analysis of immune infiltration suggested the significant heterogeneity of immunity between distinct clusters. Cluster2 was characterized by elevated immune scores and relatively higher levels of immune infiltration. Functional analysis showed that cluster-specific differentially expressed genes in Cluster2 were closely related to various immune responses. The Random forest machine model presented the best discriminative performance with relatively lower residual and root mean square error, and a higher area under the curve (AUC = 0.9829). A final 5-gene-based random forest model was constructed, exhibiting satisfactory performance in two external validation datasets (AUC = 0.8529 and 0.8333). The nomogram, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis also demonstrated the accuracy to predict Alzheimer's disease subtypes. Further analysis revealed that these five model-related genes were significantly associated with the Aβ-42 levels and β-secretase activity. Our study systematically illustrated the complicated relationship between cuproptosis and Alzheimer's disease, and developed a promising prediction model to evaluate the risk of cuproptosis subtypes and the pathological outcome of Alzheimer's disease patients.","misc","christiaan"

The crystal structure analysis of [PbL(OAc)] showed that the PbII cation is N,N',S-chelated by the tridentate pincer-type ligand L and by the oxygen atoms of the acetate anion. In addition, the metal centre forms Pb...O and Pb...S tetrel bonds with an adjacent complex molecule, yielding a 1D zigzag polymeric chain, which is reinforced by N-H...O hydrogen bonds and π...π interactions. These chains are interlinked by C-H...py non-covalent interactions, realized between one of the acetate hydrogen atoms and the pyridine rings. According to the Hirshfeld surface analysis, the crystal packing is mainly characterized by intermolecular H...H, H...C and H...O contacts, followed by H...N, H...S, C...C, C...N, Pb...H, Pb...O and Pb...S contacts. The FTIR and 1H NMR spectra of [PbL(OAc)] testify to the deprotonation of the parent ligand HL, while the acetate ligand exhibits an anisobidentate coordination mode as established by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy. Lastly, theoretical calculations at the PBE0-D3/def2-TZVP level of theory have been used to analyze and characterize the Pb...O and Pb...S tetrel bonds observed in the crystal of [PbL(OAc)], using a combination of QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules) and NCIPlot (Non-Covalent Interaction Plot) computational tools.","misc","christiaan"

The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, an easy-to-use tool for assessing the nutritional status, was reported as an independent prognostic factor in cancer patients. However, its role in patients with MDS is unclear. We aimed to explore the impact of CONUT score on the prognosis of patients with MDS, which is of great significance for clinical treatment. A total of 121 patients with MDS were analyzed. The CONUT score was calculated prior to therapy. The bio-informatics tool X-tile was used to define the CONUT score and the threshold of 4 points was determined to predict the prognosis. Patients were divided into CONUTlow and CONUThigh groups, and the characteristics were compared between two groups. Results show that CONUTlow was associated with better overall survival (OS) than CONUThigh patients (Median OS, 30.20 vs. 19.63 months, p = 0.0003). However, there were no statistical differences in progression-free survival (PFS) between the two groups (p = 0.2683). Results of univariate and multivariate COX proportional hazard analysis adjusted for bone marrow blasts level, platelet count, International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) scores, gender, and hemoglobin (Hb) level showed that the CONUT score was useful in the evaluation standard of OS of MDS (hazard ratio (HR) 2.297, 95% CI 1.441-3.663, p < 0.001). The CONUT, as a novel immuno-nutritional biomarker, may be useful in predicting the OS of MDS.","misc","christiaan"

The catalytic activity and selectivity of the new chiral catalysts were improved by adjusting the aperture of the MOF cavities. The hole size of the Zr-MOF was modulated by adding acid and replacing bridge ligands during synthesis. The difunctional chiral units of amino acid-thiourea are anchored onto the Zr-MOF by a mild synthesis method from an isothiocyanate intermediate which could effectively avoid the racemization of chiral moieties in the synthesis process. By means of specific surface area measurement (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD), it was confirmed that Zr-MOFs with different pore sizes were synthesized without breaking the basic octahedral structure of the MOF. Finally, good yields (up to 83%) and ee values (up to 73%) were achieved with the new heterogeneous catalysts in 48 hours for the aldol reaction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone. By contrast, using the catalyst support without modulating the synthesis, the yield (30%) and the ee-value (26%) were both low. Experiments have confirmed the important influence on the reaction selectivity of providing a suitable reaction environment by controlling the aperture of MOF cavities.","misc","christiaan"

Here, we characterize infection dynamics and transmissibility of a LASV isolate (Soromba-R) in adult lab-reared M. natalensis originating from Mali. The lab-reared M. natalenesis proved to be highly susceptible to LASV isolates from geographically distinct regions of West Africa via multiple routes of exposure, with 50% infectious doses of < 1 TCID50. Postinoculation, LASV Soromba-R established a systemic infection with no signs of clinical disease. Viral RNA was detected in all nine tissues examined with peak concentrations detected between days 7 and 14 postinfection within most organs. There was an overall trend toward clearance of virus within 40 days of infection in most organs. The exception is lung specimens, which retained positivity throughout the course of the 85-day study. Direct (contact) and indirect (fomite) transmission experiments demonstrated 40% of experimentally infected M. natalensis were capable of transmitting LASV to naïve animals, with peak transmissibility occurring between 28 and 42 days post-inoculation. No differences in patterns of infection or transmission were noted between male and female experimentally infected rodents. Adult lab-reared M. natalensis are highly susceptible to genetically distinct LASV strains developing a temporary asymptomatic infection associated with virus shedding resulting in contact and fomite transmission within a cohort.","misc","christiaan"

We designed dyes that include a benzothiadiazole (BTD) and an indacenodithiophene (IDT) units, and we obtained a new molecular dyad by covalent coupling with the cobalt diimine-dioxime catalyst. The introduction of the benzothiadiazole core in the structure improves the absorption properties and leads to an extension of the spectrum in the visible range up to 650 nm. The photoelectrochemical properties of the new dyad were evaluated on pristine and lithium-doped NiO electrodes. We demonstrate that increasing the light harvesting efficiency of the dyad by introducing a IDT-BTD chromophore is clearly beneficial for the photoelectrochemical activity. We also demonstrate that lithium doping of NiO, which improves the electronic conductivity of the mesoporous film, leads to a significant increase in performance, in terms of TON and F.E., more than doubled with our new dyad. This BTD-based molecular system outperforms the results of previously reported dyads using the same catalyst.","misc","christiaan"

There have been no studies which investigated the relationship of childhood sensory processing and integration and related motor performance (sensori-motor) patterns identified using an Ayres Sensory Integration® (ASI) frame of reference and later QOL of those children as adults. This longitudinal follow-up study examined this relationship. Adult QOL was also examined in relation to current adult sensori-motor patterns. Fifty-three adults who received occupational therapy services as children, were identified as having sensori-motor difficulties at that time and completed a sensory history and a quality-of-life measure as adults participated. Measures included the OTA the Koomar Center Sensory History (SXHX), Adult/Adolescent Sensory History (ASH), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF). MANCOVA found that Total childhood sensori-motor scores had a small relationship to Physical Health QOL as adults that approached significance. Pearson Correlations found that adults with childhood sensori-motor challenges who report sensori-motor challenges as adults had a moderate significant relationship among overall sensori-motor functioning and Physical Health (r = -0.56, p = 0.018). Visual (r = -0.76, p = 0.001), movement (vestibular; r = -0.48, p = 0.042) and tactile processing (r = -0.63, p = 0.008) had moderate to large significant relationships with Physical Health. Visual processing (r = -0.54, p = 0.024) was also significantly related to Psychological Health. Motor Coordination trended to significance for Physical Health (r = -0.42) and Psychological Health (r = -0.41). Conversely, adults who reported typical sensori-motor scores as adults, despite childhood sensori-motor challenges, had a good QOL. Furthermore, similar to previous research, there was a relationship between current visual, movement (vestibular) and tactile (touch) sensory processing and adult Physical and Psychological Health. A multivariate linear regression found Sensory Discrimination and Modulation accounted for one-quarter of the variance in QOL in adults with only Discrimination being statistically significant. Therefore, it is important to consider childhood sensori-motor function as well as adult functioning when examining QOL. Further, heretofore unexamined Sensory Discrimination was found to play a role in adult QOL.","misc","christiaan"

For the result without 1tR and 2tR data of alkane references (1tR(n) and 2tR(n)), the following steps were applied: (1) curve fitting based on van den Dool and Kratz relationship in order to simulate 1tR(n) using a training set of volatile compounds in a sample with their experimental 1tR data, and (2) simulation of 2tR(n) at different 1tR(n) to construct their isovolatility curves based on a nonlinear equation with p1-p5 parameters and a constant (within the ranges of -0.0052 to 0.0049, -0.6181 to -0.0230, -26.4775 to -0.2698, 0.0050 to 9.6259, -7.2976 to -3.9524 and 0.9157 to 4.0779, respectively). These parameters were obtained by performing curve fitting according to the experimental 2tR data of the same training set with the least square values ranging from 4.58×10-15 to 32.55. Simulation of 1tR and 2tR of target analytes (1tR,sim and 2tR,sim) with known 1I and 2I were performed using 1tR(n) and the simulated isovolatility curves.

"171",35974849,"Monitoring Endocrine Complications of Immunotherapy: A Screening Tool.","Introduction The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer therapy in recent years. Immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies against checkpoint molecules, including programmed death (PD)-1, PD ligand (PD-L)1, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA)-4, has become a cornerstone in cancer therapy. However, due to the physiologic role of checkpoint molecules in preventing autoimmunity, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have emerged as frequent complications. As the use of immunotherapy increases, a better understanding of irAEs and screening tools for timely diagnosis and management are needed. Materials and methods We surveyed oncology providers at our institution with 10 questions assessing their knowledge, and comfort levels in diagnosing and managing endocrine irAEs. We created an endocrine clinic referral order specifically for oncology-related endocrinopathies and created a screening tool for diagnosing these endocrinopathies. We met with our oncology providers in three different hour-long sessions. A post-intervention survey was sent out six months after our initial meeting to assess changes in the participants' knowledge and comfort levels. We also reviewed the electronic medical records system for the number of new referrals to endocrinology clinic. Results A total of 27 (N) participants responded to the initial survey and 14 (n) responded to the subsequent survey six months later. Based on the initial survey, only a minority (26%) of respondents were comfortable diagnosing and managing (15%) immunotherapy-related adrenal dysfunction whereas more respondents were comfortable diagnosing (55%) and managing (56%) thyroid dysfunction. The majority (67%) of the respondents knew which immunotherapies commonly are implicated in hypophysitis but only 42% of them were aware of the next steps of its management. We noted a significant increase in self-reported comfort levels in diagnosing (p < 0.05) and managing (p < 0.05) adrenal disorders post-intervention. There was also a trend of improvement in participants' comfort levels regarding diagnosing and managing thyroid dysfunction, management of hypophysitis, and immunotherapies implicated in thyroid dysfunction but the changes did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant change in their knowledge regarding immunotherapies implicated in hypophysitis and natural history of thyroid dysfunction in this setting. In the six months following our intervention, 30% (n=21) of the patients referred to the endocrine clinic were for immune-related endocrinopathies compared to 19% (n=7) of patients over a similar duration before the intervention. Data on the time between referral and endocrinology appointment was available for 16 out of the 21 patients and the mean (±SD) time to endocrine clinic appointment was 2.66 (±1.95) weeks. Nine (43%) of the 21 referred patients were seen in endocrinology clinic within two weeks. Conclusions Although immune-related endocrinopathies are rarely fatal, they have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Endocrinopathies are typically manageable with prompt recognition and treatment. But the subtle and non-specific manifestations make the diagnostic process a challenge. Standardized and practical screening tools can help in diagnosing these adverse events promptly, seeking specialized care if needed and may also aid in reducing healthcare-related costs.","misc","christiaan"
"2174",35974505,"Information conduction and convection in noiseless Vicsek flocks.","Physical interactions generally respect certain symmetries, such as reciprocity and energy conservation, which survive in coarse-grained isothermal descriptions. Active many-body systems usually break such symmetries intrinsically, on the particle level, so that their collective behavior is often more naturally interpreted as a result of information exchange. Here we study numerically how information spreads from a leader particle through an initially aligned flock, described by the Vicsek model without noise. In the low-speed limit of a static spin lattice, we find purely conductive spreading, reminiscent of heat transfer. Swarm motility and heterogeneity can break reciprocity and spin conservation. But what seems more consequential for the swarm response is that the dispersion relation acquires a significant convective contribution along the leader's direction of motion.","misc","christiaan"

However, this perspective has limitations when it comes to explaining the interactions between the state, civil society, and the business organizations that support it. This article provides an analytical framework derived from the sociology of public action (SPA) to understand how multiple organizations support UA. We have applied the SPA framework to the city of São Paulo and our analysis indicates that civil society has mobilized significant meanings, ideas, and networks to reinforce the importance of UA. As a result, there has been a paradigm shift in terms of UA: it has gone from a state of invisibility within an institutional void to an improved state of policy planning. However, civil society organizations still lead the delivery of services for farmers with intermittent state support, which indicates that there has been a paradigm shift in UA policy planning, but not in policy implementation.","misc","christiaan"

TOA is an important, life-threatening disease, and it has become more common in recent years, posing a major health risk to women. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents are necessary to cover the most likely pathogens because the pathogens that cause TOA are polymicrobial. However, the response rate of antibiotic treatment is about 70%, whereas one-third of patients have poor clinical consequences and they require drainage or surgery. Rising antimicrobial resistance serves as a significant reason for the unsatisfactory medical outcomes. It is important to study the antibiotic resistance mechanism of TOA pathogens in solving the problems of multi-drug resistant strains. This paper focuses on the most common pathogenic bacteria isolated from TOA specimens and discusses the emerging trends and epidemiology of resistant Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and gram-positive anaerobic cocci. Besides that, new methods that aim to solve the antibiotic resistance of related pathogens are discussed, such as CRISPR, nanoparticles, bacteriophages, antimicrobial peptides, and pathogen-specific monoclonal antibodies. Through this review, we hope to reveal the current situation of antibiotic resistance of common TOA pathogens, relevant mechanisms, and possible antibacterial strategies, providing references for the clinical treatment of drug-resistant pathogens.","misc","christiaan"

To understand this, we designed a transmission chain experiment using naïve, intranasally (IN) or intramuscularly (IM) vaccinated, and previously infected (PI) hamsters. Vaccination and previous infection protected animals from disease and virus replication after Delta and Omicron dual challenge. A gradient in transmission blockage was observed: IM vaccination displayed moderate transmission blockage potential over three airborne chains (approx. 70%), whereas, IN vaccination and PI blocked airborne transmission in >90%. In naïve hamsters, Delta completely outcompeted Omicron within and between hosts after dual infection in onward transmission. Although Delta also outcompeted Omicron in the vaccinated and PI transmission chains, an increase in Omicron competitiveness was observed in these groups. This correlated with the increase in the strength of the humoral response against Delta, with the strongest response seen in PI animals. These data highlight the continuous need to assess the emergence and spread of novel variants in populations with pre-existing immunity and address the additional evolutionary pressure this may exert on the virus.","misc","christiaan"

One of the major challenges toward their use as drugs is their low thermostability, which impacts both efficacy as well as manufacturing and delivery. To aid the design of thermally more stable mutants, consensus sequence-based method has been widely used. These methods typically have a success rate of about 50% with maximum melting temperature increment ranging from 10 to 32°C. To improve the prediction performance, we have developed a new and fast MAbs specific method by adding a 3D structural layer to the consensus sequence method. This is done by analyzing the close-by residue pairs which are conserved in >800 MAbs' 3D structures. Combining consensus sequence and structural residue pair covariance methods, we developed an in-house application for predicting human MAb thermostability to guide protein engineers to design stable molecules. Major advantage of this structural level assessment is in significantly reducing the false positives by almost half from the consensus sequence method alone. This application has shown success in designing MAb engineering panels in multiple biologics programs. Our data science-based method shows impacts in Mab engineering.","misc","christiaan"

Heifers at high-risk for BRD (n = 1000; initial BW = 229 kg ± 1.6) purchased from sale barns in the southeastern U.S. were transported to a contract research feedlot in Nebraska and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental groups (10 blocks of 100 animals each; 50 per treatment group). Experimental groups consisted of: (1) tulathromycin metaphylaxis (2.5 mg/kg) followed by ceftiofur crystalline free acid (6.6 mg/kg) and danofloxacin (8 mg/kg) for subsequent first and second as-needed BRD treatment, respectively (TCD) or (2) tildipirosin metaphylaxis (4 mg/kg) followed by florfenicol-flunixin meglumine (40 mg/kg florfenicol; 2.2 mg/kg flunixin meglumine) and enrofloxacin (12.5 mg/kg) for subsequent first and second as-needed BRD treatment, respectively (TFFE). Following expiration of the 7-d PMI, calves that showed signs of clinical BRD were pulled and examined to determine if treatment was necessary based on a clinical attitude score (CAS). Heifers with a CAS of 1 accompanied by ≥40°C rectal temperature, and all heifers with a CAS ≥ 2 regardless of rectal temperature, received the appropriate first-treatment antimicrobial. Upon relapse, following expiration of the post-treatment interval (PTI), heifers received the appropriate second-treatment antimicrobial. In the first 90 d, calves in the TFFE experimental group received more first-treatments than calves in the TCD experimental group (P = 0.054) and resulted in 50% greater mortality (P < 0.043) relative to the TCD heifers. From d 0 to closeout, first-treatment morbidity as well as mortality were greater in TFFE relative to TCD (P ≤ 0.032). Growth performance did not differ between treatments in the first 90 d; however, ADG was greater (P = 0.033) and G:F improved (P = 0.014) at closeout in TCD versus TFFE on a deads-in basis.

Online survey data were collected from 78 SUD providers serving PWID in eight western rural North Carolina counties. Providers' attitudes toward working with HCV+ clients were very positive. One-third of providers reported a low fund of knowledge regarding HCV, HCV treatment, and financial assistance opportunities. Non-prescribing providers rarely initiated discussions about HCV testing/treatment, but were receptive to training. Respondents indicated that HCV testing and treatment were best delivered at local health departments or primary care clinics but were open to other venues where PWID access care.

These atypical features may be confused with other etiologies causing a delay in diagnosis and management. We describe a young male patient who presented with neurological symptoms suggestive of PRES; however, the atypical radiological findings along with concomitant rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis led to a diagnostic dilemma. Repeat neuro-imaging after appropriate blood pressure control showed disappearance of the lesions confirming the diagnosis of PRES-SCI, and kidney biopsy showed advanced IgA nephropathy. Knowledge of atypical features of PRES is crucial amongst nephrologists as it is a common association with kidney disease and prompt identification and management avoid irreversible sequelae and unnecessary investigations.","misc","christiaan"

A self-administered survey was completed by patients in Saudi hospitals. The survey included questions on demographics, educational level, treatment options, dry eye, eye rubbing because of allergy, residence, family history, and consanguineous marriage. Six hundred and forty-eight patients (375 - male, 273 - female; mean age: 26.89 [standard deviation: 7.04] years; range: 11-50 years) were conducted at 13 central hospitals in all 13 administrate areas of Saudi Arabia over a 1-year period. Five hundred and forty-three (83.8%) patients had a secondary school diploma or diploma's degree of education and mostly were from the Aseer and Riyadh regions. The geographical distribution rate of KC was highest in the mountainous areas. For dry eye, 21.9% and 44.8% of the patients, respectively, reported frequent or occasional dryness and 13.4% and 48.9% of the patients, respectively, reported frequent or occasional bouts of eye allergy. Furthermore, 17.9% and 61.9% of the patients, respectively, reported that they constantly or sometimes rubbed their eyes. Marriages were endogamous in 53.5% of the patients and the family history was positive by 56.8%. There was a history of ocular disease in 27% of the patients and the systemic disease was 13%. This study is the first to describe the regional demographic and clinical variations of KC in Saudi Arabia. Its findings suggest that the different distribution of keratoconic patients between provinces is attributable to genetic and/or environmental factors.","misc","christiaan"

Acting as transient chiral diamino N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), these oxazolidines allowed the efficient formation of well-defined copper(i) and gold(i) hydroxyalkyl-NHC complexes, which could be isolated, for the first time, as air stable complexes after silica gel chromatography. Interestingly, X-ray analysis of gold complexes revealed that the hydroxyl-function is not chelated to the metal. Computational studies suggested that both cyclisation to produce oxazolidine and O-H bond elimination to form the transient carbene (prior to coordination) occur through a concerted mechanism. The novel chiral copper-catalysts, as well as oxazolidines alone (copper free), demonstrated excellent performances in asymmetric conjugate addition and allylic alkylation with high regio- and enantio-selectivities (up to 99% ee).","misc","christiaan"
"1100",35985127,"Two- and three-dimensional piezoelectric scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.","The incidence of bone disorders worldwide is increasing. For this reason, new and more effective strategies for bone repair are needed. The most common strategy used for cell regeneration relies in biochemical stimulation while biophysical stimulation using mechanical, and electrical cues is a promising, however, still under-investigated field. This work reports on the development of piezoelectric 2D and 3D porous scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration strategies. While the porous scaffolds mimic the bone's structure, the piezoelectric activity of the scaffolds mimics the bone mechano-electric microenvironment. The piezoelectric activity is related to the electroactive β-phase of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in the scaffolds and was dynamically stimulated by cell culture in a custom-made mechanical bioreactor. These two factors combined provide an effective biomimetic environment for the proliferation of preosteoblasts. The electromechanically-responsive scaffolds are found to promote the enhancement of proliferation rate of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells in about 20 % as well as an improved adhesion and proliferation over the materials, mainly when dynamically stimulated. These results prove that local piezoelectric effect, as the one existing in bone tissue, allows effective cell proliferation, which could be further translated in more efficient strategies for bone tissue regeneration.","misc","christiaan"

The radiological literature on this disease is exclusively case reports. There is a paucity of literature on the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The most common imaging modalities used are computed tomography and ultrasound. This report aims to provide more data on the appearance of extramedullary hematopoiesis using MRI to help radiologists establish the diagnosis. Three patients (one male and two females) were incidentally found to have a hepatic mass or nodule, without hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Laboratory tests including liver function, serum hepatic tumor markers, and hepatitis serologic markers were normal. On MRI scans, all lesions showed lower signal intensity on in-phase images than on out-phase images. One case showed changes in signal intensity on T2 weighted images (WI) and diffusion WI, which shifted from hyperintensity to hypointensity with size enlargement between two rounds of imaging examination. These lesions exhibited different enhancement patterns on dynamic contrast enhancement series. The MRI signal change and in-/out-phase image might provide useful information and help radiologists establish the diagnosis of intrahepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis.","misc","christiaan"

A total of 36 unresectable BTC patients treated with HAIC and PD-1 inhibitors between September 2019 and July 2021 were included in this study. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response, and adverse events (AEs) were investigated. Overall, 52.8% patients with advanced BTC were in stage IV, 23 patients who progressed after receiving PD-1 inhibitor had undergone HAIC, and 23 patients have received 2 or more lines of therapy. The median OS was 8.8 months (range: 4.0-24.0 months), and the median PFS was 3.7 months. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 11.5% and 76.9%, respectively. In the subgroup analysis, patients who treated with HAIC early without progression after immunotherapy were associated with a trend toward better OS (median 13.0 vs. 7.6 months; P = 0.004) and PFS (median 7.9 vs. 3.6 months; P = 0.09) compared to with HAIC with progression after PD-1 treatment. No treatment-related deaths occurred. A total of 44.4% of the patients experienced grade 3 or 4 AEs. We conclude that the combination of HAIC and PD-1 inhibitors is safe and effective. Early HAIC combined with immunotherapy can effectively prolong the overall survival of patients with advanced BTC.","misc","christiaan"

Anthocyanins are naturally occurring plant pigments that have antioxidants activity and play important role in plant defense against abiotic and biotic stresses. In the present study, drought induced effects on plants were investigated in hydroponically grown seedlings of green stem (GS) and purple stem (PS) genotypes of B. napus. The results of this study showed that the major function of anthocyanins accumulation during drought was to enhance the antioxidant capability and stress tolerance in B. napus plants. Our results showed that drought significantly inhibited the plant growth in terms of decreased biomass accumulation in both genotypes, although marked decline was observed in GS genotype. The reduction in photosynthetic attributes was more noticeable in the GS genotype, whereas the PS genotype showed better performance under drought stress. Under stressful conditions, both the genotype showed excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as higher levels of antioxidant enzymes activities. Under drought conditions, the GS genotype showed apparent damages on chloroplast deformation like in thylakoid membrane and grana structural distortion and fewer starch grains and bigger plastoglobuli. Moreover, during drought stress, the PS genotype exhibited maximum expression levels of anthocyanins biosynthesis genes and antioxidant enzymes accompanied by higher stress tolerance relative to GS genotype. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that GS genotype found more sensitive to drought stress than the PS genotype. Furthermore this research paper also provides practical guidance for plant biologists who are developing stress-tolerant crops by using anthocyanin biosynthesis or regulatory genes.","misc","christiaan"

COVID-19 vaccines and their boosters are life-saving developments that have helped prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. We conducted this study to assess the coverage of the booster dose in an Indian population (the third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in India is referred to as the booster or precautionary dose), record the reasons for not taking the booster dose, and determine the effectiveness of the booster. The levels of adherence to COVID-19 precautionary behavior was also assessed.  Methods We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study using convenient sampling via an online survey of 550 respondents older than 18 in the second quarter of 2022. The respondents were distributed among 18 states and union territories in India. The data were analyzed as simple proportions and percentages. Results Of the 550 respondents, 152 (27.6%) received the booster dose, indicating low coverage. A small percentage of respondents (7.2%) reported suffering from COVID-19 following the booster, of whom 91% were medical professionals. The most common reported reason for not taking the vaccine was that the respondents were not yet due for their dose (48.1%). The time between the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and the booster had no impact on infection rates. Men were less likely to adhere to COVID-19 precautionary behavior than women, despite similar vaccination rates. Conclusion The COVID-19 vaccine booster had a low acceptance in our study population, with roughly one-quarter of the population receiving the booster. The booster dose has been influential in the prevention of COVID-19. Most respondents followed behavioral safety measures despite the decline of active cases of COVID-19 in India following the Omicron wave. Our results indicate a need to strengthen public strategies to affect behavioral changes, such as improving India's Behavior Change Communication program to ensure adequate booster dose coverage.","misc","christiaan"

Although the COVID-19 vaccine is currently available, the latest variant of the virus, Omicron, spreads more easily than earlier strains, and its mortality rate is still high in patients with chronic diseases, especially cancer patients. So, identifying a novel compound for COVID-19 treatment could help reduce the lethal rate of the viral infection in patients with cancer. This study applied network pharmacology and systematic bioinformatics analysis to determine the possible use of curcumol for treating colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) in patients infected with COVID-19. Our results showed that COVID-19 and COAD in patients shared a cluster of genes commonly deregulated by curcumol. The clinical pathological analyses demonstrated that the expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit delta (GABRD) was associated with the patients' hazard ratio. More importantly, the high expression of GABRD was associated with poor survival rates and the late stages of COAD in patients. The network pharmacology result identified seven-core targets, including solute carrier family 6 member 3, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit pi, butyrylcholinesterase, cytochrome P450 3A4, 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, progesterone receptor, and GABRD of curcumol for treating patients with COVID-19 and COAD. The bioinformatic analysis further highlighted their importance in the biological processes and molecular functions in gland development, inflammation, retinol, and steroid metabolism. The findings of this study suggest that curcumol could be an alternative compound for treating patients with COVID-19 and COAD.","misc","christiaan"

Remodeling in mucosal microbiota and systemic immunoregulation may represent an important component in tissue injury. Here, we aim to characterize the ileal microbiota in both pathological and healthy settings and to evaluate the correlated systemic microbial-associated inflammatory markers comparing first-time surgery and relapse clinical conditions. We enrolled 28 CD patients at surgery; we collected inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa tissues and blood samples from each patient. Bacterial wall adherence was observed histologically, while its composition was assessed through amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. In addition, we evaluated the systemic microRNA (miRNA) using quantitative real-time PCR amplification and free fatty acids (FFAs) using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The total number of mucosal adherent microbiota was enriched in healthy compared to inflamed mucosa. In contrast, the phylum Tenericutes, the family Ruminococcaceae, and the genera Mesoplasma and Mycoplasma were significantly enriched in the pathological setting. Significant microbiota differences were observed between the relapse and first surgery patients regarding the families Bacillaceae 2 and Brucellaceae and the genera Escherichia/Shigella, Finegoldia, Antrobacter, Gemmatimonas, Moraxella, Anoxibacillus, and Proteus. At the systemic level, we observed a significant downregulation of circulating miR-155 and miR-223, as well as 2-methyl butyric, isobutyric, and hexanoic (caproic) acids in recurrence compared to the first surgery patients. In addition, the level of hexanoic acid seems to act as a predictor of recurrence risk in CD patients (OR 18; 95% confidence interval 1.24-261.81; p = 0.006). We describe a dissimilarity of ileal microbiota composition comparing CD and healthy settings, as well as systemic microbial-associated inflammatory factors between first surgery and surgical relapse. We suggest that patterns of microbiota, associated with healthy ileal tissue, could be involved in triggering CD recurrence. Our findings may provide insight into the dynamics of the gut microbiota-immunity axis in CD surgical recurrence, paving the way for new diagnostics and therapeutics aimed not only at reducing inflammation but also at maintaining a general state of eubiosis in healthy tissue.","misc","christiaan"

The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of fluazaindolizine, a new non-fumigant nematicide, in comparison with the fumigant nematicide 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) and non-fumigant nematicides fluopyram and oxamyl for (1) SRKN management, (2) impacts on free-living nematodes, and (3) sweet potato yield in field trials. Among all nematicides, 1,3-D at 84 kg/ha most consistently (2 of 3 years) managed SRKN soil populations and improved yield. Fluazaindolizine at 2.24 kg/ha and fluazindolizine at 1.12 kg/ha plus oxamyl at 2.14 kg/ha managed SRKN populations and improved yield in 1 of 3 years, whereas fluazaindolizine alone at 1.12 kg/ha only decreased SRKN populations. Fluopyram at 238 g/ha did not affect SRKN or yield. Nematicide application also had non-target effects on free-living nematodes with 1,3-D reducing abundances relative to untreated most frequently (2018 and 2020), but other nematicides also reducing free-living nematode abundances in 2020. In summary, 1,3-D is the most consistent option for SRKN control on sweet potato, but fluazaindolizine, oxamyl or combinations of the two products can also be effective.","misc","christiaan"

Herein, we have synthesized four Zn(II) CPs bearing α-acetamidocinnamic acid (HACA) and 4,4'-bipyridine (4,4'-bipy). The reaction between Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, HACA, and 4,4'-bipy yields {[Zn(ACA)2(4,4'-bipy)]·EtOH} n (1), which was used for the formation of three CPs through dissolution-recrystallization structural transformations (DRSTs): {[Zn(ACA)2(4,4'-bipy)]·2MeOH} n (2), {[Zn2(μ-ACA)2(ACA)2(4,4'-bipy)]·2H2O} n (3), and {[Zn3(μ-ACA)6(4,4'-bipy)]·0.75CHCl3} n (4). The study of the four crystal structures revealed that their secondary building units (SBUs) comprise monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric arrangements linked by 4,4'-bipy ligands. The fundamental role of the utilized solvent and/or temperature, as well as their effect on the orientation of the amide moieties driving the formation of the different SBUs is discussed. Furthermore, the reversibility and interconversion between the four CPs have been assayed. Finally, their solid-state photoluminescence has evinced that the effect of the amide moieties not only predetermine a different SBU but also lead to a different emission in 4 compared with 1-3.","misc","christiaan"

Dust mobilization is observed to be inhibited in certain regions and is correlated with the orientation of the magnetic field. The recent patched charge model, which describes a mechanism for dust charging and mobilization, is extended to explain the effects of magnetic fields seen in our laboratory results. We propose that ambient electrons collected in photoemitting areas precipitate changes in the emission and reabsorption of photoelectrons inside microcavities between dust grains. This affects the charging, repulsion, and subsequent mobilization of the dust grains surrounding the microcavities. The magnetic field controls the movement of ambient electrons across the dusty surface, resulting in active and inactive regions of dust mobilization. Computer simulations show that regions of ambient electron accumulation as imposed by the magnetic field match the areas of high dust activity.","misc","christiaan"

More evidence has suggested the potential associations between necroptosis and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Currently, the underlying role of necroptosis remains elusive in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at antitumor immunity and inter-tumoral heterogeneity. This study enrolled a total of 728 HCC patients and 139 immunotherapy patients from eight public datasets. The consensus clustering approach was employed to depict tumor heterogeneity of cancer necroptosis. Subsequently, our study further decoded the heterogeneous clinical outcomes, genomic landscape, biological behaviors, and immune characteristics in necroptosis subtypes. For each patient, providing curative clinical recommendations and developing potential therapeutic drugs were used to promote precise medicine. With the use of the weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm, necroptosis-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (NALRs) were identified in HCC. Based on the NALR expression, two heterogeneous subtypes were decoded with distinct clinical outcomes. Compared to patients in C1, patients in C2 harbored superior pathological stage and presented more unfavorable overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Then, the robustness and reproducibility of necroptosis subtypes were further validated via the nearest template prediction (NTP) approach and classical immune phenotypes. Through comprehensive explorations, C1 was characterized by enriched immune-inflammatory and abundant immune infiltration, while C2 possessed elevated proliferative and metabolic activities and highly genomic instability. Moreover, our results indicated that C1 was more prone to obtain desirable benefits from immunotherapy. For patients in C2, numerous underlying therapeutic agents were developed, which might produce significant efficacy. This study identified two necroptosis subtypes with distinct characteristics, decoding the tumor heterogeneity.

Additionally, the efficacy of topical applications was investigated using a porcine skin model, in which particle size and zeta potential relate to skin permeability. Skin permeation was correlated to particle size and relative stability in skin-like conditions but not directly related to the CBD content, suggesting that topical products can be designed to enhance overall skin permeation.

The generalization goes in two directions: relaxing the exclusion constraint by allowing several (but few) particles on a site and by considering two species of particles, which differ in size and transport coefficients. We calculate the nearest-neighbor correlations using a variant of the Kirkwood approximation and show by comparison with numerical simulations that the approximation provides quite accurate results. However, for long-range correlations, we show that the Kirkwood approximation is useless, as it predicts exponential decay of the density-density correlation function with distance, while simulation data indicate that the decay is algebraic. For the one-component system, we show that the decay is governed by a power law with universal exponent close to 2. In the two-component system, the correlation function behaves in a more complicated manner: Its sign oscillates but the envelope decays again very slowly and the decay is compatible with a power law with an exponent somewhat lower than 2. Therefore, our generalization of the ASEP belongs to a different universality class from the ensemble of generalized ASEP models which are mappable to zero-range processes.","misc","christiaan"

We included 40 men with PeCa as a study group and 20 age-matched uncircumcised men who underwent circumcision for phimosis as a control group. Both the groups underwent deoxyribonucleic acid isolation for HPV subtyping followed by evaluation of relative E6/E7 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression profile and relative telomerase activity in tissue samples. HPV-16 and -18 were categorized as high-risk, whereas HPV-6 and -11 were categorized as low-risk subtypes. The mean (±standard deviation) age of PeCa was 51 ± 15.9 years. The majority of patients had stage II disease, and the most common procedure done was partial penectomy. The overall prevalence of HPV in PeCa was 42.5% (n = 17) as compared to 20% (n = 4) in controls. Among the subtypes, the most common subtype was HPV-16 noted in 33.3% (8/24) of cases, followed by HPV-18 in 29.2% (7/24) of cases. PeCa tissues had a significantly higher relative E7 mRNA expression for HPV-18 than the control group (P = 0.016). The mean relative telomerase activity was significantly higher in the PeCa tissues than the control group (138.66 vs. 14.46, P < 0.001).

The levels of sIFNAR2 were determined with ELISA in plasma samples from a subgroup of 351 individuals. The rs2236757, rs3153, rs1051393, and rs2834158 variants were associated with mortality risk among patients with severe COVID-19. Higher levels of sIFNAR2 were observed in survivors of COVID-19 compared to the group of non-survivors, which was not related to the studied IFNAR2 genetic variants. IFNAR2, both gene, and soluble protein, are relevant in the clinical outcome of patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19.","misc","christiaan"

Fewer across-breed variations in horse gut microbial diversity have been illustrated. In this article, the gut microbiota of Thoroughbred, Mongolian, and Hybrid horses [first filial generation (F1) of Mongolian (maternal) and Thoroughbred (paternal)] were studied by second-generation high-throughput sequencing technology. Differences in gut microbiota composition and function between breeds were determined using diversity and functional prediction analysis. The alpha diversity analysis showed that Thoroughbred horses had a more abundant and diverse gut microbiota, while the diversity of gut microbiota in Hybrid horses was intermediate between Thoroughbred and Mongolian horses. Subsequent cluster analysis showed that Hybrid horses have a microbiota composition more similar to Mongolian horses. LEfSe analysis revealed that the bacterial biomarkers for Thoroughbred horses at the family level were Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, Fibrobacteraceae, p_251_o5, Lactobacillaceae, and uncultured_bacterium_o_WCHB1_41; the bacterial biomarker for Mongolian horses was Planococcaceae; and the bacterial biomarkers for Hybrid horses were Moraxellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Ruminococcaceae. The functional prediction results indicated that the metabolic pathways differ significantly between the breeds. Regarding metabolism, the Hybrid horses had the lowest proportion of the carbohydrate metabolic pathways, while the energy metabolic pathway had the highest proportion. The abundance ratios of the remaining eight metabolic pathways in Hybrid horses were between Thoroughbred and Mongolian horses. In conclusion, the results of this study showed an association between horse breeds and gut microbiota.","misc","christiaan"

However, more recent studies have focused on its positive properties in antitumor immunity. Many studies have demonstrated a close association of the higher density of intratumoral B cells with favorable outcomes in cancer patients. B cells can interact with T cells as well as follicular dendritic cells within tertiary lymphoid structures, where they undergo a series of biological events, including clonal expansion, somatic hypermutation, class switching, and tumor-specific antibody production, which may trigger antitumor humoral responses. After activation, B cells can function as effector cells via direct tumor-killing, antigen-presenting activity, and production of tumor-specific antibodies. At the other extreme, B cells can obtain inhibitory functions by relevant stimuli, converting to regulatory B cells, which serve as an immunosuppressive arm to tumor immunity. Here we summarize our current understanding of the bipolar properties of B cells within the tumor immune microenvironment and propose potential B cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies, which may help promote cancer immunotherapy.","misc","christiaan"

The occurrence and development of GC is a complex process involving multiple biological mechanisms. Although traditional regulation modulates molecular functions related to the occurrence and development of GC, the comprehensive mechanisms remain unclear. Ultraconserved region (UCR) refers to a genome sequence that is completely conserved in the homologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes, with 100% identity, without any insertions or deletions, and often located in fragile sites and tumour-related genes. The transcribed UCR (T-UCR) is transcribed from the UCR and is a new type of long noncoding RNA. Recent studies have found that the expression level of T-UCRs changes during the occurrence and development of GC, revealing a new mechanism underlying GC. Therefore, this article aims to review the relevant research on T-UCRs in GC, as well as the function of T-UCRs and their regulatory role in the occurrence and development of GC, to provide new strategies for GC diagnosis and treatment.","misc","christiaan"

Current strategies for boosting high-quality graphene growth, such as remote metal catalyzation, are limited by poor performance with respect to the release of metal catalysts and hence suffer from a problem with metal residues. Herein, we report an effective approach that utilizes a metal-containing species, copper acetate, to continuously supply copper clusters in a gaseous form to aid transfer-free growth of graphene over a wafer scale. The thus-derived graphene films were found to show reduced multilayer density and improved electrical performance and exhibited a carrier mobility of 8500 cm2 V-1 s-1. Furthermore, droplet-based hydrovoltaic electricity generator devices based on directly grown graphene were found to exhibit robust voltage output and long cyclic stability, in stark contrast to their counterparts based on transferred graphene, demonstrating the potential for emerging energy harvesting applications. The work presented here offers a promising solution to organize the metal catalytic booster toward transfer-free synthesis of high-quality graphene and enable smart energy generation.","misc","christiaan"

Evaluating the risk factors associated with motor deficits after surgery in this region may help reduce the occurrence of motor deficits. To report our surgical experience in treating epileptic lesions involving the rolandic and perirolandic cortices. We performed a single-center retrospective review of patients undergoing epilepsy surgeries with lesions located in the rolandic and perirolandic cortices. Patients with detailed follow-up information were included. The lesion locations, resected regions, and invasive exploration techniques were studied to assess their relationship with postoperative motor deficits. Forty-one patients were included. Twenty-three patients suffered from a transient motor deficit, and 2 had permanent disabilities after surgery. Six patients with lesions at the posterior bank of the precentral sulcus underwent resection, and 5 experienced short-term motor deficits. Two patients with lesions adjacent to the anterior part of the precentral gyrus, in whom the adjacent precentral gyrus was removed, experienced permanent motor deficits. Lesions located at the bottom of the central sulcus and invading the anterior bank of the central sulcus were observed in 3 patients. The patients did not experience permanent motor deficits after surgery. The anterior bank of the central sulcus is indispensable for motor function, and destruction of this region would inevitably cause motor deficits. The anterior bank of the precentral gyrus can also be removed without motor impairment if there is a preexisting epileptogenic lesion.","misc","christiaan"

This study presents elemental geochemical data as well as palynofacies and palynomorph components of upper Albian reservoirs in the Abu Gharadig Basin, north Western Desert. During the mid-Cretaceous, the studied area is located in the transition zone between the fluvio-deltaic and shallow marine settings at the southern margin of the Tethys Ocean. Thirty rock cutting samples were collected from the Kharita Formation and analyzed for major and trace elements, total organic carbon, and palynological composition. These data, together with geophysical gamma ray log values and lithological composition, allowed us to reconstruct the changes in relative sea level at this time in the framework of a third-order transgressive-regressive (T-R) sequence stratigraphic model. Palynomorph composition, represented by a fairly diverse assemblage of terrestrial plant spores and pollen grains versus marine dinoflagellate cysts and other microplankton, was employed along with the variation in the particulate organic matter composition. Chemical proxies, including Si, Ti, and often K and Fe, and their ratios normalized to Al, as well as the carbonate content and the Sr/Ca ratio, provided significant stratigraphic variations with respect to sea-level changes.

Utilizing the rich electronic behaviour of these 1,3-N,S-chelated ruthenium species, we have established that a combination of redox-active ligands and metal-ligand cooperativity has a big influence on the multisite borane activation. For example, treatment of mer-2a-b with BH3·THF led to the isolation of fac-[PR3Ru{κ3-H,S,S'-(NH2BSBH2N)(S2C7H4)2}] (fac-3a: R = Cy and fac-3b: R = Ph) that captured boranes at both sites of the κ2-N,S-chelated ruthenacycles. The core structure of fac-3a and fac-3b consists of two five-membered ruthenacycles [RuBNCS] which are fused by one butterfly moiety [RuB2S]. Analogous fac-3c, [PPh3Ru{κ3-H,S,S'-(NH2BSBH2N)(SC5H4)2}], can also be synthesized from the reaction of BH3·THF with [PPh3{κ2-N,S-(SNC5H4)}{κ3-H,S,S'-BH2(SNH4C5)2}Ru], cis-fac-1c. In stark contrast, when mer-2b was treated with BH2Mes (Mes = 2,4,6-trimethyl phenyl) it led to the formation of trans- and cis-bis(dihydroborate) complexes [{κ3-S,H,H-(NH2BMes)Ru(S2C7H4)}2], (trans-4 and cis-4). Both the complexes have two five-membered [Ru-(H)2-B-NCS] ruthenacycles with κ2-H-H coordination modes.

However, HL can rarely occur in the elderly population (≥60 years) and probably has different biology as compared to the younger counterparts. There was a paucity of data on the clinical and epidemiological profile of the elderly subset with HL in Indian patients who are misdiagnosed and empirically treated as tuberculosis. We have done an analysis of this subset of elderly patients who were registered at our institute. Methods A retrospective chart analysis of HL patients who presented to our center from 2008 to 2016 was conducted. Twenty-eight patients with HL of age ≥60 years were included in this study. Results Elderly HL comprised 18.67% of the total HL patients registered during this period. The majority were male patients, and the mean age of presentation was 65.9±5.6 years. A Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of ≥2 was seen in 30.77% of the patients. Among these, 84.62% of the patients presented with advanced-stage disease, and 57.69% of the patients presented with B symptoms, which was significantly associated with a high-risk international prognostic score (IPS). Histology-wise, mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (MCCHL) and nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (NSCHL) were equally represented (30.76%). Of the patients, 50% had extranodal disease, with the liver being the most frequent site involved. One patient each had bone marrow involvement and bulky disease. CD30, CD15, and CD20 positivity was seen in 84.61%, 50%, and 26.92% of cases, respectively. Conclusion Among elderly HL patients, males were more commonly represented than females, and patients more often presented with advanced disease and B symptoms and less often with bulky disease and mediastinal mass. Mixed cellularity classical HL is more common in the elderly subset, and significant comorbidities are present in a higher number of elderly HL patients.","misc","christiaan"

This paper investigates entropy optimization and the effects of heat production, magnetic field, and various fluid parameters on the flow of second-grade fluid through unstratified and stably stratified paraboloids of revolution. In the heat transfer equation, stratification, linear thermal radiation, and Joule dissipation have all been explored. The similarity transformation is used to convert the governing PDEs into nonlinear ODEs. The HAM (homotopy analysis method) is used to solve dimensionless nonlinear ODEs. The impact of significant elements on various profiles is exposed and explored. Graphical results are used to examine the influence of the velocity profile, temperature, concentration, and entropy formation rate using tables to indicate the characteristics of skin friction, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number for numerous parameters. It is noticed that the velocity is enhanced by raising the stratification parameter, while the opposite behavior is observed for temperature distribution. The concentration profile declined as the solute stratification parameter was enhanced. For both the unstratified and stratified regions, incremental values of the Brinkman number and magnetic parameter depict augmentation in entropy production, while entropy production drops for a large value of the temperature ratio parameter.","misc","christiaan"

In the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for effective therapeutics and vaccine development. According to recent studies, disulfiram can act as a potent SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibitor by targeting multiple SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins to inhibit viral polyprotein cleavage and RNA replication. Currently, disulfiram is under evaluation in phase II clinical trials to treat COVID-19. With more and more variants of the SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, it becomes critical to know whether disulfiram can also inhibit viral entry into host cells for various variants and replication inhibition. Here, molecular and cellular biology assays demonstrated that disulfiram could interrupt viral spike protein binding with its receptor ACE2. By using the viral pseudo-particles (Vpps) of SARS-CoV-2, disulfiram also showed the potent activity to block viral entry in a cell-based assay against Vpps of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. We further established a live virus model system to support the anti-viral entry activity of disulfiram with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Molecular docking revealed how disulfiram hindered the binding between the ACE2 and wild-type or mutated spike proteins. Thus, our results indicate that disulfiram has the capability to block viral entry activity of different SARS-CoV-2 variants.

However, hard state assignment approaches assume that the brain traverses microstates in a discrete rather than continuous fashion. We present multimodal, multisubject directional archetypal analysis as a scale and polarity invariant extension to archetypal analysis using a loss function based on the Watson distribution. With this method, EEG/MEG microstates are modeled using subject- and modality-specific archetypes that are representative, distinct topographic maps between which the brain continuously traverses. Archetypes are specified as convex combinations of unit norm input data based on a shared generator matrix, thus assuming that the timing of neural responses to stimuli is consistent across subjects and modalities. The input data is reconstructed as convex combinations of archetypes using a subject- and modality-specific continuous archetypal mixing matrix. We showcase the model on synthetic data and an openly available face perception event-related potential data set with concurrently recorded EEG and MEG. In synthetic and unimodal experiments, we compare our model to conventional Euclidean multisubject archetypal analysis. We also contrast our model to a directional clustering model with discrete state assignments to highlight the advantages of modeling state trajectories rather than hard assignments. We find that our approach successfully models scale and polarity invariant data, such as microstates, accounting for intersubject and intermodal variability. The model is readily extendable to other modalities ensuring component correspondence while elucidating spatiotemporal signal variability.","misc","christiaan"

The effect of biochar on the variations in physicochemical properties, bacterial communities, antibiotics, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of compost product during co-composting of pig manure and corn straw have been investigated in this study. Compared with the control treatment (CK), biochar addition accelerated the increase in pile temperature and prolonged the high temperature period (>55°C) for 2 days. Under biochar influence, organic matter degradation, NH4 +-N conversion and NO3 --N production was accelerated, and dissolved total organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) utilization by microorganisms were enhanced. Biochar addition altered the microbial community and promoted the vital activity of Actinobacteria in the later composting stage. The antibiotics removal efficiency (except danofloxacin and enrofloxacin) was accelerated in the early composting stage (1-14 days) by biochar addition, the pile temperature had a positive effect on antibiotics removal, and the total antibiotics removal efficiency in CK and CK+Biochar treatments was 69.58% and 78.67% at the end of the composting process, respectively. The absolute abundance of most of the ARGs in the CK+Biochar treatment was lower than that in the CK treatment during composting, and the ARGs removal mainly occurred in the early (1-14 days) and later (28-50 days) stages. Biochar addition reduced the absolute abundance of MGEs (intI1, intI2) in the compost product, and most of the ARGs had a significant positive correlation with MGEs. Network analysis and redundancy analysis showed that ARGs and MGEs occurred in various host bacteria (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Halanaerobiaeota), and that DTN and NH4 +-N are the main factors regulating the changes in bacterial communities, antibiotics, ARGs, and MGEs during composting. Moreover, MGEs contributed the most to the variation in ARGs. In summary, biochar addition during composting accelerated antibiotics removal and inhibited accumulation and transmission of ARGs. The results of this study could provide theoretical and technical support for biochar application for antibiotics and ARGs removal during livestock and poultry manure composting.","misc","christiaan"

We enrolled a multicenter cohort of 247 patients with u-HCC treated with LEN between 2018 and 2020. Propensity score matching identified 63 matching pairs of patients with well-balanced characteristics. We retrospectively compared the clinical outcomes, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and incidence of adverse events (AEs), between the LEN-TACE and LEN monotherapy groups. Additionally, we evaluated the tumor response, change in albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, factors affecting PFS and OS, and independent predictors contributing to the LEN-TACE sequential therapy deep response. In this study, at eight weeks after resumption of LEN after initial TACE, deep response was defined as achieving complete response or partial response (PR) on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), and at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking the baseline sum diameters as the reference. The OS and PFS in the LEN-TACE group were significantly higher than those in the LEN monotherapy group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.037, respectively). The incidence of AEs related to LEN was not significantly different between the two groups. In LEN-TACE sequential therapy, the objective response rate was 61.9%, and the disease control rate was 74.6%, according to the mRECIST criteria. No significant change in the ALBI score was observed during sequential LEN-TACE therapy. Multivariable analyses revealed that deep response was independently associated with the outcome of the initial response to LEN by mRECIST: PR (odds ratio: 5.176, 95% confidence interval: 1.528-17.537, p < 0.001).

However, compared to TME in hepatitis C virus-infected HCC, the exploration of immune characteristics and response to immunotherapy associated with the pyroptosis phenotype is still insufficient in hepatitis B virus-related HCC (HBV-HCC). Our study constructed pyroptosis-score (PYS) via principal-component analysis (PCA) to unveil the link between pyroptosis and tumor immunity in 369 HBV-HCC patients. Compared with the low-PYS group, subjects with higher PYS were associated with poor prognosis but were more susceptible to anti-PD-L1 treatment. In addition, we found that PYS can serve independently as a prognostic factor for HBV-HCC, making it possible for us to identify specific small molecule drugs with a potential value in inhibiting tumors via targeting pyroptosis. Also, the target genes predicted by the Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and pharmacophore model were enriched in the HIF-1 signaling pathway and NF-kB transcription factor activity, which were related to the mechanism of inflammation-driven cancer. The PYS is extremely important in predicting prognosis and responses to immunotherapy.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 267 children attending elementary schools between February and August 2018. Sociodemographic data were collected using a structured interview. Bodyweight, height, and waist circumference were measured in duplicate; blood samples were taken after overnight fasting to determine blood lipids, hepatic enzymes, and adipokines; food intake data was assessed by two 24-h recalls administered to the guardians. Associations between cardiometabolic risk (i.e., blood lipids, hepatic enzymes, and adipokines) with sociodemographic characteristics, dietary intake, and waist circumference were tested using multiple hierarchical regression models. Twenty-nine percent of the children were overweight or obese, 12% had low HDL levels, and over 18% had high levels of LDL and triglycerides. Children living in the urban region had lower levels of HDL (β-4.07 mg/dL; 95% CI: -7.00; -1.15; P = 0.007) but higher levels of LDL cholesterol (β 8.52 mg/dL; 95% CI: 1.38; 15.66; P = 0.019).

Fiber intake was inversely associated with total cholesterol (β-9.27 mg/dL; 95% CI -18.09; -0.45; P = 0.040) and LDL cholesterol blood levels (β-9.99 mg/dL; 95% CI: -18.22; -1.75; P = 0.018). Our findings demonstrate that young children are at high cardiovascular risk; if no actions are taken, the burden of non-communicable diseases will be substantial. The differences in risk between rural and urban areas are evident; urbanization might predispose children to a different reality and, in most cases, result in poor habits.","misc","christiaan"

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed to better understand DDIs. However, identifying key substructures that contribute most to the DDI prediction is a challenge for GNNs. In this study, we presented a substructure-aware graph neural network, a message passing neural network equipped with a novel substructure attention mechanism and a substructure-substructure interaction module (SSIM) for DDI prediction (SA-DDI). Specifically, the substructure attention was designed to capture size- and shape-adaptive substructures based on the chemical intuition that the sizes and shapes are often irregular for functional groups in molecules. DDIs are fundamentally caused by chemical substructure interactions. Thus, the SSIM was used to model the substructure-substructure interactions by highlighting important substructures while de-emphasizing the minor ones for DDI prediction. We evaluated our approach in two real-world datasets and compared the proposed method with the state-of-the-art DDI prediction models. The SA-DDI surpassed other approaches on the two datasets. Moreover, the visual interpretation results showed that the SA-DDI was sensitive to the structure information of drugs and was able to detect the key substructures for DDIs. These advantages demonstrated that the proposed method improved the generalization and interpretation capability of DDI prediction modeling.","misc","christiaan"

This study aims to develop a Bayesian model to predict critical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Sensitivity and specificity were obtained from previous meta-analysis studies. The complex vulnerability index (IVC-COV2 index for its abbreviation in Spanish) was used to set the pretest probability. Likelihood ratios were integrated into a Fagan nomogram for posttest probabilities, and IVC-COV2 + National Early Warning Score (NEWS) values and CURB-65 scores were generated. Absolute and relative diagnostic gains (RDGs) were calculated based on pretest and posttest differences. The IVC-COV2 index was derived from a population of 1,055,746 individuals and was based on mortality in high-risk (71.97%), intermediate-risk (26.11%), and low-risk (1.91%) groups. The integration of models in which IVC-COV2 intermediate + NEWS ≥ 5 and CURB-65 > 2 led to a number needed to (NNT) diagnose that was slightly improved in the CURB-65 model (2 vs. 3). A comparison of diagnostic gains revealed that neither the positive likelihood ratio (P = 0.62) nor the negative likelihood ratio (P = 0.95) differed significantly between the IVC-COV2 NEWS model and the CURB-65 model. According to the proposed mathematical model, the combination of the IVC-COV2 intermediate score and NEWS or CURB-65 score yields superior results and a greater predictive value for the severity of illness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-based/mathematical model developed for use in COVID-19 critical care decision-making.","misc","christiaan"

The beige/brown adipose tissue plays a crucial role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism by increasing energy metabolism to generate heat. The adipose tissue thermogenic program is a complex network that involves many signaling pathways regulated by coding RNAs (cRNAs) that encode transcription factor, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). This article discusses factors that regulate adipose tissue thermogenesis, including cRNAs and ncRNAs, and the important role of thermogenic adipose tissue in obesity-related metabolic syndrome. Several studies have shown that some cRNAs and ncRNAs can modulate the thermogenic function of adipose tissue in different ways.

A better understanding of the burden of CO poisoning is essential for improving its management. A systematic analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019 was conducted. Following the general analytical strategy used in the GBD Study 2019, the sex- and age-specific incidence and mortality rates of CO poisoning and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to CO poisoning in China were analyzed. Estimated average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) in age-standardized rates were calculated by joinpoint regression analysis. The effects of age, period and cohort on the incidence of CO poisoning and DALYs due to CO poisoning were estimated by an age-period-cohort model. The age-standardized incidence and mortality rates as well as DALYs of CO poisoning per 100,000 population were estimated to be 21.82 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 15.05-29.98], 0.93 (95% UI: 0.63-1.11), and 40.92 (95% UI: 28.43-47.85), respectively, in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the AAPCs in the age-standardized incidence significantly increased in both males and females, while the age-standardized mortality rates and DALYs significantly decreased in both males and females. The incidence of CO poisoning peaked in individuals aged 15-19 years. Males had a higher burden of CO poisoning than females. The age effect showed that the relative risks (RRs) of incident CO poisoning decreased with age among males and females and that individuals aged 15-24 years had the highest RRs. The RRs of incident CO poisoning increased with time. The cohort effect showed that the incidence increased in successive birth cohorts. The incidence of CO poisoning in China increased from 1990 to 2019. More attention should be given to improving the burden of CO poisoning in Chinese adolescents. The results of this study can be used by health authorities to inform preventative measures to reduce the burden of CO poisoning.","misc","christiaan"

Genetic disparities between donor and host can result in immune-mediated attack of host tissues, known as graft versus host disease (GVHD), a major cause of morbidity and mortality following HSCT. Regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) are a rare cell type crucial for immune system homeostasis, limiting the activation and differentiation of effector T cells (Teff) that are self-reactive or stimulated by foreign antigen exposure. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with Treg has demonstrated, first in murine models and now in patients, that prophylactic Treg infusion can also suppress GVHD. While clinical trials have demonstrated Treg reduce severe GVHD occurrence, several impediments remain, including Treg variability and practical need for individualized Treg production for each patient. Additionally, there are challenges in the use of in vitro expansion techniques and in achieving in vivo Treg persistence in context of both immune suppressive drugs and in lymphoreplete patients being treated for GVHD. This review will focus on 3 main translational approaches taken to improve the efficacy of tTreg ACT in GVHD prophylaxis and development of treatment options, following HSCT: genetic modification, manipulating TCR and cytokine signaling, and Treg production protocols. In vitro expansion for Treg ACT presents a multitude of approaches for gene modification to improve efficacy, including: antigen specificity, tissue targeting, deletion of negative regulators/exhaustion markers, resistance to immunosuppressive drugs common in GVHD treatment. Such expansion is particularly important in patients without significant lymphopenia that can drive Treg expansion, enabling a favorable Treg:Teff ratio in vivo. Several potential therapeutics have also been identified that enhance tTreg stability or persistence/expansion following ACT that target specific pathways, including: DNA/histone methylation status, TCR/co-stimulation signaling, and IL-2/STAT5 signaling. Finally, this review will discuss improvements in Treg production related to tissue source, Treg subsets, therapeutic approaches to increase Treg suppression and stability during tTreg expansion, and potential for storing large numbers of Treg from a single production run to be used as an off-the-shelf infusion product capable of treating multiple recipients.","misc","christiaan"

We used direct strategies to recruit English-speaking obese and nonobese pregnant women aged 17-45 years, who were in the third trimester of pregnancy. The study required data collection at 32-34 and 34-36 gestational weeks and delivery. Strategies included frequent personal engagement with participants and staff to build relationships and trust, tangible appreciation, and the study team being present at delivery. In addition, leveraging hospital information technology (IT) services was critical to ensure retention through labor and delivery (LD). A racially (52% Black, 23% White, and 10% other) and ethnically (15% Hispanic or Latinx) diverse sample of pregnant women was enrolled. Of the 52 women enrolled, 85% of women completed all procedures. This is the first report of successful strategies for recruitment and retention of racially/ethnically diverse pregnant women in a longitudinal study requiring oral administration of an isotope tracer. Personal engagement with multiple touch points, starting with recruitment and continuing regularly throughout the third trimester, was the most successful strategy.

Through the cellular forcing and four-roll mill problem, we demonstrate that this modified artificial diffusivity is devoid of unphysical artifacts, allowing all features of elastic turbulence to be retained. Results are found to conform with direct simulations, reducing the impact of artificial diffusivity from a qualitative scale to a quantitative scale while only requiring a fraction of the numerical resolution.","misc","christiaan"
"1226",35982574,"Detecting vinyl chloride by phytoscreening in the shallow critical zone at sites with potential human exposure.","Chlorinated ethene (CE) contaminants are widespread in groundwater, and the occurrence of vinyl chloride (VC), among others, is a well-known issue due to its mobility, persistence, and carcinogenicity. Human exposure to VC may occur through inhalation after soil vapor intrusion into buildings at sites with shallow underground contamination. Soil vapor intrusion risk is traditionally assessed through indoor air and sub-slab sampling (direct evidence) or soil gas and groundwater surveys (indirect evidence). Phytoscreening (sampling and analysis of tree trunk matrices) was proven as a cost-effective alternative technique to indirectly detect shallow underground contamination by higher chlorinated ethenes and subsequent vapor intrusion risk. However, the technique has appeared barely capable to screen for the lower chlorinated VC, likely due to its fugacity and aerobic bio-degradability, with only one literature record to date showing successful detection in trees. We applied phytoscreening at two sites with severe CE contamination nearby residential buildings caused by illegal dumping of chlorinated pitches from petrochemical productions. The two sites show variable amounts of VC in the shallow groundwater (1e2 to 1e4 μg/L), posing potential sanitary risk issues. Former soil gas surveys did not detect VC in the vadose zone. At both sites, we sampled trunk micro-cores and trunk gas from poplar trees close to contaminated piezometers in different seasons. VC was detected in several instances, disproving the shared literature assumption of the inefficacy of phytoscreening towards this compound. Factors influencing the detectability of VC and other CEs in trees were analyzed through linear regressions. Two different conceptual models were proposed to explain the effective uptake of VC by trees at the two sites, i.e., direct uptake of contaminated groundwater at the first site and uptake of VC from an anoxic vadose zone at the second site. In planta reductive dechlorination of CEs is not expected based on current literature knowledge. Thus, the detection of VC in trunks would indicate its occurrence in the shallow underground, suggesting higher screening effectiveness of phytoscreening compared to soil gas; this has implications for indirect vapor intrusion risk assessment.","misc","christiaan"

The damage intensity of Spodoptera exigua at the seedling stage of quinoa fluctuates with the crop's biological cycle and the environmental changes throughout the growing season. In this study, we used independently selected quinoa seedling resistant and susceptible cultivars to investigate the difference between insect resistance and insect susceptibility of quinoa at the seedling stage. Samples were collected when Spodoptera exigua 45 days after planting the seedlings, and broad targeted metabolomics studies were conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry combined with transcriptomic co-analysis. The metabolomic and genomic analyses of the insect-resistant and insect-susceptible quinoa groups revealed a total of 159 differential metabolites and were functionally annotated to 2334 differential genes involved in 128 pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. In total, 14 metabolites and 22 genes were identified as key factors for the differential accumulation of insect-resistant metabolites in quinoa seedlings. Among them, gene-LOC110694254, gene-LOC110682669, and gene-LOC110732988 were positively correlated with choline. The expression of gene-LOC110729518 and gene-LOC110723164, which were notably higher in the resistant cultivars than in the susceptible cultivars, and the accumulations of the corresponding metabolites were also significantly higher in insect-resistant cultivars.

A clinical perspective.","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with barrier defects and immune dysregulations. The pathogenesis of AD involves the physical barrier as well as epithelial cells, which are considered a vital part of the innate immunity of the skin. The importance of filaggrin mutations in the pathogenesis of AD has also been well-established with reproducible results around the world in multiple studies and ethnic groups. This protein plays an important role in skin barrier functions and further reaffirms barrier defects as one of the primary causes of AD. The main epithelial cells, keratinocytes, function as a major sentinel for the skin in detecting danger signals or microbial pathogens, and trigger downstream immune responses. In AD, these cells express TSLP, IL-33 and IL-25, which lead to downstream systemic production of type 2 cytokines. In spite of major advances in our understanding of the innate immunity of AD, recent success in the systemic therapeutics of AD have focused on targeting the products of the adaptive immunity, particularly cytokines produced by T cells. In addition to type 2 cytokines, type 17 cytokines have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD.

The ability to form biofilms supports this highly selective pathogenic potential. In vitro studies essentially relying on phenotypic assays and genetic approaches have provided a detailed picture of the molecular events contributing to biofilm assembly. A major limitation in these studies is the use of synthetic growth media, which significantly differs from the environmental conditions S. epidermidis encounters during host invasion. Building on evidence showing that growth in serum substantially affects S. epidermidis gene expression profiles and phenotypes, the major aim of this study was to develop and characterize a growth medium mimicking synovial fluid, thereby facilitating research addressing specific aspects related to PJI. Using fresh human plasma, a protocol was established allowing for the large-scale production of a medium that by biochemical analysis matches key characteristics of synovial fluid and therefore is referred to as artificial synovial fluid (ASF). By analysis of biofilm-positive, polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA)-producing S. epidermidis 1457 and its isogenic, PIA- and biofilm-negative mutant 1457-M10, evidence is provided that the presence of ASF induces cluster formation in S. epidermidis 1457 and mutant 1457-M10. Consistent with the aggregative properties, both strains formed multilayered biofilms when analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. In parallel to the phenotypic findings, expression analysis after growth in ASF found upregulation of genes encoding for intercellular adhesins (icaA, aap, and embp) as well as atlE, encoding for the major cell wall autolysin being responsible for eDNA release. In contrast, growth in ASF was associated with reduced expression of the master regulator agr. Collectively, these results indicate that ASF induces expression profiles that are able to support intercellular adhesion in both PIA-positive and PIA-negative S. epidermidis. Given the observation that ASF overall induced biofilm formation in a collection of S. epidermidis isolates from PJI, the results strongly support the idea of using growth media mimicking host environments. ASF may play an important role in future studies related to the pathogenesis of S. epidermidis PJI.","misc","christiaan"

The results revealed that IMF significantly affected meat color, total muscle fiber numbers, and muscle fiber types in Tan sheep. Widely-targeted metabolomic analysis showed that amino acids were the main differential flavor precursors between lambs with different IMF content. Importantly, the comparison of fatty acid profiles revealed that saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids are beneficial for IMF deposition. Furthermore, integrated analysis between metabolome and transcriptome indicated that MME is a key gene resulting in the reduction of amino acids in lambs with high IMF content; and the joint analysis between fatty acid profiles and transcript profiles showed that ADIPOQ, FABP4, PLIN1, PPARGC1A, SLC2A1 accelerated IMF deposition through positive regulation of saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids metabolism. These results revealed key changes in meat quality affected by IMF content and the corresponding genetic mechanism, which may provide a new insight for understanding the IMF differential deposition and for improving meat quality in Tan sheep.","misc","christiaan"

We hypothesize that certain phenotypic traits are attributable to mutations in groups of associated SNPs. We propose a method based on a network analysis framework to study SNP-SNP interactions related to cancer incidence. We employed logistic regression to measure the significance of all SNP pairs from GWAS for the incidence of colorectal cancer and computed a cancer risk score based on the generated SNP networks. We demonstrated our method in a dataset from a case-control study of colorectal cancer in the South Sulawesi population. From the GWAS results, 20,094 pairs of 200 SNPs were created. We obtained one cluster containing four pairs of five SNPs that passed the filtering threshold based on their p-values. A locus on chromosome 12 (12:54410007) was found to be strongly connected to the four variants on chromosome 1.

IFs were divided into 2 groups, as genitourinary system and non- genitourinary system findings. In addition, IFs were also evaluated in 2 groups, as clinically significant and clinically non-significant. The patient population was divided into age ranges, and the frequency of IFs in these age ranges and their clinical significance were recorded. The mpMRI examinations of 426 patients revealed a total of 321 Ifs, comprising 212 (49.8%) genitourinary (41.1%) and 189 (58.9%) extragenitourinary findings. The mean age of the patients was 63.53 ± 7.89 years. As the age increased, the rate of IFs increased (p = 0.001).

Monopolar cautery remains the most utilized modality for achieving the aforementioned goals. Given the prolonged history and pre-modern development of Bovie cautery, there remains a paucity of data regarding appropriate settings and intensity for various tissue types, procedures, or locales. As a result, utilized settings depend on precedent and personal preference. We aimed to determine the amount of secondary soft tissue injury by volume and depth beyond the electrocautery pen tip in the skin and subcutaneous tissue as well as skeletal muscle.  Methods Porcine samples were used for experimental testing using two testing types: 1) skin and subcutaneous tissue and 2) Skeletal muscle. Sample sizes were standardized at 1 cm3 cubes. For skin samples, tissue injury was created with either a scalpel or electrocautery pen on cut setting, and tested at intensities from 10 to 150 in increments of 10. Skeletal muscle samples were similarly tested using the electrocautery pen only in either a cut or coagulation setting. Samples were tested at incremental intensities from 10 to 120 for both settings. Electrocautery was tested for a period of five seconds with a continuous current. All samples were placed in formalin and underwent histologic staining with hematoxylin and eosin staining to be assessed for the extent of tissue injury in terms of depth, radius, and volume. The measurements were recorded in millimeters. Results For skin incision, there was a positive and significant correlation with respect to the radius (R=.73, p=0.006). When considering intensity with an interval of 10-70 there was a positive and significant correlation with respect to the radius, depth, and volume. The cold knife incision had no notable soft tissue injury beyond the depth of the incision. Regarding skeletal muscle, again, a significant and positive correlation between increasing monopolar settings was noted for both the coagulation and cut functions (R=.84, p=.0005; R=0.84, p=0.0006). A positive correlation was found between increasing cut intensity and volume of soft tissue injury (R=0.73, p=.008); this was not reflected in the coagulation setting. When limited to an intensity range of 10-60, a significant relationship was noted for depth, radius and volume (R=.95, p= <0.001; R=0.98, p= <.001; R=.92, p=.001). Conclusion In all samples, apart from the cold knife skin incision, additional soft tissue injury beyond the tip of the electrocautery pen was noted. Given our findings, recommendations include using the lowest setting required for the purposes of the given surgical case as well as minimizing electrocautery use for skin incisions given its association with a larger volume of tissue injury in comparison with a scalpel. Additionally, electrocautery should be used with care in, and around neurovascular structures as soft tissue injury did occur several millimeters beyond the tip of the electrocautery pen. Further study is needed to see if these patterns are similar in living animals as well as human tissue and whether they bear any clinical impact on surgical wound healing or other surgical complications.","misc","christiaan"
"1356",35969104,"The Immersive Cleveland Clinic Virtual Reality Shopping Platform for the Assessment of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living.","A decline in the performance of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) has been proposed as a prodromal marker of neurological disease. Existing clinical and performance-based IADL assessments are not feasible for integration into clinical medicine. Virtual reality (VR) is a powerful yet underutilized tool that could advance the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disease. An impediment to the adoption and scaling of VR in clinical neurology is VR-related sickness resulting from sensory inconsistencies between the visual and vestibular systems (i.e., locomotion problem). The Cleveland Clinic Virtual Reality Shopping (CC-VRS) platform attempts to solve the locomotion problem by coupling an omnidirectional treadmill with high-resolution VR content, enabling the user to physically navigate a virtual grocery store to simulate shopping. The CC-VRS consists of Basic and Complex shopping experiences; both require walking 150 m and retrieving five items. The Complex experience has additional scenarios that increase the cognitive and motor demands of the task to better represent the continuum of activities associated with real-world shopping. The CC-VRS platform provides objective and quantitative biomechanical and cognitive outcomes related to the user's IADL performance. Initial data indicate that the CC-VRS results in minimal VR-sickness and is feasible and tolerable for older adults and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The considerations underlying the development, design, and hardware and software technology are reviewed, and initial models of integration into primary care and neurology are provided.","misc","christiaan"

In this study, we designed a series of dedicated WMH labeling protocols and proposed a convolutional neural network named 2D VB-Net for the segmentation of WMH and other coexisting intracranial lesions based on a large dataset of 1,045 subjects across various demographics and multiple scanners using 2D thick-slice protocols that are more commonly applied in clinical practice. Using our labeling pipeline, the Dice consistency of the WMH regions manually depicted by two observers was 0.878, which formed a solid basis for the development and evaluation of the automatic segmentation system. The proposed algorithm outperformed other state-of-the-art methods (uResNet, 3D V-Net and Visual Geometry Group network) in the segmentation of WMH and other coexisting intracranial lesions and was well validated on datasets with thick-slice magnetic resonance (MR) images and the 2017 medical image computing and computer assisted intervention WMH Segmentation Challenge dataset (with thin-slice MR images), all showing excellent effectiveness. Furthermore, our method can subclassify WMH to display the WMH distributions and is very lightweight. Additionally, in terms of correlation to visual rating scores, our algorithm showed excellent consistency with the manual delineations and was overall better than those from other competing methods. In conclusion, we developed an automatic WMH quantification framework for multiple application scenarios, exhibiting a promising future in clinical practice.","misc","christiaan"

Predictive models should be valid, generalizable, and clinically useful. The purpose of this review was to identify existing post-surgical complication prediction models for spinal surgery and to determine if these models are being adequately investigated with internal/external validation, model updating and model impact studies. This was a scoping review of studies pertaining to models for the prediction of post-surgical complication after spinal surgery published over 10 years (2010-2020). Qualitative data was extracted from the studies to include study classification, adherence to Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines and risk of bias (ROB) assessment using the Prediction model study Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Model evaluation was determined using area under the curve (AUC) when available. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement was used as a basis for the search methodology in four different databases. Thirty studies were included in the scoping review and 80% (24/30) included model development with or without internal validation. Twenty percent (6/30) were exclusively external validation studies and only one study included an impact analysis in addition to model development and internal validation. Two studies referenced the TRIPOD guidelines and there was a high ROB in 100% of the studies using the PROBAST tool. The majority of post-surgical complication prediction models in spinal surgery have not undergone standardized model development and internal validation or adequate external validation and impact evaluation. As such there is uncertainty as to their validity, generalizability, and clinical utility. Future efforts should be made to use existing tools to ensure standardization in development and rigorous evaluation of prediction models in spinal surgery.","misc","christiaan"

In this study, the yield of this anticancer agent in Taxus baccata cell suspensions was improved 11-fold after elicitation with coronatine (COR) compared to the untreated cells, and 18-fold when co-supplemented with methyl-β-cyclodextrins (β-CDs). In the dual treatment, the release of taxanes from the producer cells was greatly enhanced, with 81.6% of the total taxane content being found in the medium at the end of the experiment. The experimental conditions that caused the highest PTX production also induced its maximum excretion, and increased the expression of taxane biosynthetic genes, especially the flux-limiting BAPT and DBTNBT. The application of COR, which activates PTX biosynthesis, together with β - CDs, which form inclusion complexes with PTX and related taxanes, is evidently an efficient strategy for enhancing PTX production and release to the culture medium. Due to the recently described role of lipid droplets (LDs) in the trafficking and accumulation of hydrophobic taxanes in Taxus spp. cell cultures, the structure, number and taxane storage capacity of these organelles was also studied. In elicited cultures, the number of LDs increased and they mainly accumulated taxanes with a side chain, especially PTX. Thus, PTX constituted up to 50-70% of the total taxanes found in LDs throughout the experiment in the COR + β - CD-treated cultures. These results confirm that LDs can store taxanes and distribute them inside and outside cells.","misc","christiaan"

Generally, intercropping of gramineous grass and leguminous grass can achieve high productivity. However, how different water availability levels affect the productivity of intercropping system remains unclear. Here, we conducted a 3-year (2015-2017) study by manipulating the water conditions (CK equivalent to the annual precipitation, +50% treatment equivalent to 50% increase over the average precipitation, and -50% treatment equivalent to 50% decrease over the average precipitation) to explore the responses of plant traits, nitrogen use efficiency, and biomass of the monoculture of Medicago sativa (a leguminous grass, M.s), monoculture of Elymus nutans (a gramineous grass, E.n), and intercropping of M.s and E.n in a semi-arid region in Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that the biomass obtained by intercropping of M.s and E.n decreased by 24.4% in -50% treatment compared to the CK treatment, while that of the monoculture of M.s decreased by 34.4% under the -50% treatment compared to the CK treatment. However, there was no significant difference in the biomass between intercropping artificial grassland and monoculture M. sativa under +50% treatment. Compared to monoculture, M.s can obtain more nitrogen by biological nitrogen fixation and decrease the proportion of nitrogen absorbed from soils under intercropping in the same water conditions. Under the intercropping system, the proportions of nitrogen absorbed from soils by M.s were 87.4%, 85.1, and 76.9% in -50%, CK, and +50% treatments, respectively. Under monoculture, these proportions were 91.9, 89.3, and 82.3% in -50%, CK, and +50% treatments, respectively. Plant trait, but not soil nitrogen content, was the main regulator for the productivity responses to water level changes. Our results highlight that intercropping can achieve higher productivity in both dry and wet conditions. Therefore, considering the fluctuating rainfall events in the future, it might be useful to alter the proportions of intercropped forage species in an artificial grassland to obtain optimal productivity by reducing the limitations of nitrogen availability. However, the economic viability of intercropping M. sativa and E. nutans should be evaluated in the future.","misc","christiaan"

To date, no systematic analysis of GLK transcription factors in tree species has been conducted. In this study, 40 EgrGLK genes in the Eucalyptus grandis genome were identified and divided into seven groups based on the gene structure and motif composition. The EgrGLK genes were mapped to 11 chromosomes and the distribution of genes on chromosome was uneven. Phylogenetic analysis of GLK proteins between E. grandis and other species provided information for the high evolutionary conservation of GLK genes among different species. Prediction of cis-regulatory elements indicated that the EgrGLK genes were involved in development, light response, and hormone response. Based on the finding that the content of chlorophyll in mature leaves was the highest, and leaf chlorophyll content of triploid Eucalyptus urophylla was higher than that of the diploid control, EgrGLK expression pattern in leaves of triploid and diploid E. urophylla was examined by means of transcriptome analysis. Differential expression of EgrGLK genes in leaves of E. urophylla of different ploidies was consistent with the trend in chlorophyll content. To further explore the relationship between EgrGLK expression and chlorophyll synthesis, co-expression networks were generated, which indicated that EgrGLK genes may have a positive regulatory relationship with chlorophyll synthesis. In addition, three EgrGLK genes that may play an important role in chlorophyll synthesis were identified in the co-expression networks. And the prediction of miRNAs targeting EgrGLK genes showed that miRNAs might play an important role in the regulation of EgrGLK gene expression. This research provides valuable information for further functional characterization of GLK genes in Eucalyptus.","misc","christiaan"

Notably, the origin of natural pH gradients and how they have been incorporated in cellular systems is one of the most important questions in understanding the prebiotic origin of life. Herein, we have demonstrated a spatiotemporal pH gradient formation pattern on a hydrogel surface by employing two different enzymatic reactions, namely, the reactions of glucose oxidase (pH decreasing) and urease (pH increasing). We found here a generic pattern of spatiotemporal change in pH and proton transfer catalytic activity that was completely altered in a cationic gold nanoparticle containing hydrogel. In the absence of nanoparticles, the gradually generated macroscopic pH gradient slowly diminished with time, whereas the presence of nanoparticles helped to perpetuate the generated gradient effect. This behavior is due to the differential responsiveness of the interface of the cationic nanoparticle in temporally changing surroundings with increasing or decreasing pH or ionic contents. Moreover, the catalytic proton transfer ability of the nanoparticle showed a concerted kinetic response following the spatiotemporal pH dynamics in the gel matrix. Notably, this nanoparticle-driven spatiotemporally resolved gel matrix will find applicability in the area of the membrane-free generation and control of spatially segregated chemistry at the macroscopic scale.","misc","christiaan"
"733",35967426,"Identification and characterization of four immune-related signatures in keloid.","A keloid is a fibroproliferative disorder of unknown etiopathogenesis that requires ill-defined treatment. Existing evidence indicates that the immune system plays an important role in the occurrence and development of keloid. However, there is still a lack of research on the immune-related signatures of keloid. Here we identified immune-related signatures in keloid and explored their pathological mechanisms. Transcriptomic datasets (GSE7890, GSE92566, and GSE44270) of keloid and normal skin tissues were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The overlap of differentially expressed genes and immune-related genes was considered as differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIGs). Functional analysis, expression, and distribution were applied to explore the function and characteristics of DEIGs, and the expression of these DEIGs in keloid and normal skin tissues was verified by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we conducted interactive network analysis and immune infiltration analysis to determine the therapeutic potential and immune correlation. We identified four DEIGs (LGR5, PTN, JAG1, and DKK1). In these datasets, only GSE7890 met the screening criteria. In the GSE7890 dataset, DKK1 and PTN were downregulated in keloid, whereas JAG1 and LGR5 were upregulated in keloid. In addition, we obtained the same conclusion through immunohistochemistry. Functional analysis indicated that these four DEIGs were mainly involved in stem cell, cell cycle, UV response, and therapy resistance. Through interactive network analysis, we found that these DEIGs were associated with drugs currently used to treat keloid, such as hydrocortisone, androstanolone, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, BHQ-880, and lecoleucovorin. Finally, many immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, resting memory CD4+ T cells, and M1 macrophages, were obtained by immune infiltration analysis. In conclusion, we identified four immune signaling molecules associated with keloid (LGR5, PTN, JAG1, and DKK1). These immune-related signaling molecules may be important modules in the pathogenesis of keloid. Additionally, we developed novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of this challenging disease.","misc","christiaan"
"903",35968331,"CDC20 is a novel biomarker for improved clinical predictions in epithelial ovarian cancer.","Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), a common tumor of the female reproductive system, ranks first in fatalities among gynecological malignancies. Most patients find tumors at late stage and have extremely poor prognoses, which necessitates improvements in early detection. This study applied bioinformatic methods to identify potential biomarkers of EOC. First, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and hub genes, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The network of hub genes was analyzed using GeneMANIA, and an analysis of biological processes was constructed with BINGO. Lastly, hub genes were analyzed for EOC-related oncology using the Oncomine and TCGA databases, and the cBioPortal online platform. Overall, cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) was identified as a key gene in EOC. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to silence CDC20 to explore its effects on EOC cell proliferation, apoptosis and SRY-related HMG-box 2 (SOX2) expression. DEGs were enriched in pathways related to cell cycle signaling, cancer, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, Wnt signaling and P53 signaling. Analysis revealed high expression of CDC20 in EOC tissues and a correlation with histology and tumor grade. CDC20 levels are highest in serous adenocarcinoma, when compared to ovarian clear cell carcinoma, ovarian endometrioid carcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma. High CDC20 expression within the tumor is associated with poor EOC prognosis. After silencing CDC20, EOC cell proliferation and migration decreased, apoptosis increased, and SOX2 expression decreased. In conclusion, CDC20 is likely a key biomarker of EOC and may act as an upstream regulator of SOX2 to mediate the SOX2 signaling in the progression of EOC. Future application of CDC20 analysis to early detection may improve prognosis, and it has the potential to be a therapeutic target.","misc","christiaan"

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of JIA have identified hundreds of risk factors, but few of them implicated specific biological mechanisms. A cross-tissue transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was performed with the functional summary-based imputation software (FUSION) tool based on GWAS summary datasets (898 JIA patients and 346,102 controls from BioBank Japan (BBJ)/FinnGen). The gene expression reference weights of skeletal muscle and the whole blood were obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTExv8) project. JIA-related genes identified by TWAS findings genes were further compared with the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified by the mRNA expression profile of JIA from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number: GSE1402). Last, candidate genes were analyzed using functional enrichment and annotation analysis by Metascape to examine JIA-related gene sets. The TWAS identified 535 significant genes with P < 0.05 and contains 350 for Asian and 195 for European (including 10 genes both expressed in Asian and European), such as CDC16 (P = 1.72E-03) and PSMD5-AS1 (P = 3.65E-02).

"1476",35974633,"Effects of time-varying habitat connectivity on metacommunity persistence.","Network structure or connectivity patterns are critical in determining collective dynamics among interacting species in ecosystems. Conventional research on species persistence in spatial populations has focused on static network structure, though most real network structures change in time, forming time-varying networks. This raises the question, in metacommunities, how does the pattern of synchrony vary with temporal evolution in the network structure. The synchronous dynamics among species are known to reduce metacommunity persistence. Here we consider a time-varying metacommunity small-world network consisting of a chaotic three-species food chain oscillator in each patch or node. The rate of change in the network connectivity is determined by the natural frequency or its subharmonics of the constituent oscillator to allow sufficient time for the evolution of species in between successive rewirings. We find that over a range of coupling strengths and rewiring periods, even higher rewiring probabilities drive a network from asynchrony towards synchrony. Moreover, in networks with a small rewiring period, an increase in average degree (more connected networks) pushes the asynchronous dynamics to synchrony. On the other hand, in networks with a low average degree, a higher rewiring period drives the synchronous dynamics to asynchrony resulting in increased species persistence. Our results also follow the calculation of synchronization time and are robust across other ecosystem models. Overall, our study opens the possibility of developing temporal connectivity strategies to increase species persistence in ecological networks.","misc","christiaan"

However, most of the previously studied interventions target individual decisions and are not directed to changing consumers' underlying perception of unhealthy food. Here, we investigate how a healthy eating call-first-person narrative by a health expert-affects individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) for sugar-free and sugar-containing food products. Participants performed two blocks of a bidding task, in which they had to bid on sweets labeled either as sugar- free or as sugar-containing. In-between the two blocks, half of the participants listened to a narrative by a dietary specialist emphasizing the health risks of sugar consumption, whereas the remaining participants listened to a control narrative irrelevant to food choices. We demonstrate that the health expert's narrative decreased individuals' WTP for sugar-containing food, but did not modulate their WTP for sugar- free food. Overall, our findings confirm that consumers may conform to healthy eating calls by rather devaluating unhealthy food products than by increasing the value of healthy ones. This paves the way for an avenue of innovative marketing strategies to support individuals in their food choices.","misc","christiaan"

One of the main challenges in myeloma therapy is acquired resistance to drugs. Several theories have been proposed to describe the mechanisms responsible for resistance to the most commonly used proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib. This study aimed to describe functional differences between sensitive myeloma cells (MM1S WT) and their daughter cell lines resistant to either bortezomib (MM1S/R BTZ) or carfilzomib (MM1S/R CFZ), as well as between both resistant cell lines. Bortezomib- and carfilzomib-resistant cell lines were successfully generated by continuous exposure to the drugs. When exposed to different drugs than during the resistance generation period, MM1S/R BTZ cells showed cross-resistance to carfilzomib, whereas MM1S/R CFZ cells were similarly sensitive to bortezomib as MM1S WT cells. Following proteomic profiling, unsupervised principal component analysis revealed that the MM1S/R BTZ and MM1S/R CFZ cell lines differed significantly from the MM1S WT cell line and from each other. Canonical pathway analysis showed similar pathways enriched in both comparisons - MM1S WT vs. MM1S/R CFZ and MM1S WT vs. MM1S/R BTZ. However, important differences were present in the statistical significance of particular pathways. Key alterations included the ubiquitin-proteasome system, metabolic pathways responsible for redox homeostasis and the unfolded protein response. In functional studies, both drugs continued to reduce chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity in resistant cells. However, the baseline activity of all three catalytic domains of the proteasome was higher in the resistant cells. Differences in generation of reactive oxygen species were identified in MM1S/R BTZ (decreased) and MM1S/CFZ cells (increased) in comparison to MM1S WT cells. Both baseline and drug-induced activity of the unfolded protein response were higher in resistant cells than in MM1S WT cells and included all three arms of this pathway: IRE1α/XBP1s, ATF6 and EIF2α/ATF4 (downstream effectors of PERK). In conclusion, contrary to some previous reports, resistant MM1S cells show upregulation of unfolded protein response activity, reflecting the heterogeneity of multiple myeloma and prompting further studies on the role of this pathway in resistance to proteasome inhibitors.","misc","christiaan"

Statements were formulated, based on the most recent published evidence and the clinicians' personal experience, then discussed, and agreed upon by the experts through a two-round voting procedure. Approval of a statement was reached with an average score ≥7. Thirteen statements dealing with three main topics (i.e., clinical diagnosis and prognosis, impact on the Quality of Life (QoL), and treatment strategies) were generated. Six statements achieved a level of agreement sufficient for approval on the first voting round. Following the discussion and a few consequent amendments, most of the statements increased their level of agreement and all 13 were approved. Overall, the statements draw a slightly more benign picture of this rare and severe disease, highlighting the possibility of remission - albeit modest -, an apparent trend towards lower mortality, and the availability of several effective drugs, to which greater accessibility would be hoped for. Valproate remains a major therapeutic option in LGS patients although lamotrigine, rufinamide, topiramate, cannabidiol, and clobazam are popular therapeutic options in Italy, allowing for a tailor-made antiseizure therapy.","misc","christiaan"

Other questions that remain unanswered also include: What is the ideal selectivity between JAK1 and JAK3? Which cells are most relevant to JAK blockade? And what is the ideal tissue distribution pattern for addressing specific autoimmune conditions? We hypothesized that JAK3 selectivity is most relevant to low-dose clinical effects and interleukin-10 (IL-10) stimulation in particular, that immune cells are the most important compartment, and that distribution to inflamed tissue is the most important pharmacokinetic characteristic for in vivo disease modification. To test these hypotheses, we prepared modified derivatives of JAK3 specific inhibitors that target C909 near the ATP binding site based on FM-381, first reported in 2016; a compound class that was hitherto limited in uptake and exposure in vivo. These limits appear to be due to metabolic instability of side groups binding in the selectivity pocket. We identified derivatives with improved stability and tissue exposure. Conjugation to macrolide scaffolds with medium chain linkers was sufficient to stabilize the compounds and improve transport to organs while maintaining JAK3 affinity. These conjugates are inflammation targeted JAK3 inhibitors with long tissue half-lives and high exposure to activated immune cells.","misc","christiaan"

In this paper, the evolution properties of collisions between RWs are studied numerically for two-component coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. We find that whether a second-order RW can be successfully excited strongly depends on the location and time of the first-order RWs encountered. Only when the highest peaks of two RWs meet at the same position at the same time, can the standard second-order RW be triggered and its structure is in good agreement with the exact solution. Further, we demonstrate that such results are also applicable to the collision of subordinate RWs. This paper not only reveals the collision properties of RWs, but also provides a feasible scheme to generate higher-order RWs for experimental realization.","misc","christiaan"

However, little is known about the immune characteristic of COAD. Here, by calculating the enrichment score of immune characteristics in three online COAD datasets (TCGA-COAD, GSE39582, and GSE17538), we identified 17 prognostic-related immune characteristics that overlapped in at least two datasets. We determined that COADs could be stratified into three immune subtypes (IS1-IS3), based on consensus clustering of these 17 immune characteristics. Each of the three ISs was associated with distinct clinicopathological characteristics, genetic aberrations, tumor-infiltrating immune cell composition, immunophenotyping (immune hot and immune cold), and cytokine profiles, as well as different clinical outcomes and immunotherapy/therapeutic response. Patients with the IS1 tumor had high immune infiltration but immunosuppressive phenotype, IS3 tumor is an immune hot phenotype, whereas those with the IS2 tumor had an immune cold phenotype. We further verified the distinct immune phenotype of IS1 and IS3 by an in-house COAD cohort. We propose that the immune subtyping can be utilized to identify COAD patients who will be affected by the tumor immune microenvironment. Furthermore, the ISs may provide a guide for personalized cancer immunotherapy and for tumor prognosis.","misc","christiaan"

During the six months preceding his presentation, he had experienced increasing shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia with profound anemia (hemoglobin level 2.8 g/dL) along with evidence of acute kidney injury and acute heart failure; the patient was presumed to have multiorgan failure due to profound anemia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed dyspoiesis suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). There were no cytogenetic abnormalities observed. However, the blood workup analysis found low copper and ceruloplasmin levels, whereas zinc levels were excessively elevated (257 mg/dL). Upon inquiry, the patient reported taking an over-the-counter zinc supplement of an unknown quantity for over a year. After two months of copper treatment, his blood count returned to normal. This case highlights a rare presentation of zinc-induced copper deficiency resulting in pancytopenia and severe anemia-related multiorgan failure. A growing number of hematological disorders are being linked to copper deficiency. Copper deficiency pancytopenia is a reversible condition that often goes unnoticed and can be misdiagnosed as MDS because it has similar hematological characteristics.","misc","christiaan"

The common design of hydrogel-based artificial skin requires a dielectric sandwiched between two hydrogel layers for capacitive sensing. However, such a planar configuration limits the sensitivity, stretchability and self-healing properties. Here, we report the design of single-layer composite hydrogels with bulk capacitive junctions as mechanical sensors. We engineer dielectric peptide-coated graphene (PCG) to serve as homogenously dispersed electric double layers in hydrogels. Any mechanical motions that alter the microscopic distributions of PCG in the hydrogels can significantly change the overall capacitance. We use peptide self-assembly to render strong yet dynamic interfacial interactions between the hydrogel network and graphene. The resulting hydrogels can be stretched up to 77 times their original length and self-heal in a few minutes. The devices can effectively sense strain and pressure in both air and aqueous environments, providing tremendous opportunities for next-generation iontronics.","misc","christiaan"

Additionally, numerous immunomodulatory functions of serotonin have been discovered in mammals. However, the regulatory role of the serotonin system in fish immunity remains unclear. In this study, various serotonergic markers in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were identified and characterized. The involvement of the serotonin system during bacterial infection was investigated. Moreover, the expression characteristics and specific functions of serotonergic markers within Nile tilapia immune cells were also assessed. Overall, 22 evolutionarily conserved serotonergic marker genes in Nile tilapia were cloned and characterized. Transcriptional levels of these molecules were most abundant in the brain, and their transcripts were induced during Streptococcus agalactiae infection. Nevertheless, few serotonergic markers exist on Nile tilapia immune cells, and no distinct immunomodulation effect was observed during an immune response. The present study lays a theoretical foundation for further investigation of the immunological mechanisms in fish as well as the evolution of the serotonin system in animals.","misc","christiaan"

Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is a biomarker with discording results regarding survival benefits in lung cancer. In our research, we studied the relationship between these two markers in patients with lung cancer. Methods Patients with stage I, II, III, and IV lung cancer (n = 80) were included in this retrospective study. The NLR baseline was recorded before the initiation of treatment. The NLR cut-off value was 4. PD-L1 expression was determined by immunohistochemical staining. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted to test their prognostic value. Results NLR proved to be a significant prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.002, Log Rank) with a mean PFS of 27.7 months for low NLR patients and 12.8 months for high NLR patients. It was also significant for overall survival (OS) (p=0.007, Log Rank) with a mean OS of 52 months for low NLR patients and 41.6 months for high NLR patients. The prognostic impact of PD-L1 expression on PFS and OS was not statistically significant with a mean PFS of 23.1 months for PD-L1-negative patients and 15.8 months for PD-L1-positive patients (p=0.422, Log Rank). Mean OS was 49 months for PD-L1-negative patients while for PD-L1-positive patients, it was 43.3 months (p=0.550 Log Rank). Regarding the correlation between PD-L1 expression and NLR value, PFS mean survival times were 13.1 months for PD-L1(+)/NLR>4, 15.1 months for PD-L1(-)/NLR>4, 16.4 months for PD-L1(+)/NLR<4 and 27.8 months for PD-L1(-)/NLR<4. This correlation between PFS and the combined PD-L1 and NLR prognostic factor was statistically relevant (p=0.04). For OS, the PD-L1/NLR combined prognostic factor was not statistically relevant (p=0.055). A mean PFS time of 27.8 months was reported for PD-L1(-)/NLR<4 group patients while for the other groups, the mean PFS was 14.9 months (p=0.045). In univariate analysis, the elevated NLR was significantly associated with a decreased PFS time (HR=2.31, 95% CI =1.323- 4.051, p=0.03) as well as OS (HR=3.555, 95% CI=1.310- 9.652, p=0.013). In multivariate analysis, NLR remained statistically significant for PFS (HR=2.160, 95% CI=1.148- 4.062, p=0.013) and OS (HR=4.364, 95% CI=1.474- 12.921, p=0.008) after adjusting for the factors of age, gender, tumor stage, lymph node stage, clinical stage, histology, and PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression was not a valid prognostic factor for progression or death in either univariate or multivariate analysis. We also stratified the disease control rate (DCR) depending on PD-L1/NLR combined factor expression. In the PD-L1(-)/NLR<4 group, we had the highest number of partial responses (PRs) and only one complete response (CR) compared to the other groups (p=0.006). Conclusions As the number of patients is limited in the present analysis, it is hypothesized that these two markers can be useful in dividing patients into two prognostic groups: the good prognostic group reunites PD-L1(+)/NLR<4 and PD-L1(-)/NLR<4 and the poor prognostic group reunites PD-L1(+)/NLR>4 and PD-L1(-)/NLR>4.","misc","christiaan"

Titanium, zinc, and iron compounds are most often combined with biochar; therefore, combinations of their oxides with biochar are the focus of this review. The first part of this paper presents the most important information about biochar, including its advantages, disadvantages, and possible modification, emphasizing the incorporation of inorganic oxides into its structure. In the next four sections, systems of biochar combined with TiO2, ZnO, Fe3O4, and other metal oxides are discussed in detail. In the next to last section probable degradation mechanisms are discussed. Literature studies revealed that the dispersion of a metal oxide in a carbonaceous matrix causes the creation or enhancement of surface properties and catalytic or, in some cases, magnetic activity. Addition of metallic species into biochars increases their weight, facilitating their separation by enabling the sedimentation process and thus facilitating the recovery of the materials from the water medium after the purification process. Therefore, materials based on the combination of inorganic oxide and biochar reveal a wide range of possibilities for environmental applications in aquatic media purification.","misc","christiaan"

The burial and thermal histories of single wells were reconstructed, and time-temperature-pressure of oil and gas filling were clarified using microscopy observation, Raman microprobe analyses, geochemical tests, and fluid inclusion microtemperature measurement. The shale fracture veins of the Wufeng-Longmaxi Formation in the Yuxi Region are mainly formed vertically and horizontally, where the vein-forming fluids are derived from endogenous fluids. A large number of methane inclusions, bituminous inclusions, and methane-bearing bituminous inclusions within the veins confirm the process of oil cracking gas and kerogen cracking gas. The homogeneous temperature (Th) of the aqueous inclusions contemporaneous with the bituminous inclusions ranges from 109.3 to 174.1 °C, which were trapped during 220 to 250 Ma. The homogeneous temperature of the aqueous inclusions contemporaneous with the methane inclusions ranges from 137.3 to 226.8 °C, which were trapped during 160 to 195 Ma and 51 to 56 Ma. The trapped pressure calculated by high-density methane inclusions (0.246-0.293 g/cm3) is between 82.9 and 140.1 MPa, with a pressure coefficient between 1.64 and 2.07. The formation pressure coefficient is nearly two, indicating that the current overpressure is inherited from the overpressure at the maximum burial depth. The earlier the fracture vein opening, the less the damage to the shale gas accumulation, and the more opening-closing phases, the lower the homogeneous temperature of the gas-liquid two-phase aqueous inclusions coeval with the high-density methane inclusions and the greater the degree of damage to the shale gas accumulation. The results provide a basis for further study on the genesis of overpressure and the migration of shale gas.","misc","christiaan"

This scenario provides a justifiable avenue to test the dilatation of the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT). Through a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we have shown how the Loschmidt echo, Fisher zero, and Dynamical topological order parameter (DTOP) transit from one to two dimensions. Owing to the introduced pseudomomentum, the derivative of the return rate does not always capture the DQPT well, but the Fisher zero and the DTOP can be treated as faithful indicators. A topology-independent parameter will also affect the occurrence of the DQPTs for quenches inside a given phase. Moreover, a comparison with the Haldane model owning the same phase diagram implies that a pair of fixed points will lead to different critical momentum distributions, thus different robustness, further reminding us that the correspondences between the equilibrium and dynamical phases transitions are multifarious.","misc","christiaan"

The quantitation of microbial exoelectrogenic ability is fundamental to studying the process of EET.

In this work, we proposed an accurate and rapid quantitation system for measuring EET ability using a gold-coated membrane filter as a working electrode. The quantitation signals could be recorded within 1 h and accurately normalized by the number of cells with outstanding repeatability and reproducibility. Further, this method could be distinguished microbial direct EET performances of different growth stages, and the results showed the middle logarithmic growth stage of Shewanella onedensis MR-1 had the best electrochemical activity. This method can be widely used for different types of electroactive microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and fungi. Due to its time savings, accurate quantification and easy operation, this method provides a standard way to assess the role of EET ability.","misc","christiaan"
"1441",35977783,"Effects of Plasticity on Elevational Range Size and Species Richness.","AbstractElevational ranges within many taxa are greater in the north temperate region than the tropics. Two hypotheses to explain the pattern are, first, that large elevational ranges in the temperate region arise because species have evolved broad tolerance curves in response to seasonality and, second, that a low diversification rate in the temperate region (speciation minus extinction) has led to relatively few species, each of which occupies a large elevational range in the absence of competitors (character release). We build a quantitative genetic model of selection on a phenotypic trait, whereby increased tolerance is modeled as arising from plasticity in the trait. We show that broad tolerances result in evolution of large elevational ranges because they induce shallower genotypic clines and hence reduced maladaptive gene flow. The evolution of large elevational ranges results in relatively few competing species arranged along the elevational gradient at a species carrying capacity. In such saturated communities, species have much elevational overlap. In contrast, in similar-sized communities that could accommodate many more species, the resulting character release is associated with smaller elevational overlaps. Empirical assessment of these predictions should contribute to assessing any role for ecological limits in driving the latitudinal diversity gradient in species richness.","misc","christiaan"

We examined in detail the dynamics of particles and identified particle trajectories which contribute the most to vacuum breakdown in such highly inhomogeneous fields. We analyzed the dynamics of the electron-positron plasma distribution on the avalanche stage. It is shown that the forming plasma structures represent concentric toroidal layers and the interplay between particle ensembles from different spatial regions favors vacuum breakdown. Based on the angular distribution of charged particles and gamma photons a way to experimentally identify the process of vacuum breakdown is proposed.","misc","christiaan"

As a phytohormone, auxin is transported between its synthesis sites and action sites. Most natural auxin moves between cells via a polar transport system that is mediated by PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin exporters. The asymmetrically localized PINs usually determine the directionality of intercellular auxin flow. Different internal cues and external stimuli modulate PIN polar distribution and activity at multiple levels, including transcription, protein stability, subcellular trafficking, and post-translational modification, and thereby regulate auxin-distribution-dependent development. Thus, the different regulation levels of PIN polarity constitute a complex network. For example, the post-translational modification of PINs can affect the subcellular trafficking of PINs. In this review, we focus on subcellular trafficking and post-translational modification of PINs to summarize recent progress in understanding PIN polarity.","misc","christiaan"

Detailed analysis on the growth of TiO2 on pre-annealed Si/TiN/Ti and HfO2 (HFO) surfaces is also given. For Si/TiN/Ti, a pre-annealing procedure led to the transformation of Ti to a TiO2 layer which acts as a seed for aligned growth of TiO2 nanorods. In contrast, Si/HFO does not provide a nucleation site for the formation of aligned nanorods. Various samples were prepared by varying the synthesis conditions, i.e. pre- and post-annealing temperatures and hydrothermal reaction time to figure out the optimum conditions which lead to unidirectional and highly aligned nanorods. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to study structural, morphological and optical properties of synthesized samples. It is found that TiO2 nanorods exhibit a rutile phase on the Si/Ti/TiN and Si/HFO substrates, but highly oriented vertical growth of nanorods has been observed only on pre-annealed Si/TiN/Ti substrates. On the other hand, TiO2 nanorods form dandelion-like structures on Si/HFO substrates. Growth of vertically oriented TiO2 nanorods on Si/TiN/Ti is attributed to the TiO2 seed layer which forms after the process of pre-annealing of substrates at a suitable temperature. Variation in hydrothermal reaction time and post-annealing temperature brings further improvement in crystallinity and morphology of nanorods. This work shows that the pre-annealed Si/TiN/Ti substrate is the optimal choice to achieve vertically oriented, highly aligned TiO2 nanorods.","misc","christiaan"

Although there is strong support for the use of student tutors (STs), there is a lack in gauging their effectiveness with more difficult organ systems such as the musculoskeletal (MSK) system. We aim to determine the effectiveness of using STs versus expert ultrasound instructors (UIs) when teaching MSK ultrasound. Methodology Medical students were recruited to participate in an MSK workshop to identify superficial volar arm structures (radial nerve, radial artery, median nerve, ulnar artery, ulnar nerve) using Butterfly iQ. In total, 14 participants were taught by STs and 10 participants were taught by UIs. Participants imaged the five structures and answered surveys gauging their confidence via five-point Likert scales. Results There was no significant difference in confidence or identification accuracy for all five structures between the two groups. However, there was a significant difference in confidence in the understanding of basic ultrasound concepts in favor of the UI group (p < 0.05). A greater number of students were more confident in identifying all five structures when taught by STs, but more students correctly identified the structures when taught by UIs. Conclusions The results on confidence could be due to positive peer perception. Both groups scored relatively high in their identification accuracies, promoting the successful use of STs.

The adsorption and desorption behavior of these elements on BC15 and BC18 has been examined in various types of aqueous solutions over a wide temperature range. As a result, it was shown that BC15 and BC18 have sufficient adsorption ability for the simultaneous recovery of V, U, and Li from seawater. Moreover, it was seen that the distribution coefficients (K d) of V decrease with an increase in [HCl]T (subscript T: total concentration), indicating that the anionic V species such as H2V4O13 4- are exponentially changed into the cationic V species such as V3+, VO2+, and VO2 + under the condition [HCl]T = 1.0 M, and the complexation reactions between BC15 (or BC18) and the initial V structures are inhibited. Besides, it was reasonably shown that the adsorption mechanism is the path through the electrostatic interaction between the anionic V species such as H2V4O13 4-, and the -C-O-C- single bond that the electron density is eccentrically located in ether functional groups in crown ether rings in BC15 and BC18 (or the -C-OH single bond that the electron density is eccentrically located in bisphenol A in BC15 and BC18). Then, the chromatography experiment of V, U, and Li on BC15 (or BC18) at 298 K was carried out by flowing seawater, 1.0 × 10-2 M HCl, and 1.0 M HCl in sequence. The first peak of V can be separated from the plateau of Li and the first and second peaks of U in the case of the BC15 system. The recovery ratios of V and U were more than 80%. On the other hand, entirely overlapping chromatograms were obtained in the case of the BC18 system, and accordingly, the recovery ratios of V and U were much lower. In short, the separation efficiency of V with BC15 is more pre-eminent than that with BC18. Judging from these results, the durability of BC15 was finally assessed for industrial applications, that is, the aforementioned chromatography experiment was repeatedly carried out to check whether V, U, and Li were stably and mutually separated from seawater or not. The evidence that the recovery performances of V, U, and Li from seawater do not decrease at all after at least five cycle tests was provided. This indicates that this information will be valuable for the development of a practical chromatographic technology to simultaneously recover V, U, and Li from seawater.","misc","christiaan"

From day 114 of gestation to 21st day of lactation(weaning), ten multiparous sows (n = 5/treatment) (Landrace x Yorkshire) were assigned randomly into one of two treatments: CON (basal diet) and TRT (CON + 0.05% SA). There was no significant difference in the body weight, backfat thickness, backfat loss, and body condition score in SA treated sows compared to sows fed the CON diet. However, the bodyweight of sow was dramatically reduced by an average of 16kg from farrowing to weaning time. The dietary inclusion of SA in the sow diet slightly improved the survival rate (p = 0.065) and showed a higher body weight (p = 0.009) in piglets. However, there was no significant difference in red blood cell, Fe, Hematocrit, and Hb concentrations between CON and TRT sows' groups, but the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) was significantly reduced in sows from the TRT group compared with the CON group from the beginning to weaning. The outcome of this trial shows that dietary addition of SA on sows diet from early lactation could increase the birth weight and TIBC of neonates at the end of the trial.","misc","christiaan"

Spatial variations in childhood stunting were observed due to changes in contextual variables from area to area, implying that geography is a crucial component in the development of strategies against childhood stunting. However, to our knowledge, there are no up-to-date studies on the distribution of childhood stunting and its determinants in Ethiopia. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution and determinants of stunting among children aged <5 y in Ethiopia. Geospatial and multilevel analysis of the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2019 data was done to investigate the spatial distribution and determinants of stunting among children aged <5 y in Ethiopia. The analysis included 5753 weighted children aged <5. Spatial autocorrelations analysis was done to assess the spatial dependency of stunting. Hot spot and cluster outlier analysis was used to observe the spatial clustering of stunting. Kriging interpolation was used to predict stunting in an unsampled area. A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted to identify determinants of stunting. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated and variables having a P < 0.05 were declared statistically significant. The national prevalence of stunting was 36.81% (95% CI, 35.48%-38.15%), with significant spatial variations across Ethiopia. Spatial clustering of stunting was detected in the northern, northwestern, northeastern, and southwestern parts of Ethiopia. Age and sex of the child, birth interval, birth type, household wealth status, maternal education, region, and community-level illiteracy were factors significantly associated with stunting. Stunting significantly varies across Ethiopia, with the highest prevalence in Northern Ethiopia. Older age, poor family wealth, maternal illiteracy, and community illiteracy level were the significant determinants of stunting in children aged <5 y in this study. Policymakers should design interventions to reduce stunting among children aged <5 y through accessing education for women and applying economic empowerment strategies in the hot spot areas.","misc","christiaan"

It has triggered populist reactions within nation states and helped to discredit the intermediary institutions (parties and parliaments) that connect democratic will-formation and joint decision-making. This rise of populism and its alignment with nationalism, in consequence, hampers joint decision-making in the international realm. We argue that representative democracies can overcome the negative spiral between technocratic intergovernmentalism and nationalist populism by mutually granting their citizens the right to elect representatives not only in their domestic parliament, but also in the parliaments of 'consociated democracies'. Such a system of horizontally expanded and overlapping national democracies can serve three functions: it re-empowers citizens in a world of cross-border flows, it curbs the self-destructive polarization of party systems and it facilitates cooperation among democracies within the European Union (EU) and beyond. Finally, we discuss three competing approaches: Liberal Multilateralism, Deliberative Transnationalism and Republican Intergovernmentalism. We point to common ground, but also show how our approach avoids their main pitfalls.","misc","christiaan"

To determine the precise N-glycan structure attached to Asn374, whether A2G2S2 is composed of the Neu5Acα2,3Gal or/and the Neu5Acα2,6Gal moiety, we synthesized key glycopeptides having one of the two putative isomers. Selective reaction monitoring assay using synthetic glycopeptides as calibration standards allowed top-down glycopeptidomics for the absolute quantitation of targeted label-free glycopeptides in a range from 313.3 to 697.5 nM in the complex tryptic digests derived from serum samples of RCC patients and healthy controls. Our results provided evidence that the Asn374 residue of human clusterin is modified dominantly with the Neu5Acα2,6Gal structure and the levels of clusterin bearing an A2G2S2 with homo Neu5Acα2,6Gal terminals at Asn374 decrease significantly in RCC patients as compared with healthy controls. The present study elicits that a new strategy integrating the bottom-up glycoproteomics with top-down glycopeptidomics using structure-defined synthetic glycopeptides enables the confident identification and quantitation of the glycopeptide targets pre-determined by the existing methods for intact glycopeptide profiling.","misc","christiaan"

We also explored the impact of (1) screening only, (2) screening plus expedited partner therapy, and (3) screening plus partner testing. Change of chlamydia prevalence before and after implementing the different strategies. The cost-effectiveness analysis reports total direct cost from a health provider perspective, the QALYs gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). In comparing the effects of universal screening only and targeted screening of the high-risk population, the mean prevalence during the 10th year of intervention was 2.75 ± 0.30% and 2.35 ± 0.21%, respectively (compared with 3.24 ± 0.30% and 3.35 ± 0.21% before the interventions, respectively). The addition of contact tracing to the latter targeted screening scenario reduces the mean prevalence during the 10th year of intervention to 1.48 ± 0.13% (compared with 3.31 ± 0.33% at baseline) in the best-case of testing before treatment and maximal contact-tracing effectiveness (40%). Overall, the most effective scenarios were those for which interventions focused on the high-risk population defined by the number of partners, with contact tracing included. The ICER for targeted screening with contact tracing at 20% and 40% efficiency was $4,634 and $7,219 per QALY gained, respectively (10-year time horizon). Expedited partner therapy did not significantly impact overall chlamydia prevalence and caused overtreatment.

The wild tomato relative Solanum galapagense accession LA1141 demonstrates the ability to tolerate deficit irrigation, making it a potential resource for crop improvement. Accessing traits from LA1141 through introgression may improve the response of cultivated tomatoes grown in water-limited environments. Canopy temperature is a proxy for physiological traits which are challenging to measure efficiently and may be related to water deficit tolerance. We optimized phenotypic evaluation based on variance partitioning and further show that objective phenotyping methods coupled with genomic prediction lead to gain under selection for water deficit tolerance. The objectives of this work were to improve phenotyping workflows for measuring canopy temperature, mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from LA1141 that contribute to water deficit tolerance and comparing selection strategies. The phenotypic variance attributed to genetic causes for canopy temperature was higher when estimated from thermal images relative to estimates based on an infrared thermometer. Composite interval mapping using BC2S3 families, genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphisms, suggested that accession LA1141 contributed alleles that lower canopy temperature and increase plant turgor under water deficit. QTLs for lower canopy temperature were mapped to chromosomes 1 and 6 and explained between 6.6 and 9.5% of the total phenotypic variance. QTLs for higher leaf turgor were detected on chromosomes 5 and 7 and explained between 6.8 and 9.1% of the variance. We advanced tolerant BC2S3 families to the BC2S5 generation using selection indices based on phenotypic values and genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs). Phenotypic, genomic, and combined selection strategies demonstrated gain under selection and improved performance compared to randomly advanced BC2S5 progenies. Leaf turgor, canopy temperature, stomatal conductance, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were evaluated and compared in BC2S5 progenies grown under deficit irrigation. Progenies co-selected for phenotypic values and GEBVs wilted less, had significantly lower canopy temperature, higher stomatal conductance, and lower VPD than randomly advanced lines. The fruit size of water deficit tolerant selections was small compared to the recurrent parent. However, lines with acceptable yield, canopy width, and quality parameters were recovered. These results suggest that we can create selection indices to improve water deficit tolerance in a recurrent parent background, and additional crossing and evaluation are warranted.","misc","christiaan"

Insufficient trophoblast invasion and migration has been considered to be an important cause of this disease. The present study aimed to investigate the role of peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), whose knockdown has been previously indicated to reduce inflammation and susceptibility to pregnancy loss in mice, in the development of PE in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to treat a human trophoblast cell line (HTR8/SVneo). After PAD4 silencing via transfection with short hairpin RNA against PAD4, the concentrations of inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-12 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 were measured using ELISA. Cell viability was also measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. HTR8/SVneo cell invasion and migration were detected using Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. Western blotting was used to measure the expression of citrullinated NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) and nuclear NF-κB p65 protein levels. TNF-α was applied for evaluating the potential regulatory effects of PAD4 on NF-κB in LPS-stimulated HTR8/SVneo cells. LPS increased the levels of IL-6, IL-12 and MCP-1 and reduced the migration and invasion of HTR8/SVneo cells. PAD4-knockdown was found to markedly reduce the levels of IL-6, IL-12 and MCP-1 secretion. HTR8/SVneo cell invasion and migration was also significantly elevated after PAD4 silencing following LPS exposure. In addition, LPS stimulation notably upregulated the protein levels of citrullinated NEMO and nuclear NF-κB p65, which was restored by PAD4 knockdown. Furthermore, TNF-α treatment partially counteracted the effects of PAD4 knockdown on the secretion of IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-12, which are markers of inflammation, and invasion and migration in LPS-induced HTR8/SVneo cells. To conclude, these results suggest that PAD4 silencing can suppress inflammation whilst promoting invasion and migration by trophoblast cells through inhibiting the NEMO/NF-κB pathway. These findings furthered the understanding in the complex molecular mechanism that can trigger PE and provide a promising target for the treatment of this disease.","misc","christiaan"

This study examined relationships among circulating cortisol, a measure of HPA axis activity and physiological stress; s100A8/A9, a RAGE ligand and emerging cancer-related biological measure; and self-reported cancer-related distress. Patients with BCa (N = 183, stage 0-IIIb) were recruited 2-10 weeks post-surgery but prior to receiving adjuvant therapies. Participants provided blood samples, from which serum cortisol and s100A8/A9 levels were determined, and completed a psychosocial questionnaire. Regression analyses, adjusting for age, cancer stage, time since surgery, race, and menopausal status, were conducted examining the relationships between cortisol, s100A8/A9, and cancer-related distress (Impact of Event Scale [IES]-Revised). Cortisol and s100A8/A9 levels were positively related (β = .218, t(112) = 2.332, p = .021), although the overall model was not significant. Cortisol levels were also positively associated with IES-Intrusions (β = .192, t(163) = 2.659, p = .009) and IES-Hyperarousal subscale scores (β = .171, t(163) = 2.304, p = .022). Patients with higher cortisol levels also reported higher s100A8/A9 levels and more cancer-related distress. The relationship between cortisol and s100A8/A9 supports a link between the stress response and pro-inflammatory physiological processes known to predict greater metastatic risk in BCa. Stress processes implicated in cancer biology are complex and replication and extension of these initial findings is important.","misc","christiaan"

Methods: We derived analytical expressions to compute post-arrival transmission when no test is performed, and when either an RT-PCR or any of 18 rapid antigen tests is performed at specified times before arrival. We determined the diagnostic sensitivity of the rapid antigen tests by propagating their RT-PCR percent positive agreement onto known RT-PCR diagnostic sensitivity. Results: Depending on the rapid antigen test used, conducting a rapid antigen test immediately before departure reduces post-arrival transmission between 37.4% (95% CrI: 28.2%-40.7%) and 46.7% (95% CrI:40.0%-49.3%), compared to a 31.1% (95% CrI: 26.3%-33.5%) reduction using an RT-PCR 12 h before arrival. Performance of each rapid antigen test differed by diagnostic sensitivity over the course of disease. However, these differences were smaller than those engendered by testing too early. Conclusion: Testing closer to arrival-ideally on the day of arrival-is more effective at reducing post-arrival transmission than testing earlier. Rapid antigen tests perform the best in this application due to their short turnaround time.","misc","christiaan"

A retrospective review of intraoperative reports, imaging, and pertinent medical records was conducted for a patient who underwent posterior spinal surgery with a tiny apical pneumothorax, which subsequently developed into a major pneumothorax. The clinical signs imperative to recognition and prompt treatment are discussed. Our case report demonstrates that the unrecognized disruption of the pleural cavity during posterior spinal surgery caused the exacerbation of the patient's bilateral pneumothoraces. The patient was successfully treated with finger thoracostomy and chest tube insertion. In conclusion, posterior spinal surgery is an invasive procedure with the potential for serious complications such as the exacerbation of a previous non-surgical pneumothorax. A low index of suspicion is imperative due to the potentially lethal nature of pneumothoraces. Vital signs, pulmonary exam findings, portable radiography, and sonography equipment are all invaluable to the accurate diagnosis and early intervention of patients with pneumothoraces.","misc","christiaan"

We sought to evaluate participant engagement, perceived self-efficacy and website usage in a preliminary evaluation of My Kidneys My Health, a patient-facing eHealth tool in Canada. We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study of adults with CKD who were not on kidney replacement therapy and who had access to My Kidneys My Health for 8 weeks. Outcomes included acceptance (measured by the Technology Acceptance Model), self-efficacy (measured by the Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale [CDSES]) and website usage patterns (captured using Google Analytics). We analyzed participant interviews using qualitative content analysis. Twenty-nine participants with CKD completed baseline questionnaires, of whom 22 completed end-of-study questionnaires; data saturation was achieved with 15 telephone interviews. Acceptance was high, with more than 70% of participants agreeing or strongly agreeing that the website was easy to use and useful. Of the 22 who completed end-of-study questionnaires, 18 (82%) indicated they would recommend its use to others and 16 (73%) stated they would use the website in the future. Average scores for website satisfaction and look and feel were 7.7 (standard deviation [SD] 2.0) and 8.2 (SD 2.0) out of 10, respectively. The CDSES indicated that participants gained an increase in CKD information. Interviewed participants reported that the website offered valuable information and interactive tools for patients with early or newly diagnosed CKD, or for those experiencing changes in health status. Popular website pages and interactive features included Food and Diet, What is CKD, My Question List and the Depression Screener. Participants indicated that the My Kidneys My Health website provided accessible content and tools that may improve self-efficacy and support in CKD self-management. Further evaluation of the website's effectiveness in supporting self-management among a larger, more heterogenous population is warranted.","misc","christiaan"

Adult community residents in a metropolitan city in Korea were recruited. They were asked to assess their health and social needs via the CHSNA system, which was integrated into an online community-care platform. Three assessment steps (basic health assessment, needs for activities of daily living, and in-depth health assessment) associated with five ICF components were used to evaluate physical health impairment, difficulties in activities and participation, and environmental problems. The final list of health and social needs was systematically linked to the domains and categories of the ICF. Only data from participants who completed all three assessment steps were included. Wide ranges of impairments and difficulties regarding the daily living activities, physical health, and environmental status of the community were recorded from 190 people who completed assessments of their health and social needs by the CHSNA system. These participants reported various health and social needs for their community life; common needs corresponded to the ICF components of body functions and activities/participation. The ICF may be suitable for determining the health-related problems and needs of the general population. Possible improvements to the present system include providing support for completing all assessment steps and developing an ICF core set for an enhanced understanding of health and social needs.","misc","christiaan"

However, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms have not been fully explored. The purpose of this study was to establish a visual model map of the articles in the field of neuroinflammation-induced MCI over the past 11 years to reveal the research hotspots and predict the future development trends in this field, which will help to promote the research and development for MCI. The neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment were used as search terms, and literature about neuroinflammation-induced MCI published between 2011 and 2021 was collected from the Web of Science. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to create visual model maps, and assess collaboration among different authors, countries, and institutions. Finally, the current research hotspots and future research directions were analyzed by using high-frequency keywords analysis and co-cited reference burst analysis. A total of 226 articles were retrieved. The number of publications in neuroinflammation-induced MCI shows an upward trend. Since 2018, the number of papers published in this field has increased significantly, with an average of more than 100 published each year. The United States had the highest literature production and the number of cited journals in this research area, and the National Institute on Aging was the most productive research institution. Brooks D.J. and Heneka M.T. had the highest number of publications and had the highest frequency of co-citations. The co-cited references revealed the evolution of the research themes, and the current studies are mainly focused on the effects of various metabolites on the control of microglial activation. Cerebrospinal fluid, mouse model, tau, microglial activation, astrocytes, and TREM2 were the current high-frequency and emerging keywords. Research on neuroinflammation-induced MCI is burgeoning, and the close collaboration with different nations and institutions need to be further strengthened. Current research hotspots are focused on the effects of various metabolites on microglia activation. Future studies should focus on how to regulate the phenotypes of microglia and astrocyte to reduce neuroinflammation and treat MCI.","misc","christiaan"
"367",35967188,"Rectal Foreign Bodies: Surgical Management and the Impact of Psychiatric Illness.","Background Entrapped rectal foreign bodies can be a challenge to manage and are being encountered by acute surgical teams with increasing frequency. The aims of our study were to (a) ascertain the population demographics of patients presenting with this problem in our local area of East Kent, (b) see if an association could be drawn between this presentation and proposed risk factors such as a psychiatric illness or socioeconomic deprivation, and (c) to review how foreign bodies are being removed in the East Kent Hospital University Foundation NHS Trust, United Kingdom and to highlight best practice with regards to this in line with the latest guidelines. Methodology Between 2017 and 2021, 32 cases of entrapped rectal foreign bodies were diagnosed and managed at our NHS Trust. Retrospective data taken from the theatre directory and electronic patient records were used to audit patient demographics, co-morbidities, the type of foreign body, and the extraction technique. Results The majority of patients (90%) were male (n = 29). The patients' age ranged from 15 to 95 years, with a median age of 48 years. In total, 12 (37.5%) patients had a medical history of a psychiatric illness. The most common foreign bodies removed were sex toys or vibrators (n = 8) and roll-on deodorant bottles (n = 7). Kent Area B (n = 10) and Kent Area A (n = 9) were the areas with the highest number of cases. Twenty-two (68.8%) patients underwent examination under a general anaesthetic for removal, seven (21.8%) patients had the object manually removed without sedation, and three (9.4%) required a laparotomy with or without bowel resection. Conclusions Cases of an entrapped rectal foreign body in this local region typically involved male patients between 40 and 50 years old. A high proportion of this group had a history of a psychiatric illness supporting an association between this presentation and mental health. We have proposed some explanations for this association including the anal canal nervous system interplay with the brain-gut axis. Lower socioeconomic status and unemployment may also be risk factors for this surgical problem. A trans-anal approach for management is successful in the majority of cases; however, almost 10% of patients required emergency surgical management. We have highlighted best practice guidelines for the investigation and management of the entrapped rectal foreign body as part of our discussion.","misc","christiaan"

Research suggests that these tools may have different predictive performance depending on patient group characteristics. Therefore, we designed this study to identify the factors that make the mortality rates predicted by the tools different. This retrospective study included patients (<18 years) who were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit from July 2017 to May 2019. After defining the predicted mortality of PIM 3 minus the predicted mortality rate of PELOD-2 as difference in mortality prediction, the clinical characteristics significantly related to this were analyzed using multivariable regression analysis. Predictive performance was analyzed through the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). In total, 945 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 3.0 [0.0-8.0] years; girls, 44.7%) were analyzed. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test revealed AUROCs of 0.889 (χ2=10.187, P=0.313) and 0.731 (χ2=6.220, P=0.183) of PIM 3 and PELOD-2, respectively. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that oxygen saturation, partial pressure of CO2, base excess, platelet counts, and blood urea nitrogen levels were significant factors. Patient condition-related factors such as cardiac bypass surgery, seizures, cardiomyopathy or myocarditis, necrotizing enterocolitis, cardiac arrest, leukemia or lymphoma after the first induction, bone marrow transplantation, and liver failure were significantly related (P<0.001). Both tools predicted observed mortality well; however, caution is needed in interpretation as they may show different prediction results in relation to specific clinical characteristics.","misc","christiaan"

On May 24, 2019, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage. Sexual and gender minority older adults are becoming more visible in Taiwanese society. However, healthcare providers' behaviour and intention to offer culturally competent care to sexual and gender minority older adults and factors affecting their behaviour and intention in Asian culture remain unclear. This study determined factors associated with healthcare providers' behaviour and intention to offer culturally competent care to Taiwanese sexual and gender minority older adults and identified related training requirements. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. This study recruited participants from 14 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organisations; long-term care facilities; and community healthcare centres. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of XXX (Ref. 201811049RIND). A total of 25 providers were interviewed: 12 nurses, 10 social workers, and 3 staff members from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organisations. Semistructured interviews were conducted between May 2019 and September 2019. Interview data were analysed using the socio-ecological model and the constant comparative technique. Factors associated with the providers' behaviour and intention to offer culturally competent care to sexual and gender minority older adults were categorised by the socio-ecological model level: 1) intrapersonal factors, namely providers' attitudes towards sexual and gender minority older adults, knowledge regarding sexual and gender minority populations, and experiences of providing care for sexual and gender minority older adults; 2) interpersonal factors, namely providers' concerns regarding interactions among staff, sexual and gender minority older adults, nonsexual and gender minority residents, and nonsexual and gender minority residents' families; 3) community factors, namely resources, training courses, and support from managers and organisations; and 4) societal factors, namely social environment and policies. This study identified multilevel factors associated with the providers' cultural competence in caring for sexual and gender minority older adults in Taiwan. These factors may lead to disparities in quality of life and health for sexual and gender minority older adults. Recommendations to address multilevel barriers to reduce health disparities and improving quality of life in sexual and gender minority older adults have been provided.","misc","christiaan"

It depends on the environmental factors, vector availability, host-parasite interactions and above all geographical boundaries. Leishmaniasis being an immunosuppressive disease empowers the invading opportunistic infections to invade and successfully colonize. A variety of infections coexist with leishmaniasis like HIV, leprosy, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis etc. With the different pathology and immune status, co-infection in most cases leads to disease severity and increased mortality.Inevitably, co-infection increases the complexity and poses a threat in the cure and control programmes. This is the first review which highlights the existing co-infections of leishmaniasis with other infectious diseases. The review also focuses on the immunology of co-infections together, diagnosis and the treatment options available for treating such cases. With the changing environment and the overlapping endemic areas of leishmaniasis with other diseases, it becomes difficult to treat a disease without accurate diagnosis. Thus, the review insists on the need for more research on development of newer and differential diagnostic methods for co-infected individuals with theoverlapping symptoms.","misc","christiaan"

However, some wetland plants including rice can germinate under submerged conditions. It has long been hypothesized that the first elongating shoot tissue, the coleoptile, acts as a snorkel to acquire atmospheric oxygen (O2) to initiate the first leaf elongation and seminal root emergence. Here, we obtained direct evidence for this hypothesis by visualizing the spatiotemporal O2 dynamics during submerged germination in rice using a planar O2 optode system. In parallel with the O2 imaging, we tracked the anatomical development of shoot and root tissues in real-time using an automated flatbed scanner. Three hours after the coleoptile tip reached the water surface, O2 levels around the embryo transiently increased. At this time, the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an enzyme critical for anaerobic metabolism, was significantly reduced, and the coleorhiza covering the seminal roots in the embryo was broken. Approximately 10 h after the transient burst in O2, seminal roots emerged. A transient O2 burst around the embryo was shown to be essential for seminal root emergence during submerged rice germination. The parallel application of a planar O2 optode system and automated scanning system can be a powerful tool for examining how environmental conditions affect germination in rice and other plants.","misc","christiaan"
"505",35966994,"Electrical stimulation mapping in the medial prefrontal cortex induced auditory hallucinations of episodic memory: A case report.","It has been well documented that the auditory system in the superior temporal cortex is responsible for processing basic auditory sound features, such as sound frequency and intensity, while the prefrontal cortex is involved in higher-order auditory functions, such as language processing and auditory episodic memory. The temporal auditory cortex has vast forward anatomical projections to the prefrontal auditory cortex, connecting with the lateral, medial, and orbital parts of the prefrontal cortex. The connections between the auditory cortex and the prefrontal cortex thus help in localizing, recognizing, and comprehending external auditory inputs. In addition, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is believed to be a core region of episodic memory retrieval and is one of the most important regions in the default mode network (DMN). However, previous neural evidence with regard to the comparison between basic auditory processing and auditory episodic memory retrieval mainly comes from fMRI studies. The specific neural networks and the corresponding critical frequency bands of neuronal oscillations underlying the two auditory functions remain unclear. In the present study, we reported results of direct cortical stimulations during stereo-electro-encephalography (SEEG) recording in a patient with drug-resistant epilepsy. Electrodes covered the superior temporal gyrus, the operculum and the insula cortex of bilateral hemispheres, the prefrontal cortex, the parietal lobe, the anterior and middle cingulate cortex, and the amygdala of the left hemisphere. Two types of auditory hallucinations were evoked with direct cortical stimulations, which were consistent with the habitual seizures. The noise hallucinations, i.e., I could hear buzzing noises in my head, were evoked with the stimulation of the superior temporal gyrus. The episodic memory hallucinations I could hear a young woman who was dressed in a red skirt saying: What is the matter with you?, were evoked with the stimulation of MPFC. The patient described how she had met this young woman when she was young and that the woman said the same sentence to her. Furthermore, by analyzing the high gamma power (HGP) induced by direct electrical stimulation, two dissociable neural networks underlying the two types of auditory hallucinations were localized. Taken together, the present results confirm the hierarchical processing of auditory information by showing the different involvements of the primary auditory cortex vs. the prefrontal cortex in the two types of auditory hallucinations.","misc","christiaan"
"1485",35979253,"Adenoma Recurrence after Endoscopic Piecemeal Mucosal Resection of Colorectal Flat Lesions: Applicability of the Sydney EMR Recurrence Tool in a Non-Tertiary Centre.","Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is the treatment of choice for non-invasive colorectal flat lesions. When endoscopic piecemeal mucosal resection (EPMR) is performed, endoscopic surveillance is necessary due to the risk of recurrence. The Sydney EMR Recurrence Tool (SERT) is a 0-4 scale that classifies lesions according to size, occurrence of intraprocedural bleeding (IPB) and presence of high-grade dysplasia (HGD). Our goal is to evaluate the applicability of SERT in predicting adenoma recurrence (AR) after EPMR. This is a retrospective single-centre study with inclusion of lateral spreading lesions ≥20 mm, consecutively resected by EPMR from March 2010 to February 2018, with at least 1 endoscopic re-evaluation. A total of 181 lesions were included, corresponding to 174 patients with a mean age of 68 years and male gender predominance (61%; n = 106). The most frequent location was the ascending colon (34%; n = 62). Lesions were assessed according to Paris Classification (PC): 0-IIa: 39% (n = 71); 0-IIb: 24% (n = 43); 0-IIa + Is: 23% (n = 42); 0-IIa + IIb: 6% (n = 11); 0-IIa + IIc: 2% (n = 3). The mean size of the lesions was 33 ± 11 mm, with 25 (14%) being ≥40 mm. IPB occurred in 9 cases (5%), and 44 lesions (24%) displayed HGD. Sixty-six lesions (36.5%) were classified as SMSA (size, morphology, site, and access score) level 4. Adjunctive therapy with argon plasma coagulation (APC) was used in 37% (n = 67) of cases. The 6-month AR rate was 16% (n = 29). According to SERT groups, the AR rate was: SERT 0: 12% (14/120); SERT 1: 17% (6/35); SERT 2: 25% (3/12); SERT 3: 30% (3/10); SERT 4: 75% (3/4). Two of the three SERT variables (size ≥40 mm and IPB) were associated with recurrence at 6 months (p < 0.05). HGD and the remaining tested variables (age, gender, localization, accessibility, PC, use of APC/biopsy forceps and occurrence of delayed bleeding) were not associated with AR. SERT 0 lesions showed an inferior risk of 6-month AR (adjusted OR = 2.62; p = 0.035), with a negative predictive value of 88%. SMSA correlated with SERT (p < 0.001) and SMSA level 4 was associated with 6-month AR (p = 0.007). Lesions classified both as SERT 0 and SMSA level <4 had the lowest 6-month recurrence rate (9.2%). The 24-month recurrence rate was 23% (n = 41). When applying the Kaplan-Meier method, cumulative recurrence was significantly lower in SERT 0 lesions (p = 0.006, log-rank test). Resection of flat colorectal lesions by EPMR has a considerable risk of recurrence, mostly in SERT 1-4 lesions. SERT 0 lesions, especially with SMSA level <4, show a lower risk of recurrent adenoma, which might allow longer intervals to first endoscopic surveillance in the future. A mucosectomia endoscópica é a terapêutica de eleição nas lesões colorretais planas não invasivas e, quando fragmentada, obriga a vigilância endoscópica, dado o risco de recorrência.

Pretende-se avaliar a aplicabilidade do SERT na predição de adenoma recorrente (AR) após mucosectomia fragmentada. Estudo retrospetivo unicêntrico com inclusão de todas as lesões planas ≥20 mm excisadas por mucosectomia fragmentada, entre Março/2010 e Fevereiro/2018, com pelo menos uma vigilância endoscópica. Incluídas 181 lesões, correspondentes a 174 doentes com idade média de 68 anos e predomínio do sexo masculino (61%; n = 106). A localização mais frequente foi o cólon ascendente (34%; n = 62). As lesões foram avaliadas segundo a classificação de Paris (CP): 0-IIa: 39% (n = 71); 0-IIb: 24% (n = 43); 0-IIa + Is: 23% (n = 42); 0-IIa + IIb: 6% (n = 11); 0-IIa + IIc: 2% (n = 3). O tamanho médio foi 33 ± 11 mm, tendo 25 (14%) dimensões ≥40 mm. Verificou-se HI em 9 casos (5%) e DAG em 44 (24%). O nível SMSA (size, morphology, site, and access score) foi 4 em 66 lesões (36.5%). Realizou-se terapêutica com árgon plasma (APC) em 37% (n = 67) dos casos.A taxa de AR aos 6 meses foi: SERT 0: 12% (14/120); SERT 1: 17% (6/35); SERT 2: 25% (3/12); SERT 3: 30% (3/10); SERT 4: 75% (3/4); global: 16% (29/181). O AR aos 6 meses associou-se à dimensão ≥40 mm e à HI (p < 0.05). A DAG não mostrou relação com a recorrência, assim como a idade, sexo, localização, acessibilidade, CP, terapêutica adju-adjuvante (APC/pinça de biópsias) e ocorrência de hemorragia tardia. As lesões SERT 0 apresentaram menor risco de AR aos 6 meses (OR ajustado = 2.62; p = 0.035), com um valor preditivo negativo de 88%. O SMSA correlacionou-se com o SERT (p < 0.001), estando o nível SMSA 4 associado à recorrência aos 6 meses (p = 0.007). As lesões classificadas como SERT 0 e nível SMSA <4 apresentaram a menor taxa de AR (9.2%). A taxa de recorrência aos 24 meses foi 23% (n = 41). Aplicando o método de Kaplan Meier, a recorrência cumulativa foi menor nas lesões SERT 0 (p = 0.006, teste log-rank). A excisão de lesões planas por mucosectomia fragmentada apresenta uma taxa de recorrência considerável, sobretudo em lesões SERT 1–4. As lesões SERT 0, particularmente se nível SMSA <4, apresentam menor risco de recidiva, o que poderá possibilitar um prolongamento do intervalo até à primeira vigilância endoscópica.","misc","christiaan"

Accumulating evidence reported the orchestrating role of ER stress in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress, but the detailed mechanism was unclear. Here, we identified ectopic expression of TMTC3 in cells undergoing ER stress and verified the association with EMT markers through the cellular model of ER stress and database analysis. TMTC3 was abnormally highly expressed in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and regulated by TP63, an SCCs-specific transcription factor. Biological function experiments indicated that TMTC3 promoted a malignant phenotype in vitro, and accelerated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. RNA-seq analyses and further experiments revealed that TMTC3 promoted the expression of EMT markers via interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI, FAM3C). Further studies on the mechanism showed that TMTC3 disrupted the interaction between PERK and GRP78 to activate the PERK pathway and promote the nuclear translocation of ATF4, which increased the transcriptional activity of ILEI. These findings indicated that TMTC3 activates GRP78/PERK signaling pathway during ER stress-induced EMT, which might serve as a potential therapeutic target in SCCs.","misc","christiaan"

Although an endoscopic resection of malignant nasal tumor now becomes a treatment of choice when the surgical margin can be secured, it is still controversial. We report three cases of NMM that was successfully removed en bloc with clear margins by endoscopic surgery with temporal transseptal access. Cases of a 78-year-old woman, an 83-year-old man, and an 81-year-old man with NMM arising from the inferior turbinate who underwent endoscopic resection of the tumor are discussed in detail. We made temporal transseptal access using septal mucosal flaps. We moved the nasal cavity-occupying tumor to the contralateral side to create a working space to perform endoscopic en bloc resections. This technique is simple yet effective and less invasive than open craniofacial resections for removing malignancies arising from the inferior turbinate.","misc","christiaan"

Two-dimensional materials such as graphene can be scrolled into one-dimensional fibers via simple sonication. Unfortunately, scrolling MXene nanosheets into fibers is quite challenging, especially Ti3C2T x composed of three layers of titanium atoms and two layers of carbon atoms. Herein, we report a new method to fabricate MXene fibers via ascorbic acid (AA) induced scrolling of Ti3C2T x nanosheets. An unusual AA-Ti3C2T x interaction is discovered in that intercalated AA molecules bind to and interact with the Ti3C2T x surface in the form of a hydrogen bonding-bonded assembly instead of as individual molecules, and a sheet-scrolling mechanism is proposed based on this interaction. The as-obtained MXene fibers exhibit a compact cross-section, and the diameter can be tailored from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers through tuning the MXene/AA ratio. Moreover, the storage modulus of the MXene-fiber sponge attains its maximum value of ∼1 MPa when a unique morphology comprising both fibers and not-yet-scrolled sheets is presented. This work offers a new strategy of fiber-shaping MXenes for applications in structural composites and flexible electronics.","misc","christiaan"

Firstly, a sufficient condition is given to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point of the proposed neural networks by employing the contraction mapping theorem. Secondly, we discuss the issue of the exponential stability in mean-square of the equilibrium point by a non-fragilely delayed output coupling feedback which involves stochastically occurring gain oscillations. The designed feedback input can be tolerant of limited stochastic fluctuations of control gains and be robust against potential errors caused by factors like round-off. By combining methods of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and free-weighting matrix, a delay-dependent output coupling feedback with stochastically occurring uncertainties is designed and linear-matrix-inequalities(LMIs)-based sufficient conditions for the exponential stabilization in mean square are derived. Finally, three numerical examples are presented to illustrate the feasibility of theoretical results with a benchmark real-world problem.","misc","christiaan"

While most NP models were developed to assess individual foods, the Ajinomoto Group Nutrient Profiling System (ANPS) was developed to assess the overall nutritional value of cooked dishes that are culturally specific to Japan. Based on the national dietary recommendations and nutritional surveys, target values were created for 13 dish categories, while considering the combinations of meal units. For the ANPS, the four evaluating elements were protein and vegetables, which should be encouraged, and sodium and saturated fatty acids, which should be limited. The ANPS algorithm for dishes was the sum of the scores of individual elements, with a maximum of 10 points per serving. The sum of scores was then multiplied by 2.5 to convert to the 100-point scale. Convergent validity was tested using the nutrient-rich food index (NRF) score of 6.3. In total, 1,089 popular Japanese dishes were evaluated using the ANPS, and the median score of ANPS was 70.0 points (interquartile range, 55-78.8), and the average score was 67.7 (standard deviation, 16.5) points. Since salt intake is a major health risk in Japan, this tool was designed to evaluate sodium content with high sensitivity, and low-salt dishes significantly improved sodium and ANPS scores compared with regular dishes. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the total score of NRF 6.3 and ANPS in 1,089 dishes was r = 0.452 (p < 0.0001). This newly developed ANPS could be used to evaluate culture-specific cooked dishes per serving size. It can determine the nutritional values of dishes, with a high sensitivity to sodium content, a major Japanese nutritional issue. Further research is needed to determine the accuracy and usefulness of the ANPS as a system that would lead to changes in eating behavior nationwide.","misc","christiaan"

In this study, CD3+T lymphocytes from ITP patients were screened for differentially expressed genes. The expression of miR-21 and miR-155 in T lymphocytes of ITP patients were investigated. The downstream target genes of miR-21 and miR-155 were also searched for the correlation between differentially expressed genes of ITP. Differential gene screening was performed using the GSE43177 data set in the GEO database, and the expression of miR-21 and miR-155 in T lymphocytes of ITP patients was verified by qPCR. The interaction network of core downstream target genes and ITP differentially expressed genes of miR-21 and miR-155 were constructed with the STRING database, and the associated factors were verified by qPCR. In ITP patients, the expression of CD8+T lymphocytes increased, the expression of CD4+T lymphocytes decreased, and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+T cells decreased. Fourteen genes were differentially expressed in CD3+T lymphocytes, all of which were upregulated, and the expression of S100A8 was increased in ITP patients. The expression of miR-21-5p and miR-155-5p increased in CD3+T lymphocytes of initial ITP patients. The core down-stream target gene VCL of miR-21 was associated with the differentially expressed genes such as LTF, LCN2, and DEFA4 in the interaction network. VCL expression was decreased and LTF expression was increased in ITP patients. S100A8 plays an important role in the regulation of CD3+T lymphocytes in ITP patients. MiR-21-5p regulates the differentially expressed gene LTF by inhibiting the core downstream target gene VCL and participates in the immune mechanism of T lymphocytes in ITP patients. MiR-155-5p is also involved in the immunoregulatory mechanism of T lymphocytes in ITP patients.","misc","christiaan"

A retrospective analysis of chest lymph nodes on computed tomography (CT) examinations, including CE and non-contrast-enhanced (non-CE) phase, was performed on 40 patients with proven diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Phases were separated, anonymized, and randomized. The assessment was performed by 5 observers: 2 general radiologists, 2 residents, and a senior chest CT expert. There were no significant differences between radiologists and residents, apart from the determination of the 4R node short diameter on CE images. Agreement between the reference observer and both residents and specialists was equally high, without any significant difference in the assessment all chest nodes and hilar nodes, and between non-CE and CE images. There was a significant difference between all observers in the determination of the largest 4R node short diameter on non-CE images, but not on CE images. The number of affected node levels was found to be significantly higher when evaluated on CE images than on non-CE images. Compared to CE images, non-CE computed tomography has sensitivity of 0.94-1.00 and specificity of 0.98-1.00, depending on the observer.

The structure of the ANN model was designed considering various input parameters, namely patient weight, patient size, body mass index, mean CTDI volume, scanning length, kVp, mAs, exposure time per rotation, and pitch factor. The aforementioned examination details of 551 abdominal CT scans were used as retrospective data. Different types of learning algorithms such as Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian and Scaled-Conjugate Gradient were checked in terms of the accuracy of the training data. The R-value representing the correlation coefficient for the real system and system output is given as 0.925, 0.785, and 0.854 for the Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian, and Scaled-Conjugate Gradient algorithms, respectively. The findings showed that the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm comprehensively detects DLP values for abdominal CT examinations. It can be a helpful approach to simplify CT quality assurance. It can be concluded that outcomes of this novel artificial intelligence method can be used for high accuracy DLP estimations before the abdominal CT examinations, where the radiation-related risk factors are high or risk evaluation of multiple CT scans is needed for patients in terms of ALARA. Likewise, it can be concluded that artificial learning methods are powerful tools and can be used for different types of radiation-related risk assessments for quality assurance in diagnostic radiology.","misc","christiaan"

However, current methods for their construction still suffer from a number of shortcomings. For instance, using a single modification technology to modulate the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) in integer increments while maintaining homogeneity and stability remains exceptionally challenging. Herein, we report a novel method for the generation of antibody conjugates with modular cargo loading from native antibodies. Our approach relies on a new class of disulfide rebridging linkers, which can react with eight cysteine residues, thereby effecting all-in-one bridging of all four interchain disulfides in an IgG1 antibody with a single linker molecule. Modification of the antibody with the linker in a 1 : 1 ratio enabled the modulation of cargo loading in a quick and selective manner through derivatization of the linker with varying numbers of payload attachment handles to allow for attachment of either 1, 2, 3 or 4 payloads (fluorescent dyes or cytotoxins). Assessment of the biological activity of these conjugates demonstrated their exceptional stability in human plasma and utility for cell-selective cytotoxin delivery or imaging/diagnostic applications.","misc","christiaan"

"1644",35977785,"The Mismatch between Range and Niche Limits due to Source-Sink Dynamics Can Be Greater than Species Mean Dispersal Distance.","AbstractSpecies distribution models assume that at broad spatial scales, environmental conditions determine species ranges and, as such, source-sink dynamics can be ignored. A rationale behind this assumption is that source-sink dynamics manifest at length scales comparable to species mean dispersal distance, which is much smaller than length scales of species distribution and variation in climate. Using a two-dimensional reaction-diffusion model, we show that species can use sink habitats near the niche limit as stepping-stones to occupy sink habitats much further than the mean dispersal distance, thereby extending the distribution far beyond the environmental niche limit. This mismatch between range and niche limits is mediated by the shape (local curvature) of the niche limit. These curvature effects may be significant for a highly dispersive species with low per capita growth rate sensitivity to changes in the environment. These findings underscore the potential importance of stepping-stone dispersal in determining range limits.","misc","christiaan"

We found that the plasmid sequence and restriction proteins affected horizontal gene transfer, and confirmed the anti-restriction and anti-methylation activities of ArdA and KlcA during transformation and transduction. Among the three anti-restriction proteins, ArdA shows stronger anti-restriction and anti-methylation effects, and KlcAHS was weaker. KlcA shows anti-methylation only during transformation. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the clinical dissemination of K. pneumoniae and other clinically resistant strains from the perspective of restrictive and anti-restrictive systems will provide basic theoretical support for the prevention and control of multidrug-resistant bacteria, and new strategies for delaying or even controlling the clinical dissemination of resistant strains in the future.","misc","christiaan"

However, it has also been shown that metaphor processing is also constrained by the linguistic context but, to our knowledge, there is no comparable work in the domain of metonymy. As an initial attempt to fill this gap, the present study uses eye-tracking experimentation to explore this aspect of Chinese metonymy processing. It complements previous work on how the length of preceding linguistic context influences metonymic processing by focusing on: (1) the contextual information of both the preceding target words; (2) the immediate spillover after the target words; and (3) whether the logical relationship between the preceding contextual information and the target word is strong or weak (a 2 × 2 between-subject experiment with target words of literal/metonymy and logic of strong/weak). Results show that readers take longer to arrive at a literal interpretation than at a metonymic one when the preceding information is in a weak logic relationship with target words, although this disparity can disappear when the logic is strong. Another finding is that both the preceding and the spillover contextual information contribute to metonymy processing when the spillover information does more to the metonymy than it does to the literal meaning. This study further complements cognitive and pragmatic approaches to metonymy, which are centered on its conceptual nature and its role in interpretation, by drawing attention to how the components of sentences contribute to the metonymic processing of target words. Based on an experiment, a contextual model of Chinese metonymy processing is proposed.","misc","christiaan"

Owing to strong selective pressure, S. exigua showed increased resistance to Lufenuron (LUF). Consequently, RNA interference (RNAi)-based insecticides had more benefits than chemical insecticides. Therefore, to enhance the insecticidal activity of LUF to S. exigua, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate the impact of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) on S. exigua larval susceptibility to LUF. First, the transcriptome of S. exigua was sequenced following the treatment with LUF. By comparing the upregulated and downregulated GO enrichment, chitin binding and chitin metabolic processes were the significantly enriched pathways. According to transcriptome sequencing, 8 genes associated with chitin biosynthesis, 8 chitin degradation genes, and 17 cuticle protein genes were obtained. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP) and Chitin synthase A (CHSA) showed significantly downregulated expression after treatment with different sublethal doses of LUF. Downregulation of UAP increased mortality from 31.97% to 47.91% when the larvae were exposed to LUF. A significant increase in the mortality of S. exigua from 30.63% to 50.19% was observed following LUF administration after dsCHSA. In addition, the expression analysis of genes associated with chitin biosynthesis was significantly changed after LUF treatment, dsRNAs-RNAi, and their combination (LUF-dsRNAs). Significant differences were observed in the chitin content between the control group at 72 h after treatments. Results of the present study can help further elucidate the understanding of the combined effects of RNAi and LUF on S. exigua.

In Ethiopia, timely vaccination is stated as key to the prevention of unnecessary childhood mortality from measles, pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, and other VPDs. However, Ethiopia ranked fifth among the ten countries with the most unprotected children. Furthermore, previous vaccine timeliness studies produced widely disparate results. As a result, it was suggested that more research be conducted to investigate the potential factors behind the high proportion of untimely vaccination. Therefore, this study was intended to explore the association between different factors and the proportion of vaccination timeliness administered under the Expanded Program on Immunization in Debre Libanos district, Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed from 1 May to 30 May 2021 among children aged 12 to 23 months with their mother/caregiver, who had started vaccination and had vaccination cards in the Debre Libanos. Simple random sampling techniques and pretested semi-structured questionnaires were used for data collection. At last, a multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the vaccination timeliness. In this study, 413 children aged 12 to 23 months were interviewed with their mother/caregiver. Overall, 33.7% [95% CI (29.1-38.3)] of children received their vaccines timely.

Viral loads (VLs) and the plasma volume of blood components, as well as an HEV-RNA dose of 3.85 log IU as the infectious threshold and an assay with a 95% limit of detection (LOD) at 17 IU/mL, were used to assess the proportion of: (i) HEV-RNA-positive BDs that would remain undetected; and (ii) blood components associated with these undetected BDs with an HEV-RNA dose >3.85 log IU, considering 4 NAT options (Individual testing [ID], MP-6, MP-12, and MP-24). Of the 510,118 BDs collected during the study period, 510 (0.10%) were HEV-RNA-positive. Based on measurable VLs available in 388 cases, 1%, 15.2%, 21.8%, and 32.6% of BDs would theoretically pass undetected due to a VL below the LOD of ID, MP-6, MP-12, and MP-24 testing, respectively. All BDs associated with a potentially infectious blood component would be detected with ID-NAT while 13% of them would be undetected with MP-6, 19.6% with MP-12, and 30.4% with MP-24 depending on the plasma volume. No red blood cell (RBC) components with an HEV-RNA dose >3.85 log IU would enter the blood supply, regardless of the NAT strategy used. A highly sensitive ID-NAT would ensure maximum safety. However, an MP-based strategy can be considered given that: (i) the risk of transmission is closely related to the plasma volume of blood components; (ii) RBC are the most commonly transfused components and have a low plasma content; and (iii) HEV-RNA doses transmitting infection exceed 4 log IU. To minimise the potential risk associated with apheresis platelet components and fresh frozen plasma, less than 12 donations should be pooled using an NAT assay with a LOD of approximately 20 IU/mL.","misc","christiaan"

Six leachates characterised by similar COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) but different BOD5/COD (Biochemical Oxygen demand/COD) and TOC/COD (Total Organic Carbon/COD) ratios were tested. By combining these ratios, the BOD5/TOC ratio was introduced to take into account the effect of both leachate properties (biodegradability and oxidation degree). Process treatment performance was significantly influenced by the quality of organic substances. Higher BOD5/TOC values (higher biodegradability and lower oxidation degree) resulted in a greater and faster larvae growth, with final wet weight of between 49.2 and 91.9mg/larva; lower mortality between 5 and 32%; higher prepupation percentages ranging from 4 to 21% and higher specific substrate consumption rate with values varying from 0.051 to 0.063 mgTOC/mg larva/d, up to 3-fold higher than values obtained using conventional activated sludge based on COD consumption.

We assessed the complementarity of four different technologies: single-cell RNA sequencing and Spatial transcriptomic (measuring over >20,000 genes), RNA In Situ Hybridization (RNAscope, measuring 4-12 genes) and Opal Polaris multiplex protein staining (4-9 proteins). To utilize the multimodal data, we implemented existing methods and also developed STRISH (Spatial TRanscriptomic In Situ Hybridization), a computational method that can automatically scan across the whole tissue section for local expression of gene (e.g. RNAscope data) and/or protein markers (e.g. Polaris data) to recapitulate an interaction landscape across the whole tissue. We evaluated the approach to discover and validate cell-cell interaction in situ through in-depth analysis of two types of cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which account for over 70% of cancer cases. We showed that inference of cell-cell interactions using scRNA-seq data can misdetect or detect false positive interactions. Spatial transcriptomics still suffers from misdetecting lowly expressed ligand-receptor interactions, but reduces false discovery. RNAscope and Polaris are sensitive methods for defining the location of potential ligand receptor interactions, and the STRISH program can determine the probability that local gene co-expression reflects true cell-cell interaction. We expect that the approach described here will be widely applied to discover and validate ligand receptor interaction in different types of solid cancer tumors.","misc","christiaan"
"1745",35968143,"The primary function of Six5 of Fusarium oxysporum is to facilitate Avr2 activity by together manipulating the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata.","Pathogens produce effector proteins to manipulate their hosts. While most effectors act autonomously, some fungal effectors act in pairs and rely on each other for function. During the colonization of the plant vasculature, the root-infecting fungus Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) produces 14 so-called Secreted in Xylem (SIX) effectors. Two of these effector genes, Avr2 (Six3) and Six5, form a gene pair on the pathogenicity chromosome of the tomato-infecting Fo strain. Avr2 has been shown to suppress plant defense responses and is required for full pathogenicity. Although Six5 and Avr2 together manipulate the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata to facilitate cell-to-cell movement of Avr2, it is unclear whether Six5 has additional functions as well. To investigate the role of Six5, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing Six5. Notably, increased susceptibility during the early stages of infection was observed in these Six5 lines, but only to Fo strains expressing Avr2 and not to wild-type Arabidopsis-infecting Fo strains lacking this effector gene. Furthermore, neither PAMP-triggered defense responses, such as ROS accumulation and callose deposition upon treatment with Flg22, necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like protein (NLP), or chitosan, nor susceptibility to other plant pathogens, such as the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae or the fungus Verticilium dahlia, were affected by Six5 expression. Further investigation of the ability of the Avr2/Six5 effector pair to manipulate plasmodesmata (PD) revealed that it not only permits cell-to-cell movement of Avr2, but also facilitates the movement of two additional effectors, Six6 and Six8. Moreover, although Avr2/Six5 expands the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata (i.e., gating) to permit the movement of a 2xFP fusion protein (53 kDa), a larger variant, 3xFP protein (80 kDa), did not move to the neighboring cells. The PD manipulation mechanism employed by Avr2/Six5 did not involve alteration of callose homeostasis in these structures. In conclusion, the primary function of Six5 appears to function together with Avr2 to increase the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata by an unknown mechanism to facilitate cell-to-cell movement of Fo effectors.","misc","christiaan"

However, in practice, titanium implants may fail to integrate or develop an implant-centered infection. Because of its excellent mechanical properties, bone integrability, biocompatibility, antibacterial properties, and so on, graphene oxide is increasingly being used in the preparation of composite biomaterials. The percutaneous titanium implants are used as the research object in this project. To solve the integration of implant and tissue, a graphene oxide/gelatin (GO/gel) composite coating was used to optimize the implant surface. Bacterial and cell experiments were used to investigate the antimicrobial activity, biocompatibility, and regulation of macrophage polarization of GO/gel-modified titanium. According to our findings, GO/gel-modified titanium has a good bacteriostatic effect against Staphylococcus aureus. On the modified surface, L929 cells proliferated well and showed no cytotoxicity. Simultaneously, the GO/gel-modified titanium surface could inhibit macrophage adhesion and spread in the early stage of culture and showed a more obvious inflammatory decline in the late stage of culture. These findings implied that GO/gel-modified titanium is advantageous for resistant bacteria and tissue remolding.","misc","christiaan"

The way that musical intervals are used in melodies relative to the tonal center of a key can strongly affect the emotion conveyed by the melody. The present study examines musical interval identification in people with no known hearing loss and in cochlear implant users. Pitch resolution varies widely among cochlear implant users with average resolution an order of magnitude worse than in normal hearing. The present study considers the effect of training on musical interval identification and tests for correlations between low-level psychophysics and higher-level musical abilities. The overarching hypothesis is that cochlear implant users are limited in their ability to identify musical intervals both by low-level access to frequency cues for pitch as well as higher-level mapping of the novel encoding of pitch that implants provide. Participants completed a 2-week, online interval identification training. The benchmark tests considered before and after interval identification training were pure tone detection thresholds, pure tone frequency discrimination, fundamental frequency discrimination, tonal and rhythm comparisons, and interval identification. The results indicate strong correlations between measures of pitch resolution with interval identification; however, only a small effect of training on interval identification was observed for the cochlear implant users. Discussion focuses on improving access to pitch cues for cochlear implant users and on improving auditory training for musical intervals.","misc","christiaan"

To evaluate the Humasis COVID-19 Ag Test (Humasis Co., Ltd., Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea) in the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This retrospective study was carried out at the Croatian Institute of Public Health and included patients with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 lasting no longer than 5 d prior to testing, whose nasopharyngeal swabs were primarily tested with RAT. Negative RAT samples underwent confirmatory real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Diagnostic efficacy was determined compared to RT-PCR. The patients were divided into three age groups (< 18, 19-65, > 65 years). Statistical analysis was performed with the significance level set at P < 0.05. In total, 2490 symptomatic patients were tested; 953 samples were positive on RAT, and 1537 were negative. All negative RAT samples were subjected to RT-PCR; 266 samples were positive and marked as false-negative results on RAT. The calculated negative predictive value as a measure of RAT efficacy was 82.69%. The χ 2 test and Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference in the proportion of false negatives (P < 0.001) and RT-PCR cycle (Ct) values for false-negative RATs (P = 0.012) among the age groups. The young age group was significantly less likely to be false negative, whereas the false negatives from the elderly group experienced significantly lower Ct values than the other two age groups. Evaluated RAT demonstrated satisfactory performance with more reliable results in younger patients. Humasis COVID-19 Ag RAT is potentially a valuable tool in areas where access to molecular methods is limited; however, RT-PCR remains a gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection.","misc","christiaan"

Moreover, BA in blood have been identified by metabolite screening approaches as biomarkers that are associated with various diseases and even with a human longevity phenotype. With the growing interest in the microbiota contribution to the health-disease trajectory, BA that undergo deconjugation and other modifications by bacteria in the large intestine have become a prime target as a microbiome diversity modifier. We here profiled BA by a quantitative and a semiquantitative approach in 15 healthy and phenotypically very similar young individuals for over a 36-h fasting period, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and an oral lipid tolerance test (OLTT). We demonstrate a remarkable heterogeneity of the responses and describe the different dynamics of the plasma changes that likely originate from different routes by which BA enters the peripheral blood, and that may represent a direct secretion from the liver into the blood and a route that reaches the blood as a spill-over after passing from the gallbladder through the intestine and the portal system. We discuss the finding that an individual transport process involved in the passage of BA could be a critical determinant in the kinetics of plasma appearance and the overall phenotypic variability found.","misc","christiaan"

This article reveals the intrinsic equilibrium of a particular type of samaras in terms of measurable aerodynamic and geometric parameters. To this end, we conducted a series of in situ measurements for the rate of vertical descent (exclusive of crosswind) of an autorotating samara in a natural range of samara sizes and masses. We then extended the range of size and mass by introducing artificial samaras, with discrete mass elements purposely designed to approximate the asymmetrical and nonuniform distribution of mass found with natural samaras. Based on the widened range, a fundamental nondimensional correlation of dynamic pressure and disc loading was generalized, where all stable autorotation descent profiles collapse to a single descent characteristic curve, irrespective of the size and mass of the natural and artificial samara's specimens. Results reveal that for stably autorotating (both natural and artificial) samaras, their terminal descent velocity (expressed as dynamic pressure) and disc loading attained equilibrium at a value that is inversely proportional to the coefficient of lift.","misc","christiaan"

Using sodium silicate (SS) as the primary material, the microcracks were grouted by a two-step approach. The low-initial-viscosity (5 mPa s) SS was first saturated within the microcracks followed by CO2 injection at 2 MPa. Through CO2 dissolution, silica gel was developed and tolerated a hydraulic pressure of up to 5.5 MPa. The effects of aquifer ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3 -, and SO4 2-) were equally evaluated at harsh conditions, and it was found that the strength of the silica gel was reduced, which was caused by salting out, low CO2 solubility, and precipitation. As a result, the hydraulic pressure was reduced to as low as 3 MPa. After 210 days, 16% of the silica gels (without ion inclusion) were reversible to the liquid phase, where a similar effect was found in the cases of Na+ and Mg2+ ions. The degradation increased with more Ca2+ ions (up to 55%) and decreased with more HCO3 - and SO4 2- ions. Microcracks grouted with CCG extended the CO2 utilization in grouting application. Combined with the effect of dissolved ions, the proposed approach is feasible in the field implementation for underground engineering under water bodies.","misc","christiaan"

The present study aimed to investigate the association between antimicrobial resistance and the ability to form biofilm among E. anophelis isolated from hospitalized patients in China. Over 10 years, a total of 197 non-duplicate E. anophelis strains were collected. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the standard agar dilution method as a reference assay according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The biofilm formation ability was assessed using a culture microtiter plate method, which was determined using a crystal violet assay. Culture plate results were cross-checked by scanning electron microscopy imaging analysis. Among the 197 isolates, all were multidrug-resistant, and 20 were extensively drug-resistant. Clinical E. anophelis showed high resistance to current antibiotics, and 99% of the isolates were resistant to at least seven antibiotics. The resistance rate for aztreonam, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefepime, and tetracycline was high as 100%, 99%, 99%, 99%, 99%, 95%, and 90%, respectively. However, the isolates exhibited the highest susceptibility to minocycline (100%), doxycycline (96%), and rifampin (94%). The biofilm formation results revealed that all strains could form biofilm. Among them, the proportions of strong, medium, and weak biofilm-forming strains were 41%, 42%, and 17%, respectively. Furthermore, the strains forming strong or moderate biofilm presented a statistically significant higher resistance than the weak formers (p < 0.05), especially for piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Although E. anophelis was notoriously resistant to large antibiotics, minocycline, doxycycline, and rifampin showed potent activity against this pathogen. The data in the present report revealed a positive association between biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance, which will provide a foundation for improved therapeutic strategies against E. anophelis infections in the future.","misc","christiaan"

Facility outbreaks were identified using COVID-19 case data. An event-study design with facility and week fixed effects was used to investigate the association of severe outbreaks with staffing measures. Weeks since the beginning of a severe COVID-19 outbreak (4 weeks prior to 16 weeks after). Total weekly staffing hours, staff counts, staff absences, departures, new hires, overtime and contract staff hours measured for all nursing staff and separately by staff type (registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, certified nursing assistants), facility self-reported staff shortages, and resident deaths. Of the included 2967 nursing homes experiencing severe COVID-19 outbreaks, severe outbreaks were associated with a statistically significant drop in nursing staffing levels owing to elevated absences and departures. Four weeks after an outbreak's start, around when average new cases peaked, staffing hours were 2.6% (95% CI, 2.1%-3.2%) of the mean below preoutbreak levels, despite facilities taking substantial measures to bolster staffing through increased hiring and the use of contract staff and overtime. Because these measures were mostly temporary, staffing declined further in later weeks; 16 weeks after an outbreak's start, staffing hours were 5.5% (95% CI, 4.5%-6.5%) of the mean below preoutbreak levels. Staffing declines were greatest among certified nursing assistants, primarily owing to smaller increases in new hires of this staff type compared with licensed practical nurses and registered nurses. In this cohort study of nursing homes experiencing severe COVID-19 outbreaks, facilities experienced considerable staffing challenges during and after outbreaks. These results suggest the need for policy action to ensure facilities' abilities to maintain adequate staffing levels during and after infectious disease outbreaks.","misc","christiaan"

We first validated the present DI-LBM through some classical benchmark problems, and then investigated the effect of electric field on the lateral migration of the particle in the Poiseuille flow. The numerical results show that the electric field has a significant influence on the particle migration. When an electric field in the vertical direction is applied to the charged particle initially located above the centerline of the channel, the equilibrium position of the particle would drop suddenly as the electric field is larger than a critical value. This is caused by the wall repulsion due to lubrication, the inertial lift related to shear slip, the lift owing to particle rotation, the lift due to the curvature of the undisturbed velocity profile, and the electric force. On the other hand, when an electric field in the horizontal direction is adopted, the equilibrium position of the particle would move toward the centerline of the channel with the increase of the electric field.","misc","christiaan"

A screening LDCT revealed a 1.9 cm × 1.8 cm × 1.4 cm right lower lobe lesion with smooth margins and close association with the hemidiaphragm. A wedge resection with biopsy showed high-grade sarcomatoid mesothelioma with extensive desmoplastic morphology and negative margins. The patient opted for imaging surveillance, and at 12 months has shown no evidence of tumor recurrence on positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. The case shows that LDCT screening discovers cancers and saves lives. It also presented a dilemma for the patient and her oncologist because common guidelines do not define a recommended treatment.","misc","christiaan"

It afforded a series of benzosulfonamides and the corresponding ring-closure products, and a reversal of diastereoselectivity was observed through epimerization of the benzosulfonamide products under continuous irradiation. On the basis of the control experiments, the role of the additive LiNTf2 in achieving high stereoselectivity was elucidated. This PEM reaction was proposed to undergo a direct nucleophilic addition mechanism rather than a hetero-Diels-Alder/ring-opening sequence. A possible transition state model with a photoenolization process was proposed to explain the origin of the high level of stereoinduction.","misc","christiaan"
"1160",35974865,"Two PerPLEXing Cases of Hashimoto's Encephalopathy Unresponsive to Steroid and Intravenous Immunoglobulin Therapy.","Hashimoto's encephalopathy is a nebulous entity over which much controversy exists. Often referred to as steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT), it describes a myriad of neurological sequelae that typically are observed to occur in patients with the presence of thyroid antibodies. We aim to raise clinical awareness of this seldom diagnosed entity as a potential etiology for altered mental status in patients who present with supporting clinical features and elevated thyroid antibodies. While steroid responsiveness is deemed a typical presenting feature of this medical condition, our cases aim to describe two cases that required escalation of therapy to intravenous immunoglobulins, and ultimately, plasmapheresis therapy for improvement in their clinical status. Our patients had a dramatic improvement in their mentation within three to four sessions of plasmapheresis, improving rapidly toward their baseline. Such a dramatic improvement, coupled with the corresponding reduction in their thyroid antibody titer supports the diagnosis of Hashimoto's encephalopathy and highlights the importance of having a low clinical threshold for the diagnosis of this entity in patients who, despite extensive evaluation, reveal no apparent cause for their altered mental status.","misc","christiaan"

The four spheres (10.0/13.0/17.0/22.0 mm) of the PET phantom (NEMA IQ Nu 2-2001) were filled with four times higher activity of [18F]-NaF than the background (5.3kBq/mL). Imaging (image matrix - 128 × 128 × 47, 2 min, 3D model) was done using two different (TOF/non-TOF) PET scanners. Phantom data were reconstructed in TOF and non-TOF modes for lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate and non-TOF mode for bismuth germanate-based PET scanners. The reconstructed data (by varying iteration and subsets) that provided the best image contrast and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were evaluated. The whole-body [18F]-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT scans (7-8 frames; 2.0 min/frame) in 16 lymphoma patients were acquired at 60 min after injecting the radioactivity (370.0-444.0 MBq of [18F]-FDG. The clinical PET/CT data were reconstructed using phantom-derived reconstruction parameters and evaluated for image contrast and SNR of the detected lesions. TOF reconstruction at second iteration provided significantly (P ≤ 0.02) higher SNR (20.7) and contrast (contrast recovery coefficient/background variability = 3.21) for the smallest hot lesions (10.0 mm) in the phantom than the non-TOF system. Similarly, in patient data analysis for the selected FDG avid lesions, the SNR values were significantly (P = 0.02) higher (13.3 ± 6.49) in TOF than (11 ± 6.48) in non-TOF system. Further, the small (≤10.0 mm) lesions were seen more distinctly in TOF system. It is thus observed that TOF reconstruction converged faster than the non-TOF, and the applicability of the same may impact the image quality and interpretation in the clinical PET data. The validation of the phantom-based experimental reconstruction parameters to clinical PET imaging data is highly warranted.","misc","christiaan"

However, the genus Hellenia within the Asian clade has been shown to be non-monophyletic and its morphology has not been studied carefully. Therefore, the complete plastid genomes of Hellenia species were obtained and the monophyly of Hellenia was tested through four different datasets in this study. Plastid phylogenomic analyses of Costaceae revealed that Hellenia is strongly supported as paraphyletic. Two major clades are recovered, namely the Hellenia s.s. subclade and the Parahellenia subclade. Phylogenetic analyses based on an enlarged taxon sampling of the Asian clade using a two chloroplast markers dataset (trnK intron and trnL-F spacer) confirmed the paraphyly of Hellenia. Meanwhile, morphological analyses suggested that members of the Parahellenia subclade differ from the remaining Hellenia species in many characters including inflorescences, bracts, stigma, axillary buds, floral tubes and labellum. According to the present molecular and morphological evidence, the latter subclade is recognized as a new genus, Parahellenia.

We present a detailed analysis of in situ observations of O3 and NO x to (1) disentangle the main processes propelling O3 formation such as precursor emissions and meteorology and (2) quantify the impact of NO x reductions and (3) estimate the effect of climate warming. The temperature sensitivity of surface O3 production is assessed separately for NO x and VOC limited regimes. The temperature sensitivity of ozone increases with temperature in spring and summer. On average, the evaluated absolute values of the sensitivities are a factor of 2.5 larger in summer than in spring. The analysis of ambient O3 burdens during hot summers indicates that rising temperatures in a warming climate might largely offset the benefit of future emission reductions. MAX-DOAS formaldehyde (HCHO) measurements in Vienna from 2017 to 2019 are used as a proxy for VOC emissions. The seasonal and the temperature dependence of the observed HCHO mixing ratios indicate that biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) are the dominant source of hydrocarbons in the urban setting during the ozone season. The result agrees well with VOC emission estimates that show BVOCs to be the dominant VOC source in Austria since the early 2000s. Accordingly, anthropogenic NO x emission reductions remain, outside of urban cores, the most effective instrument for policymakers to lower surface ozone concentrations in the short term.","misc","christiaan"

Based on this, this work first makes a detailed analysis of the business environment and CLR. Second, the research hypotheses are put forward, and the conceptual model is proposed. At the same time, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) is designed to analyze the business environment, ES, and ED, and their relationships. Finally, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) is constructed and the CLR-optimized business environment is used as the intermediary variable to explore the impact of the business environment on ES and ED. Then, 200 QSs (recovering 192 valid ones) are distributed to investigate entrepreneurs' attitudes toward ES and ED in different regions. Statistical analysis and independent t-tests are performed on the survey results to judge the relationship between variables. The results of empirical analysis show that (1) The significance coefficient P of ES and ED is 0.005 < 0.01, and the scores of ES and ED of large enterprises are 132.7864 and 142.3243, respectively, which are the highest. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the ED. (2) The influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ES is 0.60, and the influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ED is 0.75. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation plays a positive role in the development of ES. CLR-optimized business regulation plays a regulating role between ES and ED. (3) CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the formation of ES. The policy enlightenment of this work mainly has three points. First, optimizing the business environment can stimulate and protect ES, thus improving the quality of economic growth. All regions should promote mass entrepreneurship and innovation and high-quality economic development by improving the convergence of economic policies and building a legal and market-oriented business environment. Second, all regions should implement dynamic and differentiated policies to optimize the business environment's spatial pattern in Chinese cities.

To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on viral hepatitis elimination programs, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) conducted a survey in liver centers worldwide in 2021. A web-based questionnaire was distributed (May-July 2021) to all EASL members representing clinical units providing HBV and HCV hepatitis care. Results are expressed as absolute numbers and reduction rates for each care activity. Data were collected from 32 European and 12 non-European clinical centers. Between January 2019 (pre-pandemic) and December 2020 (during the pandemic), chronic HBV consultations decreased by 32% and 26%, new referrals by 38% and 39%, HBV testing rates by 39% and 21% (for HBsAg detection) and 30% and 22% (for HBV DNA detection), and new HBV treatments by 20% and 44% (p = 0.328) in European and non-European centers, respectively. With regard to HCV during the same time frame, the overall reductions were 39% and 50% for consultations, 49% and 49% for new referrals, 11% and 38% for HCV RNA detection, and 51% and 54% for new HCV antiviral treatments for European and non-European Centers, respectively (p = 0.071). All steps in the viral hepatitis care cascade have been hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a comparable impact across different centers. These data reaffirm the pandemic's major effect on global viral hepatitis elimination programs and suggest that actions to achieve the WHO 2030 targets should be reconsidered and revised to account for each country's progress relative to pre-pandemic values. The EASL multinational survey conclusively shows that viral hepatitis elimination programs, expected to provide control of hepatitis B and hepatitis C worldwide by 2030, have been held back by the COVID-19 pandemic in clinical centers from several European and non-European countries, with a comparable impact across centers. Limitations in the cascade of care for both HBV and HCV were linked to limited access to screening, consultations, specific testing, and actual treatment. As restrictions for COVID-19 begin to lift, efforts to diagnose and provide treatment for viral hepatitis should remain high on the list of priorities for public health officials to maintain the WHO elimination efforts. Measures that have been put in place to control the COVID-19 pandemic could be transferred to increasing the diagnosis and linkage to care of people with hepatitis.","misc","christiaan"

In general, the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters, the atomic positions and the atomic thermal vibrations is both anisotropic and nonlinear. Implemented here is a software package for precise and flexible calculation of structure factors for dynamical diffraction. α-Quartz is used as an example because it presents the challenges mentioned above and because it is being considered for use in high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy. The package is designed to be extended easily to other crystals by adding new material files, which are kept separate from the package's stable core. Python 3 was chosen as the language to allow the easy integration of this code into existing packages. The importance of a correct anisotropic treatment of the atomic thermal vibrations is demonstrated by comparison with an isotropic Debye model. Discrepancies between the two models can be as much as 5% for strong reflections and considerably larger (even to the level of 100%) for weak reflections. A script for finding Bragg reflections that backscatter X-rays of a given energy within a given temperature range is demonstrated. The package and example scripts are available on request. Also discussed, in detail, are the various conventions related to the proper description of chiral quartz.","misc","christiaan"

It is observed that introducing intermittency in the interaction term as a function of time or the system state predictably alters the dynamics of the constituent oscillators. Choosing the nature of the interaction, attractive or repulsive, allows for either suppression of oscillations or stimulation of activity. Two parameters Δ and τ, that reign the extent of interaction among subsystems, are introduced. They serve as a harness to access the entire range of possible behaviors from fixed points to chaos. For fixed values of system parameters and coupling strength, changing Δ and τ offers fine control over the dynamics of coupled subsystems. We show this experimentally using coupled Chua's circuits and elucidate their behavior for a range of coupling parameters through detailed numerical simulations.","misc","christiaan"

Sixty-eight percent of patients were from rural backgrounds. Half of the patients had bilateral involvement. Fifty percent of patients presented after 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms. Of 48 eyes at presentation, 11 had mild disease, 9 had moderate disease and 28 had severe disease. At presentation, best-corrected visual acuity <3/60 was found in 26 (54%) eyes. Mooren's ulcer (40% eyes) was the most common etiology for PUK. Rheumatoid factor was positive in 8 of 32 patients (25%). Of 32 patients, 19 (59%) required systemic immunosuppression for the control of disease activity. Surgical intervention to maintain anatomical integrity was required in 27 (56%) eyes. No significant change in vision was seen in pretreatment and posttreatment groups. Four eyes failed to heal after 4 weeks of initiation of treatment due to noncompliance of the patient.

This aspect is responsible for unleashing various issues in the learning process, such as gender inequality, creating adverse effects on cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mediators, which opposes the fifth UN's Sustainable Development Goal. Therefore, many studies notice the harmful effects of stereotypes in educational technologies.

Based on this, the present study aimed to verify the predominance of color bias in educational technologies available on the WEB. This study developed a computational solution to calculate male and female color bias in the available educational technology web pages. The results suggest the prevalence of the development of educational technologies with a male color bias, with an imbalance among genders, without adequate customization for age groups. Furthermore, some environments, such as Computer Science, present a higher color bias for men when compared to women. Despite both scales being independent, results indicated interesting evidence of a substantial prevalence of colors associated with the male scale.

As a novel discovery, this study finds that stock liquidity abnormally decreases with contemporaneous idiosyncratic return and also with 1-year lagged systematic return. Only the idiosyncratic return variance can decrease future short-term or contemporaneous stock liquidity. Idiosyncratic factors are more important than systematic ones for contemporaneous and future stock liquidity. The predictive power of the determinants decreases with the forecast length. Economic policy uncertainty (EPU) can affect sensitivity of stock liquidity to contemporaneous determinants. The empirical results of this research are robust over subperiods, forecast length and across four liquidity measurements. The abnormalities and linkages between determinants and stock liquidity are correlated with investor psychology and special market mechanism in China.","misc","christiaan"

"1311",35967611,"Mental Health Identification of Children and Young Adults in a Pandemic Using Machine Learning Classifiers.","COVID-19 has altered our lifestyle, communication, employment, and also our emotions. The pandemic and its devastating implications have had a significant impact on higher education, as well as other sectors. Numerous researchers have utilized typical statistical methods to determine the effect of COVID-19 on the psychological wellbeing of young people. Moreover, the primary aspects that have changed in the psychological condition of children and young adults during COVID lockdown is analyzed. These changes are analyzed using machine learning and AI techniques which should be established for the alterations. This research work mainly concentrates on children's and young people's mental health in the first lockdown. There are six processes involved in this work. Initially, it collects the data using questionnaires, and then, the collected data are pre-processed by data cleaning, categorical encoding, and data normalization method. Next, the clustering process is used for grouping the data based on their mood state, and then, the feature selection process is done by chi-square, L1-Norm, and ReliefF. Then, the machine learning classifiers are used for predicting the mood state, and automatic calibration is used for selecting the best model. Finally, it predicts the mood state of the children and young adults. The findings revealed that for a better understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's and youths' mental states, a combination of heterogeneous data from practically all feature groups is required.","misc","christiaan"

Despite this, there are few regional anaesthesia options available to effectively relieve pain in these fracture types and avoid potential side effects from opioid administration. This case report describes an elderly patient with a superior ramus fracture, who received effective pain relief with motor sparing, using a standard-volume point-of-care ultrasound-guided pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block performed in the emergency department. The standard-volume PENG block performed by an emergency clinician appears to be a safe, effective and feasible regional anaesthesia technique for superior pubic ramus fracture, with the additional benefit of motor sparing that may potentially facilitate earlier mobilisation and discharge.","misc","christiaan"

The molecular weight of the peptides was below 3,000 Da. Heptapeptides to decapeptides were the main peptides in the fermentation mycelia of S. rugosoannulata. More than 50% of the peptides had salty and umami taste characteristics, and the long-chain peptides (decapeptides to 24 peptides) also played an essential role in the pleasant taste characteristics of mycelium. In the salty and umami peptide of S. rugosoannulata, the distribution of non-polar hydrophobic amino acids and polar-uncharged amino acids accounted for a relatively high proportion, and the proportion of polar-uncharged amino acids further increased, with the extension of the peptide chain. P, F, I, l, V, G, S, T, and D were the amino acids with a high proportion in the peptides. The taste peptides can bind to more than 60% of the active amino acid residues in the cavity-binding domain of the T1R1/T1R3 receptors. Hydrogen bond interaction was the primary mode of interaction between the peptides and the receptor. The first and second amino acid residues (such as S, V, E, K, G, and A) at the C-terminal and N-terminal of the peptides were easy to bind to T1R1/T1R3 receptors. Asp108, Asn150, Asp147, Glu301, Asp219, Asp243, Glu70, Asp218 in T1R1, and Glu45, Glu148, Glu301, Glu48, and Ala46 in TIR3 were the key active amino acid sites of taste peptides binding to T1R1/T1R3 receptors.","misc","christiaan"

While the antigenicity of many HA subtypes is reasonably well studied, less is known about NA antigenicity, especially when it comes to non-human subtypes that only circulate in animal reservoirs. The N6 subtype NAs are mostly found in viruses infecting birds. However, they have also been identified in viruses that infect mammals, such as swine and seals. More recently, highly pathogenic H5N6 subtype viruses have caused rare infections and mortality in humans. Here, we generated murine mAbs to the N6 NA, characterized their breadth and antiviral properties in vitro and in vivo and mapped their epitopes by generating escape mutant viruses. We found that the antibodies had broad reactivity across the American and Eurasian N6 lineages, but relatively little binding to the H5N6 NA. Several of the antibodies exhibited strong NA inhibition activity and some also showed activity in the antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity reporter assay and neutralization assay. In addition, we generated escape mutant viruses for six monoclonal antibodies and found mutations on the lateral ridge of the NA. Lastly, we observed variable protection in H4N6 mouse challenge models when the antibodies were given prophylactically.","misc","christiaan"

Data were collected between November 15 and December 14, 2021, and three attitudes were included, namely, the negative influence on daily life, concerns of infection risk, and prediction of the ending of the pandemic. The majority of people perceived that daily life was at least somewhat negatively influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, and they worried at least once a week about infection risk. After the emergence of the omicron variant, the perceived negative influence and concern of infection risk decreased slightly while the prediction of ending increased significantly. People who were infected by COVID-19 perceived more negative influence and more concern of infection risk, but were more optimistic about the ending of the pandemic. People who did not get a vaccine perceived less negative influence and less concern of infection risk, but were more pessimistic about the ending of the pandemic. The attitudes varied significantly by individual and contextual characteristics. The emergence of omicron significantly increased people's predicted ending time of the pandemic but did not change people's perception of the pandemic's negative influence on daily life and concern of infection risk.","misc","christiaan"

This study aimed to investigate the infection by SARS-CoV-2 in children with newly-diagnosed T1D to explore a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 infection, T1D and DKA. Thirty-nine children with a T1D new onset between October 15, 2020, and April 15, 2021, were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 infection was investigated through a polymerase chain reaction on the nasal swab, dosage of specific antibodies, and an anamnestic question form. Nine (23%) of them had antibodies directed toward SARS-CoV-2, and five (12%) had a history of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection in themselves or in their family. No molecular swabs were positive. Compared to the general pediatric population, the overall incidence of COVID-19 was 5.6 times higher in the T1D patients' group (p < 0.00001). Referring only to the cases in the metropolitan area, we find a net increase in the incidence of T1D compared to the 5 years preceding our study, by 50% compared to the same months in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018, by 69% compared to 2018/2019 and by 77% compared to 2019/2020. The same trend was observed regarding DKA cases. The attributable risk of the pandemic cohort compared to the previous year is 44%. The abnormal disproportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection between children with T1D and the pediatric reference population, with a ratio of 5.6, appears to support the causative role of SARS-CoV-2 in triggering the immune response underlying diabetes, as often described for other viral infections. The difficulty accessing care services during the pandemic, with a consequent diagnosis delay, does not justify the increase in observed T1D cases, which could to be directly linked to the pandemic. The acceleration of the immune process provoked by SARS-CoV-2 may play a suggestive role in the development of T1D with DKA. Multicenter studies are needed to deepen and fully understand the pathophysiological link between SARS-CoV-2 and the onset of T1D in children.","misc","christiaan"

We used a systems approach and applied an impact matrix and chain effect analysis methods to projects in the highly urbanized Taipei metropolitan region to identify the influences and effects between urban development projects and climate change objectives. Three types of urban plans and projects were analyzed: flood control, transportation, and urban planning. The magnitudes of the influences and effects between these projects and plans were derived through interviews with experts familiar with Taipei's urban development. This pilot study found no synergy in the response to climate change mitigation and adaptation for the urban development projects analyzed. The current standalone policies and plans related to urbanization in Taipei have resulted in trade-offs for flood control and public transit projects because they contribute positively toward one climate objective but negatively impact another. A high-level policymaking mechanism that ensures coordination and collaboration between different sectors is needed to supervise sectoral policies. Prior to the approval and implementation of a plan, policymakers should request the assessment of synergies and trade-offs between plans and projects to ensure a synergistic effect to climate change issues. This study confirms that the strategy from individual sector in a metropolitan region will result in trade-off between climate change issues is a global problem. This paper also strengthens the concept that the assessment of synergy/trade-offs between policy and plans should be conducted using systemic approach.","misc","christiaan"

Poor occupational safety practices could contribute to loss of lives of janitors and the general public. However, there are no detailed investigations on occupational safety practices of janitors involved in different settings, such as universities where there are crowds of people. In addition, although observation is recognized as a better tool to investigate occupational safety practices, previous studies mainly employed self-administered questionnaires and/or face-to-face interviews as data collection mechanisms. Therefore, this study aimed to assess occupational safety practices to prevent COVID-19 transmission and associated factors among Ethiopian University janitors using an observation tool and a self-administered questionnaire. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 410 janitors of Bule Hora University (Ethiopia) from November to December, 2021. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the independent factors associated with occupational safety practices. Occupational safety practices for COVID-19 were good only among 53.9% of the janitors. Training on COVID-19 prevention measures (AOR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.57-4.37), availability of policy and protocol in the work place (AOR = 5.46; 95% CI: 3.57-8.36), and availability of soap/bleach (AOR = 2.71; 95% CI: 1.64-4.46) were found to significantly increase the likelihood of occupational safety of the janitors.

Databases of PubMed, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, and Human Gene Mutation Database, Wanfang Data, and Embase were searched for case reports of ATP1A3-related diseases. Following case screening, we collected clinical information and genetic testing results of patients, and analyzed the disease characteristics on the clinical phenotype spectrum associated with mutations, genetic characteristics of mutations, and effects of drug therapy. We collected 902 clinical cases related to ATP1A3 gene. From the results of previous studies, we further clarified the clinical characteristics of ATP1A3-related diseases, such as alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC), rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism; cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss syndrome, and relapsing encephalopathy with cerebellar ataxia, frequency of mutations in different phenotypes and their distribution in gene and protein structures, and differences in mutations in different clinical phenotypes.

In many eukaryotes, the septin cytoskeleton is an integral component in coordinating shape changes like cytokinesis, polarized growth, and migration. Septins are filament-forming proteins that assemble to form diverse higher-order structures and, in many cases, are found in different areas of the plasma membrane, most notably in regions of micron-scale positive curvature. Monitoring the process of septin assembly in vivo is hindered by the limitations of light microscopy in cells, as well as the complexity of interactions with both membranes and cytoskeletal elements, making it difficult to quantify septin dynamics in living systems. Fortunately, there has been substantial progress in the past decade in reconstituting the septin cytoskeleton in a cell-free system to dissect the mechanisms controlling septin assembly at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The core steps of septin assembly include septin heterooligomer association and dissociation with the membrane, polymerization into filaments, and the formation of higher-order structures through interactions between filaments. Here, we present three methods to observe septin assembly in different contexts: planar bilayers, spherical supports, and rod supports. These methods can be used to determine the biophysical parameters of septins at different stages of assembly: as single octamers binding the membrane, as filaments, and as assemblies of filaments. We use these parameters paired with measurements of curvature sampling and preferential adsorption to understand how curvature sensing operates at a variety of length and time scales.","misc","christiaan"

Members of the DUF1644 family, the domains of unknown function 1644 motif are predicted to play an essential regulatory role in response to abiotic stress. However, the specific molecular mechanisms of most members of this family remain elusive. Here, we report that the OsSIDP301 (stress-induced DUF1644 protein) was induced by salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA). We found that overexpression of OsSIDP301 (OE) in plants conferred salt hypersensitivity and reduced grain size, whereas plants with OsSIDP301 RNA interference (RNAi) exhibited salt tolerance and increased grain size in rice. OsSIDP301 determines salt stress tolerance by modulating genes involved in the salt-response and ABA signaling pathways. Further studies suggest that OsSIDP301 regulates grain size by influencing cell expansion in spikelet hulls. Moreover, OsSIDP301 interacts with OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1), which positively regulates grain size in rice. Our findings reveal that OsSIDP301 functions as a negative regulator of salt stress and grain size, and repressing its expression represents a promising strategy for improving salt stress tolerance and yield in rice.","misc","christiaan"

In HED matter, the electronic structure of individual atomic ions is influenced by a dense plasma environment, and one of the most significant phenomena is the ionization potential depression (IPD). Incorporation of the IPD effects is of great importance in accurate modeling of dense plasmas. All theoretical treatments of IPD so far have been based on the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, but its validity is questionable in ultrafast formation dynamics of dense plasmas, particularly when interacting with intense XFEL pulses. A treatment of transient IPD, based on an electronic-structure calculation of an atom in the presence of a plasma environment described by classical particles, has recently been proposed [Phys. Rev. E 103, 023203 (2021)2470-004510.1103/PhysRevE.103.023203], but its application to and impact on plasma dynamics simulations have not been investigated yet. In this work, we extend XMDYN, a hybrid quantum-classical approach combining Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics, by incorporating the proposed IPD treatment into plasma dynamics simulations. We demonstrate the importance of the IPD effects in theoretical modeling of aluminum dense plasmas by comparing two XMDYN simulations: one with electronic-structure calculations of isolated atoms (without IPD) and the other with those of atoms embedded in a plasma (with IPD). At equilibrium, the mean charge obtained in the plasma simulation with IPD is in good agreement with the full quantum-mechanical average-atom model. The present approach promises to be a reliable tool to simulate the creation and nonequilibrium evolution of dense plasmas induced by ultraintense and ultrashort XFEL pulses.","misc","christiaan"
