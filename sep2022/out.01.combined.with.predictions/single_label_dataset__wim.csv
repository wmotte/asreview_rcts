The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association between IBD and sexual function. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases (up to September 1, 2020). Scores of sexual functions with a standard deviation and odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) with a 95% CI were used to analysis the association between IBD and sexual function. Eleven studies with 7,018 male IBD cases and 1,803 female IBD cases were included in the meta-analysis. In male individuals, the pooled results revealed that IBD was significantly associated with impaired erectile function and poor sexual satisfaction (RR for erectile function =1.50, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.84, P<0.0001; standard mean difference for sexual satisfaction =-0.24, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.15, P<0.0001). And among female individuals, IBD had impact on most sub-domains of sexual function, except pains. IBD is associated with worse sexual function. It has significant impact on erectile function and satisfaction for male individuals and has impact on most sub-domains of sexual function for female individuals.","meta_analysis","wim"
"2",35958663,"Systematic review on somatization in a transcultural context among teenagers and young adults: Focus on the nosography blur.","Somatic complaints are a frequent cause for consultation in primary care. In a transcultural context, somatic complaints are typically associated with psychological distress. A recent review about somatic symptom disorders in adolescence showed some nosographic heterogeneity and outlined various etiological hypotheses (traumatic, environmental, or neurologic), separate from the cross-cultural considerations. Migrants' children encounter specific problems involving cultural mixing-issues of filiation (familial transmission) and affiliation (belonging to a group). This paper aims to provide a systematic review of somatization in transcultural contexts among teenagers and young adults, aged 13 to 24, over the past decade. This review adheres to the quality criteria set forth by the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Two authors queried three English databases (Medline, PsycInfo, WebOfScience) about somatization in transcultural contexts (migrant or non-Western population) among teenagers (13-18), young adults (19-24), or both. The methodological process comprised articles selection, data extraction, and then the analysis of emerging themes. Setting selection criteria to limit the transcultural field was difficult. The study analyzed 68 articles. We present a descriptive analysis of the results, centered on three main themes. First, the literature highlights a nosographic muddle reflected in the combination of anxious and depressive symptoms together with the highly variable symptomatology. Second, discrimination issues were prevalent among the migrant population. Lastly, the literature review points out possibilities for improving a care pathway and reducing the diagnostic delay induced by migrants' hesitancy about Western care and the recurrent use of inappropriate diagnostic criteria. This review discusses the links between the nosographic muddle described here and the diagnostic delays these patients experience and raises concerns about rigid diagnostic compartmentalization. The work of the psychiatrist Frantz Fanon is here useful to understand externalized symptoms resulting from physical and psychological confinement. Discrimination issues raise questions about the cultural counter-transference health professionals experience in dealing with young migrants. Defining healthcare professionals' representations about somatic complaints in a transcultural context might be a fruitful path to explore in future research. CRD42021294132.

"3",35958982,"A systematic review of the surgical outcomes of interprosthetic femur fractures.","Interprosthetic femur fractures (IFFs) are rare, but the treatment is challenging. Currently, there are many treatment methods used in practice, but an updated systematic review of comparison of common different surgical outcomes has not been thoroughly inspected. A systematic review of retrospective studies was conducted. The resource databases of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase were searched using a combination of the keywords involving IFFs and surgical outcomes from inception through June 2021. Data collected included patient demographics, intraoperative data, and postoperative outcomes. Outcomes were measured based on healing time, revision rate, complication rate, and functional scores. Forty studies were included for review with a total of 508 patients. Average reported age of patients was 78.7 years old and 403 (79.3%) were females. Overall union rate was 74.0% with 376 of 508 patients achieving fracture union after primary treatment of IFF. Only 271 patients had reported healing times of fractures with a mean of 5.15 months. The plate, prosthetic revision, nail/rod, and external fixator groups had mean healing times of 4.69, 8.73, 6.5, and 5.1 months, respectively. Revision rates were highest in the femur replacement treatment group with 9 (32.1%) patients needing at least one reoperation surgery for any reason. Overall, hardware failure and non-unions were the most reported complications in treatment of IFFs. Postoperative functional outcome scores were available for 242 patients. Harris Hip Scores for the plate, revision, replacement, nail/rod, and plate + revision groups were 76.84, 77.14, 69.9, 77, and 78.4, respectively. Each treatment method should be carefully considered by the surgeon depending on the patient. Locking plate was the most common method for the treatment of the patients with IFFs. Half of them combined with cerclage wires/cables. Around two thirds' patients could achieve union with the fastest mean healing time around 4.69 months. Other less common methods included prosthetic revision, femur replacement, nail/rod, external fixator, etc. A small number of patients treated with Ilizarov external fixator, and it has proven to be a viable option with few complications and high union rates.","systematic_review","wim"
"4",35957861,"Does patient and public involvement influence the development of competency frameworks for the health professions? A systematic review.","Competency frameworks typically describe the perceived knowledge, skills, attitudes and other characteristics required for a health professional to practice safely and effectively. Patient and public involvement in the development of competency frameworks is uncommon despite delivery of person-centered care being a defining feature of a competent health professional. This systematic review aimed to determine how patients and the public are involved in the development of competency frameworks for health professions, and whether their involvement influenced the outcome of the competency frameworks. Studies were identified from six electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science and ERIC). The database search yielded a total of 8,222 citations, and 43 articles were included for data extraction. Most studies were from the United Kingdom (27%) and developed through multidisciplinary collaborations involving two or more professions (40%). There was a large variation in the number of patients and members of the public recruited (range 1-1,398); recruitment sources included patients and carers with the clinical condition of interest (30%) or established consumer representative groups (22%). Common stages for involving patients and the public were in generation of competency statements (57%) or reviewing the draft competency framework (57%). Only ten studies (27%) took a collaborative approach to the engagement of patients and public in competency framework development. The main ways in which involvement influenced the competency framework were validation of health professional-derived competency statements, provision of desirable behaviors and attitudes and generation of additional competency statements. Overall, there was a lack of reporting regarding the details and outcome of patient and public involvement. Further research is required to optimize approaches to patient and public involvement in competency framework development including guidance regarding who, how, when and for what purposes they should be engaged and the requirements for reporting. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier: CRD42020203117.","systematic_review","wim"
"5",35966077,"Exercise and physical performance in older adults with sarcopenic obesity: A systematic review.","Sarcopenic obesity is characterized by low muscle mass and high body fat; prevalence increases with age, particularly after age 65 years. For this systematic literature review we searched scientific databases for studies on exercise interventions for improving physical performance in adults with sarcopenic obesity; also, we identified potential gaps in clinical practice guidelines that need to be addressed. We followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The databases were searched for studies published through November 2021 that measured physical performance in adults with sarcopenic obesity. Most of the studies applied a strength training protocol in which improvement was noted post-treatment on the Time Chair Rise (TCR), 30-s Chair Stand, and Single Leg Stance (SLS) tests. Discrepancies between the studies were observed when resistance training was combined with or without elastic bands or electromyostimulation, as measured with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Physical Performance Test (PPT), Gait Speed, and Timed Up & Go (TUG) test. Post-intervention SPPB, PPT, and gait speed scores showed an increase or maintenance of performance, while TUG test scores were higher according to one study but lower according to another. Engagement in physical exercise, and resistance training in particular, can improve or maintain physical performance in adults with sarcopenic obesity. Study samples should include more men. A future area of focus should be the impact of different types of training (aerobic, power training, combined modalities). Finally, studies with longer intervention periods and follow-up periods are needed to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of exercise on physical function in adults with sarcopenic obesity.","systematic_review","wim"

The complexity of this malignancy has evolved, with environmental and genetic factors and treatment strategies being more studied. We aimed to group and organize the clinicopathological and epidemiological features of GC in the Arab World and compare with data from Western countries. To obtain the highest number of topic-related articles, an extensive electronic search was conducted in the PubMed MEDLINE and Cochrane databases up to March 2022 using Boolean operators with a combination of keywords and MeSH terms. A total of 42 articles were retained after screening in accordance with the objectives of the study. The estimated age-standardized incidence rates in the Arab World were collected from the GLOBOCAN 2020 database. A total of 46 articles were retrieved from 11 countries in the Arab World. Epidemiological elements were collected, especially tumour attributes, risk factors and population characteristics, in addition to some therapeutic strategies. Results were regrouped by theme and then organized in tables and charts, allowing a global and regional approach to the subject. This review shows that the Arab World is considered a low-rate GC incidence region, presenting almost the same tumour characteristics as the Western countries. The lack of GC data in the Arab World should trigger a rise in research on this type of malignancy to better understand the subject. سرطان المعدة في العالم العربي: استعراض منهجي. مارك عودة، مارك مسلم، مجد عبده، براين يوسف، هامبيك رفايل كوريه، حميد عبيد الشامسي. يُعدُّ سرطان المعدة رابع أكثر أنواع السرطانات شيوعًا في العالم، ويتميز بأنه ينشأ عن عوامل متعددة، وله توزيع جغرافي غير متجانس. وقد تطور تعقيد هذا الورم الخبيث، مع خضوع العوامل البيئية والجينية واستراتيجيات العلاج لمزيد من الدراسة. هدفت هذه الدراسة الى تجميع وتنظيم السمات السريرية الباثولوجية والوبائية لسرطان المعدة في العالم العربي ومقارنتها ببيانات من بلدان غربية. للحصول على أكبر عدد من المقالات المتعلقة بالموضوع، أُجريَ بحث إلكتروني موسع في قاعدتََي بيانات PubMed MEDLINE وCochrane حتى مارس 2022 باستخدام عوامل منطقية (Boolean) مع مزيج من الكلمات المفتاحية ومصطلحات العناوين الرئيسية للموضوعات الطبية (MeSH). وجرى الاحتفاظ بما مجموعه 42 مقالًًا بعد الفرز وفقًا لأهداف الدراسة. وجُُمعت معدلات الإصابة المقدَّرة المُوحَّدة حسب السن في العالم العربي من قاعدة بيانات GLOBOCAN 2020. جرى الحصول على ما مجموعه 46 مقالًًا من 11 بلدًا في العالم العربي. وجرى جمع العناصر الوبائية، ولا سيما خصائص الأورام، وعوامل الخطر، وخصائص السكان، بالإضافة إلى بعض الاستراتيجيات العلاجية. وأُعيد تجميع النتائج حسب الموضوع، ثم نُظِّمت في جداول ومخططات، الأمر الذي أتاح اتباعَ نهجٍ عالمي وإقليمي إزاء الموضوع. يُبيِِّّن هذا الاستعراض أن العالم العربي يُعدُّ منطقة ذات معدل منخفض للإصابة بسرطان المعدة، إذ تُظهِر خصائصَ الأورام نفسها تقريبًا التي تظهر في الدول الغربية. وينبغي أن يؤدي نقص بيانات سرطان المعدة في العالم العربي إلى زيادة الأبحاث المتعلقة بهذا النوع من الأورام الخبيثة، من أجل التوصل إلى فهم أفضل للموضوع.

We aimed to systematically review studies that evaluated upper airway bacterial microbiota in relation to asthma, compared to nonasthmatic controls. Searches used MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection. Eligible studies included association between asthma and upper airway dysbiosis; assessment of composition and diversity of upper airway microbiota using 16S rRNA or metagenomic sequencing; upper airway samples from nose, nasopharynx, oropharynx or hypopharynx. Study quality was assessed and rated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A total of 249 publications were identified; 17 in the final analysis (13 childhood asthma and 4 adult asthma). Microbiome richness was measured in 6 studies, species diversity in 12, and bacterial composition in 17. The quality of evidence was good and fair. The alpha-diversity was found to be higher in younger children with wheezing and asthma, while it was lower when asthmatic children had rhinitis or mite sensitization. In children, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were higher in asthmatics compared to controls (7 studies), and Moraxella, Streptococcus, and Haemophilus were predominant in the bacterial community. In pooled analysis, nasal Streptococcus colonization was associated with the presence of wheezing at age 5 (p = 0.04). In adult patients with asthma, the abundance of Proteobacteria was elevated in the upper respiratory tract (3 studies). Nasal colonization of Corynebacterium was lower in asthmatics (2 studies). This study demonstrates the potential relationships between asthma and specific bacterial colonization in the upper airway in adult and children with asthma.","systematic_review","wim"

However, women have historically been underrepresented in clinical trials, leading to uneven evidence regarding the benefit of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). This review aims to outline the sex differences in the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). We conducted a systematic review via Medline from inception to 31 January 2022, including all randomized clinical trials published in English including adult patients suffering HFrEF that reported data on the efficacy of each drug. Baseline clinical characteristics, primary outcomes, and sex-specific effects are summarized in tables. The systemic review has been conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. In total, 29 articles were included in the systematic review. We observed that the proportion of women enrolled in clinical trials was generally low, the absence of a prespecified analysis of efficacy by sex was frequent, and the level of quality of evidence on the efficacy of GDMT and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-) in women was relatively poor. Sex influences the response to treatment of patients suffering from HFrEF. All the results from the landmark randomized clinical trials are based on study populations composed mainly of men. Further studies specifically designed considering sex differences are warranted to elucidate if GDMT and new devices are equally effective in both sexes.","systematic_review","wim"

However, robust conclusions have not yet been determined because of variations in the methodological and evidence quality of these SRs/MAs. Objectives: We aimed to assess the methodological and reporting quality of SRs/MAs and evaluate the available evidence of the efficacy of CHM treatment of migraines. Methods: We searched eight electronic databases from inception until 10 January 2022, without language restrictions. Two researchers were independently responsible for study screening and data extraction. The methodological and reporting quality of SRs/MAs were assessed using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). The evidence quality of included SRs/MAs was evaluated by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). In addition, a descriptive analysis of the included SRs/MAs was included. Results: Sixteen SRs/MAs, including 69 outcomes, were finally included in this overview. Data synthesis of the included SRs/MAs outcomes showed that CHM plus Western medicine (WM) was beneficial in the improvement of migraines. In comparison, there was conflicting evidence for the effectiveness of CHM used alone. CHM was better than WM in improving responder rate and acute medication usage and was superior to placebo in improving migraine days, responder rate, and migraine duration. However, there was insufficient evidence to verify the effectiveness of CHM for migraine treatment regarding pain severity and migraine frequency. All the included SRs/MAs showed extremely low methodological and reporting quality. The results of the GRADE system indicated that the quality of most of the pooled evidence was very low. Conclusions: CHM may be beneficial in improving migraines and can be used as a complementary therapy. However, we should treat the conclusions of the evaluated SRs/MAs cautiously because of the low quality of evidence. Future SRs/MAs should focus on improving methodological and reporting quality. High-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to provide strong evidence for the efficacy of CHM treatment of migraines.","systematic_review","wim"

The occurrence of this tumor in the intradural extramedullary spinal region is infrequent. This systematic review examines primary extraosseous intradural extramedullary ES in the cervical region to provide specific outcomes and evaluate the role of adjuvant chemoradiation in overall prognosis. A systematic review was conducted to identify all cervical primary extraosseous intradural extramedullary ES reported in the literature. The search included the databases of PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, Embase, and Scopus from inception to June 2021. Inclusion criteria include a reported death outcome or a minimum one-year follow-up. Our search retrieved 21 articles that involved the cervical spine, but only 11 cases met the inclusion criteria. Of the nine patients who demonstrated disease progression, six experienced local failure, two had distant craniospinal axis failure, and one had systemic metastases. Five patients died of the disease at a median of 11 months after diagnosis. Our analysis showed a one-, two-, and five-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 36.4%, 36.4%, and 12.1%, respectively. The one-, two-, and five-year overall survival rates were 72.7%, 62.3%, and 46.8%, respectively. Three of the five (60%) patients who died received craniospinal radiotherapy. Of the six patients who survived, two received craniospinal radiotherapy (33%), and one received whole spine radiotherapy (17%). This review showed that patients with cervical primary extraosseous intradural extramedullary ES had poor progression-free survival and overall survival rates.

Studies published from 2008 to 2022 were eligible for inclusion in the present study. Only studies presenting data from in-vivo investigations utilizing SCs in the repair of peripheral nerve injuries qualified for review. Studies attempting repair of a gap of ≥10 mm were included. Lastly, studies needed to have some measure of quantifiable regenerative outcome data such as histomorphometry, immunohistochemical, electrophysiology, or other functional outcomes. A search of the PubMed and Cochrane databases revealed 328 studies. After screening using the abstracts and methods, 17 studies were found to meet our inclusion criteria. Good SC adherence and survival in conduit tubes across various studies was observed. Improvement in morphological and functional outcomes with the use of SCs in long gap peripheral nerve injuries was observed in nearly all studies. Based on contemporary literature, SCs have demonstrated clear potential in the repair of peripheral nerve injury in animal studies. It has yet to be determined which nerve conduit or graft will prove superior for delivery and retention of SCs for nerve regeneration.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of the new intervention program in comparison with a widely adopted cognitive-behavioral training (CBT) program. Real-life work teams were recruited to enhance the ecological validity of outcome evaluation. The participants comprised 250 Chinese working adults (68% men; median age = 25 years, range: 18-40) who took part voluntarily. They were randomly assigned to the SPT, CBT, and waitlist conditions. For outcome evaluation, team effectiveness was the primary outcome, whereas coping flexibility was the secondary outcome. For explanation of outcome changes, group cohesion and discriminative thinking were tested as the hypothesized learning mechanisms. The results revealed that the SPT group alone reported greater team effectiveness over time, with an increase in group cohesion found to explain the improvement. Both the SPT and CBT groups reported greater coping flexibility over time, with discriminative thinking found to account for the beneficial changes. These findings provide initial evidence indicating the efficacy of utilizing the gamification approach in corporate training for team-building and personal coping.","randomized_trial","wim"

Refeeding syndrome is a severe complication of refeeding in people with malnutrition, it includes a series of electrolyte disorders and clinical symptoms. Further research is warranted to determine whether refeeding syndrome prolongs the length of stay, and to verify the effect of different energy intakes during refeeding on the length of stay in people with malnutrition. Our review aimed to explore the effects of refeeding syndrome and initial calorie intake on the length of stay in patients with malnutrition. This study aids the understanding of clinical nutrition strategies to prevent and treat refeeding syndrome. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge, and two Chinese databases were systematically searched until October 2021. Controlled studies of patients' refeeding process with the outcome of length of stay were included. Effect sizes were expressed as 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and calculated using random-effects models. Eighteen studies involving 3868 participants were included in our review. The pooled length of stay of 2965 patients with refeeding syndrome in 11 studies was 25.55 (95% CI, 20.20-30.90) days. The pooled impact of refeeding syndrome on length of stay of 2634 patients in 10 studies was weighted mean difference (WMD) = 2.91 (95% CI, -0.18 - 6.00; P = 0.065) days. The pooled effect of higher calorie intake of 1234 patients in 8 studies was WMD = -3.04 (95% CI, -5.10 to -0.99, P = 0.003) days. The average length of stay in patients with refeeding syndrome was 25.55 days with a very high heterogeneity between studies. Refeeding syndrome affects the length of stay in part of, but not all, patients. In the present review, we concluded that higher initial calorie intake may help shorten the length of stay in patients with malnutrition. More well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to explore the effect of calorie intake during refeeding.","meta_analysis","wim"
"31",35959834,"Spinal versus conventional fine needle for ultrasound-guided thyroid nodule biopsy: a protocol for a randomised clinical trial.","Thyroid nodules are very common and constitute an increasing clinical challenge since improved imaging capabilities and utilisation have led to a higher number of incidental findings. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the standard diagnostic tool in the work-up of thyroid nodules suspected of malignancy. Non-diagnostic results remain common and require repeated FNAB, leading to increased costs and delayed treatment of thyroid diseases, including treatment of thyroid cancer. If cytological diagnoses cannot be achieved, surgery may be warranted, which may potentially lead to overtreatment. Optimisation of the FNAB procedure is therefore essential. Spinal needles with a stylet have been found to lead to fewer non-diagnostic results, but studies on the subject are few. This is a multicentre, two-arm, randomised clinical trial. Adults with thyroid nodules suspected of malignancy will be included consecutively. A total of 350 patients will be assigned randomly 1:1 to have a FNAB with either a spinal (25G) or a conventional (25G) needle. The primary outcome is the rate of diagnostic cytological samples according to the Bethesda system. Secondary outcomes are patient-experienced pain, complication rate and sensitivity and specificity. This trial will explore whether FNAB from thyroid nodules employing spinal needles compared with conventional fine needles improves diagnostic results, thereby providing evidence-based recommendations for a future choice of the FNAB needle. Secondary outcomes are patient-experienced pain, complication rate and sensitivity and specificity. This trial received funding from Erik and Susanna Olesens Fond.

Thirteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comprising 882 patients with OSAHS were selected. Compared to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the phlegm-resolving method of TCM combined with CPAP significantly more effectively improved the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and lowest oxygen saturation (LSaO2). While the treatment effect was better for a treatment duration of >6 weeks compared to that at ≤6 weeks, the difference was not statistically significant. Compared to health guidance alone, the combination of the phlegm-resolving method in TCM with health guidance showed significantly better efficacy in improving AHI, ESS, and LSaO2. In terms of reducing ESS and increasing LSaO2, the effect was better for treatment courses >6 weeks. When the AHI was reduced, a duration of ≤6 weeks showed more advantages; however, the difference was not significant. Only one study reported mild nausea in one participant in the treatment group at the initial stage of treatment; the remaining studies did not mention any side effects.

Investigation in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) in people living with obesity in which metabolic complications such as insulin resistance are yet to manifest is limited, and the mechanisms by which these processes are dysregulated are not well elucidated. Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFAs) have been shown to modulate the expression of genes associated with lipid accumulation and collagen deposition and reduce the number of inflammatory macrophages in adipose tissue from individuals with insulin resistance. Therefore, these lipids may have positive actions on obesity associated scWAT hypertrophy and inflammation. To evaluate obesity-associated tissue remodelling and responses to LC n-3 PUFAs, abdominal scWAT biopsies were collected from normal weight individuals and those living with obesity prior to and following 12-week intervention with marine LC n-3 PUFAs (1.1 g EPA + 0.8 g DHA daily). RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, and histochemical staining were used to assess remodelling- and inflammatory-associated gene expression, tissue morphology and macrophage infiltration. Obesity was associated with scWAT hypertrophy (P < 0.001), hypoxia, remodelling, and inflammatory macrophage infiltration (P = 0.023). Furthermore, we highlight the novel dysregulation of Wnt signalling in scWAT in non-insulin resistant obesity. LC n-3 PUFAs beneficially modulated the scWAT environment through downregulating the expression of genes associated with inflammatory and remodelling pathways (P <0.001), but there were altered outcomes in individuals living with obesity in comparison to normal weight individuals. Our data identify dysregulation of Wnt signalling, hypoxia, and hypertrophy, and enhanced macrophage infiltration in scWAT in non-insulin resistant obesity. LC n-3 PUFAs modulate some of these processes, especially in normal weight individuals which may be preventative and limit the development of restrictive and inflammatory scWAT in the development of obesity. We conclude that a higher dose or longer duration of LC n-3 PUFA intervention may be needed to reduce obesity-associated scWAT inflammation and promote tissue homeostasis. www.isrctn.com, identifier ISRCTN96712688.","randomized_trial","wim"

This study was a parallel, dual-arm, double-blind randomized controlled trial involving adult patients undergoing complex abdominal wall reconstruction with a biologic mesh at a quaternary care institution (2017-2020). Patients were randomly assigned to receive Permacol (cross-linked) compared with Strattice (not crosslinked). The main outcome measure was hernia recurrence at 1 or more years following the index repair. We included 94 patients randomized to undergo reconstruction with 1 of 2 commonly used biologic mesh products (mean age 59.4 yr, standard deviation [SD] 9.9; 51% female; body mass index 32.9, SD 6.8). We found no significant differences between the groups (patient comorbidities, hernia recurrence risk factors, hernia size or infection profiles). Hernia recurrence rates (15%) were similar between groups (median 783 days of follow up, interquartile range 119). We found there was significantly less of a need for a component separation technique in the Strattice group (69% v. 87%). All other secondary outcome measures were equivalent between study arms. Multivariate analysis identified hepatic transplantation (odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.33-4.41), active abdominal wall infection (OR 2.01, 95% CI 0.50-7.01), and more than 1 previous hernia repair (OR 2.68, 95% CI 0.41-5.99) as risk factors for subsequent hernia recurrence; however, there was no difference in recurrence factors between patient study groups. Given similar clinical performance between the 2 most commonly used biologic mesh products, the most cost effective mesh should be used in cost-conscious health care systems.","randomized_trial","wim"
"244",35965832,"Efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation for the induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a novel management strategy for ulcerative colitis (UC). However, its effectiveness remains controversial. This study sought to assess the effectiveness of FMT in the treatment of active UC by performing a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched the Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases from their inception to December 2021. RCTs that recruited patients with active UC and treated them with FMT, a placebo or a suitable comparator were included in the meta-analysis. PICOS: Patients, active UC; Intervention, FMT; Control, placebo or a suitable comparator; Outcomes, remission rate; Studies, RCTs. The risk of bias assessment was performed with Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (version 2). Meta-analyses of risk ratios (RRs) were performed to estimate the differences in remission rates and the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) between the FMT-treated and control patients. A total of 9 RCTs comprising 425 UC patients (213 FMT and 212 control) were included in the meta-analysis. The risk of bias was low in these RCTs. Clinical remission was observed in 86 of the 213 patients in the FMT groups and 47 of the 212 patients in the control groups [RR: 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.37, 2.47; P<0.0001]. Clinical remission was better when the FMT delivery route was via the lower gut, the FMT dose was >300 grams, and the fecal specimen from multiple donors. Endoscopic remission (observed in 7 RCTs) was achieved in 33 of the 195 FMT-treated patients compared to 17 of the 194 control patients (RR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.14, 3.31; P=0.01). SAEs were reported in 22 of the 213 FMT-treated patients but only 11 of the 212 control patients (RR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.03, 4.09; P=0.04). FMT is an effective treatment for patients with active UC. Significantly higher clinical and endoscopic remission rates are observed with FMT than with control treatments. However, FMT may cause a significantly higher incidence of SAEs than control treatments. Future studies should delineate the effects of donor selection, dosage, delivery route, and antibiotic pretreatment and should evaluate the safety profile of FMT.","meta_analysis","wim"

In this study, C57BL/6J male mice were fed with HFD combined with PPH gavage (50 mg/kg/d) for 16 weeks, and body weight was measured once a week. After that, serum, adipose, and liver tissues were collected for physiological and biochemical analyses. Our research indicated that PPH treatment alleviated obesity in HFD-fed mice. PPH alleviated fat accumulation in serum, liver, and adipose tissues. In addition, PPH activated the AMPK-HSL/ACC pathway in epididymal adipose tissue to reduce lipid accumulation. Moreover, PPH turned white adipose into brown and activated the PGC 1α-UCP 1-mitochondrial pathway in scapular adipose tissue to generate more heat. Interestingly, PPH regulated colonic microbiota homeostasis in obese mice, including significant elevation of Roseburia and Eubacterium and marked reduction of Helicobacter. Moreover, Spearman's correlation analysis demonstrated that regulation of gut microbiota can decrease lipid accumulation. In summary, our study illustrated that PPH possesses the potential to be developed as an anti-obesity agent.","rodent","wim"
"320",35966092,"Modified acupuncture therapy, long-term acupoint stimulation versus sham control for weight control: a multicenter, randomized controlled trial.","Long-term acupoint stimulation (LAS), also called embedding acupuncture, is a modified acupuncture technique. The preliminary results have demonstrated its efficacy in body-weight control. However, the low quality of available trials limited its application. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LAS in body-weight control by using a randomized, parallel, sham-controlled clinical trial design. This was a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial including 84 adult participants (18-60 years) with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 24 kg/m2 conducted in three general hospitals in Shanghai, China. Participants were equally assigned to receive LAS or sham LAS (SLAS) once per 10 days, eight times in total. After completion, an additional intervention with a 3-month follow-up period was set to examine the continued effect of LAS. The primary outcome was the change in body weight from baseline to treatment endpoint within the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Secondary outcomes contained changes in waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), lipid metabolism, and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues. From 14 May 2018 to 03 November 2019, 84 participants out of 201 screened individuals met the eligibility criteria, were randomized, and were analyzed (42 participants in each group). From baseline to treatment endpoint, the body-weight reduction in the LAS group was significantly larger than in the sham control (net difference: 1.57 kg, 95% CI: 0.29-2.86, p = 0.012). The superior weight reduction effect persisted in the follow-up period (net difference: 3.20 kg, 95% CI: 1.17-5.21, p = 0.001). LAS therapy also showed improvement in triglyceride and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) compared with sham control. One participant in the LAS group reported a slightly uncomfortable and tingling sensation after the additional intervention. No other adverse events (AEs) were documented. LAS, a modified acupuncture technique, is safe and effective in body-weight control. It could be used as an alternative choice to classical acupuncture for obesity management.

"346",35958733,"Sex Differences in Hypothalamic Changes and the Metabolic Response of TgAPP Mice to a High Fat Diet.","The propensity to develop neurodegenerative diseases is influenced by diverse factors including genetic background, sex, lifestyle, including dietary habits and being overweight, and age. Indeed, with aging, there is an increased incidence of obesity and neurodegenerative processes, both of which are associated with inflammatory responses, in a sex-specific manner. High fat diet (HFD) commonly leads to obesity and markedly affects metabolism, both peripherally and centrally. Here we analyzed the metabolic and inflammatory responses of middle-aged (11-12 months old) transgenic amyloid precursor protein (TgAPP) mice of both sexes to HFD for 18 weeks (starting at 7-8 months of age). We found clear sex differences with females gaining significantly more weight and fat mass than males, with a larger increase in circulating leptin levels and expression of inflammatory markers in visceral adipose tissue. Glycemia and insulin levels increased in HFD fed mice of both sexes, with TgAPP mice being more affected than wild type (WT) mice. In the hypothalamus, murine amyloid β (Aβ) levels were increased by HFD intake exclusively in males, reaching statistical significance in TgAPP males. On a low fat diet (LFD), TgAPP males had significantly lower mRNA levels of the anorexigenic neuropeptide proopiomelanocortin (POMC) than WT males, with HFD intake decreasing the expression of the orexigenic neuropeptides Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), especially in TgAPP mice. In females, HFD increased POMC mRNA levels but had no effect on AgRP or NPY mRNA levels, and with no effect on genotype. There was no effect of diet or genotype on the hypothalamic inflammatory markers analyzed or the astrogliosis marker glial acidic protein (GFAP); however, levels of the microglial marker Iba-1 increased selectively in male TgAPP mice. In summary, the response to HFD intake was significantly affected by sex, with fewer effects due to genotype. Hypothalamic inflammatory cytokine expression and astrogliosis were little affected by HFD in middle-aged mice, although in TgAPP males, which showed increased Aβ, there was microglial activation. Thus, excess intake of diets high in fat should be avoided because of its possible detrimental consequences.","rodent","wim"
"355",35958898,"Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide ameliorated diabetes mellitus-induced erectile dysfunction in rats by regulating fibrosis and the NOS/ERK/JNK pathway.","Diabetes mellitus-induced erectile dysfunction (DMED) is a frequent complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), with limited therapy at present. This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide (GLP) on DMED. DMED was induced in the experimental rats [male 12-week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats] by treatment with streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) and apomorphine (APO). Next, rats in the GLP low dose (GLP-L)/GLP high dose (GLP-H) groups were treated with GLP (100 or 400 mg/kg/d, respectively) for 8 weeks. Subsequently, erectile function was assessed by APO and electrostimulation of the cavernous nerve (CN). Serum or penile testosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) contents were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of oxidative stress indicators in the corpus cavernosum (CC) were measured by corresponding kits, and histological changes in the CC were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson staining. Additionally, the apoptosis index, caspase-3, caspase-9, and eNOS expression, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were also detected. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot assays were conducted to determine the NOS, TGF-β1 mRNA expression, ERK1/2, eNOS, JNK phosphorylation, and arginase II protein expression. The erectile function test revealed that erectile dysfunction (ED) was alleviated in the DMED rats following treatment with GLP. Moreover, GLP upregulated the T and cGMP content, improved the oxidative stress and histological injuries of CC, and also inhibited the apoptosis and MMP loss of penile tissues in DMED rats. Furthermore, GLP treatment enhanced the mRNA expression of NOS and TGF-β1 and suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, eNOS, and JNK, as well as the protein expression of arginase II in DMED rats. GLP ameliorated DMED by repairing the CC pathological damage and upregulating NOS expression and ERK/JNK phosphorylation, indicating that GLP may be a candidate drug for DMED therapy.","rodent","wim"

The analysis of the data established that selenium supplementation did not significantly affect TG level (WMD: -0.84 mg/dL; 95 % CI: -4.74, 3.05, p = 0.671), LDL-C (WMD: 0.86 mg/dL; 95 % CI: -1.21, 2.95, p = 0.416), and HDL-C (WMD: 0.3 mg/dL; 95 % CI: -0.66, 1.27, p = 0.535). however, there was a significant reduction in TC levels following selenium supplementation (WMD: -2.11 mg/dL; 95 % CI: -4.09, -0.13, p = 0.037). After subgroup analysis, when the baseline levels of LDL-C were < 130 mg/dL, selenium supplementation elicited a significant increase in LDL-C levels (WMD: 2.89 mg/dL; 95 % CI: 0.26, 5.51, p = 0.031). For BP, selenium supplementation significantly increased SBP (WMD: 2.02 mmHg; 95 % CI: 0.50, 3.55, p = 0.009), while it had no significant effect on DBP (WMD: 0.39 mmHg; 95 % CI: (-0.89, 1.68, p = 0.551)). Although our findings suggest selenium may have possible therapeutic effects in improving TC and VLDL, because of its negative effects on LDL and BP, selenium supplementation for cardiovascular protection should be recommended with caution.","meta_analysis","wim"

Patients with low JESREC score and small number of tissue eosinophils are diagnosed with non-ECRS (NECRS). Due to the 2 parameters of this diagnostic system, chronic rhinosinusitis is to be divided to 4 groups and some patients fall into the 2 groups other than ECRS and NECRS: probable ECRS (pECRS) and probable non-ECRS (pNECRS). We attempted to clarify clinical and histopathological similarities and differences, especially concerning major basic protein (MBP), among those groups. One hundred twenty-eight patients treated by endoscopic sinus surgery was included. Clinical characteristics were compared among each group, and immunohistological analysis for MBP was performed to 35 randomly selected patients. MBP deposition at intra mucosal epithelium was evaluated by semiquantificational approach. ECRS patients showed significantly higher comorbidity rate with allergic rhinitis (36 patients, 78.3%), asthma (36 patients, 78.3%) compared with other groups. Also, percentage of the patients complaining olfactory dysfunction (42 patients, 91.3%) was significantly higher (p < 0.001). Lund-Mackay score (mean, 14.5; 6-24) and recurrence rate (27 patients, 61.4%) was the highest in ECRS patients. Regarding pECRS, the number of patients with olfactory dysfunction (5 patients, 55.6%) was higher than pNECRS and NECRS groups. Also, comorbidity of asthma and percentage of blood eosinophils tended to be higher than those 2 groups. MBP score of pECRS group was significantly higher than NECRS (p < 0.05), despite of smaller tissue eosinophil counts. pECRS might share some characteristics with ECRS although tissue eosinophil count was significantly smaller compared with ECRS. The results of this study have shown that MBP score in pECRS nasal polyps was significantly higher than NECRS patients and close to ECRS. That might suggest that eosinophils have existed in the nasal polyps of pPECRS patients at some point before surgery.","human_intervention","wim"

A two-arm parallel, single-blind randomised controlled trial. A teaching hospital in Northern Taiwan. Pregnant women ≥ 20 years of age with a singleton pregnancy (12-24 weeks gestation) and their support partners were recruited. All women included in the study had a score of ≥ 7 points on a fear of childbirth visual analogue scale. The intervention group (n = 53) received an 8-week course in a childbirth education programme, which included (1) childbirth education using simulation-based learning that highlighted coping with labour pain and (2) instruction in mindfulness breathing, body scans, stretching, sitting meditation, and mindfulness walking. Support partners were invited to participate. The control group (n = 53) received the usual standard prenatal care. The primary outcome of fear of childbirth was assessed using the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire. The secondary outcomes of anxiety, depression, and dispositional mindfulness were assessed with the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale, and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, respectively. Repeated data were collected at baseline, 36 weeks gestation, and 1 week postpartum. Ninety-one mothers completed the study, with a mean age of 33.9 years (SD = 4.4), and most were primipara (n = 83). The baseline measurements did not differ between the groups. Compared with the control group, there were significant differences in all measures from baseline for the intervention group: the scores were significantly lower for fear of childbirth (mean difference (MD) =-14.8 ∼ -23.7, p < .01), symptoms of anxiety (MD =-7.4 ∼ -6.4, p < .01), and depression (MD =-3.7 ∼ -3.5, p < .01); the levels of dispositional mindfulness were significantly higher (MD =4.9 ∼ 5.7, p < .01) at 36 weeks gestation, and 1 week postpartum. The 8-week integrated childbirth education intervention was effective in reducing the fear of childbirth in pregnant women. The mindfulness techniques were easily learnt and applied by the participants. Using these techniques during pregnancy and labour enhanced participants' mental health and coping. The integrated childbirth education which includes pregnant women and their support partners could be easily taught by midwives in other contexts.","randomized_trial","wim"

The pooled hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to evaluate its prognosis in human cancers. Also, the pooled odd ratios and the relevant 95% CIs were computed to assess the association of miR-193b levels and clinicopathological characteristics of cancer patients. In overall analysis, a significant association was identified between miR-193b levels and overall survival (HR =0.77, 95% CI: 0.64-0.92), but this association was not significant in the random pooling model. Then, two outliers were identified through sensitivity analysis. After removing outliers, the significant association was identified with random pooling model (HR =0.45, 95% CI: 0.30-0.69).

Lower expression of miR-193b was found to be related to larger tumor size and the potential of lymph node metastasis and distance metastasis. We have demonstrated that miR-193b serves as an ideal biomarker in the cancer prognosis for Asian patients, and the low expression levels of miR-193b is significantly associated with poor overall survival rates in various human malignancies. Moreover, the patients with lower miR-193b tend to develop the cancers with higher potential of metastasis.","meta_analysis","wim"

Hysteroscopic polypectomy remains the gold standard for the treatment of endometrial polyps. As alternative treatments, few drugs have been evaluated to date. To investigate the possible effect of misoprostol on the elimination of endometrial polyps. In this clinical trial we examined 30 infertile women whose endometrial polyps were confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound with saline injection. All women were administered 400 mg of misoprostol: 200 mg orally and 200 vaginally. 8 hr later, sonography with saline injection was performed again and all women were examined for the presence or absence of endometrial polyps. Finally, the diagnosis was confirmed for all women using hysteroscopy. The main outcome of this study was the elimination of endometrial polyps after misoprostol administration. The average size of the endometrial polyps was 14.33 ± 4.26 mm, with a range of 7-22 mm. After misoprostol administration, in 12 out of the 30 women who had shown endometrial polyps in the initial examination, no polyp was found. At follow-up it was found that the smallest endometrial polyp that had been eliminated was 8 mm and the largest was 22 mm.

New combinations of novel agents are needed to improve the prognosis of patients with t (11;14) MM. As a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), palbociclib (PAL) has been used to treat various malignancies, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and so on. However, the effects of PAL on MM remain unclear, and thus, further investigations are warranted. Two t (11;14) MM cell lines, U266 and KMS27, were used in this study. The cell viability and cell cycle were detected to evaluate the anti-myeloma effect of the combination of pralatrexate (PTX) and methotrexate (MTX) with PAL. Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid and mouse models were built to verify the effect of the combination treatment. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2 (MCM2), Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 3 (MCM3), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). It was observed that PAL had obvious anticancer effects on U266 and KMS27 cells, which had synergistic effects together with PTX and MTX. Importantly, it was found that PAL could promote cell cycle genes including MCM2 and MCM3, and increase the number of MM cells in the G1 phase. Moreover, PAL reduced the expression level of DHFR and exerted its anticancer effects on MM cells by targeting DHFR. It was also determined that PAL exerted anticancer effects on MM in the spheroid and mouse models. PAL exerted obvious anticancer effects on t (11;14) MM cells, which had synergistic effects together with PTX and MTX. PAL could promote cell cycle genes and the G1 phase of MM cells. Moreover, PAL reduced the expression level of DHFR and exerted its anticancer effects on t (11;14) MM cells by targeting DHFR.","human_intervention","wim"
"562",35958622,"The protective capability of Hedyotis diffusa Willd on lupus nephritis by attenuating the IL-17 expression in MRL/lpr mice.","Lupus nephritis (LN), the most severe organ manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is generally treated with glucocorticoids (GC) in clinical practice, leading to drug resistance and adverse effects in the long term. Fortunately, the combination of GC and traditional Chinese medical prescriptions can attenuate the adverse effects and improve therapeutic efficiency. Hedyotis diffusa Willd (HDW) is one of the most commonly used herbal compounds for LN treatment, which exhibits heat-clearing and detoxification effects. However, the underlying pharmacological mechanism remains unclear. The present study identified the chemical compounds in HDW extract with UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. A total of 49 components were identified in the HDW extract, and the IL-17 signaling pathway was highly enriched by network pharmacological analysis. MRL/lpr model mice, reflecting the spontaneous development of LN, were used to evaluate the protective activity and investigate the underlying mechanism of the combination treatment. The white blood cell content (WBC), including lymphocytes and neutrophils, cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-a), and various autoantibodies (ANA, ab-dsDNA, ab-snRNP/sm) in the blood of MRL/lpr mice were significantly improved by the intragastric administration of HDW. Additionally, the expression of STAT3, IL-17, Ly6G, and MPO in the kidney and neutrophil NETosis were ameliorated with HDW treatment. The pathological and morphological analysis suggested that HDW application could reduce urinary protein levels and inflammatory cell infiltration and inhibit glomerular interstitial cell proliferation. Hence, HDW might ameliorate lupus nephritis by inhibiting IL-6 secretion and STAT3-induced IL-17 expression. The active compounds in HDW were predictively selected with computational methods. The docking affinity of asiatic acid, neoandrographolide to IL-6, glycyrrhetinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, and wilforlide A to STAT3 are extremely high. In conclusion, the IL-6 and STAT3/IL-17signaling pathways could be critical regulative targets of HDW on LN.","rodent","wim"
"671",35958042,"Cupid's quiver: Integrating sensory cues in rodent mating systems.","In many animal species, males and females exploit different mating strategies, display sex-typical behaviors, and use distinct systems to recognize ethologically relevant cues. Mate selection thus requires mutual recognition across diverse social interactions based on distinct sensory signals. These sex differences in courtship and mating behaviors correspond to differences in sensory systems and downstream neural substrates engaged to recognize and respond to courtship signals. In many rodents, males tend to rely heavily on volatile olfactory and pheromone cues, while females appear to be guided more by a combination of these chemosensory signals with acoustic cues in the form of ultrasonic vocalizations. The mechanisms by which chemical and acoustic cues are integrated to control behavior are understudied in mating but are known to be important in the control of maternal behaviors. Socially monogamous species constitute a behaviorally distinct group of rodents. In these species, anatomic differences between males and females outside the nervous system are less prominent than in species with non-monogamous mating systems, and both sexes engage in more symmetric social behaviors and form attachments. Nevertheless, despite the apparent similarities in behaviors displayed by monogamous males and females, the circuitry supporting social, mating, and attachment behaviors in these species is increasingly thought to differ between the sexes. Sex differences in sensory modalities most important for mate recognition in across species are of particular interest and present a wealth of questions yet to be answered. Here, we discuss how distinct sensory cues may be integrated to drive social and attachment behaviors in rodents, and the differing roles of specific sensory systems in eliciting displays of behavior by females or males.","rodent","wim"

We included six studies with 43330 participants, of which 21147 and 22183 received calciumbased phosphate binders and sevelamer, respectively. In the analysis of unadjusted data, sevelamer could lower cardiovascular mortality. When adjusted HRs was pooled, the cardiovascular mortality did not differ significantly in the sevelamer and calcium-based phosphate binders groups. Additionally, the all-cause mortality rate in sevelamer group was different from that in calcium-based phosphate binders group. However, sevelamer could not lower all-cause mortality in terms of the adjusted data. No significant difference was found in calcium and phosphorus between calcium-based phosphate binders and sevalmer. Sensitivity analysis showed that partial results of the study were inconsistent. There was no difference in the effect of sevelamer and calciumbased phosphate binders on the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with hemodialysis, after adjusting confounders.

"751",35966681,"Effect of aging on acute pancreatitis through gut microbiota.","Compared to younger people, older people have a higher risk and poorer prognosis of acute pancreatitis, but the effect of gut microbiota on acute pancreatitis is still unknown. We aim to investigate the effect of aging gut microbiota on acute pancreatitis and explore the potential mechanism of this phenomenon. Eighteen fecal samples from healthy adult participants, including nine older and nine younger adults were collected. C57BL/6 mice were treated with antibiotics for fecal microbiota transplantation from older and younger participants. Acute pancreatitis was induced by cerulein and lipopolysaccharide in these mice. The effect of the aged gut microbiota was further tested via antibiotic treatment before or after acute pancreatitis induction. The gut microbiota of older and younger adults differed greatly. Aged gut microbiota exacerbated acute pancreatitis during both the early and recovery stages. At the same time, the mRNA expression of multiple antimicrobial peptides in the pancreas and ileum declined in the older group. Antibiotic treatment before acute pancreatitis could remove the effect of aging gut microbiota, but antibiotic treatment after acute pancreatitis could not. Aging can affect acute pancreatitis through gut microbiota which characterizes the deletion of multiple types of non-dominant species. This change in gut microbiota may potentially regulate antimicrobial peptides in the early and recovery stages. The level of antimicrobial peptides has negative correlations with a more severe phenotype.","rodent","wim"

Thoracic spinal cord hemisection injuries were performed on adult female Kunming mice. The mice with spinal cord injury (SCI) were injected with hUC-MSCs suspended in normal saline, while the control mice received an equal volume of normal saline. The histological HE staining and Nissl staining were performed 4 and 8 weeks after hUC-MSC transplantation in SCI mice. The Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale was used to assess functional recovery after SCI. Western blotting was performed to determine the protein expressions. hUC-MSCs transplantation decreased cavitation and tissue loss and increased the number of Nissl bodies in the damaged areas of the spinal cord after 4 and 8 weeks. The BBB locomotor performance of the transplanted mice was significantly improved (P<0.01). The wet weight of the injured side of the gastrocnemius muscle was significantly higher in the transplant group than that in the control group. Western blotting showed that TUJ1 and Olig2 expressions were significantly higher in hUC-MSC-grafted mice than those in vehicle controls. Three days after hUC-MSC transplantation, the expressions of TNF-α and NF-κB were higher in MSC-grafted mice than those in vehicle controls. However, 4 weeks after stem cell transplantation, the expressions of these two factors decreased in hUC-MSC-grafted mice compared with those in the vehicle controls. At 8 weeks after hUC-MSC transplantation, the expression of PTBP-1 was decreased in hUC-MSC-grafted mice compared with that in vehicle controls. hUC-MSC transplantation can protect neuron survival, promote myelin repair, and control glial scar formation in SCI mice.","rodent","wim"

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion could reduce the incidence of CPSP in patients with breast cancer. Female patients undergoing radical breast cancer surgery were randomly assigned to the 2% lidocaine group (L) and the control group (S). group L received an intravenous infusion of 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine 10 minutes prior to induction, followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg/h until the end of surgery. The control group received an equal amount of saline. The primary outcome was the incidence of CPSP at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included VAS pain scores and frequency of remedial analgesia within 24 hours postoperatively; incidence of CPSP at 1 and 6 months; and scores on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Simplified McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), and Neuropathic Pain Score (DN-4) at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively.

Interestingly, recent studies indicate light pollution is a novel environmental risk factor for chronic kidney disease. However, the impact of light pollution on obesity-related kidney disease remains largely unknown, with its underlying mechanism insufficiently explained. Renal hypoxia induced factor 1α (HIF1α) is critical in the development of glomerulosclerosis and renal fibrosis. The present study explored effects of constant light exposure on high fat diet (HFD) -induced renal injury and its association with HIF1α signal pathway. Thirty-two male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups according to diet (HFD or normal chow diet) and light cycles (light/dark or constant light). After 16 weeks treatment, rats were sacrificed and pathophysiological assessments were performed. In normal chow fed rats, constant light exposure led to glucose abnormalities and dyslipidemia. In HFD fed rats, constant light exposure exacerbated obesity, glucose abnormalities, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, renal functional decline, proteinuria, glomerulomegaly, renal inflammation and fibrosis. And, constant light exposure caused an increase in HIF1α and a decrease in prolyl hydroxylase domain 1 (PHD1) and PHD2 expression in kidneys of HFD-fed rats. Then, we demonstrated that BMAL1 bound directly to the promoters of PHD1 in mouse podocyte clone 5 cell line (MPC5) by ChIP assays. In conclusion, chronic constant light exposure aggravates HFD-induced renal injuries in rats, and it is associated with activation of HIF1α signal pathway.","rodent","wim"

In this study, we used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to construct a knockout mouse model of Aldh4a1 for the first time to explore the effect of this gene on the reproduction of male mice. The results showed that compared with WT male mice, Aldh4a1^(-/-) male mice were fertile, had normal spermatogenesis but defect in sperm maturation in the epididymis documented by impaired motility, increased morphological abnormalities and increased spontaneous acrosome reaction.

"871",35965600,"A protocol for rapid construction of senescent cells.","Aging may be the largest factor for a variety of chronic diseases that influence survival, independence, and wellbeing. Evidence suggests that aging could be thought of as the modifiable risk factor to delay or alleviate age-related conditions as a group by regulating essential aging mechanisms. One such mechanism is cellular senescence, which is a special form of most cells that are present as permanent cell cycle arrest, apoptosis resistance, expression of anti-proliferative molecules, acquisition of pro-inflammatory, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and others. Most cells cultured in vitro or in vivo may undergo cellular senescence after accruing a set number of cell divisions or provoked by excessive endogenous and exogenous stress or damage. Senescent cells occur throughout life and play a vital role in various physiological and pathological processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing, host immunity, and tumor suppression. In contrast to the beneficial senescent processes, the accumulation of senescent also has deleterious effects. These non-proliferating cells lead to the decrease of regenerative potential or functions of tissues, inflammation, and other aging-associated diseases because of the change of tissue microenvironment with the acquisition of SASP. While it is understood that age-related diseases occur at the cellular level from the cellular senescence, the mechanisms of cellular senescence in age-related disease progression remain largely unknown. Simplified and rapid models such as in vitro models of the cellular senescence are critically needed to deconvolute mechanisms of age-related diseases. Here, we obtained replicative senescent L02 hepatocytes by culturing the cells for 20 weeks. Then, the conditioned medium containing supernatant from replicative senescent L02 hepatocytes was used to induce cellular senescence, which could rapidly induce hepatocytes into senescence. In addition, different methods were used to validate senescence, including senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), the rate of DNA synthesis using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay, and senescence-related proteins. At last, we provide example results and discuss further applications of the protocol.","protocol","wim"

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IM253 treatment on inflammation and antioxidant defense in the cerebral corpus callosum of the C57BL/6 mouse, an Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and as a most commonly used experimental model of MS. During the course of study, clinical evaluation was performed and eventually histological and molecular analysis on brain samples was carried out. Gene expression analyses demonstrated that treatment with IM253 causes a significant reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine coding genes including IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17 as well as a significant increase in the expression of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant enzyme coding genes including TGF-β, GPX-1, and Cat. Histological studies also show that treatment with IM253 can reduce demyelination and inflammation (p<0.001). In addition, the GPX-1 enzyme activity evaluation also demonstrated that total antioxidant capacity was significantly higher in IM253 treated mice (p<0.001).

Great attention has been given to the impact of damp-heat syndrome on tumorigenesis and progression, but less attention has been given to damp-heat modeling per se. Studying PC in a proper damp-heat syndrome animal model can recapitulate the actual pathological process and contribute to treatment strategy improvement. Here, an optimized damp-heat syndrome mouse model was established based on our prior experience. The Fibonacci method was applied to determine the maximum tolerated dosage of alcohol for mice. Damp-heat syndrome modeling with the old and new methods was performed in parallel of comparative study about general appearance, food intake, water consumption and survival. Major organs, including the liver, kidneys, lungs, pancreas, spleen, intestines and testes, were collected for histological evaluation. Complete blood counts and biochemical tests were conducted to characterize changes in blood circulation. PC cells were subcutaneously inoculated into mice with damp-heat syndrome to explore the impact of damp-heat syndrome on PC growth. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson staining and immunohistochemistry were performed for pathological evaluation. A chemokine microarray was applied to screen the cytokines mediating the proliferation-promoting effects of damp-heat syndrome, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were conducted for results validation. The new modeling method has the advantages of mouse-friendly features, easily accessible materials, simple operation, and good stability. More importantly, a set of systematic indicators was proposed for model evaluation. The new modeling method verified the pancreatic tumor-promoting role of damp-heat syndrome. Damp-heat syndrome induced the proliferation of cancer-associated fibroblasts and promoted desmoplasia. In addition, circulating and tumor-located chemokine levels were altered by damp-heat syndrome, characterized by tumor promotion and immune suppression.

Systemic distribution of ZnO NPs, developmental performance, sperm parameters, reproductive performance, histopathological examination, and sex hormone levels were determined scheduled in the experimental rats and their male offspring. The comparative in vitro cytotoxicity of the ZnO NPs was determined among C18-4, TM3, and TM4 cells. The toxicity exerted by ZnO NPs on germ cells in vitro and the effects on the expression of cytoskeleton and blood-testis barrier (BTB)-related proteins were also determined. After oral gavage, ZnO NPs mainly accumulated in the liver and testes of rats; 350 mg/kg ZnO NPs adversely affected the epididymal weight, sperm motility, and hormone levels but did not affect the fertility of rats. In addition, 350 mg/kg ZnO NPs significantly reduced the reproductive and developmental performance of offspring male rats. Testicular histopathological and electron microscopic ultrastructure examinations showed more significant abnormal structural changes than those observed in parental rats. The results of in vitro cell experiments further showed that ZnO NPs exerted cytotoxic effects on germ cells, and led to DNA damage, nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton alterations, and could regulate actin changes through changes in LC3B. It is possible that ZnO NPs act directly on TM4 cells by penetrating the BTB, causing damage to the cytoskeleton and disrupting the dynamic balance of the BTB, thereby destroying the microenvironment necessary for spermatogenesis, which may lead to poor reproduction in rats.","rodent","wim"

Obese mice, high fat diet-fed mice and free fatty acid-stimulated cells were used for GAS5 expression detection. GAS5 overexpression or knockdown models were established to elucidate the regulatory function of GAS5 in de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and mitochondrial function. Bioinformatic analyses and dual luciferase assays were used to investigate the interaction between GAS5, miR-26a-5p and phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4B. The involvement of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway was evaluated using H89 and forskolin treatment. GAS5 was activated in vitro and in vivo fatty liver models. Knockdown of GAS5 reduced lipid droplet accumulation, DNL associated enzymes and preserved mitochondrial function, while GAS5 overexpression exacerbated hepatic lipid accumulation. Mechanistically, GAS5 sponged miR-26a-5p to increase PDE4B expression and subsequently modulated DNL and mitochondrial function via the cAMP/CREB pathway. Downregulation of GAS5 can activate the cAMP/CREB pathway through miR-26a-5p/PDE4B axis to mitigate hepatic lipid accumulation.

Here, the present study aims to investigate whether oroxylin A possess antidepressant-like actions using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and chronic restraint stress (CRS) models of depression, forced swim test, tail suspension test, open field test, sucrose preference test, western blotting, immunofluorescence and viral-mediated gene interference. Our results revealed that treatment of oroxylin A fully prevented both the CUMS-induced and CRS-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice. Moreover, the protecting effects of oroxylin A against CUMS and CRS on mice behaviors were accompanied with a significant enhancement on the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated tyrosine kinase B (pTrkB), phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (pCREB) and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Furthermore, genetic knockdown of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus remarkably abolished the antidepressant-like efficacy of oroxylin A in both the CUMS and CRS models of depression, proving that the hippocampal BDNF-TrkB system participates in the antidepressant mechanism of oroxylin A.

Secondly, we confirmed plasma-induced apoptosis in the HT29 and A549 cells using the AO/EB staining coupled with flow cytometry, and verified the production of apoptosis-related proteins, such as cytochrome c, PARP, cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9, Bcl-2 and Bax, using western blotting. Finally, the aforementioned in vitro results were tested in vivo using cell-derived xenograft mouse models, and the anticancer effect was confirmed and attributed to CAP-mediated apoptosis. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expression of cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP and Bax were upregulated whereas that of Bcl-2 downregulated after CAP treatment. These findings collectively suggest that the activation of the mitochondrial pathway is involved during CAPPZ2-induced apoptosis of human colon and lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.","rodent","wim"
"1074",35959428,"The effects of mango leaf extract during adolescence and adulthood in a rat model of schizophrenia.","There is evidence that in schizophrenia, imbalances in inflammatory and oxidative processes occur during pregnancy and in the early postnatal period, generating interest in the potential therapeutic efficacy of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds. Mangiferin is a polyphenolic compound abundant in the leaves of Mangifera indica L. that has robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential candidate for preventive or co-adjuvant therapy in schizophrenia. Hence, this study set-out to evaluate the effect of mango leaf extract (MLE) in a model of schizophrenia based on maternal immune activation, in which Poly I:C (4 mg/kg) is administered intravenously to pregnant rats. Young adult (postnatal day 60-70) or adolescent (postnatal day 35-49) male offspring received MLE (50 mg/kg of mangiferin) daily, and the effects of MLE in adolescence were compared to those of risperidone, assessing behavior, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and oxidative/inflammatory and antioxidant mediators in the adult offspring. MLE treatment in adulthood reversed the deficit in prepulse inhibition (PPI) but it failed to attenuate the sensitivity to amphetamine and the deficit in novel object recognition (NOR) induced. By contrast, adolescent MLE treatment prevented the sensorimotor gating deficit in the PPI test, producing an effect similar to that of risperidone. This MLE treatment also produced a reduction in grooming behavior, but it had no effect on anxiety or novel object recognition memory. MRI studies revealed that adolescent MLE administration partially counteracted the cortical shrinkage, and cerebellum and ventricle enlargement. In addition, MLE administration in adolescence reduced iNOS mediated inflammatory activation and it promoted the expression of biomarkers of compensatory antioxidant activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as witnessed through the reduction of Keap1 and the accumulation of NRF2 and HO1. Together, these findings suggest that MLE might be an alternative therapeutic or preventive add-on strategy to improve the clinical expression of schizophrenia in adulthood, while also modifying the time course of this disease at earlier stages in populations at high-risk.","rodent","wim"

Information about the effectiveness of VD supplementation in children is scarce. To assess the efficacy and safety of VD supplementation compared to the standard of care in hospitalized children with COVID-19. An open-label randomized controlled single-blind clinical trial was carried out. We included patients from 1 month to 17 years, with moderate COVID-19, who required hospitalization and supplemental oxygen. They were randomized into two groups: the VD group, which received doses of 1,000 (children < 1 year) or 2,000 IU/day (from 1 to 17 years) and the group without VD (control). The outcome variables were the progression of oxygen requirement, the development of complications, and death. For comparison between groups, we used the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) and the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated. p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. From 24 March 2020 to 31 March 2021, 87 patients were eligible to participate in the trial; 45 patients were randomized: 20 to the VD group and 25 to the control group. There was no difference in general characteristics at baseline, including serum VD levels (median 13.8 ng/ml in the VD group and 11.4 ng/ml in the control group). 2/20 (10%) in the VD group vs. 9/25 (36%) in the control group progressed to a superior ventilation modality (p = 0.10); one patient in the VD group died (5%) compared to 6 (24%) patients in the control group (p = 0.23). ARR was 26% (95% CI 8.8 to 60.2%) and NNT was 3 (2 to 11) for progression and ARR was 19% (95% CI -3.9 to 42.8%) and NNT was 6 (2 to 26) for death. None of the patients receiving VD had adverse effects. The trial was stopped for ethical reasons; since after receiving the results of the basal VD values, none of the patients had normal levels. In this trial, VD supplementation in pediatric patients seems to decrease the risk of COVID-19 progression and death. More studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Previous studies have shown that cell-free fat extract (CEFFE) is a kind of bioactive extraction from adipose tissues and exhibits a potent anti-inflammatory effect on wound healing and inflammatory diseases. However, the potential role of CEFFE in sepsis remains unclear. CEFFE was extracted from healthy donors and was intraperitoneally injected into septic mice. The septic mice models were constructed using lipopolysaccharide (LPS), E. coli, and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The survival of septic mice was detected for 96 h and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the differences of survival rates. Lung tissues that were collected from septic mice were subjected to HE staining to evaluate the extent of lung injury, and the mice serum was obtained for inflammasome-related cytokines detection. Moreover, peritoneal macrophages were extracted from C57 mice and treated with CEFFE and/or inflammasome activators. The level of IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-α was detected by ELISA, and the activation of NLRP3 were evaluated by Western Blot. Total mtDNA and mitochondrial permeability transition pore were determined to explore the mitochondrial dysfunction in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome with or without CEFEE. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed to confirm the mechanism of NLRP3 activation induced by CEFFE. CEFFE significantly improved the survival of sepsis mice and alleviate sepsis-induced lung injury. Moreover, CEFFE significantly decreased the level of inflammasome-cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18) but not the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. Moreover, CEFFE markedly suppressed the canonical activation of NLRP3 inflammasome without affecting inflammasomes NLRC4 and AIM2. Additionally, the non-canonical activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was significantly inhibited by CEFFE. CEFFE treatment attenuated the mtDNA outflow and the increase of mitochondrial permeability induced by both canonical and non-canonical pathway of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The results of Co-IP assays revealed that CEFFE remarkably attenuated the oligomerization of ASC and inhibited the association between NLRP3 and ASC. Our study revealed that CEFFE could significantly alleviate sepsis-related injuries possibly by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. CEFFE was a promising approach for sepsis treatment.","rodent","wim"

Oligodendrocyte (OL) dysfunction is associated with the pathogenesis of depression and the promotion of hippocampal oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination could be a novel therapeutic strategy for ameliorating depressive behaviors. Recent studies have shown that activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) by GW3965 improves depressive phenotypes, but the effects of GW3965 on OL function and myelination in the hippocampus of depression remain relatively unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of GW3965 on mature OL in the hippocampus and on the myelin sheaths of mice subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Behavioral tests were performed to assess depressive behaviors. Then, the number of mature OLs (CC1+) in each hippocampal subregion was precisely quantified with immunohistochemical and stereological methods, and the density of newborn mature OLs (BrdU+/Olig2+/CC1+ cells) in each hippocampal subregion was quantified with immunofluorescence. In addition, myelin basic protein (MBP) staining intensity in the cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) region was assessed by using immunofluorescence. We found that both the number of CC1+ OLs and the density of BrdU+/Olig2+/CC1+ cells were obviously decreased in each hippocampal subregion of mice subjected to CUS, and 4 weeks of GW3965 treatment reversed these effects only in the CA3 region. Furthermore, the decreased MBP expression in the CA3 region of mice subjected to CUS was ameliorated by GW3965 treatment. Collectively, these results suggested that improvement of OL maturation and enhancement of myelination may be structural mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of LXR agonists.","rodent","wim"

To compare in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle success rates of women with endometriosis who were treated with letrozole + gonadotropin (LA) vs. placebo + gonadotropin (PA). This double-blind, randomized clinical trial study was conducted with 94 infertile women with endometriosis (47 in the LA group and 47 in the PA group) who were candidates for IVF, from April-June 2021. For all participants, the long agonist protocol was applied. In both groups, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist was prescribed in the mid-luteal stage and from the third day of the cycle, and gonadotropin was started and its doses were regulated based on the patient's age, serum anti-Mullerian hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone.

In recent years, the incidence of DHAV-3 subtype has been increasing in China, leading to great economic losses to the duck-breeding industry. We investigated the incidence and mortality rates of DHAV in ducks and analysed the seroprevalence of DHAV in mainland China, by meta-analysis. Twenty-six studies published between 2009 and 2021 were retrieved, with a total of 689,549 cases from 14 provinces. Using the DerSimonian-Laird model, DHAV prevalence was estimated with the variance-stabilizing double arcsine transformation. The incidence of DHAV in mainland China was 12 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3-20 %), and the mortality rate was 11 % (95 % CI: 2-19 %), suggesting that the virus was highly virulent and mortality was high. Time analysis showed that DHAV incidence decreased over time. The typing survey showed that strains of DHAV-1 serotype accounted for 38 % (95 % CI: 21-56 %) and strains of DHAV-3 serotype accounted for 49 % (95 % CI: 31-68%) of the tested samples. The decline in the detection rate of DHAV-1 may be due to the widespread use of the DHAV-1 vaccine, which has effectively controlled the DHAV-1 serotype virus. The DHAV-3 vaccine has been on the market for a short time and has no cross protection with DHAV-1, so DHAV-3 accounted for a high proportion of the tested samples. Subgroup analysis of the detection methods showed little difference between PCR and other detection methods.","meta_analysis","wim"

However, whether the underlying mechanisms are associated with the regulation of the gut microbiota remain unknown. To explore alterations of the gut microbiota related to folic acid and zinc treatment in rats with hyperuricemia in our study. A hyperuricemic rat model was established with a high-purine diet. The effects of folic acid and zinc on uric acid levels were evaluated. Alterations of the gut microbiota related to hyperuricemia and the treatments were evaluated by sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq system. The results demonstrated that uric acid levels dropped observably, and the activities of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) were downregulated after folic acid or zinc intervention. 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based gut microbiota analysis revealed that folic acid and zinc enhanced the abundance of probiotic bacteria and reduced that of pathogenic bacteria, thus improving intestinal barrier function. PICRUST analysis indicated that folic acid and zinc restored gut microbiota metabolism. These findings indicate that folic acid and zinc ameliorate hyperuricemia by inhibiting uric acid biosynthesis and stimulating uric acid excretion by modulating the gut microbiota. Thus, folic acid and zinc may be new and safe therapeutic agents to improve hyperuricemia.","rodent","wim"

On the contrary, moderate low doses of UVB irradiation are shown to be essential and beneficial to human health, including a tumor-suppressive effect. However, the mechanism by which low levels of UVB suppress tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, using tumor-bearing mouse models, we show that moderate low repetitive UVB irradiation increases the percentage of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CD103+ conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s), while it decreases the number of immunosuppressive, M2-like macrophages in the tumors. Finally, in mice, deletion of Batf3, a transcription factor critical for the development of conventional dendritic cells, including the CD103+ cDC1s, showed increased tumor growth in both sham- and UVB-irradiated mice. Our findings demonstrate that moderate low UVB irradiation inhibits M2-like tumor-associated macrophages, increases CD103+ cDC1s and promotes antitumor immunity in mice with an established tumor.","rodent","wim"

Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect DYNLT3 protein expression in cervical cancer tissues. Cell proliferation and apoptosis rates and invasiveness and migratory capacities were determined by CCK-8 assays, BrdU staining assays and colony formation assays, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), wound healing assays, and Transwell invasion assays of cervical cancer cells after DYNLT3 modulation. The expression levels of Wnt signaling pathway- and EMT-related proteins were examined by Western blotting. Furthermore, the effects of DYNLT3 on the tumorigenicity and metastasis of cervical cancer in nude mice were analyzed by performing immunohistochemistry, and we found that the expression level of the DYNLT3 protein was higher in human normal cervical tissues than in cervical cancer tissues. Overexpression of DYNLT3 obviously attenuated the proliferation, migration and invasion of CaSki and SiHa cells, and promoted cell apoptosis. Upregulation of DYNLT3 expression markedly decreased the expression of Wnt signaling pathway-related proteins (Dvl2, Dvl3, p-LRP6, Wnt3a, Wnt5a/b, Naked1, Naked2, β-catenin and C-Myc) and EMT-related proteins (N-cadherin, SOX2, OCT4, vimentin and Snail), and increased the expression of E-cadherin and Axin1. However, the opposite results were observed after down-regulation of DYNLT3 expression. Up-regulation of DYNLT3 expression significantly inhibited tumor growth in a nude mouse model, while downregulation of DYNLT3 showed the opposite results. In addition, the major metastatic site of cervical cancer cells in mice was the lung, and downregulation of DYNLT3 expression increased cancer metastasis in vivo. DYNLT3 exerted inhibitory effects on cervical cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration and invasion, promoting cell apoptosis in vitro, and inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, possibly by suppressing the Wnt signaling pathway and the EMT.","rodent","wim"

However, the overall performance of various DLMs for detecting IAs has not been evaluated. We aimed at exploring the performance of DLMs in the detection of IAs and measuring the effect of DLMs in assisting clinicians. A diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis using a mixed-effect binary regression model was performed to estimate accuracy in patient-level and lesion-level. Moreover, the effect in assisting clinicians was measured by a random-effect meta-analysis. Twenty cohort studies including a total of 17 DLMs were assessed eligible in the present study. We summarized that DLMs had both high sensitivity (0.92, 95 % CI: 0.85 to 0.96) and specificity (0.96, 95 % CI: 0.94 to 0.97) in the detection of IAs in patient-level. In lesion-level, we also found a high summary sensitivity of 0.92 (95 % CI: 0.87 to 0.95). Moreover, assisted by DLMs, the sensitivity of clinicians became higher (Risk ratio: 1.09, P-value: 0.0006), with no effect on the specificity in diagnosis (Risk ratio: 0.99, P-value: 0.53). The reading time was reduced by the assistance of the deep learning model. (Mean difference: -7.37, P-value: 0.0077) CONCLUSIONS: DLMs have the competence of detecting IAs accurately.

It was previously confirmed that JDYZF can inhibit the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins in the hippocampus of AD rats and inhibit gut inflammation in AD rats. Therefore, it is hypothesized that JDYZF has a regulatory effect on the gut microbiota. In this study, an AD rat model was prepared by bilateral hippocampal injection of Aβ 25-35 and AD rats received high, medium, and low doses of JDYZF orally for 8 weeks. The body weights of the AD rats were observed to assess the effect of JDYZF. The 16S rRNA sequencing technique was used to study the regulation of the gut microbiota by JDYZF in AD rats. Immunohistochemical staining was used to observe the expression levels of Caspase-1 and Caspase-11 in the hippocampus. JDYZF reduced body weight in AD rats, and this effect may be related to JDYZF regulating body-weight-related gut microbes. The 16S rRNA analysis showed that JDYZF increased the diversity of the gut microbiota in AD rats. At the phylum level, JDYZF increased the abundances of Bacteroidota and Actinobacteriota and decreased the abundances of Firmicutes, Campilobacterota, and Desulfobacterota. At the genus level, the abundances of Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, and Blautia were increased and the abundances of Lachnospiraceae-NK4A136-group, Anaerobiospirillum, Turicibacter, Oscillibacter, Desulfovibrio, Helicobacter, and Intestinimonas were decreased.

Early prophylactic low dose administration (150 mg) of acetylsalicylic acid is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of early-onset PE, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and neonatal mean stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Universal implementation of a first-trimester screening system including angiogenic and antiangiogenic markers [the Placental Growth Factor (PlGF) and/or soluble fms-like Tyrosine Kinase-1 (sFlt-1)] has shown a prediction rate of 90% for early-onset PE but entails a high financial cost. The aim of this study is to determine the predictive and preventive capacity of a universal PE first-trimester two-step sequential screening model, determining the PlGF only in patients previously classified as intermediate risk by means of a multivariate model based on resources already used in the standard pregnancy control, in a real clinical setting. We hypothesize that this screening model will achieve similar diagnostic performance as the universal determination of PlGF but at a lower economic cost. This is a prospective, multicentric, cohort study in a real-world clinical setting. Every singleton pregnancy will be recruited at the routine first pregnancy visit. In a first step, the first-trimester risk of PE will be calculated using a multivariate Gaussian distribution model, based on medical history, mean blood pressure, Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPP-A), and Uterine Artery Doppler Pulsatility Index (UTPI). Patients will be classified into three risk groups for PE: (1) risk ≥ 1/50, high-risk with no further testing (blinded PlGF); (2) risk between 1/51 and 1/500, medium-risk requiring further testing; and (3) risk ≤ 1/501, low-risk with no further testing. In a second step, the PlGF will only be determined in those patients classified as intermediate risk after this first step, and then reclassified into high- or low-risk groups. Prophylactic administration of aspirin (150 mg/day) will be prescribed only in high risk patients. As a secondary objective, sFlt-1 values will be blindly determined in patients with high and intermediate risk to assess its potential performance in the screening for PE.

However, the neurobiological changes induced by nerve damage in the LC remain unclear. Here, we analyzed excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the LC, as well as the possible damage that noradrenergic neurons suffer after the induction of neuropathic pain through chronic constriction injury (CCI). Neuropathic pain was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 or 2 (VGLUT1 or VGLUT2), vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) was analyzed by immunofluorescence 7 (CCI7d) or 28 days after the original lesion (CCI28d). While no significant differences in the density of VGLUT1 puncta were evident, CCI7d induced a significant increase in the perisomatic VGLUT2/VGAT ratio relative to Sham-operated and CCI28d animals. By contrast, when the entire region of LC is evaluated, there was a significant reduction in the density of VGLUT2 puncta in CCI28d animals, without changes in VGLUT2/VGAT ratio relative to the CCI7d animals. Additionally, changes in the noradrenergic soma size, and a lower density of mitochondria and lysosomes were evident in CCI28d animals. Interestingly, enhanced expression of the apoptotic marker CC3 was also evident in the CCI28d rats, mainly co-localizing with glial fibrillary acidic protein but not with any neuronal or noradrenergic marker. Overall, short-term pain appears to lead to an increase of markers of excitatory synapses in the perisomatic region of noradrenergic cells in the LC, an effect that is lost after long-term pain, which appears to activate apoptosis.","rodent","wim"

H&E staining was used for histopathologic evaluation of heart injury, and TTC staining was employed for evaluation of the infarct size. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to measure the protein expression and qRT-PCR for determining mRNA expression. CRY significantly reduced the area of the infarct, the number of apoptotic cells, and the concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Subsequent analysis showed that CRY repressed the expression of caspase-12, CHOP, and GRP78, but enhanced the phosphorylation of JAK and STAT3. However, FILGO treatment markedly abolished the beneficial effect of CRY pretreatment on cardiomyocyte damage, apoptosis, cardiac function, and inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-dependent apoptosis marker proteins. CRY may alleviate MIRI by inhibiting ERS-dependent apoptosis by activating the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway.","rodent","wim"

However, Dex may result in disturbance of metabolisms. This study was to investigate the effects of postnatal short course Dex exposure on brown adipose tissue (BAT) in neonatal rats. Method: Neonatal rats received either three consecutive doses of daily Dex (0.2 mg/kg/day) or saline from postnatal P1 to P3. We investigated the effects of Dex on BAT including thermogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy flux. We also compared diurnal temperature variation between preterm infants who received systemic corticosteroid and their treatment-naïve controls. Results: Postnatal Dex treatment induced growth retardation, BAT whitening, UCP1 downregulation and cold intolerance in neonatal rats. BAT mitochondria were damaged, evident by loss of normal number, structure, and alignment of cristae. Mitochondrial fission-fusion balance was disrupted and skewed toward increased fusion, reflected by increased OPA1 and MFN2 and decreased DRP1, FIS1 and phosphorylated MFF protein levels. Autophagosome synthesis was increased but clearance was inhibited, indicated by accumulation of p62 protein after Dex treatment and no further increase of LC3-II after chloroquine co-treatment. While autophagy modulators, including chloroquine and rapamycin, did not improve UCP1 downregulation and BAT whitening, AMPK activators could partially rescue these damages. We also demonstrated that preterm infants had higher diurnal temperature variation during corticosteroid treatment. Conclusions: Postnatal short course Dex impaired BAT mitochondrial function and autophagy flux in rat pups. AMPK activators had the potential to rescue the damage.","rodent","wim"
"1516",35958426,"Hyperthermia as a trigger for Takotsubo syndrome in a rat model.","Takotsubo syndrome is a well-characterized cause of acute yet reversible heart failure associated with periods of intense emotional stress, often mimicking on presentation an acute coronary syndrome. Animal models of Takotsubo syndrome have been developed, either through the application of a stressor, or administration of exogenous catecholamine. We found that in a model of isoproterenol-induced Takotsubo syndrome in anesthetized rats hyperthermia (40-41°C) would occur after the administration of isoproterenol. Maintenance of this hyperthermia would result in an apical hypocontractility typical of the syndrome, whereas prevention of hyperthermia with active cooling to maintain a euthermic core body temperature prevented (but did not subsequently reverse) apical hypocontractility. In vitro experimentation with isolated cardiomyocytes showed no effect of hyperthermia on either baseline contractility or contractility change after beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. We suggest that the rise in body temperature that is characteristic of catecholamine storm may be a component in the development of Takotsubo syndrome.","rodent","wim"

Twenty-two animals were imaged 7-9 days following 4T1-cell implantation inside mammary glands. Dynamic 64CuCl2 µPET/CT acquisition or iterative static images up to 8 h p.i. were performed. Animal biodistribution and tumor uptake were first evaluated in vivo by µPET analysis and then assessed on tissue specimens. Concerning 18F-FDG µPET, a static acquisition was performed at 15 min and 60 min p.i. Tumor 64CuCl2 accumulation increased from 5 min to 4 h p.i., reaching a maximum value of 5.0 ± 0.20 %ID/g. Liver, brain, and muscle 64CuCl2 accumulation was stable over time. The tumor-to-muscle ratio remained stable from 1 to 8 h p.i., ranging from 3.0 to 3.7.

In this study, we evaluated the longitudinal changes in respiratory indices during sleep in healthy infants during the first six months of life. Single-center prospective cohort study. Thirty healthy infants underwent overnight in-lab polysomnography at one and five months of age and findings were compared between assessments. Systematic review of studies evaluating infant polysomnography and meta-analysis was conducted. At one month of age, total AHI, obstructive AHI, and central AHI model-adjusted means (95% confidence interval) were 16.9 events/hour (12.2, 21.5), 10.2 events/hour (7.4, 13.1), and 6.6 events/hour (4.2, 9.0), respectively. 16.8% of events were obstructive apneas and 36.1% central apneas. By five months of age, there were significant reductions in each index to 4.1 events/hour (3.2, 5.0), 1.9 events/hour (1.4, 2.4), and 2.2 events/hour (1.6, 2.9), respectively (p < 0.001 for each), and a lower proportion of events were obstructive apneas (8.6%, p = 0.007) and a greater proportion central apneas (52.3%, p = 0.002). Meta-analysis found high AHI in infants with significant heterogeneity. Central AHI and obstructive AHI are greater in healthy newborns than older children. There is a significant spontaneous reduction in events and change in type of events in the first six months of life in this low-risk population. These findings may serve as a reference for clinicians evaluating for obstructive sleep apnea in infants.","meta_analysis","wim"
"1599",35964457,"A discovery of clinically approved Panlongqi Tablet for repositioning to treat osteoarthritis by inhibiting PI3K/AKT activation.","Panlongqi Tablet (PLQT) is a Chinese patent drug composed of 29 kinds of traditional Chinese medicines. Clinical practice has shown that PLQT can relieve osteoarthritis-caused joint pain, but its effects and mechanisms in other pathological links of osteoarthritis have not been characterized. The purpose of this study is to reposition the pharmacodynamic effects of PLQT through network pharmacology analysis combined with experimental validation, and also to preliminarily explore its possible mechanism. On the basis of integrating the relevant targets of PLQT in multiple drug databases and osteoarthritis-related targets in the disease database, an interaction network of related genes was constructed. The hub candidate targets of PLQT in the treatment of osteoarthritis were determined by calculating the main network topological characteristics, The specific functions and pathways of these targets acting on osteoarthritis were modularly analyzed. In addition, the modified Hulth-induced rat model of osteoarthritis and IL-1β-induced in vitro model of osteoarthritis were established to further validate the potential efficacy and possible mechanism of PLQT. A total of 138 key targets related to osteoarthritis were selected based on topological parameters, and their biological functions were mainly enriched in four over-expressed modules of cartilage degeneration, inflammatory response, immune response, and subchondral bone metabolism. The hub candidate targets had the highest enrichment degree in the TLR4-RAC1-PIK3CA-Akt-NFκB signaling axis of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In vivo results showed that PLQT treatment significantly inhibited the degeneration of proteoglycan and collagen in the cartilage of osteoarthritis rats, suppressed chondrocyte apoptosis, and reduced the Mankin score of joints. Moreover, PLQT alleviated synovial inflammation, reduced the Krenn score of synovium, inhibited the formation of osteophytes in osteoarthritis rats, reduced the bone mineral density (BMD), fractional bone volume (BV/TV), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.), as well as increased the trabecular separation (Tb.Sp.) of subchondral bone and the thickness of the subchondral bone plate (SBP.Th.). PLQT suppressed the expressions of TLR4, RAC1, PIK3CA, p-Akt, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5 in the cartilage, and inhibited the expression of NFκB p65 in the chondrogenic nucleus. Meanwhile, as downstream effector factors of the predictive pathways, the levels of serum interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were decreased after PLQT treatment. In vitro results also showed that PLQT could inhibit the expression of key proteins and downstream effector factors of the signaling axis, and this inhibition disappeared when pathway agonists were added. PLQT exerted pharmacological effects on the key pathological links of osteoarthritis including chondrocyte apoptosis, extracellular matrix degradation, inflammation, and subchondral bone metabolism by inhibiting the TLR4-RAC1-PIK3CA-Akt-NFκB axis-related proteins.","rodent","wim"

Moxibustion is effective in the treatment of RA, while the underlying therapeutic mechanisms remain limited. Thus, we explored whether moxibustion could adjust the circadian rhythm of RA by modulating the core clock genes CLOCK and BMAL1 at the molecular level. 144 Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (group A), model group (group B), 7-9 am moxibustion treatment group (group C), and 5-7 pm moxibustion treatment group (group D). Each group was divided into 6 time points (0 am, 4 am, 8 am, 12 N, 6 pm, and 8 pm) with an equal number of rats at each time point. Except for group A, all rats were injected with Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) 0.15 ml on the right foot pad to establish the RA model. The rats of the two moxibustion treatment groups were respectively subjected to moxibustion at 7-9 am and 5-7 pm. After 3 weeks of treatment, the tissues were collected at 6 time points during the next 24 hours. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to test the mRNA expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 in the hypothalamus and synovial tissues. CLOCK and BMAL1 protein expression in synovial tissues were detected with western blot. Compared to group A, group B showed significantly down-regulated expression levels of CLOCK and BMLA1 at synovial tissue (P < 0.05), while no statistically significant difference was found in the hypothalamus (P > 0.05). The expression levels of CLOCK and BMLA1 were up-regulated in the moxibustion treatment groups in different tissues, especially in synovial tissue (P < 0.05) compared to group B. Nevertheless, no difference was observed between groups C and D (P > 0.05). Moxibustion could treat RA by modulating clock core genes CLOCK and BMAL1 to regulate the circadian rhythm. However, there was no significant difference between the 7-9 am moxibustion treatment group and the 5-7 pm moxibustion treatment group. This study provides a basis for research on moxibustion in the treatment of RA.","rodent","wim"

"1648",35966011,"NF-κB and AP-1 are required for the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of MCP-1, CXCL1, and Cx43 in cultured rat dorsal spinal cord astrocytes.","TLR4 and Cx43 signaling in dorsal spinal cord has been shown to be involved in the development of neuropathic pain. However, it is not clear whether TLR4 signaling is associated with the expression of MCP-1, CXCL1, and Cx43 in LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-treated rat dorsal spinal cord astrocytes under in vitro condition. In the present study, we found that TLR4 antagonist TAK-242 significantly inhibited LPS-induced MCP-1, CXCL1, and Cx43 expression, suggesting the role of TLR4 in response to LPS in cultured dorsal spinal cord astrocytes. Application of TAK-242 significantly blocked LPS-induced NF-κB and AP-1 activity and the expression of MCP-1, CXCL1 and Cx43. Furthermore, NF-κB inhibitor PDTC and AP-1 inhibitor SR11302 significantly blocked LPS-induced MCP-1, CXCL1, and Cx43 expression. DNA-binding activity of NF-κB, its effect on MCP-1 expression was suppressed by PDTC and SR11302. On the other hand, DNA-binding activity of AP-1, its effect on CXCL1 or Cx43 expression was also suppressed by PDTC and SR11302. In addition, PDTC was found to inhibit the nuclear translocation of AP-1 and the expression of c-Jun induced by LPS, which suggested that NF-κBp65 is essential for the AP-1 activity. Similarly, SR11302 significantly blocked LPS-induced the nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65 and the expression of NF-κBp65 induced by LPS. Pretreatment with CBX, Gap26, or Gap19 (Cx43 blockers) significantly inhibited abnormal astrocytic hemichannel opening and chemokines (MCP-1 and CXCL1) release in LPS-stimulated astrocytes. In summary, cell culture experiments revealed that LPS stimulation could evoke TLR4 signaling with the subsequent activation of NF-κB and AP-1, resulting in the expression of MCP-1, CXCL1, and Cx43. TLR4 activation increased Cx43 hemichannel, but not gap-junction activities and induced the release of the MCP-1 and CXCL1 from astrocytes via Cx43 hemichannel. These findings may help us to understand the role of astrocytic signaling in inflammatory response within dorsal spinal cord tissue.","rodent","wim"
"1678",35957923,"A modified mouse model for observational fear learning and the influence of social hierarchy.","Indirectly experiencing traumatic events either by witnessing or learning of a loved one's suffering is associated with the highest prevalence rates of epidemiological features of PTSD. Social species can develop fear by observing conspecifics in distress. Observational fear learning (OFL) is one of the most widely used paradigms for studying fear contagion in mice. However, the impact of empathic fear behavior and social hierarchy on fear transfer in mice is not well understood. Fear emotions are best characterized in mice by using complementary tests, rather than only freezing behavior, and simultaneously avoiding behavioral variability in different tests across time. In this study, we modified the OFL model by implementing freezing (FZ), open field (OF), and social interaction (SI) tests in a newly designed experimental facility and applied Z-normalization to assess emotionality changes across different behaviors. The integrated emotionality scores revealed a robustly increased emotionality of observer mice and, more importantly, contributed to distinguishing susceptible individuals. Interestingly, fos-positive neurons were mainly found in the interoceptive network, and mice of a lower social rank showed more empathy-like behaviors. Our findings highlight that combining this experimental model with the Z-scoring method yields robust emotionality measures of individual mice, thus making it easier to screen and differentiate between empathic fear-susceptible mice and resilient mice, and refining the translational applicability of these models.","rodent","wim"

All groups received intraperitoneal injections of isoprinosine hydrochloride daily for 14 days. Additionally, the L-NBP, M-NBP, and H-NBP groups received NBP at 3, 6, and 12 mg per kg body weight, respectively, by intraperitoneal injection. An additional 10 rats (control group) received 0.9% sodium chloride via intraperitoneal injection for 14 consecutive days. Echocardiography was used for the measurement of heart function. Immunohistochemical staining for factor VIII-related antigen and microvascular density determination were performed. The protein and mRNA expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CMI areas were measured by western blot and RT-PCR, respectively. Electrocardiograms showed that NBP improved cardiac function by regulating left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening. Compared with the control and model groups, the L-NBP, M-NBP, and H-NBP groups showed increased mRNA and protein expression of VEGFA and HIF-1α in myocardial tissue. The mRNA and protein expression of VEGFA and HIF-α in the H-NBP group were the highest.

Phyllanthus emblica (PE), an edible and medicinal natural resource, exerts excellent effects on ameliorating NAFLD, but the potential mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, a mouse NAFLD model was established by administering a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD). The protective effects of the aqueous extract of PE (AEPE) on the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites in NAFLD mice were detected by performing 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. The administration of middle- and high-dose AEPE decreased the levels of ALT, AST, LDL-C, TG, and Hyp and increased HDL-C levels in CDAHFD-fed mice. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), Oil Red O, and Masson's trichrome staining indicated that AEPE treatment attenuated hepatic steatosis and fibrotic lesions. Moreover, the disordered intestinal microflora was remodeled by AEPE, including decreases in the abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae, Faecalibaculum, and Romboutsia. The untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that AEPE restored the disturbed glutathione metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis of the gut bacterial community in NAFLD mice, which strongly correlated with hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Collectively, AEPE potentially ameliorates NAFLD induced by a CDAHFD through a mechanism associated with its modulatory effects on the gut microbiota and microbial metabolism.","rodent","wim"

Overexpression of the A isoform of the STOX1 transcription factor (STOX1A) recapitulates PE in mice, and STOX1A overexpressing trophoblasts recapitulate PE patients hallmarks in terms of gene expression and pathophysiology. STOX1 overexpression induces nitroso-redox imbalance and mitochondrial hyper-activation. Here, by a thorough analysis on cell models, we show that STOX1 overexpression in trophoblasts alters inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO) content, the nitroso-redox balance, the antioxidant defense, and mitochondrial function. This is accompanied by specific alterations of the Krebs cycle leading to reduced l-malate content. By increasing NOS coupling using the metabolite tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) we restore this multi-step pathway in vitro. Moving in vivo on two different rodent models (STOX1 mice and RUPP rats, alike early onset and late onset preeclampsia, respectively), we show by transcriptomics that BH4 directly reverts STOX1-deregulated gene expression including glutathione metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, lipoprotein metabolism and platelet activation, successfully treating placental hypotrophy, gestational hypertension, proteinuria and heart hypertrophy. In the RUPP rats we show that the major fetal issue of preeclampsia, Intra Uterine Growth Restriction (IUGR), is efficiently corrected.

Mice in group B were given boric acid gel, and group F was treated with fluconazole gel for 30 min every 12 h. Group M was treated with sterile water, and group N was not given treatment. After the seventh day of treatment, each group was observed with the naked eye, and vaginal lavage fluid and vaginal tissue were collected. Expression levels of cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining was used to measure the fungi in vaginal tissues. There were no significant changes in group M. In groups B and F, there was less vaginal injury and less exudate, with group B doing better than group F. The numbers of CA colonies were higher in groups B, F, and M than in group N (P < 0.01). There was less vaginal colonization of CA in group B than in group F (P < 0.01). After the seventh day of treatment, levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-6, TGF-β, IL-4, and IL-10 were significantly greater in groups B, F, and M than in group N (P < 0.001); levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-6, and TGF-β in groups B and F were higher than those of group M (P < 0.01), while IL-4 and IL-10 levels were significantly lower (P < 0.001). The trends of cytokine increases and decreases were more significant in group B than in group F (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical results were similar to ELISA results.

"1762",35965995,"Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical Network Dynamics in the Harmaline Rodent Model of Essential Tremor.","Essential Tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder, characterised by a posture or movement-related tremor of the upper limbs. Abnormalities within cerebellar circuits are thought to underlie the pathogenesis of ET, resulting in aberrant synchronous oscillatory activity within the thalamo-cortical network leading to tremors. Harmaline produces pathological oscillations within the cerebellum, and a tremor that phenotypically resembles ET. However, the neural network dynamics in cerebellar-thalamo-cortical circuits in harmaline-induced tremor remains unclear, including the way circuit interactions may be influenced by behavioural state. Here, we examined the effect of harmaline on cerebello-thalamo-cortical oscillations during rest and movement. EEG recordings from the sensorimotor cortex and local field potentials (LFP) from thalamic and medial cerebellar nuclei were simultaneously recorded in awake behaving rats, alongside measures of tremor using EMG and accelerometery. Analyses compared neural oscillations before and after systemic administration of harmaline (10 mg/kg, I.P), and coherence across periods when rats were resting vs. moving. During movement, harmaline increased the 9-15 Hz behavioural tremor amplitude and increased thalamic LFP coherence with tremor. Medial cerebellar nuclei and cerebellar vermis LFP coherence with tremor however remained unchanged from rest. These findings suggest harmaline-induced cerebellar oscillations are independent of behavioural state and associated changes in tremor amplitude. By contrast, thalamic oscillations are dependent on behavioural state and related changes in tremor amplitude. This study provides new insights into the role of cerebello-thalamo-cortical network interactions in tremor, whereby neural oscillations in thalamocortical, but not cerebellar circuits can be influenced by movement and/or behavioural tremor amplitude in the harmaline model.","rodent","wim"

Mitochondria-targeted anti-oxidants are evolving as a new class of compounds that can alter the pathophysiology of age-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in disease progression. We recently synthesized an alkyl TPP + -tagged esculetin (mitochondria-targeted esculetin or Mito-Esc). Apoe-/- mice were chronically (14 months) administered with Mito-Esc to investigate its efficacy in the mitigation of atherosclerosis in the setting of aging. We monitored BP, and performed various biochemical assays, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, inflammatory factors, qPCR, and Western blotting. Simultaneously, human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were used as a model system to study the mechanistic aspects. A chronic low-dose administration of Mito-Esc to Apoe-/- mice greatly prevented alterations in lipid profile, blood pressure, and atherosclerotic plaque formation in the setting of aging. Mito-Esc administration significantly reduced vascular senescence and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and prevented dysregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis markers in aortic tissue. Further, Mito-Esc treatment prevented replicative and stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) in HAEC. Importantly, Mito-Esc treatment delayed endothelial cell senescence by increasing human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) levels via SIRT1 activation. Moreover, Mito-Esc treatment by altering miR-19b and miR-30c via a SIRT1 activation significantly inhibited the increase in PAI-1 levels in HAEC as well as in the serum of Apoe-/- mice. In addition, Mito-Esc treatment improved mitochondrial function in late passage (aged) HAECs by enhancing the oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Furthermore, Mito-Esc administration counteracted the decline in GSH and nitrite levels in Apoe-/- mice and in HAECs. Overall, Mito-Esc alleviates atherosclerosis in the setting of aging by delaying vascular senescence and pro-inflammatory processes, and by improving mitochondrial biogenesis and function.","rodent","wim"

Therefore, NAFLD seriously affects the quality of life in patients and causes a large economic burden. It has been reported that puerarin has the function of lowering the serum lipids, but due to the complexity of NAFLD, the specific mechanism of action has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the preventive or ameliorating effects of two doses of puerarin (0.11% and 0.22% in diet) on high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced NAFLD in rats. The rats were fed with HFFD-mixed puerarin for 20 weeks. The results showed that puerarin ameliorated the levels of lipids in the serum and liver. Further exploration of the mechanism found that puerarin ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation in NAFLD rats by reducing the expression of Srebf1, Chrebp, Acaca, Scd1, Fasn, Acacb, Cd36, Fatp5, Degs1, Plin2, and Apob100 and upregulating the expression of Mttp, Cpt1a, and Pnpla2. At the same time, after administration of puerarin, the levels of antioxidant markers (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) were significantly increased in the serum and liver, and the contents of serum and hepatic inflammatory factors (interleukin-18, interleukins-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) were clearly decreased.

The present study aims to explore the protective effect of HZDP on intestinal injury during heatstroke and analyze its potential pharmacodynamic basis. Male rats in the control and HS groups were given normal saline, and those in the HZDP groups were given HZDP (0.23, 0.46, and 0.92 g/kg) before induction of HS. Serum contents of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (iFABP), and diamine oxidase (DAO) were determined using ELISA. Histopathology of intestinal injury was observed following H&E staining. The expression of claudin-3 was determined using western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence techniques. Moreover, network pharmacological tools were used to analyze the potential pharmacodynamic basis and the mechanism of HZDP. Treatment with HZDP significantly prolonged the time to reach Tc. Compared with the control group, the contents of TNF-α, IL-6, iFABP, and DAO in HS rats increased markedly. HZDP treatments reduced these levels significantly, and the effects in the middle dose group (0.46 g/kg) were most obvious. HZDP also attenuated intestinal injury and significantly reversed the decrease in claudin-3 expression. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that 35 active ingredients and 128 target genes of HZDP were screened from TCMSP and 93 target genes intersected with heatstroke target genes, which were considered potential therapeutic targets. TNF-α and IL-6 were the main inflammatory target genes of HZDP correlated with HS. These results indicated that HZDP effectively protected intestinal barrier function and prevented acute intestinal injury by increasing the expression of claudin-3 in rats, eventually improving heat resistance.","rodent","wim"

The objective of this study is to investigate the chronic dose-dependent effects of sirolimus in the thymus. This was monitored using body weight, histomorphology, caspase-3 expression, cytochrome C immunohistochemistry, and cellular bioenergetics as surrogate biomarkers. BALB/c mice received intraperitoneal injections of either sirolimus (2.5, 5, or 10 µg/g) or dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1 µL/g) as a control for 4 weeks. At the end of the treatment, fragments were collected from the thymus, small intestine, adrenal gland, and kidney. They were processed for assessing histologic changes, measuring cellular respiration and ATP levels. Immunohistochemical stain of caspase-3 and cytochrome C was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue. The treated animals exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in weight gain despite adequate food intake. Sirolimus produced significant thymic derangements, manifested by dose-dependent tissue involution, increased cortical apoptotic bodies, increased caspase-3-positive lymphocytes, and increased rate of cellular respiration without a concomitant increase in cellular ATP. There were no similar changes in cellular ATP in the other assessed organs. The effects on thymic cellular bioenergetics suggest mitochondrial derangements, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and induction of apoptosis.","rodent","wim"
"1829",35958495,"Probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii attenuates cardiopulmonary bypass-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting ferroptosis.","Acute lung injury (ALI) is one of the most common and fatal complications of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Probiotics treatment has been shown to reduce lung injury in different experimental models. However, the effect of probiotics on CPB-induced ALI is still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate whether probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 treatment protects against lung injury in a rat model of CPB. Rats were orally gavaged with Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 once a day for 5 days before being subjected to CPB. Rats were euthanized post-CPB, and samples of lung tissue were processed for later investigation. The levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA. The expression levels of ferroptosis markers in lungs were assessed by western blot. The microbes in feces and proximal colon of rats were analyzed by using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing method. The ratio and maturity of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) were determined by flow-cytometry. Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 treatment improved lung function, attenuated pathologic lung changes and decelerated the exacerbation of inflammatory cytokine level after experimental CPB. Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 treatment also inhibited CPB-induced ferroptosis, as evidenced by the changes of main markers of ferroptosis, namely, the increase of Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and the decrease of Acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4). In addition, after Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 treatment, the ratio and maturity of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) in the guts of rats with CPB were significantly up-regulated. Our findings suggest that probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 reduces CPB-induced lung injury through suppression of the ferroptosis in lung and up-regulation of the ratio and maturity of cDCs in gut.","rodent","wim"
"1858",35959429,"Isochlorogenic Acid C Alleviates High-Fat Diet-Induced Hyperlipemia by Promoting Cholesterol Reverse Transport.","Background: Promoting cholesterol reverse transport (RCT) has been proven to be a promising hyperlipidemia therapy since it is more effective for the treatment of atherosclerosis (AS) caused by hyperlipidemia. Liver X receptor (LXR) agonists can accelerate RCT, but most of them trigger undesirable liver steatosis due to the activation of liver LXRα. Aim: We aim to figure out whether isochlorogenic acid C (ICAC) facilitates RCT without causing hepatic steatosis. Methods: In vitro study, we established foam macrophages and macrophages with loaded NBD-cholesterol models to investigate the competence of RCT promoting ICAC. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to verify ICAC's regulation of RCT and NF-κB inflammatory pathways. In this in vivo study, male 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to investigate ICAC's anti-hyperlipidemic effect and its functions in regulating RCT. The anti-hyperlipidemic effect of ICAC was evaluated by blood and liver lipid levels, liver hematoxylin, oil red o staining, and liver coefficient. Finally, mRNA levels of genes involved in RCT and inflammation pathways in the liver and intestine were detected by RT-qPCR. Results: ICAC prevented macrophages from foaming by up-regulating the LXRα mediated RCT pathway and down-regulating expression of the cholesterol absorption genes LDLR and CD36, as well as suppressing iNOS, COX2, and IL-1β inflammatory factors. In HFD-fed mice, ICAC significantly lowered the lipid level both in the serum and the liver. Mechanistic studies showed that ICAC strengthened the RCT pathway in the liver and intestine but didn't affect liver LXRα. Furthermore, ICAC impeded both adipogenesis and the inflammatory response in the liver. Conclusion: ICAC accelerated RCT without affecting liver LXRα, thus resulting in a lipid-lowering effect without increasing liver adipogenesis. Our results indicated that ICAC could be a new RCT promoter for hyperlipidemia treatment without causing liver steatosis.","rodent","wim"

The Sabin-strain-based inactivated poliovirus vaccine (sIPV) and the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) have been licensed in China for many years. To conduct a clinical study on the safety and immunogenicity of the sIPV when administered concomitantly with the DTaP. The study population was divided into three groups: group 1 was the sIPV+ DTaP concomitant administration group, group 2 was the sIPV inoculation group, and group 3 was the DTaP inoculation group. Blood samples were collected prevaccination and 30 days postvaccination, and serum antibody levels were detected. This study showed that the seropositive and seroconversion rates of type 1, 2 and 3 poliovirus in group 1 were higher than those in group 2, with no statistically significant difference after vaccination (P>0.05). Groups 1 and 3 also showed similar responses for all vaccine antigens except anti-FHA (97.65 (94.09-99.36) vs. 100 (97.89-100)). The geometric mean titers (GMTs) for the DTaP and sIPV among the groups were comparable, and the non-inferiority t test result was P<0.001. The number of local adverse events (AEs) reported in group 1 (29.91%) were larger than those in group 2 (12.39%) and group 3 (21.93%), among which the most common was redness. Similarly, the most common systemic AE was fever. All 5 severe AE (SAE) cases were determined by experts to be unrelated to the vaccines during the study. The evidence of similar seroconversion and safety with co-administered DTaP and sIPV supports the co-administration supports the introduction of a strategy of simultaneous administration of both vaccines into routine infant immunization, and it could increase vaccination coverage and protect more infants from morbidity and mortality from these related diseases. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04054882?term=NCT04054882&cntry=CN&draw=2&rank=1, identifier NCT04054882.","randomized_trial","wim"

"1890",35966019,"Age-Dependent Behavioral and Metabolic Assessment of App NL-G-F/NL-G-F Knock-in (KI) Mice.","Mitochondria play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset and progression. Traditional transgenic AD mouse models which were widely used in the past decades share a common limitation: The overexpression of APP and overproduction of amyloid-beta (Aβ) are accompanied by other APP peptide fragments, which could introduce artificial and non-clinically relevant phenotypes. Here, we performed an in-depth and time-resolved behavioral and metabolic characterization of a clinically relevant AD mouse model engineered to express normal physiological levels of APP harboring humanized Swedish (K670N/M671L), Beyreuther/Iberian (I716F), and Arctic (E693G) mutations (App NL-G-F/NL-G-F ), termed APP knock-in (APPKI) mice. Our result showed that APPKI mice exhibited fear learning deficits at 6-m age and contextual memory deficit at 12-m age. Histopathological analysis revealed mild amyloidosis (6E10) accompanied by microgliosis (Iba1) as early as 3 months, which progressed significantly together with significant astrocytosis at 6 and 12 m. We further analyzed hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction by multiple assays, while 3-m APPKI mice brain mitochondrial function remains a similar level as WT mice. Significant mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by decreased ATP production and higher membrane potential with subsequent overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in mitochondria isolated from 7-m APPKI mice hippocampal tissue. Morphologically, these mitochondria were larger in volume with a decreased level of mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin-2 (MFN2). At 12 months, APPKI mice exhibit a significantly decreased total mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in isolated hippocampal mitochondria detected by high-resolution respirometry. These data indicate early mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain at pre-symptomatic age in the App NL-G-F/NL-G-mice, which may play a key role in the progression of the disease. Moreover, the identified behavioral and bioenergetic alterations in this clinically relevant AD mouse model provide a valuable tool to optimize the temporal component for therapeutic interventions to treat AD.","rodent","wim"
"1917",35965792,"TAK-242 ameliorates epileptic symptoms in mice by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.","There is evidence that immune inflammation plays an important role in the of epilepsy. The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling pathway is a target for the treatment of epilepsy. TAK-242 is a potent TLR4 inhibitor with neuroprotective effects. No study has examined whether TAK-242 has a protective effect on epilepsy. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into the following 3 groups: (I) the control group; (II) the model [pentetrazol (PTZ)] group; and (III) the treatment group [PTZ + TAK-242 (3 mg/kg)], with 8 mice in each group. A mouse model of epilepsy was established via the intraperitoneal injection of PTZ (37 mg/kg). The behavioral changes of the mice were observed and scored using the Racine grading criteria. TAK-242 (3 mg/kg) was administered to establish the treatment model. The control group was intraperitoneally injected with normal saline at the same dose as the PTZ epileptogenic dose, and 3 mg/kg of normal saline was intragastrically administered. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions of TLR4, NF-κB, and the NF-κB downstream gene tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the mouse brain tissues were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. Compared to the control group, the mice in the model group showed generalized tonic convulsion and involuntary falling after PTZ modeling. The results of the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed that the treatment group had a higher number of normal neurons than the model group, and the neuronal cell morphology in the treatment group was closer to the control group. However, the occurrence of generalized tonic convulsion and involuntary falling in the mice in the treatment group was significantly improved. Comparing the Western Blot and RT-qPCR results, we detected higher TLR4, NF-KB, TNF-α protein and mRNA expression levels in the model group than the treatment group, and there was no significant difference between the control group and the treatment group. TAK-242 treatment ameliorates epileptic symptoms in mice, and the mechanism by which this occurs may be related to the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory pathway.","rodent","wim"
"1920",35966203,"Impact of Perineuronal Net Removal in the Rat Medial Prefrontal Cortex on Parvalbumin Interneurons After Reinstatement of Cocaine Conditioned Place Preference.","Parvalbumin (PV)-positive cells are GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons that modulate the activity of pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and their output to brain areas associated with learning and memory. The majority of PV cells within the mPFC are surrounded by a specialized extracellular matrix structure called the perineuronal net (PNN). We have shown that removal of PNNs with the enzyme chondroitinase-ABC (Ch-ABC) in the mPFC prevents the consolidation and reconsolidation of cocaine-associated conditioned place preference (CPP) memories. Here we examined the extent to which retrieval of a CPP memory during cocaine-primed reinstatement altered the levels and function of PV neurons and their surrounding PNNs during the reconsolidation period. We further determined the extent to which PNN removal prior to reinstatement altered PV intensity levels and PV cell function. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained for cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) followed by extinction training, microinjection of Ch-ABC in the prelimbic PFC, and cocaine-induced reinstatement. Rats were sacrificed immediately prior to reinstatement or at 2 h, 6 h, or 48 h after reinstatement for immunohistochemistry or 2 h later for electrophysiology. Our findings indicate that PNN removal only partially diminished reinstatement. Cocaine-primed reinstatement produced only minor changes in PNN or PV intensity in vehicle controls. However, after PNN removal, the intensity of remaining PNN-surrounded PV cells was decreased at all times except at 2 h post-reinstatement, at which time cocaine increased PV intensity. Consistent with this, in vehicle controls, PV neurons naturally devoid of PNNs showed a similar pattern to Ch-ABC-treated rats prior to and after cocaine reinstatement, suggesting a protective effect of PNNs on cocaine-induced changes in PV intensity. Using whole-cell patch-clamp, cocaine-primed reinstatement in Ch-ABC-treated rats decreased the number of elicited action potentials but increased excitatory synaptic transmission, which may have been compensatory. These findings suggest that without PNNs, cocaine-induced reinstatement produces rapid changes in PV intensity and PV cell excitability, which may in turn regulate output of the mPFC post-memory retrieval and diminish the maintenance of cocaine memory during reconsolidation.","rodent","wim"

Group C was given conventional nursing intervention, group B was given FTS intervention, and group A was given FTS intervention combined with empathic care. Psychological stress state (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate), postoperative recovery indicators (time of first anal exhaust, time of first defecation, time of getting out of bed, and length of postoperative hospital stay), postoperative complications, and psychological state (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS)) levels of patients in the three groups were compared. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate in group A were lower than those in group B, and those in group B were lower than those in group C (all P < 0.05). The time of first anal exhaust, time of first defecation, time of getting out of bed, and postoperative hospital stay in groups A and B were shorter than those in group C (all P < 0.05).The incidence of postoperative complications in groups A and B was 8.33% and 8.33%, respectively, lower than 23.33% in group C (both P < 0.05). SAS and SDS scores of group A were lower than those of groups B and C after intervention (all P < 0.05). The concept of FTS combined with empathic nursing is beneficial to reduce the stress response of patients with gynecological malignant tumor before surgery, reduce the risk of postoperative complications, improve patients' mood, and speed up the rehabilitation process of patients.","randomized_trial","wim"

POF is a common gynecological disease that reduced the pregnancy rate. Electro-acupuncture (EA) is a useful non-pharmaceutical therapy that supposedly regulates the function of the liver and kidney in the treatment of POF with TCM. However, the underlying mechanism of EA in the treatment of POF has not been adequately studied through metabonomics with reference to the theory of TCM. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of EA on the liver and kidney metabolites in POF mice through metabolomics. POF mice were established via intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin. Both Sanyinjiao (SP6) and Guanyuan (CV4) were stimulated by EA for 3 weeks. The biological samples (including the serum and the ovary, liver, and kidney tissues) were evaluated by histopathology, molecular biology, and hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR)-based metabolomics to assess the efficacy of EA. 1HNMR data were analyzed by the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The results revealed that EA was beneficial to ovarian function and the menstrual cycle of POF. Both the energy metabolism and neurotransmitter metabolism in the liver and kidney were regulated by EA. Notably, EA played an important role in regulating energy-related metabolism in the kidney, and the better effect of neurotransmitter-related metabolism in the liver was regulated by EA. These findings indicated that the ovarian functions could be improved and the metabolic disorder of the liver and kidney caused by POF could be regulated by EA. Our study results thus suggested that the EA therapy, based on the results for the liver and kidney, were related to POF in TCM, as preliminarily confirmed through metabolomics.","rodent","wim"

Rhamnazin, Myricetin and Quercetin were analytically characterized through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography from Saraca asoca flower in a 0.1% acetic acid fraction of ethanol. The antidepressant effect was tested by repeated administration of freshly prepared ESAF on mice subjected to repeated and different forms of stress induction for 2 hours every day in the morning and night for seven consecutive days. The antidepressant activity was measured by known behavioral animal models: forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). At the end of the experiment, each group of mice was sacrificed by cervical dislocation, followed by an estimation of the biochemical data. The oral administration of ESAF in doses of 50, 100, & 250 mg/kg for seven consecutive days gave a significant decrease in the time of immobility (P<0.05) and reversed the depression-like behavior induced by acute restraint methods and behavioral models. ESAF treated groups showed a significant increase in glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity in the hippocampus of the acutely restrained mice. In addition, ESAF 250 mg/kg reduced plasma corticosterone levels in mice subjected to different forms of acute restraint stress compared to other groups, comparable to the standard imipramine. Our study showed the antidepressant activity of the ESAF. This effect may be attributed to the presence of antioxidant bioflavonoids namely, Rhamnazin, Myricetin and quercetin. Reduction in the plasma corticosterone levels along with an increase in the antioxidant enzymatic activity such as GSP-PX and SOD in the mice's hippocampus is the proposed molecular hypothesis for its neuroprotective mechanism.","rodent","wim"

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to test the expressions of miR-27a, FOXO1 messenger RNA (mRNA), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) mRNA, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA, and western blot was applied to test the expression of FOXO1. In order to overexpress miR-27a, an intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v) of miR-27a mimic was administered. We adopted 2,3,5-triphenytetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and brain water content measurement to test the effects of miR-27a on the infarcted volume and edema in brain after HIE. Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis was applied to test the effects of miR-27a on the infiltrated peripheral immune cells in the rat brains after HIE. We successfully established a rat model of neonatal HIE. It was revealed that the expressions of miR-27a decreased gradually after HIE, however, the expressions of FOXO1 mRNA increased. After injection of the miR-27a mimic, the expression of miR-27a in the rat HIE model brains was significantly upregulated, however, the expression of FOXO1 was robustly downregulated. Both TTC staining and brain water content showed that the infarcted volume and brain edema was markedly increased after HIE. Interestingly, the overexpression of miR-27a reduced the infarcted volume and edema induced by HIE. Additionally, RT-qPCR and FCM analysis showed that HIE lead to increases of IL-1β, TNF-α, and infiltrated immune cells. Overexpression of miR-27a could reduce the expressions of IL-1β mRNA and TNF-α mRNA, and the cell numbers of infiltrated peripheral macrophages and neutrophils in the brain. MiR-27a plays protective roles by reducing infarct volume and brain edema, and inhibiting inflammatory factors and infiltrated peripheral immune cells by targeting FOXO1 in neonatal HIE rats.","rodent","wim"

Nociceptive behavior in wild type mice was induced by formalin, carrageenan or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) injection in the hind paw, and the effect of oral cpd3 administration was measured. Scratch activity was measured after oral administration of cpd3, in mice overexpressing phospholipase A2 ( sPLA2tg ), in wild type mice (WT) and in TRPA1-deficient mice (Trpa1 KO). In vitro effects of cpd3 were assessed by measuring intracellular calcium release in HMC-1 and HEK-TRPA1 cells. As expected, nociceptive behavior (induced by formalin, carrageenan or PGE2) was reduced after treatment with cpd3. Unexpectedly, cpd3 induced scratch activity in mice. In vitro addition of cpd3 to HEK-TRPA1 cells induced an intracellular calcium wave that could be inhibited by the TRPA1-antagonist A-967079. In Trpa1 KO mice, however, the increase in scratch activity after cpd3 administration was not reduced.

Elevated mRNA expressions of SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, Catalase, and GPX were demonstrated in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of GBR-EA treated animals. The pro-inflammatory changes induced by HFD in the hippocampus were attenuated by GBR-EA through the downregulation of CRP and TNF- α and upregulation of PPAR-γ.

Hypothyroidism was induced by daily administration of propylthiouracil. Kisspeptin-10 (Kp-10) treatment was performed every other day or daily beginning on day 8 of gestation. Feto-placental development, placental histomorphometry, and expression levels of growth factors (VEGF, PLGF, IGF1, IGF2, and GLUT1), hormonal (Dio2) and inflammatory mediators (TNFα, IL10, and IL6), markers of hypoxia (HIF1α) and oxidative damage (8-OHdG), antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, Cat, and GPx1), and endoplasmic reticulum stress mediators (ATF4, GRP78, and CHOP) were evaluated on day 18 of gestation. Daily treatment with Kp-10 increased free T3 and T4 levels and improved fetal weight. Both treatments reestablished the glycogen cell population in the junctional zone. Daily treatment with Kp-10 increased the gene expression levels of Plgf, Igf1, and Glut1 in the placenta of hypothyroid animals, in addition to blocking the increase in 8-OHdG and increasing protein and/or mRNA expression levels of SOD1, Cat, and GPx1. Daily treatment with Kp-10 did not alter the higher protein expression levels of VEGF, HIF1α, IL10, GRP78, and CHOP caused by hypothyroidism in the junctional zone compared to control, nor the lower expression of Dio2 caused by hypothyroidism. However, in the labyrinth zone, this treatment restored the expression of VEGF and IL10 and reduced the GRP78 and CHOP immunostaining. These findings demonstrate that daily treatment with Kp-10 improves fetal development and placental morphology in hypothyroid rats, blocks placental oxidative damage, and increases the expression of growth factors and antioxidant enzymes in the placenta.","rodent","wim"

Herein, we compared the modulation and consequent pharmacological effects of oral administration of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-loaded β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) NPs (EGCG@β-CD NPs) and EGCG on gut microbiota. EGCG@β-CD NPs were prepared using self-assembly and their influence on the intestinal microbiome structure was analyzed using a metagenomics approach. The Encapsulation efficiency (EE), particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential of EGCG@β-CD NPs were recorded as 98.27 ± 0.36%, 124.6 nm, 0.313 and -24.3 mV, respectively. Surface morphology of EGCG@β-CD NPs was observed as spherical. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and molecular docking studies confirmed that EGCG could be well encapsulated in β-CD and formed as EGCG@β-CD NPs. After being continuously administered EGCG@β-CD NPs for 8 weeks, the serum cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the rats were significantly decreased, while the levels of catalase (CAT) and apolipoprotein-A1 (apo-A1) in the liver increased significantly in the hyperlipidemia model of rats, when compared to the high-fat-diet group. Furthermore, metagenomic analysis revealed that the ratio of Verrucomicrobia/Bacteroidetes was altered and Bacteroidetes decreased in the high-fat diet +200 mg/kg·bw EGCG@β-CD NPs group, while the abundance of Verrucomicrobia was significantly increased, especially Akkermansia muciniphila in rat feces. EGCG@β-CD NPs could be a promising EGCG delivery strategy to modulate the gut microbiota, enhancing its employment in the prevention of hyperlipidemia.","rodent","wim"
"2105",35958602,"Development of mouse model for oral allergy syndrome to identify IgE cross-reactive pollen and food allergens: ragweed pollen cross-reacts with fennel and black pepper.","Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is an IgE-mediated immediate food allergy that is localized to the oral mucosa. Pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS), a pollinosis-associated OAS, is caused by cross-reactivity between food and pollen allergens. However, we need to more precisely understand the underlying pathogenesis of OAS/PFAS. In the present study, we developed a method to comprehensively identify cross-reactive allergens by using murine model of OAS and protein microarray technology. We focused on lip angioedema, which is one of the most common symptoms of OAS, and confirmed that mast cells reside in the tissues inside the lower lip of the mice. Interestingly, when the food allergen ovalbumin (OVA) was injected inside the lower lip of mice with high levels of OVA-specific IgE followed by an intravenous injection of the Evans blue dye, we found immediate dye extravasation in the skin of the neck in a mast cell-dependent manner. In addition, the degree of mast cell degranulation in the oral cavity, reflecting the severity of oral allergic responses, can be estimated by measuring the amount of extravasated dye in the skin. Therefore, we used this model of OAS to examine IgE cross-reactive allergens in vivo. Protein microarray analysis showed that serum IgE from mice intraperitoneally sensitized with ragweed pollen, one of the major pollens causing pollinosis, bound highly to protein extracts from several edible plants including black peppercorn and fennel. We confirmed that the levels of black pepper-specific IgE and fennel-specific IgE were significantly higher in the serum from ragweed pollen-sensitized mice than in the serum from non-sensitized control mice. Importantly, analysis of murine model of OAS showed that the injection of black pepper or fennel extract induced apparent oral allergic responses in ragweed pollen-sensitized mice. These results indicate IgE cross-reactivity of ragweed pollen with black pepper and fennel. In conclusion, we developed mouse model of OAS to identify IgE cross-reactive pollen and food allergens, which will help understand the pathogenesis of OAS/PFAS.","rodent","wim"

Thus, we aimed to ascertain the overall effects of the 5:2 IF diet (5 days a week of normal food intake and 2 consecutive fasting days) in patients with NAFLD compared to a control group (usual diet). A 12-week randomized controlled trial was performed to evaluate the effects of the 5:2 IF diet on anthropometric indices, body composition, liver indices, serum lipids, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory markers in patients with NAFLD. The IF group (n = 21) decreased body weight (86.65 ± 12.57-82.94 ± 11.60 kg), body mass index (30.42 ± 2.27-29.13 ± 1.95 kg/m2), waist circumference (103.52 ± 6.42-100.52 ± 5.64 cm), fat mass (26.64 ± 5.43-23.85 ± 5.85 kg), fibrosis (6.97 ± 1.94-5.58 ± 1.07 kPa), steatosis scores/CAP (313.09 ± 25.45-289.95 ± 22.36 dB/m), alanine aminotransferase (41.42 ± 20.98-28.38 ± 15.21 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (34.19 ± 10.88-25.95 ± 7.26 U/L), triglycerides (171.23 ± 39.88-128.04 ± 34.88 mg/dl), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (2.95 ± 0.62 -2.40 ± 0.64 mg/L), and cytokeratin-18 (1.32 ± 0.06-1.19 ± 0.05 ng/ml) values compared to the baseline and the end of the control group (n = 23)-p ≤ 0.05 were considered as significant. However, the intervention did not change the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, insulin, HOMA-IR, and total antioxidant capacity.

The symptoms affect the quality of patients' life by impeding normal sleep cycles and causing excessive daytime sleepiness. Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) is a therapy often used for ischemic stroke patients to minimize infarct size and maximize post-stroke neurological function. Animal experiments have shown that RIC plays a protective role for retinal ganglion cells and other critical areas of the brain of Parkinson's disease. However, whether RIC improves excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) for patients with Parkinson's disease remains to be determined. This is a single-center, double-blind, and randomized controlled trial, which includes patients with Parkinson's disease with EDS. All recruited patients will be randomly assigned either to the RIC or the control group (i.e., sham-RIC) with 20 patients in each group. Both groups receive RIC or sham-RIC treatment once a day for 28 days within 24 h of enrollment. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale-2 (PDSS-2), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire39 (PDQ39) score scales, and adverse events, such as inability to tolerate the treatment leading to suspension of the study or objective signs of tissue or neurovascular injury caused by RIC and/or sham-RIC are evaluated at 7, 14, 28, and 90 days after enrollment. The primary goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of the treatments in patients with Parkinson's disease by measuring serious RIC-related adverse events and any reduced incidence of adverse events during the trial and to study potential efficacy, improvement of patients' excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life-based on ESS, PSQI, PDSS-2, and PDQ39 scores.

In this study, a severe TBI mouse model was created using controlled cortical impact (CCI), and a surgical model of DC was established. Furthermore, a series of neurological function assessments were performed to better understand the pathophysiological changes after DC. In this study, mice were randomly allocated into three groups, namely, CCI group, CCI+DC group, and Sham group. The mice in the CCI and CCI+DC groups received CCI after opening a bone window, and after brain injury, immediately returned the bone window to simulate skull condition after a TBI. The CCI+DC group underwent DC and contused tissue removal 6 h after CCI. The mice in the CCI group underwent the same anesthesia process; however, no further treatment of the bone window and trauma was performed. The mice in the Sham group underwent anesthesia and the process of opening the skin and bone window, but not in the CCI group. Changes in Modified Neurological Severity Score, rotarod performance, Morris water maze, intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB), inflammatory factors, neuronal apoptosis, and glial cell expression were evaluated. Compared with the CCI group, the CCI+DC group had significantly lower ICP, superior neurological and motor function at 24 h after injury, and less severe BBB damage after injury. Most inflammatory cytokine expressions and the number of apoptotic cells in the brain tissue of mice in the CCI+DC group were lower than in the CCI group at 3 days after injury, with markedly reduced astrocyte and microglia expression. However, the degree of brain edema in the CCI+DC group was greater than in the CCI group, and neurological and motor functions, as well as spatial cognitive and learning ability, were significantly poorer at 14 days after injury.","rodent","wim"
"2187",35966200,"Microbial neuraminidase induces TLR4-dependent long-term immune priming in the brain.","Innate immune memory explains the plasticity of immune responses after repeated immune stimulation, leading to either enhanced or suppressed immune responses. This process has been extensively reported in peripheral immune cells and also, although modestly, in the brain. Here we explored two relevant aspects of brain immune priming: its persistence over time and its dependence on TLR receptors. For this purpose, we used an experimental paradigm consisting in applying two inflammatory stimuli three months apart. Wild type, toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and TLR2 mutant strains were used. The priming stimulus was the intracerebroventricular injection of neuraminidase (an enzyme that is present in various pathogens able to provoke brain infections), which triggers an acute inflammatory process in the brain. The second stimulus was the intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (a TLR4 ligand) or Pam3CSK4 (a TLR2 ligand). One day after the second inflammatory challenge the immune response in the brain was examined. In wild type mice, microglial and astroglial density, as well as the expression of 4 out of 5 pro-inflammatory genes studied (TNFα, IL1β, Gal-3, and NLRP3), were increased in mice that received the double stimulus compared to those exposed only to the second one, which were initially injected with saline instead of neuraminidase. Such enhanced response suggests immune training in the brain, which lasts at least 3 months. On the other hand, TLR2 mutants under the same experimental design displayed an enhanced immune response quite similar to that of wild type mice. However, in TLR4 mutant mice the response after the second immune challenge was largely dampened, indicating the pivotal role of this receptor in the establishment of immune priming. Our results demonstrate that neuraminidase-induced inflammation primes an enhanced immune response in the brain to a subsequent immune challenge, immune training that endures and that is largely dependent on TLR4 receptor.","rodent","wim"

However, the effects of IL-35 on blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in ischemic stroke are not well characterized. A total of 150 male C57BL/6 mice (aged 6-8 weeks and weighing 20-25 g) were used in this study. The protective effects of IL-35 against BBB dysfunction were examined using a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and an in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury in mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3). Intracerebroventricular administration of IL-35 (10 µg/g) was found to reduce cerebral edema and Evans blue (EB) leakage, and increase the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, thereby attenuating MCAO-induced neurological deficit in mice. Moreover, IL-35 (20 ng/mL) treatment upregulated the expression of TJ proteins in OGD/R-induced bEnd.3 cells. IL-35 also markedly suppressed the expression of caspase-1, IL-1β, and gasdermin D (GSDMD) in vivo and in vitro. In addition, IL-35 decreased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibited the expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) in OGD/R-induced bEnd.3 cells.

"2221",35959789,"H151, a small molecule inhibitor of STING as a novel therapeutic in intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury.","Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a severe disease associated with high mortality. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an intracellular protein that is activated by cytosolic DNA and is implicated in I/R injury, resulting in transcription of type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) and other pro-inflammatory molecules. H151 is a small molecule inhibitor of STING that has not yet been studied as a potential therapeutic. We hypothesize that H151 reduces inflammation, tissue injury and mortality after intestinal I/R. In vitro, RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with H151 then stimulated with recombinant murine (rm) CIRP, and IFN-β levels in the culture supernatant were measured at 24 hours after stimulation. In vivo, male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 60-min intestinal ischemia via superior mesenteric artery occlusion. At the time of reperfusion, mice were intraperitoneally instilled with H151 (10 mg/kg BW) or 10% Tween-80 in PBS (vehicle). Four hours after reperfusion, the small intestines, lungs and serum were collected for analysis. Mice were monitored for 24 hours after intestinal I/R to assess survival. In vitro, H151 reduced rmCIRP-induced IFN-β levels in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, intestinal levels of pIRF3 were increased after intestinal I/R and decreased after H151 treatment. There was an increase in serum levels of tissue injury markers (LDH, AST) and cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-6) after intestinal I/R, and these levels were decreased after H151 treatment. I/R-induced intestinal and lung injury and inflammation were significantly reduced after H151 treatment, as evaluated by histopathologic assessment, measurement of cell death, chemokine expression, neutrophil infiltration, and myeloperoxidase activity. Finally, H151 improved the survival rate from 41% to 81% after intestinal I/R. H151, a novel STING inhibitor, attenuates the inflammatory response and reduces tissue injury and mortality in a murine model of intestinal I/R. H151 shows promise as a potential therapeutic in the treatment of this disease.","rodent","wim"

The use of CTX (cyclophosphamide) caused a series of negative effects: the secretion of IL-2, IL-22, TNF-α, sIgA, length of the villi, and the area of Pey's node were significantly reduced (P < 0.05); the depth of crypt and the percent of CD3+ and CD4+ cells were significantly increased (P < 0.05); the cecal flora taxa decreased; the abundance of Firmicutes and Lactobacillus increased; and the abundance of Bacteroidetes, Deferribacteres, Proteobacteria, Mucispirillum, Bacteroides, and Flexisprra decreased. The addition of CSPCM improved the secretion of cytokines and the development of intestinal villi, crypts, and Pey's node. The number of CD3+ and CD4+ cells in groups C, D, and E was significantly higher than that in group B (P < 0.05).

After the model had been established, the NAC group received intracerebroventricular injections of NAC, the YY-moxi group received YY-moxi, and the NAC + YY-moxi group received a combination of these 2 interventions. The neurological deficit score was confirmed, and the cerebral infarction was examined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. In the ischemia site of stroke, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated Dutp nick end labeling staining was applied to examine the apoptotic cells. Additionally, the apoptosis-associated genes and protein expressions in the ischemic brains were investigated by the reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis. YY-moxi alone and YY-moxi combined with NAC significantly reduced the neurological scores and cerebral infarction area of the MCAO rats. Additionally, YY-moxi alone and the combined application of YY-moxi and NAC improved the pathological status of ischemic brain tissues. Further, we found that YY-moxi alone and YY-moxi in combination with NAC could enhanced the antioxidation ability and reduced the inflammatory response of the MCAO model rats. We also proved that YY-moxi alone and YY-moxi combined with NAC significantly suppressed apoptosis-related proteins in the MCAO model rats. These findings indicate that YY-moxi exerts a protective effect on cerebral ischemic injury by reducing apoptosis. The study suggests that the mechanism may be related to its downregulating the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NK-κB).","rodent","wim"

An SAE rat model was established, and the expression of Ionized calcium bindingadaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) in rat brain tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry. Enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay was performed to detect the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in brain tissue. Real time quantitative PCR was performed to detect the relative expression of SIRT3 and related miRNAs, while Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of SIRT3. Rat microglia cells were cultured in vitro. After miRNA-494 was transfected, the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 was detected. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of SIRT3 and Iba-1 in microglia. The results showed that the expression of Iba-1 in the brain tissue of the SAE model group increased, and the expression of inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-6 increased significantly (P<0.01). The expression of SIRT3 protein and mRNA in the brain tissue of the SAE model group also significantly increased (P<0.05).

The mice were fed with a normal diet or high-fat diet supplementation with or without anthocyanin extracts (ACNE, 75, 150, 250 mg/kg body weight) for 18 weeks, corresponding to control (Con), model (Mod), and treatment group (LD, low dose; MD, medium dose; HD, high dose), respectively, along with a positive control group (posCon, treatment with Atorvastatin, 0.003 mg/kg body weight). The results showed that ACNE could significantly enhance the antioxidant capacity and lower the plasma lipid, but have no evident influence on the body weight of apoE-/- mice. A series of differential metabolites, predominantly related to lipid metabolism, were identified, including docosahexaenoic acid, palmitoyl ethanolamide, stearoylcarnitine, L-palmitoylcarnitine, indoxyl sulfate (IS), 1-palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine, phenylacetylglycine (PAGly), and so on. Among these, both IS and PAGly were host-microbial metabolites. These differential metabolites were mainly enriched in the pathway of glycerophospholipid metabolism and linoleic acid metabolism. Several important enzymes related to glycerophospholipid metabolisms such as LCAT, LPCAT, GPCPD1, PLA2G1B, PPARG, LIPE, PNPLA2, AGPAT1, and ENPP2 were recognized as underlying targets for anti-atherogenic effects of ACNE.

Therefore, it is desirable to develop the next generation sclerostin inhibitors to promote bone formation without increasing cardiovascular risk for OI. Methods and Results: Our data showed that sclerostin suppressed inflammatory responses, prevented aortic aneurysm (AA) and atherosclerosis progression in hSOSTki.Col1a2+/G610C.ApoE-/- mice. Either loop2&3 deficiency or inhibition attenuated sclerostin's suppressive effects on expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in vitro, whilst loop3 deficiency maintained the protective effect of sclerostin on cardiovascular system both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, loop3 was critical for sclerostin's antagonistic effect on bone formation in Col1a2+/G610C mice. Accordingly, a sclerostin loop3-specific aptamer aptscl56 was identified by our lab. It could recognize both recombinant sclerostin and sclerostin in the serum of OI patients via targeting loop3. PEG40k conjugated aptscl56 (Apc001PE) demonstrated to promote bone formation, increase bone mass and improve bone microarchitecture integrity in Col1a2+/G610C mice via targeting loop3, while did not show influence in inflammatory response, AA and atherosclerosis progression in Col1a2+/G610C.ApoE-/- mice with Angiotensin II infusion. Further, Apc001PE had no influence in the protective effect of sclerostin on cardiovascular system in hSOSTki.Col1a2+/G610C.ApoE-/- mice, while it inhibited the antagonistic effect of sclerostin on bone formation in hSOSTki.Col1a2+/G610C mice via targeting loop3. Apc001PE was non-toxic to healthy rodents, even at ultrahigh dose. Apc001PE for OI was granted orphan drug designation by US-FDA in 2019 (DRU-2019-6966).

Whereas Shilajit's treatment of osteosarcoma rates in combination with CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy drug cocktail significantly (p < 0.05) reversed the studied functional markers to their near-normal levels. Co-treatment of shilajit and drug cocktails also markedly alleviated histopathological changes in liver and kidney tissues. Correlation co-efficient analysis of hepatic and renal functional markers revealed a significant inter-association among these markers. Collectively, present data indicate that shilajit may potentiate the effects of chemotherapy drugs and mitigate the metastasis-induced liver and kidney damage in osteosarcoma. Thus, the findings of this study substantiate the beneficial health effects of shilajit and promote its regular consumption.","rodent","wim"
"2301",35966477,"Long-term changes of parvalbumin- and somatostatin-positive interneurons of the primary motor cortex after chronic social defeat stress depend on individual stress-vulnerability.","Chronic stress is a major risk factor for developing mental illnesses and cognitive deficiencies although stress-susceptibility varies individually. In a recent study, we established the connection between chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and impaired motor learning abilities accompanied by chronically disturbed structural neuroplasticity in the primary motor cortex (M1) of mice. In this study, we further investigated the long-term effects of CSDS exposure on M1, focusing on the interneuronal cell population. We used repeated CSDS to elicit effects across behavioral, endocrinological, and metabolic parameters in mice. Susceptible and resilient phenotypes were discriminated by symptom load and motor learning abilities were assessed on the rotarod. Structural changes in interneuronal circuits of M1 were studied by immunohistochemistry using parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SST+) markers. Stress-susceptible mice had a blunted stress hormone response and impaired motor learning skills. These mice presented reduced numbers of both interneuron populations in M1 with layer-dependent distribution, while alterations in cell size and immunoreactivity were found in both susceptible and resilient individuals. These results, together with our previous data, suggest that stress-induced cell loss and degeneration of the GABAergic interneuronal network of M1 could underlay impaired motor learning, due to their role in controlling the excitatory output and spine dynamics of principal neurons required for this task. Our study further highlights the importance of long-term outcomes of chronically stressed individuals which are translationally important due to the long timecourses of stress-induced neuropsychiatric disorders.","rodent","wim"
"2311",35957997,"A translational mouse model for investigation of the mechanism of preterm diffuse white matter injury.","The increasing incidence of preterm birth has led to a global problem of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm neonates as a result of brain injury. There is still a lack of models mimicking diffuse white matter injury (WMI) in preterm neonates that can be applied to transgenic mice. The right common carotid artery of the neonatal mouse was ligated on postnatal day 3 (P3) C57BL/6 mice and followed by 80, 90, or 100 min of hypoxia using a mixture of 10%±0.2% oxygen-nitrogen. The most suitable model was chosen by characterizing the effects of this hypoxic-ischemic insult on development of myelin, glial cell conditions, and neurological outcomes by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining performed at postnatal day 17 (P17), western blot measuring myelin basic protein (MBP) at postnatal day 10 (P10) and P17, immunofluorescence staining of MBP-neurofilament protein heavy chain (NFH), oligodendrocyte transcription factor-2 (Olig2)-adenomatous polyposis coli clone (CC1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionic calcium linker protein (Iba-1) at P17, electron microscopy observing myelin microstructure at postnatal day 52 (P52) and behavioral testing at postnatal day 45-50 (P45-P50). The 90-min group showed neuroanatomical changes in the ipsilateral side of the brain, the 80-min group showed minor changes, and the 100-min group showed severe injury. Mice in the 90-min group subsequently showed marked activation of astrocytes, augmentation of microglia, a notable decrease in expression of MBP with a normal level of NFH, long-term cognitive dysfunction, and impairment of the myelin ultrastructure in adulthood. In conclusion, a mouse model of preterm diffuse WMI rather than cystic periventricular leukomalacia was successfully achieved by ligating one of the common carotid arteries on P3 followed by 90 min of hypoxia in a mixture of 10%±0.2% oxygen-nitrogen. The attempt provides an adequate translational animal model for elucidating the underlying mechanism.","rodent","wim"

The purpose of this study was to explore the possible mechanism of lung injury induced by La2O3 NPs. In this study, 40 SPF male SD rats were randomly divided into low-, medium-, and high-dose groups and control groups, with 10 animals in each group. Rats were poisoned by tracheal injection. The low-, medium-, and high-dose groups were given La2O3 NPs suspension of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, respectively, and the control group was given an equal volume of high-temperature sterilized ultrapure water. The rats in each group were exposed once a week for 12 consecutive times. The gene transcription and protein expression levels of PINK1 and parkin in rat lung tissue were mainly detected. Compared with the control group, the gene transcription and protein expression levels of PINK1 and Parkin in the exposed group were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05).

"2349",35958560,"Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP, IAP Enhancer) attenuates intestinal inflammation and alleviates insulin resistance.","In this study, we investigated the effects of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) in controlled intestinal inflammation and alleviated associated insulin resistance (IR). We also explored the possible underlying molecular mechanisms, showed the preventive effect of IAP on IR in vivo, and verified the dephosphorylation of IAP for the inhibition of intestinal inflammation in vitro. Furthermore, we examined the preventive role of IAP in IR induced by a high-fat diet in mice. We found that an IAP + IAP enhancer significantly ameliorated blood glucose, insulin, low-density lipoprotein, gut barrier function, inflammatory markers, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in serum. IAP could dephosphorylate LPS and nucleoside triphosphate in a pH-dependent manner in vitro. Firstly, LPS is inactivated by IAP and IAP reduces LPS-induced inflammation. Secondly, adenosine, a dephosphorylated product of adenosine triphosphate, elicited anti-inflammatory effects by binding to the A2A receptor, which inhibits NF-κB, TNF, and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways. Hence, IAP can be used as a natural anti-inflammatory agent to reduce intestinal inflammation-induced IR.","rodent","wim"
"2351",35958302,"Nano-Selenium Alleviates Cadmium-Induced Acute Hepatic Toxicity by Decreasing Oxidative Stress and Activating the Nrf2 Pathway in Male Kunming Mice.","Cadmium (Cd) is known as a highly toxic heavy metal and has been reported to induce hepatotoxicity in animals. Nano-selenium (NSe) is an antioxidant that plays many biological roles such as oxidative stress alleviation. The purpose of this study is to explore the mechanism of action by which NSe inhibits Cd-induced hepatic toxicity and oxidative stress. Sixty eight-week-old male Kunming mice were randomly divided into four groups (15 mice per group). The control group and cadmium groups received distilled water, whereas the sodium-selenite group received 0.2 mg/kg SSe and the NSe group received 0.2 mg/kg NSe intragastrically for 2 weeks. On the last day, all the other groups were treated with Cd (126 mg/kg) except for the control group. The results obtained in this study showed that NSe alleviated Cd-induced hepatic pathological changes. Furthermore, NSe reduced the activities of ALT and AST as well as the content of MDA, while elevated the activities of T-AOC, T-SOD and GSH (P < 0.05). In addition, the NSe group significantly increased mRNA expressions of Nrf2 pathway related molecules (Nrf2, HO-1, NQO-1, GST, GSH-Px, CAT and SOD) compared to the Cd group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, NSe shows its potentiality to reduce Cd-induced liver injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and activating the Nrf2 pathway.","rodent","wim"

Considering that the deterioration of musculoskeletal conditions is of serious concern in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, it is worthwhile to clarify the effect of wearable sensor-based exercise on musculoskeletal disorders in such patients compared with traditional exercise. Five health science-related databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and Ebsco Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, were systematically searched. The protocol number of the study is PROSPERO CRD42022319763. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published up to March 2022 and written in English were included. Balance was the primary outcome measure, comprising questionnaires on postural stability and computerized dynamic posturography. The secondary outcome measures are motor symptoms, mobility ability, functional gait abilities, fall-associated self-efficacy, and adverse events. Stata version 16.0 was used for statistical analysis, and the weighted mean difference (WMD) was selected as the effect size with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Fifteen RCTs involving 488 participants with mean ages ranging from 58.6 to 81.6 years were included in this review, with 14 of them being pooled in a quantitative meta-analysis. Only five included studies showed a low risk of bias. The Berg balance scale (BBS) was used in nine studies, and the pooled data showed a significant improvement in the wearable sensor-based exercise group compared with the traditional exercise group after 3-12-week intervention (WMD = 1.43; 95% CI, 0.50 to 2.36, P = 0.003). A significant change in visual score was found both post-assessment and at 1-month follow-up assessment (WMD = 4.38; 95% CI, 1.69 to 7.07, P = 0.001; I2 = 0.0%). However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in the secondary outcome measures (all p > 0.05). No major adverse events were reported. The wearable sensor-based exercise had advantages in improving balance in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, while there was a lack of evidence in motor symptoms, mobility, and functional gait ability enhancement. Future studies are recommended to construct a comprehensive rehabilitation treatment system for the improvement in both postural control and quality of life. http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42022319763.","meta_analysis","wim"

Among the emerging inflammatory markers observed to be associated with β-cell damage is interleukin 1β (IL1β), a proinflammatory cytokine that modulates important metabolic processes including insulin secretion and β-cell apoptosis. The present systematic review and meta-analysis gathers available evidence on the emerging role of IL1β in T2DM. PubMed and Embase were searched for human studies that assessed 1L1β in T2DM individuals from 2016-2021. Thirteen studies (N=2680; T2DM=1182, controls=1498) out of 523 were included in the systematic review and only 3 studies in the meta-analysis. Assays were the most commonly used quantification method and lipopolysaccharides as the most common stimulator for IL1β upregulation. Random and fixed effects meta-analysis showed non-significant mean differences of IL1β concentrations between the T2DM and controls. Given the high heterogeneity and small subset of studies included, caution is advised in the interpretation of results. The present systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the limited evidence available that could implicate 1L1β as a potent biomarker for T2DM. Standardization of 1L1β assays with larger sample sizes are encouraged in future observational and prospective studies.","meta_analysis","wim"

Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of immunosuppressants do not have final conclusion. Thus, a pairwise and network meta-analysis (NMA) was carried out to seek the most recommended therapeutic schedule for patients with IMN. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including cyclophosphamide (CTX), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus-combined mycophenolate mofetil (TAC + MMF), cyclosporine (CsA), tacrolimus (TAC), leflunomide (LEF), chlorambucil (CH), azathioprine (AZA), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), non-immunosuppressive therapies (CON), steroids (STE), mizoribine (MZB), and rituximab (RIT) for patients with IMN were checked. Risk ratios (RRs) and standard mean difference (SMD) were reckoned to assess dichotomous variable quantities and continuous variable quantities, respectively. Total remission (TR) and 24-h urine total protein (24-h UTP) were compared using pairwise and NMA. Then interventions were ranked on the basis of the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Results: Our study finally included 51 RCTs and 12 different immunosuppressants. Compared with the CON group, most regimens demonstrated better therapeutic effect in TR, with RR of 2.1 (95% CI) (1.5-2.9) for TAC, 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for RIT, 2.5 (1.2-5.2) for TAC + MMF, 1.9 (1.4-2.7) for CH, 1.8 (1.4-2.4) for CTX, 2.2 (1.0-4.7) for ACTH, 1.6 (1.2-2.1) for CsA, 1.6 (1.0-2.5) for LEF, and 1.6 (1.1-2.2) for MMF. In terms of 24-h UTP, TAC (SMD, -2.3 (95% CI -3.5 to -1.1)), CTX (SMD, -1.7 (95% CI -2.8 to -0.59)), RIT (SMD, -1.8 (95% CI -3.5 to -0.11)), CH (SMD, -2.4 (95% CI -4.3 to -0.49)), AZA (SMD, --4.2 (95% CI -7.7 to -0.68)), and CsA (SMD, -1.7 (95% CI -3 to -0.49)) were significantly superior than the CON group. As for adverse effects (AEs), infections, nausea, emesia, myelosuppression, and glucose intolerance were the collective adverse events for most immunosuppressants. Conclusion: This study indicates that TAC + MMF performed the best in terms of TR, and TAC shows the best effectiveness on 24-h UTP compared with other regimens. On the contrary, there seems to be little advantage on STE alone, LEF, AZA, and MZB in treating patients with IMN compared with CON.

Our objective was to systematically review, synthesise and critique the epidemiological studies that provided information about the relationship between psoriasis and atrial fibrillation risk. We searched through PubMed, EMBASE and the bibliographies for articles published between 1 January 2000, and 1 November 2017, that reported on the association between psoriasis and atrial fibrillation. All abstracts, full-text articles and sources were reviewed with duplicate data excluded. Summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% CI were pooled using a random effects model. We identified 252 articles, of these eight unique abstracts underwent full-text review. We finally selected six out of these eight studies comprising 11,187 atrial fibrillation patients. The overall pooled relative risk (RR) of atrial fibrillation was 1.39 (95% CI: 1.257-1.523, P < 0.0001) with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 80.316, Q = 45.723, τ2 = 0.017, P < 0.0001) for the random effects model. In subgroup analysis, the greater risk was found in studies from North America, RR 1.482 (95% CI: 1.119-1.964, P < 0.05), whereas a moderate risk was observed in studies from Europe RR 1.43 (95% CI: 1.269-1.628, P < 0.0001). We were only able to include six studies with 11,178 atrial fibrillation patients, because only a few such studies have been published. Our results showed that psoriasis is significantly associated with an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation. Therefore, physicians should monitor patient's physical condition on a timely basis.","meta_analysis","wim"

Therefore, this time, meta-analysis is used to study the therapeutic effect of endoscopic sinus surgery on children with chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps, analyze its effectiveness and safety, and provide theoretical basis for clinical treatment. Boolean logic searching was adopted to retrieve articles from various databases, including PubMed, Medline, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), published from the establishment of the database to December 30, 2021. The following search terms were used: endoscopic sinus surgery, antrochoanal polyps, chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps, and nasal polyps. Comparative studies on traditional surgical treatment and endoscopic sinus surgery were also screened out. Review Manager was utilized for meta-analysis. A total of 9 references were included in the study, and most of them were low risk bias (medium and high quality). Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical heterogeneity between the control group and the experimental group (Chi2=0.03, I2=0%, P=0.98). According to the fixed effect model analysis, the number of patients with polyp formation in the experimental group was significantly less than that in the control group (Z=2.65, P=0.008). Compared with the control group, there is no statistical heterogeneity in the postoperative recurrence (Chi2=1.59, I2=0%, P=0.45). According to the analysis of fixed effect model, the postoperative recurrence in the experimental group is significantly less than that in the control group (Z=2.92, OR =2.78, 95% CI: 1.40-5.52, P=0.004). Compared with the control group, the results of postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) were statistically different (Chi2=12.63, I2=84%, P=0.002).

Studies reported that the higher blood CXCL12 level was associated with increased major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), but the results were inconsistent. The objective of this study was to clarify the prognostic value of the blood CXCL12 level in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) through meta-analysis. All related studies about the association between the blood CXCL12 level and the prognosis of CAD were comprehensively searched and screened according to inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. The quality of the included literature was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The heterogeneity test was conducted, and the pooled hazard risk (HR) or the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the fixed-effect or random-effects model accordingly. Publication bias was evaluated using Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were also conducted. A total of 12 original studies with 2,959 CAD subjects were included in the final data combination. The pooled data indicated a significant association between higher CXCL12 levels and MACEs both in univariate analysis (HR 5.23, 95% CI 2.48-11.04) and multivariate analysis (HR 2.53, 95% CI 2.03-3.16) in the CXCL12 level as the category variable group.

Subgroup analysis of the CXCL12 level as the continuous variable group found significant associations in non-ACS (multivariate OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.23-1.92), Caucasian (multivariate OR 3.83, 95% CI 1.44-10.19), and long-term (multivariate OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.37-1.93) subgroups, but not in ACS (multivariate OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.67-2.75), Asian (multivariate OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.91-2.14), and short-term (multivariate OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.28-4.76) subgroups. No significant publication bias was found in this meta-analysis. The higher blood CXCL12 level is associated with increased MACEs in patients with CAD, and the blood CXCL12 level may serve as an important prognostic index for CAD. Integrating the blood CXCL12 level into CAD risk assessment tools may provide more comprehensive messages for evaluating and managing patients with CAD.","meta_analysis","wim"

We conducted an umbrella review using Living Overview of Evidence platform for COVID-19, which performs regular automated searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and more than 30 other sources. The review was conducted following the JBI methodology for systematic reviews. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for grading the certainty of the evidence is reported (registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, CRD42020198267). Thirty studies that fulfilled selection criteria were included; 19 primary studies provided estimates of sensitivity (0.91, 95%CI = [0.88-0.93]) and specificity (0.73, 95%CI = [0.61; 0.82]) of chest CT for COVID-19. No correlation was found between sensitivities and specificities (ρ = 0.22, IC95% [-0.33; 0.66]). Diagnostic odds ratio was estimated at: DOR = 27.5, 95%CI (14.7; 48.5). Evidence for sensitivity estimates was graded as MODERATE, and for specificity estimates it was graded as LOW. The value of chest CT appears to be that of an additional screening tool that can easily detect PCR false negatives, which are reportedly highly frequent. Upon the absence of PCR testing and impossibility to perform RT-PCR in trauma patients, chest CT can serve as a substitute with increased value and easy implementation.

Two researchers retrieved the literature from Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Psyclnfo, and Cochrane Library from the establishment of the databases until November 20, 2021. We used the New Castle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to evaluate the risk of bias in prospective research and cross-sectional research, respectively. The major exposure was HCWs' sleep disturbance, and the major outcome was mental health. The correlation coefficients (r), regression coefficients (β) and odds ratios (OR) of the included studies were integrated. Fifty-nine studies were included for qualitative analysis, of which 30 studies could be combined and entered into quantitative analysis. There were 23 studies during the COVID-19 pandemic among the 59 included studies. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the correlation coefficient between sleep disturbance and mental health was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.39-0.47). HCWs with sleep disturbance had a 3.74 (95% CI: 2.76-5.07) times higher risk of mental health problems than those without sleep disturbance. The correlation coefficient during the COVID-19 epidemic was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.37-0.53), while it was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.36-0.44) during the non-epidemic period.

We thus conducted this meta-analysis to investigate the overall incidence and risk of developing PICC-related VTE in hospitalized patients. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception until January 26, 2022. In studies with a non-comparison arm, the pooled incidence of PICC-related VTE was calculated. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated to assess the risk of VTE in the studies that compared PICC to the central venous catheter (CVC). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess methodological quality. A total of 75 articles (58 without a comparison arm and 17 with), including 109292 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled incidence of symptomatic VTE was 3.7% (95% CI: 3.1-4.4) in non-comparative studies. In the subgroup meta-analysis, the incidence of VTE was highest in patients who were in a critical care setting (10.6%; 95% CI: 5.0-17.7). Meta-analysis of comparative studies revealed that PICC was associated with a statistically significant increase in the odds of VTE events compared with CVC (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.83-3.37; P < 0.01). However, in subgroup analysis stratified by the study design, there was no significant difference in VTE events between the PICC and CVC in randomized controlled trials (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 0.77-6.74; P = 0.13). Best practice standards such as PICC tip verification and VTE prophylaxis can help reduce the incidence and risk of PICC-related VTE. The risk-benefit of inserting PICC should be carefully weighed, especially in critically ill patients. Cautious interpretation of our results is important owing to substantial heterogeneity among the studies included in this study.","meta_analysis","wim"

The two existing treatment methods, hysteroscopic electric resection and vaginal surgery, are still controversial in terms of efficacy and safety. So, this paper to compares the effectiveness and safety of hysteroscopic electric resection and vaginal surgery in the treatment of USD after cesarean section. We performed a related literature search from main databases. According to the PICOS principles inclusion criteria were adult female USD patients to evaluate the efficacy of hysteroscopic resection and vaginal surgery for the treatment of USD, outcome data could be extracted to compare the efficacy and safety of the two procedures. Subsequently, according to the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the retrieved articles, studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria were eliminated. The RevMan 5.20 software was used for meta-analysis and Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2.0) was used to assess the risk of bias. The effectiveness and safety of hysteroscopic resection and vaginal surgery in the treatment of USD patients after cesarean section were compared. Eight articles were finally included, with a total of 191 patients in the hysteroscopic electric resection group and 212 patients in the vaginal surgery group. Compared with hysteroscopic resection and vaginal surgery, there is less intraoperative blood loss [mean difference (MD) is -25.23, P<0.00001], shorter operation time (MD is -29.45, P<0.00001), and shorter hospital stay (MD is -1.87, P<0.00001), but menstrual improvement risk ratio (RR) is 0.71 (P=0.51) and diverticulum recovery RR is 0.60 (P=0.43) there were no significant differences. Hysteroscopic electric resection provides a more satisfactory outcome than vaginal surgery in terms of intraoperative blood loss, operation time, and hospital stay. However, the sample size of the study was not large enough and some studies had high risk of bias, more large-sample multi-center high quality studies are needed for further comprehensive comparative analysis.","meta_analysis","wim"

Nine databases were searched from March 1990 to March 2022 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to the adjunctive treatment of PI for AHF. The Cochrane collaboration tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Meta-analysis and subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted by RevMan 5.3 software. The evidence's certainty was evaluated by grading recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) methods. A total of 8 studies were included with a total of 614 patients with AHF. The meta-analysis demonstrated that adjunctive treatment with PI on AHF was superior to conventional medicine alone. It increased the total effective rate (RR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.22-1.55; p < 0.001) and improved left ventricular ejection fraction [SMD = 0.85; 95% CI (0.62, 1.09); p < 0.001]. Regarding safety, a total of 11.9% (23/194) adverse reactions were observed in the PI group and 9.8% (19/194) adverse reactions in the control group, and there were no significant differences in the incident rate of adverse events between both groups [RR = 1.16; 95% CI (0.66-2.05); p = 0.061]. The outcomes' evidentiary quality was assessed as moderate. PI had an adjunctive effect on AHF combined with conventional medicine, and it seemed to be safe and more effective than the conventional medical treatment alone for improving the total clinical effective rate and left ventricular ejection fraction. But further well-designed RCTs are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of XBP in treating AHF due to the poor methodological quality of the included RCTs.

A systematic review and meta-analysis.","Video-Assisted and Robotic-Assisted techniques become constantly more prominent practice in thoracic surgery for lung cancer. Furthermore, the increased frequency in detection of small lung cancers makes the intra-operative identification of these cancers even more challenging. Indocyanine Green (ICG) is one of the most commonly used dyes that assists surgeons identify small lung cancers intra-operatively. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ICG in lung cancer detection. We performed a systematic review of the literature by screening the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and Scopus until 30th April 2022 and the first 300 articles of Google Scholar for any suitable grey literature. We included any study that investigated the effectiveness of ICG in lung cancer detection. We excluded studies that explored the use of ICG only in identification of intersegmental planes, lymph node mapping, case reports and non-English articles. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis on test accuracy studies using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) and the bivariate random-effects models. In cases where the data for a localization technique was not sufficient for that analysis, it was presented with tables with narrative purposes. Each study was assessed for Risk of Bias (RoB) and Applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. We found 30 eligible studies that included a total of 1,776 patients who underwent ICG localization of pulmonary nodules. We identified three ICG localization techniques: CT-guided, endobronchial and intravenous. From the 30 studies, 13 investigated CT-guided localization, 12 explored an endobronchial method while 8 studies administered ICG intravenously the median reported success rate was 94.3% (IQR: 91.4%-100%) and 98.3% (IQR: 94%-100%) for the first two techniques respectively. Intravenous ICG lung cancer localization showed Sensitivity of 88% (95% CI: 59%-0.97%) and Specificity of 25% (95% CI: 0.04%-0.74%). There were 15.2% (150/989) patients who experienced complications from CT guided ICG localization. No ICG-related complications were reported in endobronchial or intravenous techniques. Our study provides a comprehensive review of the literature on ICG localization techniques for lung cancer. Current evidence suggests that ICG is boh effective and safe. Further prospective research with standardized protocols across multiple thoracic units is required in order to accurately validate these findings.","meta_analysis","wim"

However, the POD guidelines issued by the European Society of Anesthesiology (ESA) suggest that the effect of regional anesthesia on POD is controversial. This meta-analysis aims to investigate whether perioperative regional anesthesia reduced the incidence of POD. Standard Published randomized controlled trails (RCTs) were searched from bibliographic databases to identify all evidence that reported regional anesthesia assessing incident delirium following diverse surgeries. The primary outcome was the incidence of POD, and the secondary outcomes were POD scores, pain scores, and emergence time. The relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the weighted or standardized mean difference (WMD, SMD) for continuous outcomes were estimated using a random-effects model. Twenty RCTs with 2110 randomized participants undergoing different surgeries were included. Meta-analysis showed that regional anesthesia was associated with less POD incidence compared to general anesthesia (total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) or inhalation anesthesia) (relative risk (RR) = 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-0.85)). Subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in POD incidence was associated with a nerve block (0.46, 95% CI = 0.32-0.67) and regional-combined-general anesthesia (0.42, 95% CI = 0.29-0.60). Regional anesthesia significantly reduced POD incidence in the recovery room after pediatric surgeries (0.41, 95% CI = 0.29-0.56). Regional anesthesia also reduced the POD score (SMD -0.93, 95% CI = -1.55 to -0.31) and pain score (SMD -0.95, 95% CI = -1.72 to -0.81). There was no significant difference in emergence time between regional anesthesia and general anesthesia (WMD -1.40, 95% CI = -3.83 to 6.63).

A subgroup analysis was conducted on different treatment methods to determine the most effective treatment method. The researchers independently searched databases, including PubMed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of science. The search deadline was June 2022. A randomized controlled trial was conducted on Parkinson's disease patients with HY stages 1-3 who received continuous physical therapy for 6 months or more. Systematic evaluation and meta-analysis were carried out by using common clinical evaluation indicators, namely, MDS-UPDRS exercise score, daily activity (ADL) score, or LED dose. The quality of the literature was assessed using the modified Jadad scale of Cochrane's bias risk tool. A total of 523 Parkinson's disease patients with HY stages of 1-3 were included in the study. The results showed that long-term physical therapy could improve patients' motor symptoms with combined antiparkinsonian drugs (Z = 2.61 and P = 0.009) and had a significant positive effect on the motor symptoms of patients with discontinued antiparkinsonian drugs (Z = 2.73 and P = 0.006).

We aimed to evaluate the predictive performances of validated, recalibrated, and developed prognostic risk prediction tools used in the Southeast Asian population with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) events for secondary events. We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Central databases until March 2022. We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies that exclusively evaluated populations in the Southeast Asian region with a confirmed diagnosis of an AMI event and evaluated for risk of secondary events such as mortality, recurrent AMI, and heart failure admission. The CHARMS and PRISMA checklists and PROBAST for risk of bias assessment were used in this review. We included 7 studies with 11 external validations, 3 recalibrations, and 3 new models from 4 countries. Both short- and long-term outcomes were assessed. Overall, we observed that the external validation studies provided a good predictive accuracy of the models in the respective populations. The pooled estimate of the C-statistic in the Southeast Asian population for GRACE risk score is 0.83 (95%CI 0.72-0.90, n = 6 validations) and for the TIMI risk score is 0.80 (95%CI: 0.772-0.83, n = 5 validations). Recalibrated and new models demonstrated marginal improvements in discriminative values. However, the method of predictive accuracy measurement in most studies was insufficient thereby contributing to the mixed accuracy effect. The evidence synthesis was limited due to the relatively low quality and heterogeneity of the available studies. Both TIMI and GRACE risk scores demonstrated good predictive accuracies in the population. However, with the limited strength of evidence, these results should be interpreted with caution. Future higher-quality studies spanning various parts of the Asian region will help to understand the prognostic utility of these models better. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?%20RecordID=228486.","meta_analysis","wim"

Whether TEAS could relieve cancer-related fatigue (CRF), anxiety, and depression and improve the quality of life in cancer patients remains controversial. Thus, we conducted a thorough literature search of electronic Chinese and English databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the effect of CRF, anxiety, depression, and quality of life in cancer patients from inception to July 1st, 2021. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias criteria were used to assess the risk of bias for each included RCT. Continuous variables were analyzed using standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A fixed-effects model was used for the meta-analysis of all outcomes. A total of nine RCTs with 924 cancer patients were included in this analysis, including 460 patients in the interventional group and 464 patients in the control group. We found that TEAS could significantly reduce CRF, depression, and anxiety (SWD = -0.83, 95% CI: -0.99 to -0.66, P < 0.05) and improve the quality of life (SWD = -1.37, 95% CI: -2.34 to -0.40, P < 0.05). The funnel plot analysis revealed no significant publication bias. We conclude that TEAS is beneficial for reducing CRF, depression, and anxiety and improving the quality of life of cancer patients, but additional high-quality evidence in the future is entailed to support this.","meta_analysis","wim"

To ascertain the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an mHealth intervention (Mymee) that combines symptom, diet, and behavior tracking via a smartphone application with data analytics to detect associations between symptoms and lifestyle factors along with weekly health coaching sessions to mitigate CNCP in adults 55 years of age and older. Participants (N = 31) in this pilot study were recruited from one primary care practice in New York City and randomized to an intervention [app + up to 12 health coaching sessions (scheduled approximately once weekly) + usual care] or a control (app + usual care) arm. Feasibility measures included recruitment (proportion of eligible persons who enrolled) and retention rates (proportion of subjects completing a follow-up assessment) as well as adherence with the weekly coaching sessions and logging daily data on the app. Efficacy outcomes (e.g., pain intensity, self-efficacy, disability, anxiety) were assessed at baseline and follow-up (~16 weeks after baseline). Descriptive statistics were obtained and general linear mixed models used for primary analyses. Participants had a mean (standard deviation) age of 67.32 (9.17) and were mostly female (61%). Feasibility outcomes were mixed as evidenced by recruitment and retention rates of 74% and 65%, respectively. The mean number of weekly coaching sessions attended by intervention participants was 6.05 (SD = 5.35), while the average number of days logging data on the app was 44.82 (34.02). We found a consistent trend in favor of the intervention, where pain intensity, affect, and quality of life measures improved considerably more among intervention (vs. control) participants. Finally, the proportion of participants with GAD-7 scores at follow up decreased by 0.35 to 0, whereas controls did not change, a significant effect in favor of the intervention (p = 0.02). This study supports the need for future research that seeks to enhance feasibility outcomes and confirm the efficacy of the Mymee intervention among aging adults with CNCP.","randomized_trial","wim"

We aimed to evaluate the effect of prehabilitation on the postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing colorectal surgery. This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis. The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies reporting the effect of prehabilitation strategies versus standard care or rehabilitation in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The primary outcomes were overall postoperative complications and length of hospital stay (LOS), and the secondary outcome was functional capacity (measured using the 6-min walk test [6MWT]) at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. Fifteen studies with 1,306 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed no significant reduction in the number of overall postoperative complications (risk ratio = 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79-1.31; p = 0.878) or LOS (standardized mean difference = 0.04; 95% CI = -0.11 to 0.20; p = 0.589) in patients who underwent colorectal surgery with or without prehabilitation strategy.

However, the optimal strategy of capecitabine-based chemotherapy remains uncertain. We conducted this network meta-analysis to address this issue. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to retrieve eligible studies published before September 2021. Two independent reviewers extracted information from eligible studies using a pre-designed data extraction sheet. The primary outcome included disease-free survival, and the second outcome showed overall survival and adverse events. Direct meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4, and Bayesian network analysis was performed using R version 3.6.1 with the gemtc and rjags packages. Nine studies involving 3661 TNBC patients met the selection criteria. The network meta-analysis suggested that the addition of capecitabine to adjuvant chemotherapy achieved a significantly longer disease-free (HR = 0.66, 95% CrI = 0.49 to 0.86) and overall survival time (HR = 0.60, 95% CrI = 0.43 to 0.83) than standard chemotherapy. All comparisons did not achieve statistical significance. The addition of capecitabine to adjuvant chemotherapy was the most effective treatment for improving disease-free (81.24%) and overall survival (78.46%) times, and the replacement of capecitabine to adjuvant chemotherapy was the safest regime. Based on available evidence, capecitabine-based chemotherapy benefits TNBC patients, and the addition of capecitabine with adjuvant chemotherapy was the most effective regime. In contrast, the replacement of capecitabine to adjuvant chemotherapy was the safest regime. More studies of high quality and large scale are needed to confirm our findings.","meta_analysis","wim"

Due to the contrasting existing literature, we decided to perform the present meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the effect of the use of reparixin on survival in patients at high risk for in-hospital mortality. We created a search strategy to include any human RCTs performed with reparixin utilization in patients at high risk for in-hospital mortality, excluding oncological patients. Two trained, independent authors searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for appropriate studies. Furthermore, references of review articles and included RCTs were screened to identify more studies. No language restrictions were enforced. To assess the risk of bias of included trials, the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) was used. Overall, six studies were included and involved 406 patients (220 received reparixin and 186 received the comparator). The all-cause mortality in the reparixin group was significantly lower than that in the control group [5/220 (2.3%) in the reparixin group vs. 12/186 (6.5%) in the control group, odds ratio = 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.96), p-value for effect 0.04, p for heterogeneity 0.20, I 2 = 36%]. In addition, no difference in the rate of pneumonia, sepsis, or non-serious infections was shown between the two groups.

Indeed, a number of studies have highlighted impairments in both social cognitive functions and empathic skills in OCD, despite several inconsistencies. This study aimed to investigate social cognitive dysfunction and empathy deficits in patients with OCD using a meta-analytic approach. A literature search was conducted using the databases Pubmed, PsycINFO, ProQuest and Scopus to identify the relevant studies (January 1980 to March 2020). Following the systematic review of relevant OCD studies, a random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. The current meta-analysis included 25 studies consisting of 1161 patients with OCD and 1329 healthy controls. OCD was associated with decreased performance in theory of mind (ToM). In the facial emotion recognition domain, patients with OCD significantly underperformed healthy controls only in their recognition of disgust. OCD was significantly related to reduced cognitive empathy. OCD was associated with medium-sized impairments in ToM and cognitive empathy, which can likely contribute to psychosocial impairment in this disorder.

We performed a comprehensive search of electronic databases such as PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Wanfang Data in October 2021. The results were reported as weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity scores were assessed with the standard Cochran's Q test and the I 2 statistic. A total of 8 randomized trials and 2 prospective cohort studies, together involving 643 patients (n = 336 CSWT and n = 307 control), were included in our study.

In behavioral therapy, traditional pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) can be boring and monotonous, which can cause poor compliance. It's important to establish a new safe and effective crotch-pelvic floor functional reconstruction training method [Yun-type pelvic floor optimal training (Yun-type training)] for OAB patients. This randomized, double-blind, crossover trial recruited a total of 150 women with mild to moderate OAB. Patients were randomly assigned to receive Yun-type training (n=83) or PFMT (n=67). The intervention group was first given Yun-type training for 6 weeks, then switched to PFMT for 6 weeks after 2 weeks of elution. Patients in the control group were first treated with PFMT for 6 weeks, and changed to the use of Yun-type training for 6 weeks after 2 weeks of elution. The primary endpoint was overactive bladder symptom scores (OABSS) after 6 and 14 weeks of Yun-type training and PFMT. Yun-type training could significantly improve OABSS compared with PFMT after 6 and 14 weeks (P<0.001). Yun-type training was associated with an improvement in urine, urgency, urge urinary incontinence (UUI), urogenital distress inventory-6 (UDI-6), patient's perception of bladder condition (PPBC), voiding volume (VV), incontinence impact questionnaire-7 (IIQ-7), female sexual function index (FSFI), sexual desire, arousal, pain, satisfaction, pelvic floor muscle tone, type I muscle strength, type II muscle strength, and sex partner satisfaction as compared with PFMT after 6 and 14 weeks. Moreover, nocturia, maximum flow rate (Qmax), and climax in the Yun-type training group were significantly improved after 6 weeks, and the average flow rate (Qave) was improved after 14 weeks in the Yun-type training group. Yun-type training could yield additional benefits on OAB symptoms, sexual function, and sex partner satisfaction as compared with PFMT. The superior sexual function resulting from Yun-type training can be explained by the fact that it can contract deep and superficial muscle layers, resulting in increased vaginal wall pressure and blood flow, which further improves FSFI and sex partner satisfaction. It could lead to a new non-invasive treatment for OAB patients. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR-INR-17012192.","randomized_trial","wim"

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for data extraction and synthesis. The pairwise meta-analysis compared statins and controls using a random-effects model, and a network meta-analysis compared the types and dosages of statins using the Bayesian random-effects model. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42021242067. The study included 37 randomized controlled trials with 17,410 participants and 20 interventions. According to the pairwise meta-analysis, statins significantly decreased CRP levels compared to controls (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-1.31, -0.64], P < 0.0001). In the network meta-analysis, simvastatin 40 mg/day appeared to be the best strategy for lowering CRP (Rank P = 0.18, WMD = -4.07, 95% CI = [-6.52, -1.77]). The same was true for the high-sensitivity CRP, non-acute coronary syndrome (ACS), <12 months duration, and clear measurement subgroups. In the CRP subgroup (rank P = 0.79, WMD = -1.23, 95% CI = [-2.48, -0.08]) and ≥12-month duration subgroup (Rank P = 0.40, WMD = -2.13, 95% CI = [-4.24, -0.13]), atorvastatin 80 mg/day was most likely to be the best. There were no significant differences in the dyslipidemia and ACS subgroups (P > 0.05).

The data was presented by an odds ratio (OR) with an accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI). We then generated forest plots calculated by fixed-effects or random-effects model. This study enrolled a total of 201 studies (140 papers). Our analysis showed a higher frequency of methylation of the CpG islands in GC tissues compared to non-neoplastic tissues. Besides, the data demonstrated that polygene's aberrant promoter methylation might be linked to the initial development and progression of GC. The genes with altered DNA methylation might serve as epigenetic biomarkers, providing a promising molecular diagnostic and prognostic tool for human GC.

To identify the efficacy and tolerability of different treatments for MOG-AD. Systematic search in Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to March 1, 2021, were performed. Published articles including patients with MOG-AD and reporting the efficacy or tolerability of two or more types of treatment in preventing relapses were included. Reported outcomes including incidence of relapse, annualized relapse rate (ARR), and side effects were extracted. Network meta-analysis with a random-effect model within a Bayesian framework was conducted. Between group comparisons were estimated using Odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% credible intervals (CrI). Twelve studies that compared the efficacy of 10 different treatments in preventing MOG-AD relapse, including 735 patients, were analyzed. In terms of incidence of relapse, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), oral corticosteroids (OC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine (AZA), and rituximab (RTX) were all significantly more effective than no treatment (ORs ranged from 0.075 to 0.34). On the contrary, disease-modifying therapy (DMT) (OR=1.3, 95% CrI: 0.31 to 5.0) and tacrolimus (TAC) (OR=5.9, 95% CrI: 0.19 to 310) would increase the incidence of relapse. Compared with DMT, IVIG significantly reduced the ARR (MD=-0.85, 95% CrI: -1.7 to -0.098). AZA, MMF, OC and RTX showed a trend to decrease ARR, but those results did not reach significant differences. The combined results for relapse rate and adverse events, as well as ARR and adverse events showed that IVIG and OC were the most effective and tolerable therapies. Whilst DMT should be avoided, IVIG and OC may be suited as first-line therapies for patients with MOG-AD. RTX, MMF, and AZA present suitable alternatives.","meta_analysis","wim"

In this study, 193 MHD patients were enrolled and sleep quality was assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to explore the risk factors for sleep disturbance in MHD patients, including demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters, and that a prediction model was developed on the basis of risk factors by two-way stepwise regression. The final prediction model is displayed by nomogram and verified internally by bootstrap resampling procedure. The prevalence of sleep disturbance and severe sleep disturbance in MHD patients was 63.73 and 26.42%, respectively. Independent risk factors for sleep disturbance in MHD patients included higher 0.1*age (OR = 1.476, 95% CI: 1.103-1.975, P = 0.009), lower albumin (OR = 0.863, 95% CI: 0.771-0.965, P = 0.010), and lower 10*calcium levels (OR = 0.747, 95% CI: 0.615-0.907, P = 0.003). In addition, higher 0.1*age, lower albumin levels, and anxiety were independently associated with severe sleep disturbance in MHD patients. A risk prediction model of sleep disturbance in MHD patients showed that the concordance index after calibration is 0.736, and the calibration curve is approximately distributed along the reference line. Older age, lower albumin and calcium levels are higher risk factors of sleep disturbance in MHD, and the prediction model for the assessment of sleep disturbance in MHD patients has excellent discrimination and calibration.","misc","wim"

We hypothesize that oncogene overlap and MET amplicon size decline with increase in MET plasma copy number (pCN), thus enriching for MET-dependent states. We interrogated cell-free DNA NGS results of 16,782 patients with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC to identify those with MET amplification as reported using Guardant360. Co-occurring genomic mutations and copy number alterations within each sample were evaluated. An exploratory method of adjusting for tumor fraction was also performed and amplicon size for MET was analyzed when available. MET amplification was detected in 207 (1.2%) of samples. pCN ranged from 2.1 to 52.9. Of these, 43 (20.8%) had an overlapping oncogenic driver, including 23 (11.1%) METex14 skipping or other MET mutations. The degree of (non-MET) oncogene overlap decreased with increases in pCN. Patients with MET pCN ≥ 2.7 had lower rates of overlapping drivers compared to those with MET pCN < 2.7 (6.1% vs. 16.3%, P = .033). None of the 7 patients with pCN > 6.7 had an overlapping driver. After adjusting for tumor fraction, adjusted pCN (ApCN) was also lower for those with overlapping drivers than those without (median ApCN 4.9 vs. 7.3, P =.024). There was an inverse relationship between amplicon size and pCN. We propose that a high MET pCN and/or ApCN, together with the absence of overlapping oncogenic drivers and small MET amplicon size, will enrich for patients most likely to derive benefit from MET targeted therapy.","misc","wim"

We aimed to study the relationship between PCSK9 levels, genetic polymorphisms, and stroke outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke. A total of 9,782 acute ischemic stroke patients registered in the China National Stroke Registry-III were included in this prospective study. Circulating PCSK9 concentrations and 11 key single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined. The clinical outcomes included stroke recurrence, death, and poor functional outcome at 12 months. The median PCSK9 level was 361.28 ng/mL. After adjusting for confounders, patients in the highest quartile of circulating PCSK9 had a relatively lower risk of 12-month stroke recurrence (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67-0.96). No significant relationship between PCSK9 level and death or poor functional outcome was found. No significant relationship between SNPs and stroke outcomes at 12 months was found.

Patients with a BAV have an increased risk of aneurysm formation and the development of an aortic dissection. Vascular smooth muscle cells in both the non- and dilated aortic wall are characterized by a maturation defect in all BAV patients, as compared to patients with a tricuspid aortic valve, which can contribute to inherent developmental susceptibility. Besides structural abnormalities of the vascular wall, a turbulent blood flow, caused by bicuspid valve geometry, could expedite the pathological process in the aortic wall, leading to aortopathy. Although the risk for aortopathy is significant, not all BAV patients experience (acute) aortic complications in their lifespan, highlighting the complexity of the pathogenetic process. Recent studies have focused on the embryonic development of semilunar valves and the ascending aortic wall. Their findings highlight that a defect in the embryogenesis could not only explain the development of a malformed aortic valve but also the increased risk for ascending aorta and arch pathology. This review presents an overview of the normal and abnormal development of the aortic valve and the aortic wall: a common defect in early embryogenesis causes the development of a BAV and associated aortopathy.","misc","wim"

A visual analysis of the clinical ECG register provides the cardiologist with vital physiological information to determine the patient's heart condition. Because of its clinical significance, there is a strong interest in algorithms and medical ECG measuring devices that acquire, preserve, and process ECG recordings with high fidelity. Bearing this in mind, the proposed electronic device is based on four different mathematical models describing macroscopic heartbeat dynamics with ordinary differential equations. Firstly, we produce full 12-lead ECG profiles by implementing a model comprising a network of heterogeneous oscillators. Then, we implement a discretized reaction-diffusion model in our electronic device to reproduce ECG waveforms from various rhythm disorders. Finally, in order to show the versatility and capabilities of our system, we include two additional models, a ring of three coupled oscillators and a model based on a quasiperiodic motion, which can reproduce a wide range of pathological conditions. With this, the proposed device can reproduce around thirty-two cardiac rhythms with the possibility of exploring different parameter values to simulate new arrhythmias with the same hardware. Our system, which is a hybrid analog-digital circuit, generates realistic ECG signals through digital-to-analog converters whose amplitudes and waveforms are controlled through an interactive and friendly graphic interface. Our ECG patient simulator arises as a promising platform for assessing the performance of electrocardiograph equipment and ECG signal processing software in clinical trials.

Understanding how long the humoral immune response induced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) inactivated vaccine lasts is important to create an effective immunization scheme. This study aimed to detect the first, third, sixth month concentrations and seroconversion rates of the antibodies induced by the inactivated vaccine. The study included 282 healthcare workers who were vaccinated at days 0 and 28 by the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 μg/0.5ml). Anti-S-RBD-IgG (receptor binding domain) antibody concentrations and seroconversion rates were examined in vaccinated healthcare workers at the first, third and sixth months after the vaccination. MAGLUMI SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG (CLIA) (Snibe Diagnostics, Chinese) kit was used for the detection of antibodies. The mean age of the healthcare workers was 38.93 ± 10.59 (min= 21-max= 64). After the administration of the second vaccine dose, the participants were found to be reactive for anti-SRBD-IgG antibodies by 98.2% and 97.8% at the first and third months, respectively,. The decrease in the mean plasma concentrations of anti-S-RBD IgG was observed as 56.7% in the cohort with only two doses of the vaccine (first month: 42.4 AU/ml versus third month: 18.2 AU/ml). In the cohort with a history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prior to the vaccination, the decrease was observed as 25.1% (first month: 58.29 versus third month: 43.64 AU/ml) and at a mean of 57.4 (0-90) days prior to vaccination, the decrease rate was 43.1% (first month: 55.05 AU/ml versus third month: 31.28 AU/ml), keeping more stable in participants infected at a mean of 183.1 (91-330) days prior to vaccination(a decrease of 5.2%; with 62.34 AU/ml at first and 59.08 AU/ml at third months). At the end of the sixth month, antibodies could not be detected in 16.7% of people who (n= 42) received two doses of the inactivated vaccine, and the amount of anti-S-RDB IgG decreased by an average of 52.5% compared to the third month, and by 74.8% compared to the first month. Antibody concentrations at the first, third, and sixth months after the vaccination with two doses of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were found to be decreased and at the sixth month, the rate of non-reactive people was 16.7%. As participants who had COVID-19 at a mean of 181 (90-330) days before the vaccination presented with a more stable antibody level, it can be concluded that a booster at months 6-12, resulting in a schedule of 0-1-6 months, is recommended for the inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for effective herd immunity.","misc","wim"
"718",35966478,"Experiences of siblings to children with autism spectrum disorder.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is prevalent globally resulting in increased awareness and understanding of the disorder internationally and to a lesser extent in Southern African countries. This understanding has predominantly been in relation to the impact of the disorder on the neurodivergent child and family relations. Internationally, limited research has explored the impact on neurotypical siblings who have been raised alongside children diagnosed with ASD, with a dearth of such studies emerging from the South African context. The importance of neurotypical siblings' developmental experiences emerging from their immediate environment is significant within the traditionally collectivist nation of South Africa. For this reason, this study aimed to explore South African neurotypical siblings' experiences of living with a brother or sister diagnosed with ASD; through a qualitative study adopting an interpretative phenomenological design. Semi-structured interviews, aimed at generating demographic data and exploring the experiences of being raised alongside a sibling diagnosed with ASD, were conducted with eight university students. The data generated were analyzed employing the five stages of interpretive phenomenological analysis approach. Themes of emotional burden, perceived family dynamics, acceptance, and identity development emerged through data analysis. The participants reported experiences of pre-mature development, unfair treatment, and feelings of being overburdened, along with reported efforts toward acceptance of their sibling's diagnosis, and support from community members. Consequently, an understanding that their neurodivergent sibling played a key role in the development of their identities and career trajectories emerged. The impact of being raised alongside a sibling diagnosed with ASD highlights the need for additional support for neurotypical individuals, supported by programs to enhance awareness about ASD in the general South African community. These interventions would be aimed at mitigating the impact of heightened childhood stress, stigmatization, and marginalization.","misc","wim"

A novel under-actuated soft adhesion actuator (USAA) proposed in this paper for climbing robots can generate adhesion through robot's load applied to the actuator. The actuator is composed of a soft film/substrate structure with an annular groove on the substrate and a cavity on the soft film. To fabricate the actuator, we first study the influence of the geometric parameters of the USAA on the maximum adhesion of the actuator by analysis and experiments, and then combine these parameters and the boundary conditions of the static meniscus in the mold to design the mold. Moreover, we fabricate a climbing robot equipped with USAAs and evaluate its performance on horizontal and inclined surfaces with a wide range of characteristics. The USAA can generate strong and controllable adhesion to various smooth and semi-smooth surfaces. Furthermore, the fabricated robot performs well on various surfaces under a certain load (at least 500 g) and speed (369 mm/min) through experiments. It's adaptability to a variety of surfaces enables a wide range of applications and pushes the boundaries of soft adhesion actuators.","misc","wim"

Central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE), central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE), and arteriole-to-venule ratio (AVR) were measured using the Parr-Hubbard-Knudtson formula. Univariate and multivariate regressions were used to determine the association of CRAE, CRVE, and AVR with age, sex, smoking status, presence of cilioretinal artery, and AMD severity at baseline and 5 years using the 9-step AMD severity score. Only CRAE and CRVE were higher in men (P < 0.001), current smokers (P < 0.001), and the eyes with a cilioretinal artery (P=0.009 - 0.043). AMD severity was greater in older patients (P=0.001), current smokers (P=0.012), the eyes without a cilioretinal artery (P=0.001), and lower AVR (P=0.034) on multivariate regression but was not influenced by CRAE or CRVE (P=0.240 - 0.500). Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) presence was associated with older age (P=0.003) and absence of a cilioretinal artery (P=0.009), while central geographic atrophy (CGA) was associated with narrower CRAE (P=0.002) and possibly AVR (P=0.046). None of the retinal vessel parameters were predictive of AMD severity score or new onset of CNV or CGA at 5 years. A lower arteriole-to-venule ratio may be associated with AMD severity, with narrower arterioles seen in the eyes with geographic atrophy, suggesting a role of the retinal vasculature in AMD pathophysiology.

Thus, additional studies on the mechanisms underlying tamoxifen resistance and more specific prognostic biomarkers are required. In this study, we investigated the role of the SET domain containing 1A (SETD1A), a histone H3-lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase, in the development of tamoxifen resistance in BC. Methods: The relationship between tamoxifen resistance and SETD1A protein level was investigated using resistant cell lines derived from the parent BC cells. Biochemical and molecular assays, such as RNA-sequencing, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, chromatin-immunoprecipitation, and protein-binding assays, were used to identify the SETD1A target gene in tamoxifen-resistant BC cells. Additionally, the role of SETD1A in cancer stem cells (CSCs) was investigated using CSCs isolated from tamoxifen-resistant BC cells. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis and immunofluorescence staining using clinical datasets and tissue microarray were performed to determine the correlation between the expression of the SETD1A-SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) pair and recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients with BC. Results: SETD1A was expressed at higher levels in tamoxifen-resistant BC cells than in primary BC cells. Notably, SETD1A-depleted tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells showed restored sensitivity to tamoxifen, whereas SETD1A overexpression in MCF-7 cells resulted in decreased sensitivity. SETD1A is recruited to the SOX2 gene via its interaction with SOX2, thereby enhancing the expression of SOX2 genes in tamoxifen-resistant BC cells. The growth of tamoxifen-resistant cells and CSCs was effectively suppressed by SETD1A knockdown. In addition, high levels of SETD1A and SOX2 were significantly correlated with a low survival rate in patients with ER-positive tamoxifen-resistant BC. Conclusion: Our findings provide the first evidence of the critical role of the SETD1A-SOX2 axis in tamoxifen-resistant BC cells, implying that SETD1A may serve as a molecular target and prognostic indicator of a therapeutic response in patients with tamoxifen-resistant BC.","misc","wim"

This study establishes a multiplex droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method for simultaneously detecting five high-risk bacterial biothreats: Yersinia pestis, Bacillus anthracis, Brucella spp., Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Francisella tularensis. Unlike conventional multiplex real-time PCR (qPCR) methods, the multiplex ddPCR assay was developed using two types of probe fluorophores, allowing the assay to perform with a common two-color ddPCR system. After optimization, the assay performance was evaluated, showing a lower limit of detection (LOD) (0.1-1.0 pg/μL) and good selectivity for the five bacteria targets. The multiplex assay's ability to simultaneously detect two or more kinds of targets in a sample was also demonstrated. The assay showed strong sample tolerance when testing simulated soil samples; the LOD for bacteria in soil was 2 × 102-2 × 103 colony-forming unit (CFU)/100 mg soil (around 5-50 CFU/reaction), which was 10-fold lower than that of the single-target qPCR method. When testing simulated soil samples at bacterial concentrations of 2 × 103-2 × 104 CFU/100 mg soil, the assay presented a higher sensitivity (100%, 35/35) than that of the qPCR method (65.71%, 23/35) and a good specificity (100%, 15/15). These results suggest that the developed 5-plex ddPCR method is more sensitive than conventional qPCR methods and is potentially suitable for rapidly detecting or screening the five selected bacterial biothreats in suspicious samples.","misc","wim"

In the present report, five cardenolides isolated from the aerial parts of the plant (calactin, calotropin, 12β-hydroxycalactin, 12β,6'-dihydroxycalotropin, and 16α-hydroxycalotropin) were investigated for their biological effects on a human hepatocarcinoma cell line. Cell viability was monitored by an MTT assay. The occurrence of apoptosis was evaluated by detecting caspase-3 activation and chromatin fragmentation. The ability of these compounds to induce autophagy was analysed by monitoring two markers of the autophagic process, LC3 and p62. Our results indicated that all cardenolides had cytotoxic effects, with IC50 ranging from 0.127 to 6.285 μM. All compounds were able to induce apoptosis and autophagy, calactin being the most active one. Some of them also caused a reduction in cell migration and a partial block of the cell cycle into the S-phase. The present study suggests that selected cardenolides from aerial parts of P. tomentosa, particularly calactin, possess potentially desirable properties for further investigation as anticancer agents.","misc","wim"

"1773",35958202,"Shift in subsistence crop dominance from broomcorn millet to foxtail millet around 5500 BP in the western Loess Plateau.","Broomcorn and foxtail millet were the most important crops in northern China during the Neolithic period. Although the significance of broomcorn millet in human subsistence exceeded that of foxtail millet during the early Neolithic, this pattern was reversed by the end of Neolithic period. However, the process underlying this shift remains unclear. The recent excavation of the Gedachuan (GDC) in Zhangjiachuan county has revealed an abundance of relics including millet crop remains from relatively continuous strata of the Yangshao and Qijia cultures, and therefore provides a unique opportunity to examine how and when foxtail millet replaced broomcorn millet as the dominant crop in the western Loess Plateau during the Neolithic period. In this study, we identify 1,738 and 2,686 broomcorn and foxtail millet remains, respectively, from 74 flotation samples, accounting for 38.81% and 59.98% of total plant remains, respectively. Compared with 23 direct dates of carbonized crop grains in GDC, we propose that the weight of foxtail millet in plant subsistence of GDC first exceeded that of broomcorn millet as early as ∼5,500 BP, filling an important gap in the archaeobotanical record from the western Loess Plateau. Further comparative analysis of multidisciplinary data suggests the shift in significance of these two millet crops during the late Neolithic may have been triggered by variations in human settlement intensity and climate change in the western Loess Plateau. The results of this study also suggest that the Banpo Phase of Yangshao Culture survived in the western Loess Plateau as late as ∼5,600 BP.","misc","wim"

The Cooperation network shows that the United States, Harvard Medical School, and Frontiers in Immunology were the most active country, institute, and journal in this field, respectively. Co-occurrence analysis divided all keywords into four clusters: people, animals, cells, and diseases. The latest keyword within all clusters was COVID, and the most frequently occurring keyword was SCFA. Gut microbiota and host immune response remain a research hotspot, and their relation to cancer, CNS disorders, and autoimmune disease has been explored.

This reaction is considered both a potentially important step in industrial water treatment and an attractive, commercially relevant synthetic pathway. Surprisingly, an important factor, the role of the reaction medium on the reduction performance, has so far been overlooked. Here, we report a pronounced effect of the solvent on the reaction kinetics in the presence of silver and gold nanoparticles. We demonstrate that the addition of methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol to the reaction mixture leads to a dramatic decrease in the reaction rate. For typical concentrations of reactants, the reduction is completely suppressed in the presence of 50 vol% alcohols. 4-NiP reduction rate in aqueous alcohol mixtures can, however, be improved noticeably by increasing the borohydride concentration or the reaction temperature. The analysis of various factors responsible for solvent effects reveals that the decrease in the reduction rate in the presence of alcohols is related, amongst others, to a substantially higher oxygen solubility in alcohols compared to water. The results of this work show that the effects of solvent properties on reaction kinetics must be considered for unambiguous comparison and optimization of the catalytic performance of metallic nanoparticles in the liquid phase 4-NiP reduction.","misc","wim"

It is treated with palliative therapies, consisting of repeated drainages and sometimes instillation of chemotherapy. Since the nineties, surgery has been combined with more effective systemic chemotherapy, intraperitoneal chemotherapy and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for the treatment of PC. This combination therapy significantly increases the overall survival of selected PC patients. The understanding of how intraperitoneal chemotherapy and HIPEC can cure patients is still unclear. Experts hypothesized that the efficacy is obtained by the ability of high peritoneal drug exposure and hyperthermia to directly kill cancer cells. Several studies indicate that cancer cells death directly influences the response of the immune system. For this reason, the protective effect of intraperitoneal chemotherapy and HIPEC could be mediated by its ability to kill cancer cells in an immuno-genic way, causing an efficient anticancer immune response. In this review, we investigate the role of the innate peritoneal or locoregional therapy-induced immune response in PC therapy.","misc","wim"

Patients with TAO did not receive treatment for the disease and did not have exposed keratitis. Patients with TAO (TAO group) and healthy individuals (control group) were compared. All samples were swabbed at the conjunctival vault of the lower eyelid. The V3 to V4 region of the 16S rDNA was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 Sequencing Platform. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze the differences between the groups and the correlation between ocular surface microbiota and the disease. The ocular surface microbiota of patients and healthy individuals were cultured. The ocular surface microbiota structure of TAO patients changed significantly. The average relative abundance of Bacillus and Brevundimonas increased significantly in the TAO group. Corynebacterium had a significantly decreased relative abundance (P<0.05). Paracoccus, Haemophilus, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium were positively correlated with the severity of clinical manifestations or disease activity (P<0.05). Bacillus cereus and other opportunistic pathogens were obtained by culture from TAO patients. This study found that the composition of ocular microbiota in patients with TAO was significantly different from that in healthy individuals. The ocular surface opportunistic pathogens, such as Bacillus, Brevundimonas, Paracoccus, and Haemophilus in TAO patients, increase the potential risk of ocular surface infection.

However, the molecular mechanism of OS occurrence is not completely clear. Thus, we screened potential biomarkers of OS and analyze their prognostic value. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were used to analyze the differential lncRNAs in patients with OS of different immune score and the lncRNAs expressed by immune cells. Cox regression was used to develop the prognosis prediction model and specify the prognosis outcomes. Risk-proportional regression model was constructed, and the samples were divided into high and low groups based on the risk scores for the survival analysis. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were calculated and the risk-score model was verified. Finally, using 4 gene sets (comprising chemokines, immune checkpoint blockades, immune activity-related genes, and immune cells), and 4 analysis tools (CIBERSORT, TIMER, XCELL and MCP) to evaluated tumor immune infiltration. Twenty-nine long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) were obtained from the intersection of the screened lncRNAs. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 8-antisense RNA 1 (CARD8-AS1), lncRNA five prime to Xist (FTX), KAT8 regulatory NSL complex unit 1-antisense RNA 1 (KANSL1-AS1), Neuroplastin Intronic Transcript 1 (NPTN-IT1), oligodendrocyte maturation-associated long intervening non-coding RNA (OLMALINC) and RPARP Antisense RNA 1 (RPARP-AS1) were found to be correlated with survival. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis showed risk score [HR (hazard ratio) 3.5, P value 0.0043; HR 3.7, P value 0.0033] and metastasis (HR 4.7, P value 6.60E-05; HR 4.8, P value 8.36E-05) were the key factors of patients with OS. The areas under curves (AUCs) of the 1-, 3-, and 5-year ROC curves of the prognostic model were 0.715, 0.729, and 0.771. The low-risk patients tended to have a high abundance of immune cells. This study showed that a risk score based on 6 lncRNAs has potential value in the prognosis of OS, and patients with low-risk scores have high immune cell infiltration and good prognosis. This study may enrich understandings of underlying mechanisms related to the occurrence and development of OS.","misc","wim"

This study aimed to construct a prognostic prediction model for ESCC patients undergoing nCRT and surgery based on immune and inflammation-related indicators. We retrospectively analyzed the levels of serum immune- and inflammation-related indicators of ESCC patients before receiving nCRT plus surgery in the training cohort (99 patients) and validation cohort (67 patients), which were collected from 2007 to 2020. Univariate and multivariate Cox survival analyses were conducted to evaluate the indicators to set up a nomogram associated with the patients' overall survival (OS). The prediction accuracy and discriminative ability of the nomogram were measured by the concordance index (C-index), decision curve, calibration curve, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses demonstrated that immune globin A (IgA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were independent risk factors. A nomogram based on IgA, CRP, and cTNM stage was established for predicted OS in the training cohort and validated in the validation cohort. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.820 (95% CI: 0.705-0.934), which was higher than that of the cTNM stage (0.655 (95% CI: 0.546-0.764), p < 0.05) in the training cohort, and similar results were observed in the validation cohort (0.832 (95% CI: 0.760-0.903 vs 0.635 (95% CI: 0.509-0.757), p < 0.001). Furthermore, the prediction accuracy and net benefit of the nomogram verified by the calibration curve, decision curve, NRI, and IDI were satisfactory in the training and validation cohorts. The newly constructed nomogram concluding serum IgA, CRP, and cTNM stage might be helpful in the prognosis prediction for ESCC patients receiving nCRT plus surgery.","misc","wim"

However, the mechanisms underlying immune cell regulation in gram-negative sepsis remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the potential regulatory mechanisms and identified the key genes related to immune cells in gram-negative sepsis. The RNA-sequencing data for gram-negative sepsis samples and normal samples were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE9960. CIBERSORT was performed to analyze the proportion of 22 types of immune cells in gram-negative sepsis and normal samples. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to determine the networks that are associated with the differentially distributed immune cells in the two groups. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the limma package. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithms were applied to ascertain hub gene signatures. The gene interaction network of hub gene signatures was determined by ingenuity pathway analysis. Furthermore, the expression levels of the key genes were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). CIBERSORT analysis showed that the proportions of plasma cells, resting CD4+ memory T cells, M1 macrophages, and eosinophils were significantly different between gram-negative sepsis and normal samples. WGCNA identified 1,100 genes in the most relevant modules associated with these immune cells. In addition, 87 differentially expressed genes were identified. By overlapping the genes found in the WGCNA and the differentially expressed genes, a total of 46 genes related to immune cells were identified. Integrative analysis of LASSO and SVM-RFE identified NLR family CARD domain-containing 4 (NLRC4) and ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator like 4 (RGL4) as key gene signatures related to immune cells in gram-negative sepsis. The qRT-PCR results demonstrated that both NLRC4 and RGL4 were upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with sepsis. This investigation provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of immune cells involved in the pathogenesis of gram-negative sepsis. NLRC4 and RGL4 were identified as key gene signatures related to immune cells and may act as potential diagnostic biomarkers for gram-negative sepsis.","misc","wim"

The aim of this study was to describe the movement characteristics performed during exercise in custom-designed exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises among patients who have undergone unilateral total knee replacement (TKR). In addition, the secondary aim was to assess the relation of these exercise methods, and to assess participants' perceived exertion and knee pain during exergaming and exercising. Patients up to 4 months after the TKR surgery were invited in a single-visit exercise laboratory session. A 2D motion analysis and force plates were employed to evaluate movement characteristics as the volume, range, and intensity of movement performed during custom-designed knee extension-flexion and weight shifting exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises post TKR. The perceived exertion and knee pain were assessed using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion and Visual Analog Scale, respectively. Evaluation of seven patients with TKR [age median (IQR), 65 (10) years] revealed that the volume and intensity of movement were mostly higher during exergames. Individual goniometer-measured knee range of motion were achieved either with exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises, especially in knee extension exercises. The perceived exertion and knee pain were similar after exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises. During custom-designed exergaming the patients with TKR achieve the movement characteristics appropriate for post-TKR rehabilitation without increasing the stress and pain experienced even though the movement characteristics might be partly different from conventional therapeutic exercises by the volume and intensity of movement. Physical therapists could consider implementing such exergames in rehabilitation practice for patients with TKR once effectiveness have been approved and they are widely available.","misc","wim"

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics, risk factors, diagnostic methods, management, and clinical outcomes of patients with VTE. This study was based on a VTE registry created over ten years at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All adult inpatients and outpatients referred to the thrombosis unit of the KFMC with clinically suspected VTE including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were enrolled. Data were collected using a standardized case report form, which included demographic and clinical characteristics, risk factors, diagnostic methods, management, and outcomes. A total of 1,008 patients were recruited. Most patients were women (73.2%), and more than half of all patients had unprovoked VTE (58%). Among the provoked cases, the most frequent cause was surgery (29.8%), followed by hospitalization (24.2%). There was a significant statistical association between provoked status and sex, family history of VTE, smoking, recent hospitalization within 3 months for a medical condition, the site of VTE, and underlying peripheral vascular disease and varicose veins (all p < 0.05). The majority (88.3%) of patients with deep vein thrombosis was hospitalized for ≤3 days (n = 433, 79.9%), while fewer than half of the patients with PE needed hospitalization (45.3%). Thrombolytic therapy was administered to 14.1% (n = 142) of patients, and catheter-directed thrombolysis was performed in 1.0% (n = 10) of patients. The odds of mortality for provoked VTE were 3.20 times higher than those of unprovoked VTE [2.12-4.83; p-value < 0.001]. Unprovoked VTE was more common than provoked VTE in the Saudi Arabian cohort, implying hereditary predisposition. Furthermore, male sex, family history of VTE, prior history of VTE, type of VTE, underlying obesity, history of trauma, surgery, hospitalization, pregnancy, and 3-6 months of anticoagulation therapy were the most critical risk factors for VTE recurrence.

RNA-sequencing data was utilized to determine the differentially expressed circRNAs, and circHIPK2 was established as a novel prospective circRNA. The expressions of circRNAs along with messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in NPC tissues and cells was assessed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the transfection of NPC cells with plasmids in vitro and in vivo was adopted to explore the effects of circHIPK2 in NPC. Western blotting was adopted to assess the expressions of HIPK2 and β-catenin, while Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8 assay coupled with colony-forming assay were utilized to assess the biological functions. The expression of nuclear and cytoplasmic HIPK2 was detected via nucleocytoplasmic separation assay. Herein, we established that circHIPK2 was upregulated in NPC tissues. Over-expression of circHIPK2 promoted cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and further studies revealed it inhibited the protein level of HIPK2 in a post-transcriptional pattern, decreasing β-catenin expression and suppressing the proliferation of NPC.

The highest specific surface area of AC was estimated at 1300 to 1500 m2/g, which presented characteristics of microporous materials. SEM micrographs revealed that chemical activation using an impregnation reagent ZnCl2 increases the porosity of the AC, which in turn leads to an increase in the surface area, and the SEM image showed that particle size diameter ranged between 48.88 and 69.95 nm. The performance of prepared AC for adsorption of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) dye was tested. The results showed that the adsorption percentage by AC (2.5 g/L) was equal to 94.76% after just 15 min, and the percentage of removal increased to be ~100% after 60 min.

"170",35966281,"Decoding Neuropathic Pain: Can We Predict Fluctuations of Propagation Speed in Stimulated Peripheral Nerve?","To understand neural encoding of neuropathic pain, evoked and resting activity of peripheral human C-fibers are studied via microneurography experiments. Before different spiking patterns can be analyzed, spike sorting is necessary to distinguish the activity of particular fibers of a recorded bundle. Due to single-electrode measurements and high noise contamination, standard methods based on spike shapes are insufficient and need to be enhanced with additional information. Such information can be derived from the activity-dependent slowing of the fiber propagation speed, which in turn can be assessed by introducing continuous background 0.125-0.25 Hz electrical stimulation and recording the corresponding responses from the fibers. Each fiber's speed propagation remains almost constant in the absence of spontaneous firing or additional stimulation. This way, the responses to the background stimulation can be sorted by fiber. In this article, we model the changes in the propagation speed resulting from the history of fiber activity with polynomial regression. This is done to assess the feasibility of using the developed models to enhance the spike shape-based sorting. In addition to human microneurography data, we use animal in-vitro recordings with a similar stimulation protocol as higher signal-to-noise ratio data example for the models.","misc","wim"

To date, only invasive surgical options are available to treat cardiovascular calcification despite the growing understanding of underlying pathological mechanisms. Key players in vascular calcification are vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which transform into calcifying SMCs and secrete mineralizing extracellular vesicles that form microcalcifications, subsequently increasing plaque instability and consequential plaque rupture. There is an increasing, practical need for a large scale and inexhaustible source of functional SMCs. Here we describe an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived model of SMCs by differentiating iPSCs toward SMCs to study the pathogenesis of vascular calcification. Specifically, we characterize the proteome during iPSC differentiation to better understand the cellular dynamics during this process. First, we differentiated human iPSCs toward an induced-SMC (iSMC) phenotype in a 10-day protocol. The success of iSMC differentiation was demonstrated through morphological analysis, immunofluorescent staining, flow cytometry, and proteomics characterization. Proteomics was performed throughout the entire differentiation time course to provide a robust, well-defined starting and ending cell population. Proteomics data verified iPSC differentiation to iSMCs, and functional enrichment of proteins on different days showed the key pathways changing during iSMC development. Proteomics comparison with primary human SMCs showed a high correlation with iSMCs. After iSMC differentiation, we initiated calcification in the iSMCs by culturing the cells in osteogenic media for 17 days. Calcification was verified using Alizarin Red S staining and proteomics data analysis. This study presents an inexhaustible source of functional vascular SMCs and calcifying vascular SMCs to create an in vitro model of vascular calcification in osteogenic conditions, with high potential for future applications in cardiovascular calcification research.","misc","wim"

This highlights the elusiveness of meeting unmet needs in existing pharmacotherapies for treatment-resistant depression. There is accumulating evidence that antidepressant agents involving the glutamatergic system such as brexpiprazole and esketamine/ketamine have more rapid onset of action and potentially improved effectiveness as an augmentation therapy in treatment-resistant depression. This case series aimed to report five complex cases of unipolar and bipolar treatment-resistant depression where conventional treatment strategies were inadequate in managing high risk suicidal behavior and achieving functional recovery. We discussed further the possible synergistic mechanisms of the novel combination strategy of brexpiprazole and esketamine/ketamine, clinical and patient factors that influenced treatment response, challenges with this combination strategy and implications for future practice and research.","misc","wim"

The transcatheter endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) affords a minimally invasive technique to save the lives of these critical patients, and an appropriate stent-graft gets to be the key medical device during an EVAR procedure. Herein, we report a trilayer stent-graft and corresponding delivery system used for the treatment of the AD disease. The stent-graft is made of nitinol stents with an asymmetric Z-wave design and two expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membranes. Each of the inner and outer surfaces of the stent-graft was covered by an ePTFE membrane, and the two membranes were then sintered together. The biological studies of the sintered ePTFE membranes indicated that the stent-graft had excellent cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility in vitro. Both the stent-graft and the delivery system exhibited satisfactory mechanical properties and operability. The safety and efficacy of this stent-graft and the corresponding delivery system were demonstrated in vivo. In nine canine experiments, the blood vessels of the animals implanted with the stent-grafts were of good patency, and there were no thrombus and obvious stenosis by angiography after implantation for 6 months. Furthermore, all of the nine clinical cases experienced successful implantation using the stent-graft and its postrelease delivery system, and the 1-year follow-ups indicated the preliminary safety and efficacy of the trilayer stent-graft with an asymmetric Z-wave design for interventional treatment.","misc","wim"

The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib as third-line or above therapy for patients with HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Patients with HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer who have failed from prior therapy and treated with anlotinib monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy or immunotherapy from June 2018 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed based on real-world clinical practice. The primary end point was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS) and safety. 47 patients with HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer received anlotinib monotherapy or combination therapy as third-line or above therapy. In the general population, 10 patients achieved PR, 25 patients had SD and 12 patients had PD. The overall ORR and DCR were 21.3% and 74.5%, respectively. Subgroup analysis suggested that there were no statistically significant differences in ORR and DCR with respect to HR status (positive vs. negative), treatment programs (monotherapy vs. combination) and treatment type in combination group (chemotherapy vs. immunotherapy). The patients who did not received previously anti-angiogenesis therapy had superior DCR (84.8% vs. 50.0%, P=0.012). Median PFS and OS were 5.0 months (95% CI=4.3-5.7) and 21.0 (95% CI=14.9-27.1) months, respectively. The PFS (6.5m vs. 3.5m, P=0.042)and OS (28.2m vs. 12.6m, P=0.040) were better in HR positive patients than HR negative patients. And simultaneously, patients who received anlotinib combination therapy obtained better PFS (5.5m vs. 3.0m, P=0.045). The incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse events(AEs) was 31.9%. Anlotinib monotherapy or combination therapy provide a viable third-line or above therapeutic strategy in patients with HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer, a median PFS of 5.0 months was obtained with well tolerated toxicity.","misc","wim"

Therefore, it is necessary to start with the logistics mode of land transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong, reduce the cost of customs clearance by land transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong, and increase the trade volume by land transportation between the two places. This paper systematically analyzes the present situation of customs clearance efficiency in China and introduces BPNN (BP neural network) algorithm to optimize customs clearance. The detailed idea and process of the algorithm are introduced, and the BPNN trained by the algorithm is applied to function approximation. The simulation results show that this scheme can not only improve the convergence speed of the algorithm in the training process but also the trained BPNN has strong adaptive and self-learning ability. Comparing the customs clearance efficiency before and after the improvement, the results show that the improved customs clearance efficiency is higher and can save a lot of time, thus verifying the effectiveness and applicability of the model-solving algorithm.","misc","wim"

Nonetheless, research focuses less on how these clinical scales interact with each other. Investigates the network structure and interaction of the MMPI-2 clinical scales between healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia through the Bayesian network. Data was collected from Wuhan Psychiatric Hospital from March 2008 to May 2018. A total of 714 patients with schizophrenia and 714 healthy subjects were identified through propensity score matching according to the criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Separated MMPI-2 clinical scales Bayesian networks were built for healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, respectively. The Bayesian network showed that the lower 7 scale was a consequence of the correlation between the lower 2 scale and the greater 8 scale. A solely lower 7 scale does yield neither a lower 2 scale nor a higher 8 scale. The proposed method showed 72% of accuracy with 78% area under the ROC curve (AUC), similar to the previous studies. The proposed method simplified the continuous Bayesian network to predict binary outcomes, including other categorical data is not explored. Besides, the participants might only represent an endemic as they come from a single hospital. This study identified MMPI-2 clinical scales correlation and built separated Bayesian networks to investigate the difference between patients with schizophrenia and healthy people. These differences may contribute to a better understanding of the clinical symptoms of schizophrenia and provide medical professionals with new perspectives for diagnosis.","misc","wim"

In the present paper, the results of studying ML techniques in a tuberculosis diagnosis loop in a scenario of limited resources are presented. Data are analyzed using a tuberculosis (TB) therapy program at a health institution in a main city of a developing country using five ML models. Logistic regression, classification trees, random forest, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks are trained under physician supervision following physicians' typical daily work. The models are trained on seven main variables collected when patients arrive at the facility. Additionally, the variables applied to train the models are analyzed, and the models' advantages and limitations are discussed in the context of the automated ML techniques. The results show that artificial neural networks obtain the best results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the receiver operating curve. These results represent an improvement over smear microscopy, which is commonly used techniques to detect TB for special cases. Findings demonstrate that ML in the TB diagnosis loop can be reinforced with available data to serve as an alternative diagnosis tool based on data processing in places where the health infrastructure is limited.","misc","wim"

One of the leading causes of drug resistance is the colonization of microorganisms in biofilm mode. Hence, there is an urgent need to design novel and highly effective biofilm inhibitors that can work either synergistically with antibiotics or individually. Therefore, we have developed a recursive regression-based platform Biofilm-i employing a quantitative structure-activity relationship approach for making generalized predictions, along with group and species-specific predictions of biofilm inhibition efficiency of chemical(s). The platform encompasses eight predictors, three analysis tools, and data visualization modules. The experimentally validated biofilm inhibitors for model development were retrieved from the aBiofilm resource and processed using a 10-fold cross-validation approach using the support vector machine and andom forest machine learning techniques. The data was further sub-divided into training/testing and independent validation sets. From training/testing data sets the Pearson's correlation coefficient of overall chemicals, Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, fungus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Escherichia coli was 0.60, 0.77, 0.62, 0.77, 0.73, 0.83, 0.70, and 0.71 respectively via Support Vector Machine. Further, all the QSAR models performed equally well on independent validation data sets. Additionally, we also checked the performance of the random forest machine learning technique for the above datasets. The integrated analysis tools can convert the chemical structure into different formats, search for a similar chemical in the aBiofilm database and design the analogs. Moreover, the data visualization modules check the distribution of experimentally validated biofilm inhibitors according to their common scaffolds. The Biofilm-i platform would be of immense help to researchers engaged in designing highly efficacious biofilm inhibitors for tackling the menace of antibiotic drug resistance.","misc","wim"

This study aimed to characterize the grazing activity and protein-energy requirements of grazing dairy goats in a Mediterranean woodland in northern Morocco by combining two sensors, the Global Positioning System (GPS) and three axis accelerometers. An experiment was conducted in a representative woodland with eight dairy goats. Measurements were undertaken during the three main grazing seasons (spring, summer, and autumn) for two consecutive and contrasting years. Grazing activity parameters were assessed using GPS collars and leg position sensors. The results showed that grazing time was higher in spring (57% and 59%) than in summer (39% and 36%) and autumn (41% and 45%), respectively, for the dry and wet years (p &lt; 0.001). During the two studied years, the daily horizontal distance traveled by the goats increased from spring (about 4.5 km) to summer (about 6.5 km) and autumn (about 7.4 km), while greater daily vertical distances were recorded over similar distances during summer-autumn. Several protein-energy intakes that were insufficient to cover the requirements of the grazing goats were recorded, especially in summer. The combination of GPS collars and accelerometers contributed to a better understanding of the grazing activities of dairy goats in the studied Mediterranean woodland. These findings provide useful data on the protein-energy balances of dairy goats and offer additional information that could be useful for herders and managers to enhance goat-feeding strategies and guarantee high-performance in the semi-extensive traditional goat farming system.","misc","wim"

When curative resection is not possible, palliative systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and platinum derivate as first line followed by a 5-FU doublet combination as second line is the standard therapy. Recently, targeted therapy and immunotherapy have rapidly emerged as personalized therapeutic approaches requiring previous tumor sequencing and molecular profiling. BRCA mutations are well-characterized targets for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). However, BRCA gene mutations in CCA are rare and few data of PARPi in the treatment of CCA are available. Immunotherapy with programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) has been shown to be effective in combination with chemotherapy or in PD-L1-positive CCA. However, data from immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy, including PARPi, are lacking. In this report, we present the case of a male patient with PD-L1-positive and BRCA2-mutated metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, who was treated with a combined therapy with PARP (PARPi), olaparib, and a PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, as second-line therapy after gemcitabine/platinum derivate failure. Combined therapy was able to induce a long-lasting complete remission for over 15 months. The combined therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Only mild anemia and immune-related thyroiditis were observed, which were easily manageable and did not result in discontinuation of olaparib and pembrolizumab. The presented case showed substantial clinical activity of a combination with olaparib/pembrolizumab in advanced BRCA2-mutated CCA. Thus, identifying targetable molecular signatures and combinations of targeted therapies with immunotherapy reveals a promising strategy to effectively treat patients with cholangiocarcinoma and should be considered after failure of standard chemotherapy.","misc","wim"

To more definitively identify these alterations, we evaluated the maternal and infant gut microbiota through the shotgun metagenomic analysis of a subset of stool specimens collected from a randomized, controlled trial in diet-controlled women with GDM. The women were fed either a CHOICE diet (60% complex carbohydrate/25% fat/15% protein, n=18) or a conventional diet (CONV, 40% complex carbohydrate/45% fat/15% protein, n=16) from 30 weeks' gestation through delivery. In contrast to other published studies, we designed the study to minimize the influence of other dietary sources by providing all meals, which were eucaloric and similar in fiber content. At 30 and 37 weeks' gestation, we collected maternal stool samples; performed the fasting measurements of glucose, glycerol, insulin, free fatty acids, and triglycerides; and administered an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to measure glucose clearance and insulin response. Infant stool samples were collected at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4-5 months of age. Maternal glucose was controlled to conventional targets in both diets, with no differences in Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). No differences in maternal alpha or beta diversity between the two diets from baseline to 37 weeks' gestation were observed. However, women on CHOICE diet had higher levels of Bifidobacteriaceae, specifically Bifidobacterium adolescentis, compared with women on CONV. Species-level taxa varied significantly with fasting glycerol, fasting glucose, and glucose AUC after the OGTT challenge. Maternal diet significantly impacted the patterns of infant colonization over the first 4 months of life, with CHOICE infants showing increased microbiome alpha diversity (richness), greater Clostridiaceae, and decreased Enterococcaceae over time. Overall, these results suggest that an isocaloric GDM diet containing greater complex carbohydrates with reduced fat leads to an ostensibly beneficial effect on the maternal microbiome, improved infant gut microbiome diversity, and reduced opportunistic pathogens capable of playing a role in obesity and immune system development. These results highlight the critical role a maternal diet has in shaping the maternal and infant microbiome in women with GDM.","misc","wim"

Laparoscopic enucleation (LE) has been applied to LHs more frequently for its potential advantages in postoperative recovery and blood loss. However, to date, LE is still a difficult and complex surgical technique especially when the hemangioma is located in the right hemi liver. The aim of this study was to analyze whether LE is superior to OE for LH in the right hemi liver. Demographics and perioperative data of patients who underwent LE or OE for LH in the right hemi liver between May 2013 and July 2020 were collected. To decrease the selection bias, patients who underwent OE in first 2 years and those underwent LE in next 5 years by a same operation team were included. The data of sex, age, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, largest tumor size, and removed tumor number were enrolled in the propensity score matching (PSM) method to compensate for differences in the baseline characteristics between LE and OE groups. The perioperative outcomes were compared between 2 matched groups after PSM method. A total of 110 patients (36 LE vs. 74 OE) were matched by age, sex, BMI, ASA grade score, largest tumor size, removed tumor number and tumor location. Finally, 34 patients in each group were retained after PSM. There were no significant differences in operative time, estimated blood loss, amount of autologous transfusion, morbidity grade and the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) on postoperative day 1 or 3 or 5. LE was associated with a significantly higher rate of use of the Pringle maneuver (P<0.001), shorter time to oral feeding (P<0.001) and shorter postoperative length of stay (P<0.001). For LHs in the right hemi liver, the perioperative safety of LE is not inferior to OE, and LE seems to achieves a faster recovery from surgery compared with OE.","misc","wim"

This study investigated the role of CEMIP in the progression and metastasis of osteosarcoma, CEMIP was found to be overexpressed in osteosarcoma tissues when compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, and its expression was positively associated with a poor prognosis in osteosarcoma patients. Silencing CEMIP decreased osteosarcoma cells proliferation, migration, and invasion, but enhanced apoptosis in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, CEMIP promoted osteosarcoma cells growth and metastasis through activating Notch signaling pathway, silencing CEMIP would reduce the protein expression and activation of Notch/Jagged1/Hes1 signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo, activation of Notch signaling pathway could partially reversed cell proliferation and migration in shCEMIP osteosarcoma cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that CEMIP plays a substantial role in the progression of osteosarcoma via Notch signaling pathway, providing a promising therapeutic target in osteosarcoma.","misc","wim"

However, it neither provides information about the functional status of spermatozoa nor addresses disorders such as idiopathic or unexplained infertility (UI). Recently, assessment of sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) has been proposed as an extended sperm test that may help overcome these inherent limitations of basic SA. In this review, we aim to: (I) discuss the pathophysiological aspects of SDF, including natural repair mechanisms, causes, and impact on reproductive outcomes; (II) explain different assessment tools of SDF, and describe potential therapeutic options to manage infertile men with high SDF; and (III) analyse the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of current research on the topic. This review was constructed from original studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses that were published over the years up until August 2021, related to the various aspects of SDF. Different mechanisms lead to high SDF, including defective chromatin packaging, apoptosis, and seminal oxidative stress. The relevance of sperm DNA integrity to male fertility/infertility has been supported by the frequent observation of high levels of SDF in infertile men, and in association with risk factors for infertility. Additionally, high SDF levels have been inversely correlated with the outcomes of natural pregnancy and assisted reproduction. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling, sperm chromatin structure assay, sperm chromatin dispersion, and Comet assay are four commonly used assays for measurement of SDF. Addressing lifestyle risks and underlying conditions, antioxidants, hormonal therapy, and advanced sperm selection techniques have all been proposed as potential therapeutic options to lower SDF. The sum of literature provides evidence of detrimental effects of high SDF on both natural and assisted fertility outcomes. Standardization of the techniques used for assessment of SDF and their incorporation into the work up of infertile couples may have significant implications on the future management of a selected category of infertile men with high SDF.","misc","wim"

A completely randomized design experiment was conducted in potted soil, artificially inoculated with the pathogen, and sown with surface-sterilized seeds of mungbean genotypes (susceptible: MNUYT-107 and highly susceptible: MNUYT-105). Concealment of plant resistance by M. phaseolina in both genotypes resulted in 53-55% disease incidence and 40-50% plant mortality, which contributed in causing a significant reduction of 30-90% in attributes of growth, biomass, yield, photosynthetic pigment, and total protein content with an imbalance of production of antioxidant enzymes (polyphenol oxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase). Soil application with Zn-based fertilizer (ZnSO4: 33%) in combination with GM significantly managed up to 80% of the charcoal rot disease, hence improving growth (50-100%) and physiochemical (30-100%) attributes and sustainably enhancing grain average yield (300-600%), biological yield (100-200%), and harvest index (100-200%) in mungbean plants.

This study investigated the physiological and molecular response mechanisms of S. caseolaris by analyzing its antioxidant defense capacity, including its differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under similar salt stress conditions. Salt treatment significantly affected the osmoprotectants and lipid peroxidation in S. caseolaris seedlings, which increased proline (Pro) content by 31.01-54.90% during all sample periods and decreased malonaldehyde (MDA) content by 12.81 and 18.17% at 25 and 40 days under 3.0% NaCl treatment. Antioxidant enzyme activities increased significantly following 3.0% NaCl treatment. Transcriptome analysis following De novo assembly showed 26,498 matched unigenes. The results showed that 1,263 DEGs responded to transcription factors (TFs) and plant phytohormones and mediated oxidoreductase activity to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the control vs. 3.0% NaCl comparison. In addition, the transcription levels of genes associated with auxin and ethylene signal transduction also changed. Under salt stress, ROS scavenging genes (POD, CAT, and APX) and part of AP2, MYB, NAC, C2C2, bHLH, and WRKY TFs were upregulated.

The genotype-specific prevalence of HPV and risk factors for HPV infection are still unclear. From 2010 to 2020, patients receiving renal transplantation surgery (referred to as RTRs), who had been screened for HPV infection one year after transplantation were enrolled. A comparison cohort of four age- and marital status-matched healthy individuals was selected for RTRs. The clinical characteristics and cervical screening results of RTRs were analyzed. Our study included 196 female renal transplant recipients (RTRs), none of whom had been vaccinated against HPV. Overall high-risk HPV (hrHPV) infection and abnormal cytology rates in the RTR group were 23.5% and 20.9%, respectively. The odds ratios of hrHPV infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ in RTRs vs. non-RTRs were 3.033 (95% CI, 2.013-4.568) and 3.628 (95% CI, 1.863-7.067), respectively. The prevalence of HPV16 in RTRs was much higher (30.4% vs. 8.3%, P=0.002). The multi-infection rate was much higher in HPV-infected RTRs (23.9% vs. 1.14%, P<0.001). The only risk factor for hrHPV infection was the duration of immunosuppression, which increased with time. RTRs had significantly higher HPV infection rates and increased risks of HPV-related cervical premalignancies and cancers due to the immunosuppressed state. The duration of immunosuppression is a risk factor for transplant recipients. Female RTRs may benefit from more frequent cervical cancer screening after renal transplantation than healthy women. Prospective research on HPV infection dynamics in RTRs and optimal screening methods should be further explored in the future.","misc","wim"
"1413",35960283,"The digital pathogen concept: epidemiological approach to problem of disorders associated with information technologies.","The article is devoted to conceptualization of current scientific experience of studying disorders associated with information technologies. Over the past decades, prevalence of information technologies in world modern society occurs with such intensity that detailed study of influence of this factor on health is significantly lagged behind. In the last decade, a number of pathological conditions associated with application of modern information technologies, in particular psychological and psychiatric profile, was described. The new concepts of Internet addiction, gambling, problematic use of technologies, etc., describing individual response of patients, are introduced. At that, lack of fundamental understanding of both etiology and pathogenesis of described conditions due to multiform specifics, high comorbidity and active evolution of digital society. The article attempts to fill this gap and to approach issue on population scale, namely to evaluate from perspective of epidemiological method characteristics of occurrence, spread and termination of pathogenic effects. The analysis of existing studies suggests that causation of emerging disorders is related not only to addictive behavior and prolonged exposure to information flow, but also to different pathogenicity of its particular components, causing various clinical forms of health disorders in individual with different levels of susceptibility. The pattern of new unique pathogen with specific propagation in human population is described - indirectly through digital environment - and capable of replication within specific ecological niche, i.e. digital pathogen tropic to bio-substrates of higher nervous activity. At that, the duration of contact with digital environment is considered as necessary but insufficient cause of development of pathological process that corresponds to empirical data. The most important property of digital pathogen propagation is its ability to replicate in anthropogenic abiotic digital environment, which is conditioned by its nature, mechanisms of accumulation and distribution. It is also noteworthy that basic principles of dissemination of information flows in social networks largely repeat principles of propagation of infectious pathogens in nature and are characterized by unique mechanism and ways of its transmission. It is concluded that in modern conditions there is a need to study problem of pathology associated with digital environment at population level from position of epidemiological method. The important aspects are joint efforts in studying and classifying new pathogen at interdisciplinary level and developing preventive measures.","misc","wim"

However, the partial usage of the full capacity and the low rate capability are caused by poor ionic and electronic conduction. In this work, the effects of two approaches, such as electrode binder carbonization by heat treatment and 3-dimensionalization by the laser structuring of ultra-thick graphite anodes to lithium-ion batteries for high energy density, are investigated. During the heat treatment, the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder is carbonized to form fluorinated graphitic carbons, thereby increasing the number of lithium-ion storage sites and the improvement of the electrode capacity by 14% (420 mAh g-1 and 20 mAh cm-2). Further, the carbonization improves the rate capability by 31% at 0.1 C by simultaneously reducing the ionic and electronic resistances. Furthermore, after the laser structuring of the carbonized electrode, the areal discharge capacity increases to 50% at the increasing current rates, resulting from drastically improved ionic conduction. In addition to the electrochemical characteristics, these two approaches contribute considerably to the fast wetting of the electrolyte into the ultra-thick electrode. The carbonization and laser structuring of the ultra-thick graphite anodes are practical approaches for high-energy batteries to overcome the thickness limitation.","misc","wim"

DC. and Deverra. triradiata Hochst. ex Bioss are perennial desert shrubs widely used traditionally for many purposes and they are characteristic for their essential oil. The objective of the present study was to investigate the in vivo wound healing activity of the essential oil (EO) of D. tortuosa and D. triradiata through their encapsulation into nanoemulsion. EO nanoemulsion was prepared using an aqueous phase titration method, and nanoemulsion zones were identified through the construction of phase diagrams. The EO was prepared by hydrodistillation (HD), microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD), and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and analyzed using GC/MS. D. tortuosa oil is rich in the non-oxygenated compound, representing 74.54, 73.02, and 41.19% in HD, MADH, and SFE, respectively, and sabinene represents the major monoterpene hydrocarbons. Moreover, D. triradiata is rich in oxygenated compounds being 69.77, 52.87, and 61.69% in HD, MADH, and SFE, respectively, with elemicin and myristicin as major phenylpropanoids. Topical application of the nanoemulsion of D. tortuosa and D. triradiata (1% or 2%) exhibited nearly 100% wound contraction and complete healing at day 16. Moreover, they exhibit significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and a significant increase in growth factors and hydroxyproline levels. Histopathological examination exhibited complete re-epithelialization accompanied by activated hair follicles and abundant collagen fibers, especially at a concentration of 2%.

"2306",35957289,"Experimental Study Regarding Long Range LiDAR Capabilities in Sensing Safety Distance for Vehicle Application.","The safety of vehicles is one of the major goals of driving automation. The safety distance is longer for rail vehicles such as trams because of the adherence limitations of the wheel-to-rail system. The major issues of fixed frontal sensing are fake target detection, blind spots related to rail slopes, curves, and random changes in the target's illumination or reflectivity. In this experimental study, distance measurements were performed using a scaled tram model equipped with a LiDAR sensor with a narrow field of view, under different conditions of illumination, size, and reflectivity of the target objects, and using different track configurations, to evaluate the effectiveness of such sensors in collision-avoidance systems for rail applications. The experimental findings are underlining the sensor's sensitivity to fake targets, objects in the sensor's blind spots, and special optical interferences, which are important for evaluating long-range LiDAR capabilities in sensing safety distance for vehicles. The conclusions can help developers to produce a dedicated colliding prevention system for trams and to identify the zones with high risk in the track where additional protection methods should be used. The LiDAR sensor must be used in conjunction with additional sensors to perform all the security tasks of an anti-colliding system for the tram.","misc","wim"

However, not all patients that could benefit from fertility preservation can use the currently available technology. In this regard, obtaining functional mature oocytes from ovarian cortical tissue in vitro would represent a major breakthrough in fertility preservation as well as in human medically assisted reproduction. In this study, we have used a microfluidics platform to culture cryopreserved-thawed human cortical tissue for a period of 8 days and evaluated the effect of two different flow rates in follicular activation and growth. The results showed that this dynamic system supported follicular development up to the secondary stage within 8 days, albeit with low efficiency. Surprisingly, the stromal cells in the ovarian cortical tissue were highly sensitive to flow and showed high levels of apoptosis when cultured under high flow rate. Moreover, after 8 days in culture, the stromal compartment showed increase levels of collagen deposition, in particular in static culture. Although microfluidics dynamic platforms have great potential to simulate tissue-level physiology, this system still needs optimization to meet the requirements for an efficient in vitro early follicular growth.","misc","wim"

However, there remains a practical challenge in the design of voltage stress, efficiency, and power density. In this paper, a single-ended resonant converter with a primary parallel resonant-matching network is investigated to absorb the bulky input-choke inductors of the Class-E inverters into the coil inductance. The analytical expressions for all the converter parameters are derived based on time-domain resonant waveforms, including: (1) analysis of critical zero-voltage switching (ZVS) conditions and (2) power transfer capabilities under the given maximum switch voltage stress. Furthermore, this paper elaborates on the design methodology of the proposed single-ended resonant converters, and an optimal operating point is chosen to ensure soft-switching operation and rated power.

However, the prognosis and risk factors for recurrence in patients with sHCC remain unclear. This study investigated the risk factors for the recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related sHCC after SBRT. A total of 240 HBV-related sHCC patients treated with SBRT between March 2011 and March 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The cumulative probability of recurrence was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with Cox proportional hazard models. Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma developed in 134 (55.8%) patients at a median time of 27 months after SBRT. The one- and two-year rates of recurrence were 20.9 and 45.0%, respectively. The median follow-up time was 30 months. The Cox multivariate analysis indicated that age (P = 0.029, HR [1.019, 1.002-1.037]), tumor size (P = 0.012, HR [1.227, 1.045-1.440]), and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (P = 0.005, HR [1.911, 1.221-2.989]) were independent risk factors for recurrence.

Proteome profiling reveals dozens of Rab proteins associated with lipid droplets (LDs), but few of them have been functionally validated. Cell death activator CIDE-3 protein mediates LD fusion and growth. It is highly enriched at LD-LD contact sites. Here, we investigated the role of Rab3D in lipid storage in adipocyte. We verified that the adipose levels of Rab3D transcript were higher than that of other Rab3 family members; the differences were most pronounced in white adipose tissue. Moreover, we showed that Rab3D promotes LD growth in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in a dose dependent manner, independently of the process of CIDE-3-mediated LD fusion. Finally, we confirmed that the GTP-bound form of Rab3D is its LD promoting form; it translocates from other vesicles to LDs during adipocyte differentiation. By contrast, the Rab3D-GDP form is retained in the cytoplasm and has no effect on LD sizes. Presented results provide evidence for the role of Rab3D in controlling formation of large LDs in adipocytes. We conclude that Rab3D is a novel LD regulator with characteristics differing from these of previously identified LD associated Rab proteins, such as Rab18 and Rab8a.","misc","wim"

However, there is lacking systematic assessment of stem-like indices and associations with a response of sorafenib in HCC. Our study thus aimed to evaluate the status of tumor dedifferentiation for HCC and further identify the regulatory mechanisms under the condition of resistance to sorafenib. Datasets of HCC, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs) expression, somatic mutation, and clinical information were collected. The mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi), which can represent degrees of dedifferentiation of HCC samples, was calculated to predict drug response of sorafenib therapy and prognosis. Next, unsupervised cluster analysis was conducted to distinguish mRNAsi-based subgroups, and gene/geneset functional enrichment analysis was employed to identify key sorafenib resistance-related pathways. In addition, we analyzed and confirmed the regulation of key genes discovered in this study by combining other omics data. Finally, Luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate their regulation. Our study demonstrated that the stemness index obtained from transcriptomic is a promising biomarker to predict the response of sorafenib therapy and the prognosis in HCC. We revealed the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway (the PPAR signaling pathway), related to fatty acid biosynthesis, that was a potential sorafenib resistance pathway that had not been reported before. By analyzing the core regulatory genes of the PPAR signaling pathway, we identified four candidate target genes, retinoid X receptor beta (RXRB), nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3 (NR1H3), cytochrome P450 family 8 subfamily B member 1 (CYP8B1) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), as a signature to distinguish the response of sorafenib. We proposed and validated that the RXRB and NR1H3 could directly regulate NR1H3 and SCD, respectively. Our results suggest that the combined use of SCD inhibitors and sorafenib may be a promising therapeutic approach.","misc","wim"

Berbamine (BE), a natural substance obtained primarily from Berberis vulgaris L, is a traditional herbal medicine with several bioactivities, such as antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Thymoquinone (TQ), a phytochemical molecule derived from the Nigella sativa plant's black cumin seeds, has attracted interest owing to itsanti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. This current study's aims was to examine the protective impacts of BE and TQ in Concanavalin A (ConA)- induced acute liver injury and the action's underlying mechanism. sixty mice of both sexes were used and divided into four groups (each group with six mice) as follows: Group I obtained distilled water (negative control group). Group II received distilled water with a single dose of 0.1 ml ConA (20 mg/kg) on day 4 by retro-orbital route (model group). Groups III and IV received BE (30 mg/kg/day) and TQ (25 mg/kg/day), respectively, by oral gavage for four successive days, with a single dose of ConA (20 mg/kg) on day 4, then all animals were sacrificed after 8 h and prepared for liver and blood collection. ConA administration increased the ALT, AST, TNF-α, INFγ, and NF-κB significantly (p < 0.001) in the model group.

Beyond simple nutrition and a hedge against the seasonal, geographic, and chemical unpredictability of nectar, honey has properties that protect the hive against various stresses. Enzyme-mediated detoxification during honey ripening neutralizes potentially toxic phytochemicals, and bees that consume honey have enhanced tolerance to other ingested toxins. Catalase and antioxidant phenolics protect honey bees from oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species, promoting their longevity. Phytochemical components of honey and microRNAs have the potential to influence developmental pathways, with diet playing a large role in honey bee caste determination. Components of honey mediate stress response and promote cold tolerance during overwintering. Honey has a suite of antimicrobial mechanisms including osmotic pressure, low water activity, low pH, hydrogen peroxide, and plant-, honey bee-, and microbiota-derived compounds such as phytochemicals and antimicrobial peptides. Certain types of honey, particularly polyfloral honeys, have been shown to inhibit important honey bee pathogens including the bacteria responsible for American and European Foulbrood, the microsporidian Nosema ceranae, and the fungi responsible for Stonebrood. Understanding the diverse functional properties of honey has far-ranging implications for honey bee and hive health and management by beekeepers.","misc","wim"

This study was designed to reveal the toxic effects of polystyrene nanoplastic (PS NP) exposure on the freshwater macrophyte Lemna minor. In addition, elucidating the interaction of this aquatic plant, which is used extensively in the phytoremediation of water contaminants and wastewater treatment facilities, with nanoplastics will guide the development of remediation techniques. For this purpose, we examined nanoplastic accumulation, oxidative stress markers, photosynthetic efficiency, antioxidant system activity and phytohormonal changes in L. minor leaves subjected to PS NP stress (P-1, 100 mg L-1; P-2, 200 mg L-1 PS NP). Our results showed no evidence of PS NP-induced oxidative damage in P-1 group plants, although PS NP accumulation reached 56 µg g-1 in the leaves. Also, no significant changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were observed in this group, indicating unaffected photosynthetic efficiency. PS NP exposure triggered the antioxidant system in L. minor plants and resulted in a 3- and 4.6-fold increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the P-1 and P-2 groups. On the other hand, high-dose PS NP treatment resulted in insufficient antioxidant activity in the P-2 group and increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and lipid peroxidation (TBARS contents) by 25 % and 17 % compared to the control plants. Furthermore, PS NP exposure triggered abscisic acid biosynthesis (two-fold in the P-1 and three-fold in the P-2 group), which is also involved in regulating the stress response. In conclusion, L. minor plants tolerated NP accumulation without growth suppression, oxidative stress damage and limitations in photosynthetic capacity and have the potential to be used in remediation studies of NP-contaminated waters.","misc","wim"

The NAPCare PMG are grounded in World Health Organization best practices but adapted for the cultural and resource context of Nepal. Wider adoption of the NAPCare PMG has been limited due to distribution of the guidelines as paper booklets. Building on a long-standing partnership between clinicians and researchers in the US and Nepal, the NAPCare PMG mobile application (app) was collaboratively designed. Healthcare providers in Nepal were recruited to pilot test the app using patient case studies. Then, participants completed a Qualtrics survey to evaluate the app which included the System Usability Scale (SUS) and selected items from the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). Descriptive and summary statistics were calculated and compared across institutions and roles. Regression analyses to explore relationships (α = 0.05) between selected demographic variables and SUS and MARS scores were also conducted. Ninety eight healthcare providers (n = 98) pilot tested the NAPCare PMG app. Overall, across institutions and roles, the app received an SUS score of 76.0 (a score > 68 is considered above average) and a MARS score of 4.10 (on a scale of 1 = poor, 5 = excellent). 89.8% (n = 88) agreed or strongly agreed that the app will help them better manage cancer pain. Age, years of experience, and training in palliative care were significant in predicting SUS scores (p-values, 0.0124, 0.0371, and 0.0189, respectively); institution was significant in predicting MARS scores (p = 0.0030). The NAPCare PMG mobile app was well-received, and participants rated it highly on both the SUS and MARS.

Threats in a cloud-based system need to be considered from a holistic perspective that accounts for data, application, infrastructure and service, which can pose potential risks. Data certainly plays a critical role within the whole ecosystem and organisations should take account of and protect data from any potential threats. Due to the variation of data types, status, and location, understanding the potential security concerns in cloud-based infrastructures is more complex than in a traditional system. The existing threat modeling approaches lack the ability to analyse and prioritise data-related threats. The main contribution of the paper is a novel data-driven threat analysis (d-TM) approach for the cloud-based systems. The main motivation of d-TM is the integration of data from three levels of abstractions, i.e., management, control, and business and three phases, i.e., storage, process and transmittance, within each level. The d-TM provides a systematic flow of attack surface analysis from the user agent to the cloud service provider based on the threat layers in cloud computing. Finally, a cloud-based use case scenario was used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The result shows that d-TM revealed four critical threats out of the seven threats based on the identified assets. The threats targeted management and business data in general, while targeting data in process and transit more specifically.","misc","wim"
"1471",35965664,"Inequality in abundance.","With technological advance has come the possibility of a new era of abundance. Technologies like 3D printing and robotics promise to lower the costs of production and distribution of goods and services, presumably making these goods and services readily available to those across income and wealth spectrums. This undoubtedly is a good thing. But what will be the effect of these technologies on existing wealth inequalities and the psychological and societal burdens they impose? Can we expect that this newfound abundance will help remedy the current historic levels of inequality in the U.S. and other western countries? Unfortunately, the answer is likely no, for two reasons. First, history suggests that inequality often persists even under conditions of abundance due to dynamics of power and politics and ongoing impacts of structural inequalities. Having more than enough of a particular good or service to go around does not guarantee that all will have access to this good or service. Second, even if the new abundance enabled by technology extends into all levels of the socioeconomic spectrum, enabling individuals to access goods and services (and their attendant benefits) previously beyond their reach, the harms that attend unequal societies will persist. Increasing evidence suggests that these harms, including increased violence and decreased health, arise not from access (or a lack thereof) to particular goods and services, but from the adverse psychological consequences of living in an unequal society. This is a psychological burden shared not just by those at the losing end of the inequality equation, but also those who enjoy a relative advantage in society. Unequal societies are psychologically harmful to all who live in them, regardless of where these individuals fall on the socioeconomic spectrum, and largely independent of the particular goods and services they enjoy. The upshot is that society cannot rely on new abundance technologies to automatically solve problems of inequality and the social and psychological burdens that plague those who live in unequal societies. Indeed, depending on how society responds to questions of access to these technologies, their introduction might exacerbate various forms of inequality. In light of this, it is crucial to address conditions of inequality head-on, so that the new era of abundance promised by technological advance can lead to real gains in individual and societal wellbeing.","misc","wim"

An external validation was performed by an individual set of 94 MpBC patients from National Cancer Center in China from 2010 to 2018. The nomogram finally consisted of 7 independent prognostic factors and presented a good accuracy for predicting the OS with the C-index of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.751-0.786).

Orf virus (ORFV), a DNA parapoxvirus, can infect its natural ungulate hosts and transmit into humans. Moreover, the ORFV has advantages of low toxicity, high targeted, self-amplification and can induce potent Th1-like immunity. This study explored the therapeutic potential of ORFV infection for human lung cancer therapy and investigated the molecular mechanisms. We used a previously described ORFV NA1/11 strain and tested the oncolysis of ORFV NA1/11 in two lines of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of both cell lines with ORFV NA1/11 resulted in a decrease in cell viability by inducing cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, suppressing cyclin B1 expression and increasing their apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. The ORFV NA1/11-infected lung cancer cells were highly immunogenic. Evidently, ORFV NA1/11 infection of lung cancer cells induced oncolysis of tumor cells to release danger-associated molecular patterns, and promoted dendritic cell maturation, and CD8 T cell infiltration in the tumors by enhancing CXCL16 secretion. These findings may help to understand the molecular mechanisms of ORFV oncolysis and aid in the development of novel therapies for lung cancer.","misc","wim"

The improving of the quality of the captured medical images is considered as a challenging task in medical image. In this study, a trace operator in fractional calculus linked with the derivative of fractional Rényi entropy is proposed to enhance the low contrast COVID-19 images. The pixel probability values of the input image are obtained first in the proposed image enhancement model. Then the covariance matrix between the input image and the probability of a pixel intensity of the input image to be calculated. Finally, the image enhancement is performed by using the convolution of covariance matrix result with the input image. The proposed enhanced image algorithm is tested against three medical image datasets with different qualities. The experimental results show that the proposed medical image enhancement algorithm achieves the good image quality assessments using both the BRISQUE, and PIQE quality measures. Moreover, the experimental results indicated that the final enhancement of medical images using the proposed algorithm has outperformed other methods. Overall, the proposed algorithm has significantly improved the image which can be useful for medical diagnosis process.","misc","wim"

The study of high-genetic-risk patients or those already with CD limits our knowledge of dysbiosis that may occur early in life in a generalized population. To explore early gut microbial imbalances correlated with future celiac disease (fCD), we analyzed the stool of 1478 infants aged one year, 26 of whom later acquired CD, with a mean age of diagnosis of 10.96 ± 5.6 years. With a novel iterative control-matching algorithm using the prospective general population cohort, All Babies In Southeast Sweden, we found nine core microbes with prevalence differences and seven differentially abundant bacteria between fCD infants and controls. The differences were validated using 100 separate, iterative permutations of matched controls, which suggests the bacterial signatures are significant in fCD even when accounting for the inherent variability in a general population. This work is the first to our knowledge to demonstrate that gut microbial differences in prevalence and abundance exist in infants aged one year up to 19 years before a diagnosis of CD in a general population.","misc","wim"

This is due to the ability of protein-based amyloid architecture that proved to be an attractive system to carry drug and nutrition. However, few research focused on the modification of functional properties of different fractions isolated from amyloid fibrils. Hereby, we separated the retentate (RGFs) and filtrate (FGFs) fractions from rice glutelin fibrils (GFs) using centrifugal filtration and then investigated the structural characteristics and functional properties of these fractions. We proved that protein fibrillization would highly improve both emulsifying and antioxidant abilities of protein dispersion. In addition, further processed RGFs with rich β-sheet structures exhibited a similar functional performance to GFs dispersion. By contrast, FGFs dispersion with less β- sheet content, lower molecular weight, interestingly re-assembled into spherical aggregates with weaker interaction, exhibiting better antioxidant and emulsifying properties.","misc","wim"

However, few studies have investigated the effects of such a program and predictors of work restoration and maintenance in the participants. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of a rework program as well as to examine whether cognitive function and mental state at the end of the rework program predict the probability of work restoration and maintenance and whether the frequency of rework program participation predicts successful work restoration and maintenance. The rework program included both patients absent from work and unemployed patients. Patients completed assessments including Trail Making Test Type B (TMT-B), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale just before graduating from the rework program. Simultaneously, their depressive state was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating scale. The patients were divided into the job group, comprising 94 patients who were able to restore their work or get a new job, and the non-job group, comprising 34 patients who were not able to do so. We found that the program was more effective in patients absent from work than in unemployed patients, TMT-B could predict work restoration and maintenance, and the frequency of rework program participation could predict work restoration but not work maintenance. Based on the findings, we propose Yamashita's criterion where a TMT-B completion time of 70 s is the cut-off point for work restoration. The present findings may provide useful evidence that could aid in the further development of rework program(s).","misc","wim"

However, the transportation system of PAA as a side chain of PG are unclear yet. To discover ABC transporters (ABCTs) involved in the transportation of PAA, the expression levels of 38 ABCT genes in the genome of Monascus ruber M7, culturing with and without PAA, were examined, and found that one abct gene, namely abct31, was considerably up-regulated with PAA, indicating that abct31 may be relative with PAA transportation. Furthermore the disruption of abct31 was carried out, and the effects of two PG substrate's amino acids (L-Cys and L-Val), PAA and some other weak acids on the morphologies and production of secondary metabolites (SMs) of Δabct31 and M. ruber M7, were performed through feeding experiments. The results revealed that L-Cys, L-Val and PAA substantially impacted the morphologies and SMs production of Δabct31 and M. ruber M7. The UPLC-MS/MS analysis findings demonstrated that Δabct31 did not interrupt the synthesis of PG in M. ruber M7. According to the results, it suggests that abct31 is involved in the resistance and detoxification of the weak acids, including the PAA in M. ruber M7.","misc","wim"

"2121",35966576,"Continuous theta-burst stimulation enhances and sustains neurogenesis following ischemic stroke.","Rationale: Previous work has indicated that continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), a modality of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), may provide neuroprotection and improve neurological function after stroke by preserving the blood-brain barrier, altering glial polarization phenotypes, and supporting peri-infarct angiogenesis. The present study was performed to examine whether cTBS, a noninvasive neurostimulation technique, promotes neurogenesis in a photothrombotic (PT) stroke rat model and contributes to functional recovery. Methods: Beginning 3 h or 1 week after the induction of PT stroke, once-daily 5-min cTBS treatments were applied to the infarcted hemisphere for 6 days. Samples were collected 6 days, 22 days, and 35 days after PT stroke. Fluorescent labeling, Western blotting, and behavioral tests were performed accordingly. Results: We found that cTBS therapy significantly expanded the pool of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and newly generated immature neurons in the cortical peri-infarct region after PT stroke. Likewise, the amount of DCX-positive immature neurons in the peri-infarct area was markedly elevated by cTBS. Application of cTBS strikingly diminished the PT-induced loss of NPCs and newly-formed neurons. In addition, the amount of newly generated mature neurons in the peri-infarct zone was significantly promoted by cTBS. Intriguingly, cTBS reduced reactive gliogenesis significantly while promoting oligodendrogenesis and preserving myelination. Mechanistic studies uncovered that cTBS upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). Finally, cTBS-treated animals displayed improved motor functions. To be noted, temozolomide (TMZ), a drug that has been previously used to suppress neurogenesis, could reverse the beneficial effects of cTBS. Conclusions: Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism by which cTBS promotes functional recovery from stroke. We demonstrated that cTBS effectively enhances and sustains neurogenesis after PT stroke. Both early and delayed cTBS treatment could improve the survival of newly generated neurons and functional recovery, and inhibition of neurogenesis could reverse these therapeutic benefits. Mechanistically, cTBS was effective in upregulating the release of neurotrophic factors, protecting NPC and immature neurons, as well as suppressing excessive gliogenesis.","misc","wim"
"182",35958012,"An intelligent prediagnosis system for disease prediction and examination recommendation based on electronic medical record and a medical-semantic-aware convolution neural network (MSCNN) for pediatric chronic cough.","Due to the phenotypic similarities among different pediatric respiratory diseases with chronic cough, primary doctors often misdiagnose and the misuse of examinations is prevalent. In the pre-diagnosis stage, the patients' chief complaints and other information in the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a powerful reference for respiratory experts to make preliminary disease judgment and examination plan. In this paper, we proposed an intelligent prediagnosis system to predict disease diagnosis and recommend examinations based on EMR text. We examined the clinical notes of 178,293 children with chronic cough symptoms from retrospective EMR data. The dataset is split into 7:3 for training and testing. From the testing set, we also extract 5% of samples for validation. We proposed a medical-semantic-aware convolution neural network (MSCNN) framework that can accomplish two downstream tasks from the same medical language model through transfer learning. First, a medical language model based on the word2vec algorithm was built to generate embeddings for the text data. Then, text convolutional neural network (TextCNN) was used to build models for disease prediction and examination recommendation. We implemented 5 algorithms for disease prediction. In the disease prediction task, our algorithm outperformed the baseline methods on all metrics, with a top-1 accuracy (AC) of 0.68 and a top-3 AC of 0.923 on the testing set. By adding data enhancement, the top-3 AC reached 0.926. In the examination recommendation task, the overall AC on the testing set was 0.93 and the macro average (MA) F1-score was 0.88. The average area under the curve (AUC) on the training set was 0.97 while on the testing set it was 0.86. We constructed an intelligent prediagnosis system with an MSCNN framework that can predict diseases and make examination recommendations based on EMR data. Our approach achieved good results on a retrospective clinical dataset and thus has great potential for the application of automated diagnosis assist in clinical practice during pre-diagnosis stage, which will provide help for primary level doctors or doctors in basic-level hospitals. Due to the generality of the proposed framework, it can be straight forwardly extended to prediagnosis for other diseases.","misc","wim"
"1734",35957235,"Enhanced Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy for Heavy Metal Detection in Agriculture: A Review.","Heavy metal pollution in agriculture is a significant problem that endangers human health. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an emerging technique for material and elemental analysis, especially heavy metals, based on atomic emission spectroscopy. The LIBS technique has been widely used for rapid detection of heavy metals with its advantages of convenient operation, simultaneous detection of multi-elements, wide range of elements, and no requirement for the state and quantity of samples. However, the development of LIBS is limited by its detection sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD). Therefore, in order to improve the detection sensitivity and LOD of LIBS, it is necessary to enhance the LIBS signal to achieve the purpose of detecting heavy metal elements in agriculture. This review mainly introduces the basic instruments and principles of LIBS and summarizes the methods of enhanced LIBS signal detection of heavy metal elements in agriculture over the past 10 years. The three main approaches to enhancing LIBS are sample pretreatment, adding laser pulses, and using auxiliary devices. An enhanced LIBS signal may improve the LOD of heavy metal elements in agriculture and the sensitivity and stability of the LIBS technique. The enhanced LIBS technique will have a broader prospect in agricultural heavy metal monitoring and can provide technical support for developing heavy metal detection instruments.","misc","wim"

Twelve patients with obese type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia (traditional Chinese medicine syndrome differentiation was excess heat syndrome of the stomach and intestines) were treated with JTTZR for 24 weeks, and 12 patients were included in the healthy control group. First, blood samples from 6 patients in each group (disease group before treatment, disease group after treatment, and healthy control group) were collected for RNA microarray analysis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to validate these target lncRNAs and mRNAs. Finally, a detailed analysis of the differences in the disease group before treatment vs. the healthy control group and the disease group after treatment vs. the disease group before treatment was undertaken. In addition, we focused on disease-related pathways and analyzed the correlation between the differential expression of target lncRNAs and clinical indicators. (1) Disease group before treatment vs. healthy control group: There were 557 up-regulated lncRNAs, 273 down-regulated lncRNAs, 491 up-regulated mRNAs, and 1639 down-regulated mRNAs. GO analysis and pathway analysis showed that T2DM may be related to cell proliferation in the forebrain, post-embryonic organ development, calcium signaling pathway. qPCR validation showed that the expression of XLOC-005590 and HNF1A-AS1 as target lncRNAs increased, and this was verified by gene chip analysis. (2) Disease group after treatment vs. disease group before treatment: 128 lncRNAs were upregulated, 32 lncRNAs were downregulated, 45 mRNAs were upregulated, and 140 mRNAs were downregulated. GO analysis and pathway analysis showed that JTTZR may treat T2DM through endosome transport, the insulin signaling pathway, and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. qPCR validation showed that in the healthy control group, XLOC_005590 was upregulated, whereas the downstream gene (ECI2) was downregulated in the disease group before treatment. However, after 24 weeks of intervention with JTTZR, XLOC_005590 was downregulated and ECI2 was upregulated compared with the disease group before treatment (0 weeks) (P <0.05). JTTZR may interfere in patients with obese T2DM with dyslipidemia by regulating pathways such as fatty acid degradation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate metabolism.","misc","wim"

Phosphorylation and ubiquitylation are key PTMs that dictate protein function, recognition, sub-cellular localization, stability, turnover and fate. Hence, failures in their regulation leads to various disease. Chemical protein synthesis allows preparation of ubiquitinated and phosphorylated proteins to study their biochemical properties in great detail. However, monitoring these modifications in intact cells or in cell extracts mostly depends on antibodies, which often have off-target binding. Here, we report that the most widely used antibody for ubiquitin (Ub) phosphorylated at serine 65 (pUb) has significant off-targets that appear during mitosis. These off-targets are connected to polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) mediated phosphorylation of cell cycle-related proteins and the anaphase promoting complex subunit 1 (APC1).","misc","wim"

Recent evidence suggests common signaling pathways in these diverse settings mediated by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are packaged in extracellular vesicles (EVs) protecting ncRNAs from degradation. EVs are a heterogeneous group of lipid bilayer-covered vesicles released from virtually all cells, which have important roles in intercellular communication. Recent studies pointed out that ncRNAs including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are selectively sorted into EVs, modulating specific aspects of cancer development, namely cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, immune tolerance or drug resistance, under conditions of hypoxia in recipient cells. In myocardial infarction and stroke, ncRNAs shuttled via EVs have been shown to control tissue survival and remodeling post-hypoxia by regulating cell injury, inflammatory responses, angiogenesis, neurogenesis or neuronal plasticity. This review discusses recent evidence on EV-associated ncRNAs in hypoxic cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke, discussing their cellular origin, biological function and disease significance. The emerging concept of lncRNA-circular RNA/ miRNA/ mRNA networks is outlined, upon which ncRNAs synergistically respond to hypoxia in order to modify disease responses. Particular notion is given to ncRNAs participating in at least two of the three conditions, which revealed a large degree of overlaps across pathophysiological conditions.

However, despite the presence of enteric ganglia in the small intestine, both human patients and Ednrb-/- mice suffer from dysmotility and altered gastrointestinal function, thus raising the possibility of enteric nervous system (ENS) abnormalities proximal to the aganglionic region. We undertook the present study to determine whether abnormalities with the ENS in ganglionated regions may account for abnormal gastrointestinal function. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on ENS cells from the small intestine of Ednrb-/- mice and compared the results to a published single-cell dataset. Our results identified a missing population of neurons marked by the enzyme Gad2, which catalyzes the production of γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the small intestine of Ednrb-/- animals. This result was confirmed by immunostaining enteric ganglia from Ednrb-/- mice and their wild-type littermates. These data show for the first time that ganglionated regions of the Hirschsprung gut lack a neuronal subpopulation, which may explain the persistent gastrointestinal dysfunction after surgical correction of Hirschsprung disease.","misc","wim"

PCOS is often associated with hyperandrogenemia, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and intestinal flora disorder. Although there have been many studies in the past, the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of the disease is still unclear. Studies have shown that PCOS diseases and related complications are closely related to local oxidative stress imbalance in the endometrium, leading to poor endometrial receptivity and effects on pregnancy. Previous reviews have mainly focused on the abnormal mechanism of ovarian oxidative stress in women with PCOS, while reviews on endometrial receptivity and oxidative stress are relatively insufficient. This study reviews the abnormal cellular and molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress due to comorbidities in women with PCOS, leading to a downregulation of endometrial receptivity.","misc","wim"

To identify the potential immune regulatory mechanism of CRC liver metastasis, single-cell sequencing and multiplex immunohistochemistry were applied to identify key cell populations of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the CRC and LM sites. We found memory CD8+ T cells, B cells, and CTSB + macrophages were enriched in the LM site, forming the memory immune hub, which was important for the anti-tumor response against LM. Therefore, our results revealed that memory immune responses were called in the LM sites and probably meditated by CTSB + macrophages.","misc","wim"

Drug-polymer interactions were studied by FTIR, DSC, XRD and SEM analysis. The water absorption capacity was calculated by swelling index. Drug release was determined at various pH. Several in vitro kinetic models were applied to observe drug release behaviour. Studies of drug-polymer interactions and particle flow characteristics of the developed composite material have shown that there is good compatibility between drug and the excipients. The XRD and SEM results confirmed calcite polymorphs in the developed composite material. Thermograms showed that the developed composite material was heat stable. A restricted drug release was observed in an acidic medium (pH 1.2). A controlled drug release was depicted from the developed system at pH 6.8. The drug release mechanism of Super Case II was suggested.

In this paper, we realize a room temperature ultrafast polaritonic switch where the Bose-Einstein condensate population can be depleted at the hundred femtosecond timescale with high extinction ratios. This is achieved by applying an ultrashort optical control pulse, inducing parametric scattering within the photon part of the polariton condensate via a four-wave mixing process. Using a femtosecond angle-resolved spectroscopic imaging technique, the erasure and revival of the polariton condensates can be visualized. The condensate depletion and revival are well modeled by an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation including parametric scattering process. This pushes the speed frontier of all-optical controlled polaritonic switches at room temperature towards the THz regime.","misc","wim"

To address these issues, several publications and projects have proposed using blockchain technology to enable digital trust and ticket verifiability and thus to improve event ticketing systems. However, these approaches exhibit considerable privacy challenges and fall short concerning reliable, efficient visitor identification, which is necessary for controlling secondary market transactions. We demonstrate how a novel paradigm for end-user digital identity management, called self-sovereign identity (SSI), can be utilized to gain secondary market control. To do so, we follow a rigorous design science research approach to build and evaluate an SSI-based event ticketing framework. Our findings demonstrate that SSI-based event ticketing can enable efficient secondary market control by facilitating a practical implementation of the centralized exchange model. To generalize our results, we derive design principles for the efficient, reliable, and privacy-oriented ticket and identity verification and the use of revocation registries.","misc","wim"

Early-life adversity exposes developing young to physical or psychological experiences that risks surpassing their capacity to effectively cope, thereby impacting their lifetime physical and mental wellbeing. Sensitivity to stressful events, like social isolation, has the potential to magnify stress-coping. Chronic stress through social defeat is an established paradigm that models adverse early-life experiences and can trigger enduring alterations in behavioral and neural phenotypes. To assess the degree to which stress resilience and sensitivity stemming from early-life chronic stress impact sociability, we exposed male prairie voles to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) during adolescence. We simultaneously exposed subjects to either social isolation (CSDS+Isol) or group housing (CSDS+Soc) during this crucial time of development. On PND41, all subjects underwent a social approach test to examine the immediate impact of isolation, CSDS, or their combined effects on sociability. Unlike the CSDS+Isol group which primarily displayed social avoidance, the CSDS+Soc group was split by individuals exhibiting susceptible or resilient stress phenotypes. Notably, the Control+Soc and CSDS+Soc animals and their cage-mates significantly gained body weight between PND31 and PND40, whereas the Control+Isol and CSDS+Isol animals did not. These results suggest that the effects of early-life stress may be mitigated by having access to social support. Vasopressin, oxytocin, and opioids and their receptors (avpr1a, oxtr, oprk1, oprm1, and oprd1) are known to modulate social and stress-coping behaviors in the lateral septum (LS). Therefore, we did an mRNA expression analysis with RT-qPCR of the avpr1a, oxtr, oprk1, oprm1, and oprd1 genes to show that isolation and CSDS, or their collective influence, can potentially differentially bias sensitivity of the LS to early-life stressors. Collectively, our study supports the impact and dimensionality of early-life adversity because the type (isolation vs. CSDS), duration (acute vs. chronic), and combination (isolation + CSDS) of stressors can dynamically alter behavioral and neural outcomes.","misc","wim"

The linear calibration-free wavelength modulation spectroscopy (LCF-WMS) approach combined with the temperature profile-fitting strategy was utilized for trace NO and NO2 concentration detection with broad spectral interference from gaseous water (H2O). Transition lines near 1308 nm, 5238 nm, and 6250 nm were selected to investigate the H2O, NO, and NO2 generated from combustion.

In this study, we investigated the association between GGT and the risk of T2DM using real-world data, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, and literature mining. A cross-sectional study enrolled 3,048 participants (>40 years) from a community in Northeastern China was conducted. A generalized additive model was used to examine the relation between GGT and T2DM. A two-sample MR was performed to investigate the causal effect of GGT (61,089 individuals, mostly of European ancestry) on T2DM (29,193 cases and 182,573 controls of European ancestry). GGT was related to glucose metabolism indicators, such as fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (P < 0.05). The odds ratios (ORs) [95% confidence interval (95% CI), P] for T2DM across the GGT categories (14-16, 17-20, 21-25, 26-35, ≥36) were 1.14 [(0.88-1.47), P = 0.330], 1.55 [(1.22-1.98), P < 0.001], 1.87 [(1.47-2.28), P < 0.001], 1.97 [(1.55-2.52), P < 0.001], and 2.29 [(1.78-2.94), P < 0.001] versus GGT ≤ 13 category after adjusting for potential confounding factors. A generalized additive model identified a non-linear correlation between GGT and T2DM and indicated that the risk of T2DM almost levelled out when GGT exceeded 34 IU/L. The MR analysis showed that the odds of having T2DM for a one-time increase in genetically determined GGT was 0.998 [(0.995-1.002), P = 0.34]. Our analysis of observational study suggested that GGT, its increment, within a certain range, is indicative of the development of T2DM. However, MR analysis provided no evidence that GGT is a linear causal factor of T2DM. Further investigation is required to determine if GGT exerts a non-linear causal effect on T2DM.","misc","wim"

The coupling to the bath preserves the global SO(3) spin symmetry. Using large-scale, approximation-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that any finite coupling to the bath suffices to stabilize long-range antiferromagnetic order. This is in stark contrast to the isolated Heisenberg chain where spontaneous breaking of the SO(3) symmetry is forbidden by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. A linear spin-wave theory analysis confirms that the memory of the bath and the concomitant retarded interaction stabilize the order. For the Heisenberg chain, the ohmic bath is a marginal perturbation so that exponentially large system sizes are required to observe long-range order at small couplings. Below this length scale, our numerics is dominated by a crossover regime where spin correlations show different power-law behaviors in space and time. We discuss the experimental relevance of this crossover phenomena.","misc","wim"

Prospective study that consecutively included patients with ACS during 2020. All patients were discharged with high-intensity statins, and the lipid profile was determined after 1 month. At this time, patients were contacted by phone, and treatment was adjusted following the therapeutic algorithm of the Spanish Society of Cardiology. These visits were repeated every month until LDL-c reached <55 mg/dL. Patients were then transferred to scheduled conventional outpatient visits. A total of 346 patients (67.3±2.3 years; 68.2% men) were included. Follow-up was 12-24 months (mean, 17.7±3.8; median, 17.3). Definitive lipid-lowering therapy (mean uptitration time, 3.2±2.1 months) consisted of high-intensity statins alone (32.4%), high-intensity statins plus ezetimibe (56.9%), and PCSK9 inhibitors (10.7%). LDL-c decreased from 108.4±40.6 to 48.7±14.4 mg/dL. At baseline, LDL-c was <100 mg/dL, 70 mg/dL, and 55 mg/dL in 44.5%, 17.6%, and 7.2% of patients, respectively.

The ability of the gut microbiota to signal across the gut-brain-microbiota axis with metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, impacts brain health and has been identified to play a role in the gastrointestinal and developmental symptoms affecting autistic children. The fecal microbiome of older children with ASD has repeatedly shown particular shifts in the bacterial and fungal microbial community, which are significantly different from age-matched neurotypical controls, but it is still unclear whether these characteristic shifts are detectable before diagnosis. Early microbial colonization patterns can have long-lasting effects on human health, and pre-emptive intervention may be an important mediator to more severe autism. In this study, we characterized both the microbiome and short-chain fatty acid concentrations of fecal samples from young children between 21 and 40 months who were showing early behavioral signs of ASD. The fungal richness and acetic acid concentrations were observed to be higher with increasing autism severity, and the abundance of several bacterial taxa also changed due to the severity of ASD. Bacterial diversity and SCFA concentrations were also associated with stool form, and some bacterial families were found with differential abundance according to stool firmness. An exploratory analysis of the microbiome associated with pre-emptive treatment also showed significant differences at multiple taxonomic levels. These differences may impact the microbial signaling across the gut-brain-microbiota axis and the neurological development of the children.","misc","wim"

Standard annuloplasty procedures lead to an average of 55% annular area reduction of the end diastolic pre-operative annular area in Barlow's diseased valves. Following annular reduction, mitral valvuloplasty may be needed, usually with special focus on the posterior leaflet. An in silico pipeline to perform annuloplasty by utilizing the pre- and -postoperative 3D echocardiographic recordings was developed. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that annuloplasty ring sizes based on a percentage (10%-25%) decrease of the pre-operative annular area at end diastole can result in sufficient coaptation area for the selected Barlow's diseased patient. The patient specific mitral valve geometry and finite element model were created from echocardiography recordings. The post-operative echocardiography was used to obtain the artificial ring geometry and displacements, and the motion of the papillary muscles after surgery. These were used as boundary conditions in our annuloplasty finite element analyses. Then, the segmented annuloplasty ring was scaled up to represent a 10%, 20% and 25% reduction of the pre-operative end diastolic annular area and implanted to the end diastolic pre-operative finite element model. The pre-operative contact area decrease was shown to be dependent on the annular dilation at late systole. Constraining the mitral valve from dilating excessively can be sufficient to achieve proper coaptation throughout systole. The finite element analyses show that the selected Barlow's diseased patient may benefit from an annuloplasty ring with moderate annular reduction alone.","misc","wim"

However, these drugs commonly cause drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The reason proposed are multifactorial, which includes immune hyperactivation, changes in drug metabolism, patient cytokine profiles, oxidative stress, genetic predisposition, and the principal target in HIV patients, the CD4+ lymphocytes. This study determined the association of CD4 count and DHRs to first-line HAART, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, and antitubercular agents among HIV patients. This is a retrospective analytical study. Review of charts were done. The demographic and clinical profile used a descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation for quantitative data and frequency and percent for categorical data. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to measure the degree of the relationship of CD4 count and DHRs. A total of 337 eligible patients were included. There was a 25% incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. However, the prevalence of DHRs across the different CD4 groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.167). Likewise, the study found no significant association between the CD4 count and DHRs to first-line HAART, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, and antitubercular agents (p = 0.311). The most common DHR was morbilliform rash, and nevirapine was the most reported antiretroviral drug causing DHR. There was no association in the CD4 count and DHRs to first-line HAART, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, and antitubercular agents. Hence, regardless of the baseline CD4 lymphocyte count, the physician should be vigilant in monitoring hypersensitivity reactions. Patient education on common DHRs is very important upon diagnosis of HIV and/or initiation of treatment.","misc","wim"

It is counterintuitive to observe the reversal of optical torque acting on an ordinary dielectric nanoparticle illuminated by an elliptically or circularly polarized light wave. Here, we demonstrate that negative optical torques, which are opposite to the direction of SAM, can ubiquitously emerge when elliptically polarized light waves are impinged on dielectric nanoparticles obliquely.

Attenuation of Treg differentiation and function by GLK could also contribute to autoimmune diseases. Methods: We analyzed the roles of GLK and IKKβ in Treg differentiation and function using T-cell-specific GLK transgenic mice and IKKβ conditional knockout mice. The mechanism of GLK/IKKβ-mediated attenuation of Treg differentiation/function was studied by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, reporter assays, in vitro kinase assays, protein-protein interaction assays, mass spectrometry, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Results: We found that GLK signaling inhibited Foxp3 transcription by blocking the function of the transcription factor FoxO1. Mechanistically, GLK directly phosphorylated and activated IKKβ at Ser733 in a PKCθ-independent manner. The phospho-IKKβ Ser733 induced FoxO1 Ser319 phosphorylation and nuclear export, leading to Foxp3 downregulation. Consistently, scRNA-seq analyses showed that Foxp3 mRNA levels were inversely correlated with FoxO1 mRNA levels in GLK transgenic CD4+ T cells. Conclusions: GLK-IKKβ-FoxO1 signaling axis inhibits Foxp3 transcription, leading to reduction of Treg differentiation and suppressive activity, as well as induction of autoimmune disease.","misc","wim"

Plasma samples were collected from 26 NSCLC patients before surgery. The exosomes were extracted from the plasma and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used to evaluate the expression of the proteins in the exosomes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed using the Cytoscape 3.8.2 software. Multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify proteins which could effectively distinguish between lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. The relationship between protein expression and the TNM stage was calculated using Spearman rank correlation. The expression levels of ZSWIM9, FYB1, SERPINF1, C1orf68, MASP2, and IGHV3-72 were higher in patients with lung adenocarcinoma compared to patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma. MFGE8 was associated with the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma. CORO1A was positively correlated with the TNM stage of the patients, and COL4A2 was negatively correlated with TNM stage. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that cholesterol metabolism was important in NSCLC development. Lung adenocarcinoma may be distinguished from squamous cell carcinoma by the molecular profile of exosomes in the plasma samples.

In this research, the prognostic value of the hypoxia-immune-related gene SLC19A1 in MM was evaluated by bioinformatics analysis. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data along with clinical information on MM were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Consistent clustering analysis and ESTIMATE algorithms were performed to establish the MM sample subgroups related to hypoxia and immune status, respectively, based on the GSE24080 dataset. The differentially expressed analysis was performed to identify the hypoxia-immune-related genes. Subsequently, a hypoxia-immune-gene risk signature for MM patients was constructed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, which was also verified in the GSE4581 dataset. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of SLC19A1 was determined using qRT-PCR in 19 MM patients, and the correlations between the genetic expression of SLC19A1 and clinical features were further analyzed. A total of 47 genes were identified as hypoxia-immune-related genes for MM. Among these genes, SLC19A1 was screened to construct a risk score model that had better predictive power for MM. The constructed prognostic signature based on SLC19A1 was verified in the GSE4581 dataset. All independent prognostic factors (age, β2-microglobulin, LDH, albumin, MRI, and gene risk score) were used to develop a nomogram that showed a better performance for predicting the survival probability of MM patients for 1-5 years. Furthermore, SLC19A1 was highly expressed in newly diagnosed and relapsed MM patients, and high expression of SLC19A1 is correlated with higher bone marrow aspiration plasma cells and β2-microglobulin levels in MM patients. In conclusion, our results suggest that SLC19A1 is aberrantly expressed in MM and highly expressed SLC19A1 might be a biomarker correlated with inferior prognosis.

Despite the current substantial progress of new drugs and strategies to prevent and treat diabetes, we do not understand precisely the exact cause of the failure and impairment of β-cells. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find new methods to restore β-cells. In recent years, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) can serve as an ideal alternative source for the pancreatic β-cells. In this review, we systematically summarize the current progress and protocols of generating pancreatic β-cells from human PSCs. Meanwhile, we also discuss some challenges and future perspectives of human PSCs treatments for diabetes.","misc","wim"

Therefore, the development of a portable gas-sensing technology for high-efficiency detection of TEA is of great worth for human health and environmental monitoring. In this work, a mixed potential type TEA sensor was initially developed based on pyrochlore Gd2Zr2O7 solid state electrolyte and BiVO4 sensing electrode. The sensor generates high response values of - 62.2 mV and - 134.4 mV to 5 ppm and 100 ppm TEA at 500 °C, respectively. The response value of the sensor displays a logarithmic linear relationship with the concentration of TEA in the range of 1-100 ppm with the sensitivity of - 50.8 mV/decade. Besides, the sensor shows good response and recovery characteristics, and the response and recovery time to 10 ppm TEA is 10 s and 89 s, respectively. Moreover, the sensor possesses good humidity resistance, reproducibility and stability. The sensing behavior of the sensor is explained by the mixed potential sensing mechanism, which is confirmed by the measurement of the polarization curves. This work provides a good supplement for TEA gas sensor, which holds important application value for the sensitive detection of TEA in the environment.","misc","wim"

The purpose of this study is to investigate the distinctions between intra- and juxta-articular OO, trying to avoid delaying diagnosis and optimize treatment strategies. Thirty patients diagnosed with OO in the intra- and juxta joint at our institution who underwent surgical resection were included. Clinical and epidemiological factors, preoperative radiograph parameters, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scan, were documented. The outcomes of the involved extremity were evaluated at the final follow-up. Mean age at diagnosis, interval time, and follow-up time was 8.37±3.79 years old, 4.67±5.88 months, 3.57±2.18 years, respectively. Factors identified to be significantly associated with intra- and juxta-articular OO including pain with activity (P=0.004) and abnormal range of motion (P=0.00). The factor of abnormal range of motion (P=0.03) also influenced the existence of complications. Six children had a secondary operation to cure the recurrence. It is essential for clinicians and radiologists to be aware of the atypical clinical and radiographic features of intra- and juxta-articular OO, as the delayed diagnosis can lead to unnecessary pain and further complications after surgeries. The pain with activity and abnormal range of motion is helpful to identify the location of OO. The persistently abnormal range of motion also significantly leads to complications. The open surgeries to resect the nidus in juxta-articular OO were effective.","misc","wim"
"1662",35966207,"The role of gamma oscillations in central nervous system diseases: Mechanism and treatment.","Gamma oscillation is the synchronization with a frequency of 30-90 Hz of neural oscillations, which are rhythmic electric processes of neuron groups in the brain. The inhibitory interneuron network is necessary for the production of gamma oscillations, but certain disruptions such as brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic imbalances can cause this network to malfunction. Gamma oscillations specifically control the connectivity between different brain regions, which is crucial for perception, movement, memory, and emotion. Studies have linked abnormal gamma oscillations to conditions of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that gamma entrainment using sensory stimuli (GENUS) provides significant neuroprotection. This review discusses the function of gamma oscillations in advanced brain activities from both a physiological and pathological standpoint, and it emphasizes gamma entrainment as a potential therapeutic approach for a range of neuropsychiatric diseases.","misc","wim"

From a safety-by-design concept, this work proposes LN for the encapsulation of insecticide active ingredients (AI). However, given the complexity of nanoparticles, ecotoxicological studies are often controversial, and a detailed investigation of their effects on the environment is required. Accordingly, this work aimed to produce and characterize LN containing the insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin (LC) and evaluate their safety to crops (Solanum lycopersicum and Zea mays), soil invertebrates (Folsomia candida and Eisenia fetida), and soil microbial parameters. The average particle size for LN-loaded with LC (LN-LC) was 165.4 ± 2.34 nm, with narrow size distribution and negative charge (-38.7 ± 0.954 mV). LN were able to encapsulate LC with an entrapment efficacy of 98.44 ± 0.04%, maintaining the stability for at least 4 months. The LN-LC showed no risk to the growth of crops and reproduction of the invertebrates. The effect on microbial parameters showed that the activity of certain soil microbial parameters can be inhibited or stimulated by the presence of LN at highest concentrations, probably by changing the pH of soil or by the intrinsic properties of LN.","misc","wim"
"2080",35960237,"[miRNA Expression Profile in Ileocecal Adenocarcinoma Cells Infected with Cryptosporidium].","Cryptosporidium spp. is an opportunistic protozoan transmitted by fecal-oral route via oocysts. The agent may cause severe infection especially in individuals with suppressed immune system, due to its intracellular location and ability to cause auto-infection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-translated endogenous RNA molecules with an average of 22 nucleotides in length that regulate the expression of genes involved in important biological functions such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and immune response. Recent studies have focused on the role of miRNAs in pathogenesis of infectious diseases and their potential to be used as biomarkers. The aim of this study was to determine the miRNA profile of human ileocecal adenocarcinoma (HCT-8) cells at 24 hours of infection with Cryptosporidium spp. In the study, the HCT-8 cell line was infected with Cryptosporidium spp. that were isolated from infected human stool samples and RNA was isolated from the cells 24 hours after infection. After this process, cDNA synthesis was performed and the expression of 95 human miRNA profiles were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Fold changes of expression were determined by comparison with Cryptosporidium spp. uninfected cell lines. Sequence information of miRNAs and their target genes were performed via TargetScanHuman7.1 and miRDB websites, while gene ontology (GO) pathways of target genes were analyzed with the mirPath v.3 program. It was detected that the expression of 10 miRNAs were upregulated and 11 of them were downregulated compared with the control group. It was observed that, this 21 differentially expressed miRNAs were mainly associated with apoptosis, mitotic cell cycle, and immune response. Hsa-miR-612, hsa-miR-6763-5p, hsa-miR-188-5p, hsa-miR-664b-3p, hsa-miR-210-3p, hsa-let-7e-5p hsa-let-7b-3p, hsa-miR-4787-3p, hsa-miR-548ab, hsa-miR-3714 and hsamiR-4803 were found to be associated with apoptosis; and hsa-miR-612, hsa-miR-664b-3p, hsa-miR210-3p, hsa-let-7e-5p, hsa-let-7b-3p, hsa-miR-548ab, and hsa-miR4803 were found to be associated with mitotic cell cycle. The balance of proliferation and apoptosis is very significant in the development of infection and cancer. It is thought that determination of the effect of miRNAs on proliferation-apoptosis balance could provide information related to the etiopathogenesis and prognosis of infections, and on the role of microorganisms in carcinogenesis. In this study, 12 differentially expressed miRNAs were found to be associated with immune response. This may emphasize the role of miRNAs in the prevention and treatment of infections. It was concluded that, miRNAs could be used in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of infections with the determination of miRNA's role in the infection mechanism as a result of the increasing number of studies.","misc","wim"

The concept of microbial electrochemistry has been gaining tremendous attention for the past two decades, mainly due to its numerous applications. This technology offers a wide range of applications in areas such as the environment, industries, and sensors. The biocatalysts governing the reactions could be cell secretion, cell component, or a whole cell. The electroactive bacteria can interact with insoluble materials such as electrodes for exchanging electrons through colonization and biofilm formation. Though biofilm formation is one of the major modes for extracellular electron transfer with the electrode, there are other few mechanisms through which the process can occur. Apart from biofilm formation electron exchange can take place through flavins, cytochromes, cell surface appendages, and other metabolites. The present article targets the various mechanisms of electron exchange for microbiome-induced electron transfer activity, proteins, and secretory molecules involved in the electron transfer. This review also focuses on various proteomics and genetics strategies implemented and developed to enhance the exo-electron transfer process in electroactive bacteria. Recent progress and reports on synthetic biology and genetic engineering in exploring the direct and indirect electron transfer phenomenon have also been emphasized.","misc","wim"

Representative dosimetric parameters including mean and median dose, D80, and D10 (dose covering 80% and 10% of the structure volume, respectively) for targets and normal organs were extracted and compared between the two groups of patients. For the 12-Gy cohort, the average mean dose for normal organs ranged from 18.3% to 78.3% of 12 Gy, and the average median dose ranged from 18.3% to 77.5% of 12 Gy. For the 20-Gy cohort, the average mean dose for normal organs ranged from 13.0% to 76.0% of 20 Gy, and the average median dose ranged from 12.5% to 75.0% of 20 Gy. Compared to the mean dose to normal organs in the 12-Gy cohort, the average mean dose to normal organs increased from 0.0% to 73.1%, with only four normal organs showing a >50% increase. Normal organ dose in TMLI plans using volumetric modulated arc therapy fields fell within the dose range in historical TMLI plans. Dosimetric data in historical TMLI plans at our institution are summarized at prescription dose levels of 12 Gy and 20 Gy, respectively. Compared to the normal organ dose with a prescription dose of 12 Gy, the mean and median dose to most normal organs at an escalated prescription dose of 20 Gy had an increase less than prescription dose scaling. Dosimetric results from this study can be used as reference data to facilitate clinical implementation of TMLI at other institutions.","misc","wim"

However, Notch-derived lncRNAs and their latent clinical significance remain elusive in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we introduced a framework that could screen Notch-derived lncRNAs (named NLncer) and ultimately identified 24 NLncers. To further explore the clinical significance of these NLncers, we performed LASSO and Cox regression in TCGA-CRC cohort (n = 584) and then retained six lncRNAs tightly associated with prognosis. The final model (termed NLncS) was subsequently tested in GSE38832 (n = 122), GSE39582 (n = 573), and an in-house clinical cohort (n = 115). Ultimately, our NLncS model could serve as an independent risk factor and afford a robust performance for assessing the prognosis of CRC patients. Additionally, patients with high NLncS risk scores were characterized by upregulation of immune pathways, strong immunogenicity, abundant CD8 + T-cell infiltration, and potentially higher response rates to CTLA4 blockers, which turned out to be suitable for immunotherapy. Aiming at globally observing the characteristics of high-risk patients, somatic mutation and methylation modification analysis provide us with evidence at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. To facilitate the clinical transformability, we mined deeply into the sensitive compounds targeting high-risk individuals and identified dasatinib as a candidate agent for patients with a high Notch risk score. In conclusion, our NLncS model is a promising biomarker for optimizing the clinical management of CRC patients.","misc","wim"

The 1975 Signal Hypothesis also predicted that proteins targeted to different intracellular membranes would possess distinct signals and integral membrane proteins contained uncleaved signal sequences which initiate translocation of the polypeptide chain. This review summarizes the central role that the signal peptides play as address codes for proteins, their decisive role as targeting factors for delivery to the membrane and their function to activate the translocation machinery for export and membrane protein insertion. After shedding light on the navigation of proteins, the importance of removal of signal peptide and their degradation are addressed.

However, approximately 10% of patients with GIST are resistant to current targeted drug therapy. There is a need to explore other potential targets. Although p53 alterations frequently occur in most cancers, studies regarding p53 in GIST have been limited. The CDKN2A/MDM2/p53 axis regulates cell cycle progression and DNA damage responses, which in turn control tumor growth. This axis is the major event required for transformation from low- to high-risk GIST. Generally, p53 mutation is infrequent in GIST, but p53 overexpression has been reported to be associated with high-risk GIST and unfavorable prognosis, implying that p53 should play a critical role in GIST. Also, Wee1 regulates the cell cycle and the antitumor activity of Wee1 inhibition was reported to be p53 mutant dependent. In addition, Wee1 was reported to have potential activity in GIST through the regulation of KIT protein and this mechanism may be dependent on p53 status. In this article, we review previous reports regarding the role of p53 in GIST and propose targeting the p53 pathway as a novel additional treatment strategy for GIST.","misc","wim"

TCP-EBUS was inserted into the distal airways of ex-vivo human lungs to assess bronchial accessibility relative to clinically available bronchoscopes. The short- (≤1 h) and medium-term (≤10 d) safety of TCP-EBUS insertion and EBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) using a 25-gauge needle were evaluated physiologically and radiologically in live pigs. TCP-EBUS-guided TBNA feasibility was assessed in-vivo with pig intrapulmonary pseudo-tumors and ex-vivo with resected human lung cancer specimens. For bronchial accessibility, TCP-EBUS demonstrated greater reach than the 6.6-mm convex probe endobronchial ultrasound (CP-EBUS) in all bronchi, as well as surpassed a 5.5-mm conventional bronchoscope in 63% (131/209) and a 4.8-mm conventional bronchoscope in 27% (57/209) of assessed bronchi.

Whether there is an accelerated effect of aging on endothelial decline in former preeclamptic women is unknown. We investigated if the arterial aging regarding endothelial-dependent and -independent vascular function is more pronounced in women with a history of preeclampsia as compared to women with a history of solely normotensive gestation(s). Data was used from the Queen of Hearts study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02347540); a large cross-sectional study on early detection of cardiovascular disease among young women (≥18 years) with a history of preeclampsia and a control group of low-risk healthy women with a history of uncomplicated pregnancies. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD; absolute, relative and allometric) and sublingually administered nitroglycerine-mediated dilation (NGMD; absolute and relative) were measured using ultrasound. Cross-sectional associations of age with FMD and NGMD were investigated by linear regression. Models were adjusted for body mass index, smoking, antihypertensive drug use, mean arterial pressure, fasting glucose, menopausal state, family history of CVD and stress stimulus during measurement. Effect modification by preeclampsia was investigated by including an interaction term between preeclampsia and age in regression models. Of the 1,217 included women (age range 22-62 years), 66.0% had a history of preeclampsia and 34.0% of normotensive pregnancy. Advancing age was associated with a decrease in relative FMD and NGMD (unadjusted regression coefficient: FMD: -0.48%/10 years (95% CI:-0.65 to -0.30%/10 years), NGMD: -1.13%/10 years (-1.49 to -0.77%/10 years)) and increase in brachial artery diameter [regression coefficient = 0.16 mm/10 years (95% CI 0.13 to 0.19 mm/10 years)]. Similar results were found when evaluating FMD and NGMD as absolute increase or allometrically, and after confounder adjustments. These age-related change were comparable in former preeclamptic women and controls (p-values interaction ≥0.372). Preeclampsia itself was independently associated with consistently smaller brachial artery diameter, but not with FMD and NGMD. In young- to middle-aged women, vascular aging in terms of FMD and NGMD was not accelerated in women after preeclampsia compared to normotensive pregnancies, even though former preeclamptic women consistently have smaller brachial arteries.","misc","wim"

GBS population structure is composed of multiple clades that differ in virulence, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and niche adaptation; however, there is growing evidence of interspecies transmission, both from evolutionary analysis and from disease investigations. The prevention of GBS infections through vaccination is desirable in humans as well as animals because it reduces the burden of GBS disease and reduces our reliance on antimicrobials, and the risk of adverse reactions or selection for AMR. In this perspective article, we navigate through the landscape of AMR in the pediatric and multi-host pathogen GBS under the One Health perspective and discuss the use of antimicrobials to control GBS disease, the evolution of AMR in the GBS population, and the future perspectives of resistant GBS infections in the post-pandemic era.","misc","wim"

Ion migration, corrosiveness, and hygroscopicity induced by the additive Li-TFSI are detrimental to the device stability, which significantly hinders further commercialization of PSCs. Herein, a hydrophobic organic ionic compound, trityltetra(pentafluorophenyl)borate (TPP), is explored as a novel efficient and stable alternative p-dopant, avoiding the long-term aging process to improve the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD. As a result, the champion efficiency of TPP-based devices delivers performance up to 23.03%, which is higher than that of the Li-TFSI-based devices (22.39%). In addition, the TPP-based devices also exhibit higher average PCE values. The excellent performance with TPP may be associated with the higher work function of doped spiro-OMeTAD and a better alignment of energy levels with the valence band of perovskite, which substantially accelerate interfacial carrier transportation and minimize the open-circuit voltage (V oc) loss of PSCs. More importantly, the un-encapsulated TPP-doped devices also display much superior operational stability under maximum power point (MPP) tracking with continuous light illumination in an ambient humid environment, which maintained 96-97% of the initial PCE over 1,100 h outputting.

The current study was performed to investigate the prevalence of HUA and gout and the related risk factors in Chinese adults. Data were collected from the National Survey of Thyroid Disorders and Diabetes (the Thyroid Disease, Iodine Status, and Diabetes National Epidemiological survey [TIDE]), a cross-sectional investigation conducted during 2015-2017. Using a random, multistage, and stratified sampling strategy, a representative sample (78,130 participants aged 18 years and above) was selected from the general population in 31 provinces of mainland China. The weighted prevalence rates of HUA and gout were calculated, and the related risk factors were analyzed. The weighted prevalence rates of HUA and gout in Chinese adults were 17.7% and 3.2%, respectively. The prevalence of HUA in males linearly decreased with age, while the prevalence in females showed the opposite trend (both P for trend < 0.01). The prevalence rate of gout exhibited a rising tendency with age in both genders (both P for trend < 0.05). The HUA and gout prevalence rates in males were the highest in Han and Tibetan nationalities, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that the morbidities of HUA and gout were differentially associated with age, residence location, nationality, smoking, and other complicating metabolic diseases in the two genders. There are relatively high prevalence rates of gout and HUA in China, which is currently a developing country. Reducing their burden has become an urgent issue for Chinese people.","misc","wim"
"1654",35957236,"A DLSTM-Network-Based Approach for Mechanical Remaining Useful Life Prediction.","Remaining useful life prediction is one of the essential processes for machine system prognostics and health management. Although there are many new approaches based on deep learning for remaining useful life prediction emerging in recent years, these methods still have the following weaknesses: (1) The correlation between the information collected by each sensor and the remaining useful life of the machinery is not sufficiently considered. (2) The accuracy of deep learning algorithms for remaining useful life prediction is low due to the high noise, over-dimensionality, and non-linear signals generated during the operation of complex systems. To overcome the above weaknesses, a general deep long short memory network-based approach for mechanical remaining useful life prediction is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a two-step maximum information coefficient method was built to calculate the correlation between the sensor data and the remaining useful life. Secondly, the kernel principal component analysis with a simple moving average method was designed to eliminate noise, reduce dimensionality, and extract nonlinear features. Finally, a deep long short memory network-based deep learning method is presented to predict remaining useful life. The efficiency of the proposed method for remaining useful life prediction of a nonlinear degradation process is demonstrated by a test case of NASA's commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation data. The experimental results also show that the proposed method has better prediction accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods.","misc","wim"
"615",35959402,"Chronic anemia: The effects on the connectivity of white matter.","Chronic anemia is commonly observed in patients with hemoglobinopathies, mainly represented by disorders of altered hemoglobin (Hb) structure (sickle cell disease, SCD) and impaired Hb synthesis (e.g. thalassemia syndromes, non-SCD anemia). Both hemoglobinopathies have been associated with white matter (WM) alterations. Novel structural MRI research in our laboratory demonstrated that WM volume was diffusely lower in deep, watershed areas proportional to anemia severity. Furthermore, diffusion tensor imaging analysis has provided evidence that WM microstructure is disrupted proportionally to Hb level and oxygen saturation. SCD patients have been widely studied and demonstrate lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the corticospinal tract and cerebellum across the internal capsule and corpus callosum. In the present study, we compared 19 SCD and 15 non-SCD anemia patients with a wide range of Hb values allowing the characterization of the effects of chronic anemia in isolation of sickle Hb. We performed a tensor analysis to quantify FA changes in WM connectivity in chronic anemic patients. We calculated the volumetric mean of FA along the pathway of tracks connecting two regions of interest defined by BrainSuite's BCI-DNI atlas. In general, we found lower FA values in anemic patients; indicating the loss of coherence in the main diffusion direction that potentially indicates WM injury. We saw a positive correlation between FA and hemoglobin in these same regions, suggesting that decreased WM microstructural integrity FA is highly driven by chronic hypoxia. The only connection that did not follow this pattern was the connectivity within the left middle-inferior temporal gyrus. Interestingly, more reductions in FA were observed in non-SCD patients (mainly along with intrahemispheric WM bundles and watershed areas) than the SCD patients (mainly interhemispheric).","misc","wim"

PCD is thought to be caused by proteins expressed by tumor cells which trigger an antibody-mediated immune response. Despite PCD being commonly associated with anti-Yo, anti-Hu and anti-Tr/DNER antibodies, PCD is the most prevalent paraneoplastic syndrome in patients harboring anti-Zic4 antibodies. We report what, to our knowledge, is the first known case of anti-Zic4 mediated PCD in a patient with EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our patient was in complete response (CR) to targeted therapy and presented to the emergency room with drowsiness, unsteady gait and memory lapses. The diagnostic work-up revealed a diffuse cerebellar atrophy in the MRI, ruling out brain metastasis and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. A body-CT scan showed no signs of recurrent disease. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was within normal parameters. An onconeural antibody panel was conducted in a peripheral blood sample, detecting high levels of anti-Zic4 antibody by indirect immunofluorescence (IFI), results later confirmed by immunoblot testing. With the suspected diagnosis of an anti-Zic4 PCD, the case was discussed with the neurology department and treatment with high dose methylprednisolone was initiated. Considering the lack of substantial clinical benefit, the patient was then treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) for 5 days, showing modest improvement. At this time, the patient presented minor disease relapse in the form of a sub-centimetric pulmonary nodule. Despite one cycle of chemotherapy, the patient's neurological condition deteriorated leading to fatal pneumonia secondary to progressive dysphagia. There is scarce evidence of paraneoplastic syndromes in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Further research is warranted to stablish a possible association between anti-Zic4 and the EGFR molecular pathway.","misc","wim"

Identification of potential biomarkers predictive of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) risk may assist in risk stratification and clinical decision. A total of 1,187 patients with intermediate coronary lesions and available N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were enrolled in the current study. A baseline NT-proBNP level was obtained. The primary endpoint was defined as MACEs, the composite endpoint of all-cause death and non-fatal myocardial infarction. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to explore the association between NT-proBNP level and MACE risk. The mean age of the study cohort was 59.2 years. A total of 68 patients experienced MACE during a median follow-up of 6.1 years. Restricted cubic spline analysis delineated a linear relationship between the baseline NT-proBNP level and MACE risk. Both univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that an increased NT-proBNP level was associated with an increased risk of MACE [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) per doubling: 1.412, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.022-1.952, p = 0.0365]. This association remains consistent in clinical meaningful subgroups according to age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes. An increased NT-proBNP level is associated with an increased risk of MACE in patients with intermediate coronary lesions and may serve as the potential biomarker for risk stratification and treatment decision guidance.","misc","wim"
"1454",35960584,"Effective Model for Fractional Topological Corner Modes in Quasicrystals.","High-order topological insulators (HOTIs), as generalized from topological crystalline insulators, are characterized with lower-dimensional metallic boundary states protected by spatial symmetries of a crystal, whose theoretical framework based on band inversion at special k points cannot be readily extended to quasicrystals because quasicrystals contain rotational symmetries that are not compatible with crystals, and momentum is no longer a good quantum number. Here, we develop a low-energy effective model underlying HOTI states in 2D quasicrystals for all possible rotational symmetries. By implementing a novel Fourier transform developed recently for quasicrystals and approximating the long-wavelength behavior by their large-scale average, we construct an effective k·p Hamiltonian to capture the band inversion at the center of a pseudo-Brillouin zone. We show that an in-plane Zeeman field can induce mass kinks at the intersection of adjacent edges of a 2D quasicrystal topological insulators and generate corner modes (CMs) with fractional charge, protected by rotational symmetries. Our model predictions are confirmed by numerical tight-binding calculations. Furthermore, when the quasicrystal is proximitized by an s-wave superconductor, Majorana CMs can also be created by tuning the field strength and chemical potential. Our work affords a generic approach to studying the low-energy physics of quasicrystals, in association with topological excitations and fractional statistics.","misc","wim"

Between February 2009 and November 2014, 7,433 patients at the Shanghai Cancer Center who had undergone elective surgery for colorectal cancer were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Patients were divided into two groups: low and high preoperative WBC groups. Propensity score matching was used to address the differences in baseline characteristics. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to identify independent prognostic factors in colorectal cancer patients. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells in the high and low preoperative WBC groups were compared using immunohistochemical staining. Of the 7,433 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery and were available for analysis, 5,750 were included in the low preoperative WBC group, and 1,683 were included in the high preoperative WBC group. After propensity score matching, 1,553 patients were included in each group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that a high preoperative WBC count was associated with a decreased overall survival (P = 0.002) and disease-free survival (P = 0.003), and that preoperative WBC count was an independent risk factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.234; 95% confidence interval, 1.068-1.426; P = 0.004) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.210; 95% confidence interval, 1.047-1.397, P = 0.01). Compared to the low preoperative WBC group, the high preoperative WBC group exhibited higher expression of regulatory T cells (P = 0.0034), CD68+ macrophages (P = 0.0071), and CD66b+ neutrophils (P = 0.0041); increased expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (P = 0.005) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (P = 0.0019); and lower expression of CD8+ T cells (P = 0.0057) in colorectal cancer patients. Our research indicates that a high preoperative WBC count is a prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer patients and is associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which could aid in future risk stratification.","misc","wim"
"399",35957256,"xImpact: Intelligent Wireless System for Cost-Effective Rapid Condition Assessment of Bridges under Impacts.","Bridge strikes by over-height vehicles or ships are critical sudden events. Due to their unpredictable nature, many events go unnoticed or unreported, but they can induce structural failures or hidden damage that accelerates the bridge's long-term degradation. Therefore, always-on monitoring is essential for deployed systems to enhance bridge safety through the reliable detection of such events and the rapid assessment of bridge conditions. Traditional bridge monitoring systems using wired sensors are too expensive for widespread implementation, mainly due to their significant installation cost. In this paper, an intelligent wireless monitoring system is developed as a cost-effective solution. It employs ultralow-power, event-triggered wireless sensor prototypes, which enables on-demand, high-fidelity sensing without missing unpredictable impact events. Furthermore, the proposed system adopts a smart artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework for rapid bridge assessment by utilizing artificial neural networks. Specifically, it can identify the impact location and estimate the peak force and impulse of impacts. The obtained impact information is used to provide early estimation of bridge conditions, allowing the bridge engineers to prioritize resource allocation for the timely inspection of the more severe impacts. The performance of the proposed monitoring system is demonstrated through a full-scale field test. The test results show that the developed system can capture the onset of bridge impacts, provide high-quality synchronized data, and offer a rapid damage assessment of bridges under impact events, achieving the error of around 2 m in impact localization, 1 kN for peak force estimation, and 0.01 kN·s for impulse estimation. Long-term deployment is planned in the future to demonstrate its reliability for real-life impact events.","misc","wim"

The main goal of this paper is to analyze and compare out-of-field neutron and non-neutron organ doses inside 5- and 10-year-old pediatric anthropomorphic phantoms for the treatment of a 5-cm-diameter brain tumor. Proton irradiations were carried out at the Cyclotron Centre Bronowice in IFJ PAN Krakow Poland using a pencil beam scanning technique (PBS) at a gantry with a dedicated scanning nozzle (IBA Proton Therapy System, Proteus 235). Thermoluminescent and radiophotoluminescent dosimeters were used for non-neutron dose measurements while secondary neutrons were measured with track-etched detectors. Out-of-field doses measured using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) were compared with previous measurements performed within a WG9 for three different photon radiotherapy techniques: 1) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 2) three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D CDRT) performed on a Varian Clinac 2300 linear accelerator (LINAC) in the Centre of Oncology, Krakow, Poland, and 3) Gamma Knife surgery performed on the Leksell Gamma Knife (GK) at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia. Phantoms and detectors used in experiments as well as the target location were the same for both photon and proton modalities. The total organ dose equivalent expressed as the sum of neutron and non-neutron components in IMPT was found to be significantly lower (two to three orders of magnitude) in comparison with the different photon radiotherapy techniques for the same delivered tumor dose. For IMPT, neutron doses are lower than non-neutron doses close to the target but become larger than non-neutron doses further away from the target. Results of WG9 studies have provided out-of-field dose levels required for an extensive set of radiotherapy techniques, including proton therapy, and involving a complete description of organ doses of pediatric patients. Such studies are needed for validating mathematical models and Monte Carlo simulation tools for out-of-field dosimetry which is essential for dedicated epidemiological studies which evaluate the risk of second cancers and other late effects for pediatric patients treated with radiotherapy.","misc","wim"

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has shown itself capable of contributing to the development or reformulation of organizational processes to make them more competitive and sustainable. Thus, this article aims to propose drivers for the development of corporate sustainability via I4.0. To this end, a literature review and content analysis were used as research methods to identify and analyze, in recent scientific literature, boosting elements that enable organizational processes to become more sustainable via I4.0. Based on these elements, six drivers were systematized and proposed: strategy; product and process design; energy and material resources; people; smart production; and supply chain. Each driver was discussed in light of the scientific literature to generate recommendations for companies to develop the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. The main theoretical-scientific contribution of this work is the deepening and expansion of the knowledge block that articulates corporate sustainability with I4.0, which strengthens the basis for the development of new research on these topics and creates a reference for the analysis and discussion of empirical studies. As an applied-managerial contribution, the drivers proposed in this work will provide organizations and their managers with a point of reference to effectively move towards sustainability, making their businesses greener, fairer, and more profitable. A limitation of this study is that the proposed drivers were based on the 30 most cited articles and did not consider other sources, such as documentation from companies. Therefore, for future studies, we suggest increasing the article base and include organizational repositories and identify how SMEs can become sustainable through I4.0 in a way that strengthens the social dimension of sustainability.","misc","wim"

Thus, the design and synthesis of stable size/morphology-controlled MOF nanocrystals is critical but challenging. In this study, dual-ligand and hard-soft-acid-base strategies were used to fabricate a variety of 3D pillared-layer [Ni(thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate)(4,4'-bipyridine)]n MOF nanocrystals (1D nanofibers, 2D nanosheets and 3D aggregates) with controllable morphology by varying the concentration of 4,4'-bipyridine and thus controlling the crystal growth direction. Owing to the shorter ion diffusion length, enhanced electron/ion transfer and strong interactions between thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate and 4,4'-bipyridine, the 2D nanosheets showed much larger specific capacitance than 1D nanofibers and 3D aggregates. A single device with an output voltage as high as 3.0 V and exceptional cycling performance (95% of retention after 5000 cycles at 3 mA cm-2) was realized by configuring two aqueous asymmetric supercapacitive devices in series. The excellent cycling property and charge-discharge mechanism are consistent with the hard-soft-acid-base theory.","misc","wim"

In the context of limited medical resources, it is crucial to set the right priorities of extended heart rhythm monitoring by stratifying patients into different risk groups likely to have newly detected AF (NDAF). This study aimed to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based machine learning model to assess the risk of NDAF in an early stage after stroke. Linked data between a hospital stroke registry and a deidentified research-based database including EHRs and administrative claims data was used. Demographic features, physiological measurements, routine laboratory results, and clinical free text were extracted from EHRs. The extreme gradient boosting algorithm was used to build the prediction model. The prediction performance was evaluated by the C-index and was compared to that of the AS5F and CHASE-LESS scores. The study population consisted of a training set of 4,064 and a temporal test set of 1,492 patients. During a median follow-up of 10.2 months, the incidence rate of NDAF was 87.0 per 1,000 person-year in the test set. On the test set, the model based on both structured and unstructured data achieved a C-index of 0.840, which was significantly higher than those of the AS5F (0.779, p = 0.023) and CHASE-LESS (0.768, p = 0.005) scores. It is feasible to build a machine learning model to assess the risk of NDAF based on EHR data available at the time of hospital admission. Inclusion of information derived from clinical free text can significantly improve the model performance and may outperform risk scores developed using traditional statistical methods.

The current paper has been envisioned and conceptualized to update the practicing Indian dentists regarding the so-called enigma of dentistry Dentin Hypersensitivity, based on the best available contemporary evidence. An expert panel was constituted comprising 30 subject experts from across the country, which after extensive literature review and group discussions formulated these recommendations. The panel advocated routine screening of all dentate patients for exposed dentin areas and DH to avoid under-diagnosis of the condition and suggested an early preventive management. Consensus guidelines/recommendations for the use of desensitizing agents (DAs) at home, including the use of herbal agents, are also provided within the backdrop of the Indian context. The guidelines recommend that active management of DH shall be accomplished by a combination of at home and in-office therapies, starting with the simplest and cost-effective home use of desensitizing toothpastes. A diagnostic decision tree and a flowchart for application in daily practice are designed to manage the patients suffering from DH or presenting with exposed dentin areas in dentition. Various treatment methods to manage DH have been discussed in the paper, including the insights from previously published treatment guidelines. Further, a novel system of classification of DH patients based on specific case definitions has been developed for the first time. Explicit charts regarding the available treatment options and the chronology of institution of the agent, for the management in different case categories of DH, have been provided for quick reference. The management strategy takes into account a decision algorithm based on hierarchy of complexity of treatment options and intends to improve the quality of life of the patient by long-term maintenance with an innovatively defined triple C's or 3Cs approach.","misc","wim"

AKIP1 knockdown was conducted in ATC cell lines (8505C and CAL-62 cells) by siRNA; then, cell viability, apoptosis, invasion, PI3K/AKT and β-catenin pathways, and doxorubicin sensitivity were detected. Subsequently, doxorubicin-resistant 8505C cells (8505C/Dox) were established. Additionally, AKIP1 was modified in 8505C and 8505C/Dox cells that underwent doxorubicin treatment by siRNA or overexpression plasmid, followed by cellular function and pathway detection. AKIP1 was elevated in FRO, 8505C, CAL-62, and KHM-5M cells compared to control cells (all p < 0.05). Subsequently, AKIP1 knockdown elevated apoptosis, inhibited viability and invasion, and inactivated PI3K/AKT and β-catenin pathways in 8505C and CAL-62 cells (all p < 0.05). AKIP1 knockdown decreased relative cell viability in doxorubicin-treated 8505C and CAL-62 cells; then, AKIP1 was elevated in 8505C/Dox cells compared to 8505C cells (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, AKIP1 knockdown restored doxorubicin sensitivity (reflected by decreased cell viability and invasion, and increased apoptosis), but inactivated PI3K/AKT and β-catenin pathways in doxorubicin-treated 8505C/Dox cells.

A stack of multiple graph convolutional layers is considered as an encoder that encodes the node feature information into the potential vector space, while the decoder employs a simple two-layer perceptron to reconstruct the initial node features from the encoded vector information. The encoding-decoding mechanism achieves a re-evaluation of the initial node features. Subsequently, an additional local feature reconstruction loss is added after the decoder to aid the goal of graph classification. Further, stochastic gradient descent is applied to solve the problem in the loss function. Finally, the proposed model is experimentally validated based on the Karate Club and Football datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed model improves the NMI metric by an average of 7.65% and effectively mitigates the node oversmoothing problem. The proposed model is proved to have good detection accuracy.","misc","wim"

At present, it is still a challenge to control potato common scab in the field. To address this problem, the 972 family lactococcin (Lcn972) was screened from Bacillus velezensis HN-Q-8 in this study, and an Escherichia coli overexpression system was used to obtain Lcn972, which showed a significant inhibitory effect on Streptomyces scabies, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10.58 μg/mL. The stability test showed that Lcn972 is stable against UV radiation and high temperature. In addition, long-term storage at room temperature and 4°C had limited effects on its activity level. The antibacterial activity of Lcn972 was enhanced by Cu2+ and Ca2+, but decreased by protease K. The protein was completely inactivated by Fe2+. Cell membrane staining showed that Lcn972 damaged the cell membrane integrity of S. scabies. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations revealed that the hyphae of S. scabies treated with Lcn972 were deformed and adhered, the cell membrane was incomplete, the cytoplasm distribution was uneven, and the cell appeared hollow inside, which led to the death of S. scabies. In conclusion, we used bacteriocin for controlling potato common scab for the first time in this study, and it provides theoretical support for the further application of bacteriocin in the control of plant diseases.","misc","wim"

In this study, three compounds extracted from A. continentalis were identified as acanthoic acid, continentalic acid, and kaurenoic acid by NMR and were further investigated how these diterpenoids affect the physiology of the S. mutans. When S. mutans was exposed to individual or mixed fraction of diterpenoids, severe growth defects and unique morphology were observed. The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the cell membrane was increased compared to that of saturated fatty acids in the presence of diterpenoids. Genome-wide gene expression profiles with RNA-seq were compared to reveal the mode of action of diterpenoids. Streptococcus mutans commonly enhanced the expression of 176 genes in the presence of the individual diterpenoids, whereas the expression of 232 genes was considerably reduced. The diterpenoid treatment modulated the expression of genes or operon(s) involved in cell membrane synthesis, cell division, and carbohydrate metabolism of S. mutans. Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into the antibacterial effect of diterpenoids to control S. mutans infection, which causes human dental caries.","misc","wim"

However, the mechanism involved in this early stage of metastasis remains largely unknown. Microarray analysis was used to carry out differential genomics analyses between matched pairs of metastatic sentinel lymph node tissues and breast primary tumors. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system was used for in vivo screening by transplanting a loss-of-function cell pool into immunocompromised mice. MAGeCK was used to analyze the screening results. Survival analysis was performed via the Kaplan-Meier method. Cell proliferation, wound healing, migration and invasion assays were performed to confirm the phenotype. A tail vein model and subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model were used for the in vivo study. The relationship between coiled-coil domain containing 102B (CCDC102B) and receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) was examined using coimmunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, nuclear protein extraction and immunofluorescence assays. The primary biological functions and pathways related to CCDC102B were enriched by RNA sequencing. We identified CCDC102B through screening and found that it was significantly upregulated in metastatic lesions in lymph nodes compared to matched primary tumors. Increased expression of CCDC102B promoted breast cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, high expression of CCDC102B was correlated with poor clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. We further identified that CCDC102B was stabilized by the loss of RACK1, a protein negatively correlated with breast cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, we found that RACK1 promoted CCDC102B lysosomal degradation by mediating chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). The aggressive behavior of CCDC102B in breast cancer cells could be reversed by the expression of RACK1. Moreover, CCDC102B was correlated with the significant enrichment of NF-κB pathway components. Overexpressing CCDC102B led to less interaction between RACK1 and IKKa. Thus, CCDC102B positively regulates the NF-κB pathway by interacting with RACK1. Taken together, our findings uncover a novel role of CCDC102B in breast cancer metastasis. CCDC102B serves as a potential metastasis promoter by regulating the activation of the NF-κB pathway and can be degraded by RACK1 via CMA.","misc","wim"

A longitudinal cohort of 84 pregnant women was established. The urinary proteomes of women in different trimesters of pregnancy (6-8, 22-24, and 32-34 weeks) were characterized using data-independent acquisition tandem mass spectrometry. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was diagnosed at 24 to 28 weeks. Functional analysis of serial changed proteins was performed. Fifteen women had GDM, 50 were healthy, and 19 experienced spontaneous abortion (SA). Functional analysis showed that the urinary proteome reflected physiological and pathological changes during pregnancy. Compared to those of women with a normal pregnancy, the urinary proteomes of women with GDM and SA showed significant disease-related changes in insulin secretion and estrogen receptor activity, respectively, during the first trimester. Urinary protein during the first trimester of pregnancy achieved an area under the curve of 0.91 and 0.81 for GDM and SA, respectively. The urinary proteome has the potential to reflect serial changes of pregnancy progression; therefore, its use might facilitate early diagnosis of pregnancy complications.","misc","wim"

IR injury causes dysfunction of tissues and organs, and oxidative stress plays an important role in driving this process. Curcumin (CUR), a polyphenolic compound derived from turmeric, protects against IR injury by alleviating oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis. We review the protective effects of CUR against IR. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases using the keywords: ischemic reperfusion, CUR and summarized the results. The effects of CUR during IR have been reported for animal models in vitro and in vivo and the compound has been shown in various organs by suppression of oxidative stress, prevention of inflammation, inhibition of apoptosis and autophagy. CUR with nanocarriers showed many advantages than free CUR in the treatment of IR injury, such as improved bioavailability, sustained-release, better water solubility, better target organ accumulation, improved permeability across the blood-brain-barrier and more effective. Nanotechnology offers significant improvements and promising strategies to improve drug delivery to IR-injured tissues and achieve the desired protective effects.

It significantly reduces quality of life and causes great distress to patients. Although traditional drainage (e.g., anal and pelvic catheters) may reduce the impact of AL to some extent, their role in reducing the incidence of AL remains controversial. In this study, we developed a novel drainage technique involving the placement of drainage tubes through the gap between sutures during handsewn anastomosis, to reduce the occurrence of anastomotic leakage. We retrospectively analyzed 34 consecutive patients who underwent intersphincteric resection requiring handsewn anastomosis between February 1, 2017, and January 1, 2021. Patients were classified into the trans-anastomotic drainage tube group (TADT, n = 14) and the non-TADT group (n = 20) based on whether trans-anastomotic tube placement was performed. The incidence of postoperative complications, such as AL, was compared between the two groups, and anal function of patients at 1-year post-ISR was evaluated. Six cases of AL occurred in the non-TADT group, while none occurred in the TADT group; this difference was statistically significant (p=0.031). The TADT group also had a shorter hospital stay (p=0.007). There were no other significant intergroup differences in operation time, blood loss, pain score, anastomotic stenosis, intestinal obstruction, or incidence of wound infection. In the 30 patients (88.2%) evaluated for anal function, there were no significant intergroup differences in stool frequency, urgency, daytime/nocturnal soiling, Wexner incontinence score, or Kirwan grading. Taken together, trans-anastomotic tube placement is a novel drainage method that may reduce AL after ISR requiring handsewn anastomosis and without adversely affecting anal function.","misc","wim"
"1151",35957745,"A Novel, Low-Cost Glaucoma Calculator to Identify Glaucoma Patients and Stratify Management.","Glaucoma is a leading cause of preventable blindness globally. Nearly, half of the patients who have glaucoma in the United States are unaware of their diagnosis, and this number is far greater in resource poor areas. The risk of progressive and irreversible loss of vision is decreased with an early diagnosis, and better access to treatment is vital to improve the visual outcome for patients. We therefore postulated that a minimally invasive, low-cost calculator used to predict the risk of glaucoma and inform the course of follow-up care will improve patient prognosis. We retrospectively examined data from 104 eyes of patients who underwent a complete ocular examination, visual field, and corneal pachymetry at Advanced Eye Care of New York (54 with glaucoma and 50 controls). Receiver operating curves (ROC) were utilized to determine the correct glaucoma classification rates of the Laroche glaucoma calculator (Range -3 to 18), a novel tool that combines age, intraocular pressure (IOP), and central corneal thickness (CCT) into a composite metric. Additionally, we compared the discriminatory power of this calculator to age, intraocular pressure (IOP), and central corneal thickness (CCT) separately. A score of greater than or equal to 6 on the Laroche glaucoma calculator (sensitivity 90.74%, specificity 64.00%, correct classification 77.88%) optimizes the accuracy of this tool. Compared to IOP (Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.72, chi2 = 4.21, p=0.04) and CCT (AUC = 0.53), chi2 24.72 p < 0.001), the Laroche glaucoma calculator (AUC = 0.81) was significantly better at discriminating against glaucoma patients vs. controls. These results demonstrate that the Laroche calculator is a novel, effective tool for identifying glaucoma, and it may provide a low-cost risk stratification tool, particularly in areas with limited resources.","misc","wim"

European bison has a unique history of near extinction and the recovery of the species from just a few founder individuals. Together with the short medium lifespan, the expected genetic homogeneity makes bison a suitable model for studying longevity. Particular single nucleotide polymorphisms within three genes, BCKDHB, FER1L6 and SERPINI2, were found significantly overrepresented in long-lived European bisons. In SERPINI2, the longevity-associated single nucleotide polymorphism localizes to an exon. In the protein encoded by the SERPINI2 gene, amino acid leucine present in the reference European bisons is replaced by tryptophan in the long-lived animals. This study is the first to determine longevity-associated variants in genes in European bison. Association of the FER1L6 gene with longevity shows a possible sex dependency.","misc","wim"
"1809",35966018,"Role of Eryptosis in Hemorrhagic Stroke.","Erythrocytes undergo certain morphological changes resembling apoptosis during senescence or in an abnormal state/site, which is termed eryptosis. This process is characterized by phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, membrane blebbing, and cell shrinkage. Eryptotic erythrocytes are subsequently removed via macrophage-mediated efferocytosis. In hemorrhagic stroke (HS), blood within an artery rapidly bleeds into the brain tissue or the subarachnoid space, resulting in severe neurological deficits. A hypoxic, over-oxidative, and pro-inflammatory microenvironment in the hematoma leads to oxidative stress, hyperosmotic shock, energy depletion, and Cl- removal in erythrocytes, which eventually triggers eryptosis. In addition, eryptosis following intracerebral hemorrhage favors hematoma clearance, which sheds light on a common mechanism of intrinsic phagocytosis. In this review, we summarized the canonical mechanisms of eryptosis and discussed its pathological conditions associated with HS. Understanding the role of eryptosis in HS may uncover additional potential interventions for further translational clinical research.","misc","wim"

We also demonstrated the potential workflow of DSMES documentation using SEE-Diabetes during clinical practice. The survey showed 60% of providers were familiar with DSMES. Focus group findings showed clinic notes should convey concise information at an appropriate reading level, numbered problems, and less medical jargon to improve the readability of clinic notes. Application of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals was suggested to deliver effective diabetes self-care information.

Whether and how cerebral gray matter structural damage inherent to the disorder affects cognitive function in patients is still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the changes in cerebral gray matter volume and whether these alterations contribute to cognitive impairment and mood disorders. Forty patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and forty healthy controls (HCs) matched for gender, age, and education were recruited. All participants underwent attention network tests (ANT), neuropsychological tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Voxel-based morphological analysis (VBM) and correlation analysis was performed on all participants. Finally, according to the course of disease, patients were divided into two groups: NMDARE_SD (short duration; course ≤ 2 years since diagnosis) and NMDARE_LD (long duration; course >2 years since diagnosis), to evaluate gray matter volume changes that differ as a function of disease course. Compared to HCs, patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis showed decreased executive control ability and lower MoCA score, while increased anxiety and depression as reflected by HAMA and HAMD24 scores (all P < 0.05). In VBM analysis, patients showed decreased gray matter volume in bilateral thalamus, left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC_L), left superior temporal gyrus (STG_L), and left rectus gyrus. In the analysis stratified by disease course, the NMDARE_LD group exhibited decreased gray matter volume in the left precuneus and right posterior cerebellar lobe compared to the NMDARE_SD group. Patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis have cognitive, executive, and emotional dysfunction, and the sites of gray matter atrophy are concentrated in the thalamus, frontal lobe, and temporal lobe. These abnormalities may be involved in the process of cognitive and affective dysfunction.Patients with different courses of anti-NMDAR encephalitis have different brain atrophy sites.

However, when assessing the robustness of an analytical method the analysis of the individual effect of each factor is not sufficient on its own. Some factors may not influence the robustness of the method, but their effect combined with the effects of other factors may have a significant contribution on the robustness of the method, which is not given by conventional analysis of DoE results. The aim of this work is to propose, in addition to the analysis of the individual effects of the factors, to estimate the joint effect of the factors by means of the matrix experimental results prediction interval. This prediction interval is the interval in which, with a given probability, should fall the next results, therefore it is an interesting tool to estimate the variation limits of the method results during routine use. We also propose the use of two other prediction intervals which can help to analyze the DoE results and give a conclusion on the method robustness. The first one is based on the DoE experimental error information, and it gives an estimation of the experimental error component impact on the factors joint effect. The second one is based on the factors non-significance limits, and it provides the information regarding the factors impact on the responses in the case where the conditions are, by definition, robust. We applied these proposals to the robustness study of a UHPLC method for the separation of phytocannabinoids and we could demonstrate that, in addition to the calculated effects values and robustness information, the use of the prediction intervals information provided additional information that allowed a better interpretation of the method performance parameters.","misc","wim"

We have therefore previously proposed a new repair-oriented surgical classification for BAVs in order to facilitate our understanding of any given phenotype and to guide surgical repair. BAVs can range from symmetric to very asymmetric, and classification is determined by commissural orientation. This can therefore range from 180° to 120° respectively, and as such has further implications for the presence or absence of a raphe; the height of the non-functional commissure (raphe); the length of the line of cusp fusion; and the architecture of the aortic valve sinuses. Over the last three decades, we have attempted different repair strategies for BAVs, with its respective learning curves and have achieved the best long-term repair results with our signature approach: the 180°-Reimplantation technique (El Khoury technique). Although very asymmetric and tricuspid aortic valve-like phenotypes are sometimes best repaired through tricuspidization, we have found that the majority of BAVs are amenable to our 180°-Reimplantation technique. This technique creates a symmetric valve, through a selective annuloplasty, and stabilization of the entire functional aortic annulus (FAA) with reimplantation of the commissure at 180° at the level of the virtual basal ring (VBR) and sinotubular junction (STJ). Depending on the valve phenotype, additional cusp modifications are often required to address one or two prolapsing cusps and/or a fibrous raphe.

Subcortical volumes were measured using T1-weighted MRI from patients before RT (N = 91) and from longitudinal follow-ups acquired in three-monthly intervals (N = 349). The volumes were normalized to the baseline values, while excluding structures touching the clinical target volume (CTV) or abnormal tissue seen on FLAIR imaging. A multivariate linear effects model was used to determine if time after RT and mean RT dose delivered to the corresponding structures were significant predictors of tissue atrophy. The hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, putamen, and pallidum showed significant atrophy after RT as function of both time after RT and mean RT dose delivered to the corresponding structure. Only the caudate showed no dose or time dependant atrophy. Conversely, the hippocampus was the structure with the highest atrophy rate of 5.2 % after one year and assuming a mean dose of 30 Gy.

B10 bound to RXRα (Kd = 3.04 ± 0.58 μM) and inhibited the growth of cervical cancer cells (HeLa, IC50 = 1.46 ± 0.10 μM) and hepatoma cells (HepG2, IC50 = 3.89 ± 0.45 μM and SK-hep-1, IC50 = 5.74 ± 0.50 μM) with low cytotoxicity to nonmalignant cells(LO2, IC50 > 50 μM). Furthermore, our mechanistic studies confirmed that B10 acted as an anticancer agent by inhibiting the p-RXRα/PLK1 pathway. These results provide a basis for further investigation and optimization of RXRα-targeted anti-mitotic molecules for cancer therapy.","misc","wim"
"2198",35961109,"Binary colloidal crystals (BCCs) modulate the retina-related gene expression of hBMSCs - A preliminary study.","Surface topography-induced lineage commitment of human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) has been reported. However, this effect on hBMSC differentiation toward retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-like cells has not been explored. Herein, a family of cell culture substrates called binary colloidal crystals (BCCs) was used to stimulate hBMSCs into RPE-like cells without induction factors. Two BCCs, named SiPS (silica (Si)/polystyrene (PS)) and SiPSC (Si/carboxylated PS), having similar surface topographies but different surface chemistry was used for cell culture. The result showed that cell proliferation was no difference between the two BCCs and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) control. However, the cell attachment, spreading area, and aspect ratio between surfaces were significantly changed. For example, cells displayed more elongated on SiPS (aspect ratio ~7.0) than those on SiPSC and TCPS (~2.0). The size of focal adhesions on SiPSC (~1.6 µm2) was smaller than that on the TCPS (~2.5 µm2). qPCR results showed that hBMSCs expressed higher RPE progenitor genes (i.e., MITF and PAX6) on day 15, and mature RPE genes (i.e., CRALBP and RPE65) on day 30 on SiPS than TCPS. On the other hand, the expression of optical vesicle or neuroretina genes (i.e., MITF and VSX2) was upregulated on day 15 on SiPSC compared to the TCPS. This study reveals that hBMSCs could be modulated into different cell subtypes depending on the BCC combinations. This study shows the potential of BCCs in controlling stem cell differentiation.","misc","wim"
"2109",35965505,"Treatment planning of total marrow irradiation with intensity-modulated spot-scanning proton therapy.","The goal of this study is to investigate treatment planning of total marrow irradiation (TMI) using intensity-modulated spot-scanning proton therapy (IMPT). The dosimetric parameters of the intensity-modulated proton plans were evaluated and compared with the corresponding TMI plans generated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) using photon beams. Intensity-modulated proton plans for TMI were created using the Monte Carlo dose-calculation algorithm in the Raystation 11A treatment planning system with spot-scanning proton beams from the MEVION S250i Hyperscan system. Treatment plans were generated with four isocenters placed along the longitudinal direction, each with a set of five beams for a total of 20 beams. VMAT-TMI plans were generated with the Eclipse-V15 analytical anisotropic algorithm (AAA) using a Varian Trilogy machine. Three planning target volumes (PTVs) for the bones, ribs, and spleen were covered by 12 Gy. The dose conformity index, D80, D50, and D10, for PTVs and organs at risk (OARs) for the IMPT plans were quantified and compared with the corresponding VMAT plans. The mean dose for most of the OARs was reduced substantially (5% and more) in the IMPT plans for TMI in comparison with VMAT plans except for the esophagus and thyroid, which experienced an increase in dose. This dose reduction is due to the fast dose falloff of the distal Bragg peak in the proton plans. The conformity index was found to be similar (0.78 vs 0.75) for the photon and proton plans. IMPT plans provided superior superficial dose coverage for the skull and ribs in comparison with VMAT because of increased entrance dose deposition by the proton beams. Treatment plans for TMI generated with IMPT were superior to VMAT plans mainly due to a large reduction in the OAR dose. Although the current IMPT-TMI technique is not clinically practical due to the long overall treatment time, this study presents an enticing alternative to conventional TMI with photons by providing superior dose coverage of the targets, increased sparing of the OARs, and enhanced radiobiological effects associated with proton therapy.","misc","wim"

Herein, we investigate the causality between metabolites and various cancers through a Mendelian randomization (MR) study. We carried out a two-sample MR analysis based on genetic instrumental variables as proxies for 486 selected human serum metabolites to evaluate the causal effects of genetically determined metabotypes (GDMs) on cancers. Summary data from various cancer types obtained from large consortia. Inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger and weighted-median methods were implemented to infer the causal effects, moreover, we particularly explored the presentence of horizontal pleiotropy through MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO Global test. Metabolic pathways analysis and subgroup analyses were further explored using available data. Statistical analyses were all performed in R.

Interestingly, 2-methylbutyroylcarnitine was also associated with decreased risk of lung cancer (ORIVW =0.59; 0.50-0.70; P IVW =1.98×10-9) expect ovarian cancer and breast cancer. In subgroup analysis, 2-methylbutyroylcarnitine was associated with decreased risk of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer (ORIVW =0.72; 0.64-0.80; PIVW =3.55×10-9), lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) (ORIVW =0.60; 0.48-0.70; PIVW =1.14×10-5). Metabolic pathways analysis identified 4 significant pathways. Our study integrated metabolomics and genomics to explore the risk factors involved in the development of cancers.

It is vulnerable to various damages, such as ionizing radiation. Exploration of proliferation, senescence and radiosensitivity of skin cells contributes to the development of medical and cosmetic countermeasures against skin aging and toward injury protection. Human antigen R (HuR) is one of the most widely studied RNA-binding proteins and serves an important role in stabilization of mRNA and regulation of the expression of the target genes. To investigate the role of HuR in modulating proliferation, senescence and radiosensitivity of skin cells, the present study performed an in vitro study using lentivirus-mediated overexpression or silencing of HuR in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells and human skin fibroblast WS1 cells. The results indicated that overexpression of HuR promoted proliferation, whereas downregulation of HuR inhibited proliferation of HaCaT and WS1 cells. Overexpression of HuR reduced apoptosis and senescence in skin cells. RNA-Seq of skin cells with HuR overexpression or knockdown identified 77 mRNAs positively or negatively correlated with HuR expression levels. In addition, silencing of HuR induced a significant increase in radiogenic reactive oxygen species after irradiation. Overexpression of HuR increased radiotolerance of HaCaT and WS1 cells. RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with RNA-Seq identified 14 mRNAs interacting with HuR upon radiation exposure. Overall, the findings of the present study illustrated the key role of HuR in modulating proliferation, senescence and radiosensitivity of skin cells providing a new therapeutic strategy for cosmetic treatments and to combat skin injury.","misc","wim"
"1556",35959041,"The effects of alphabetic literacy, linguistic-processing demand and tone type on the dichotic listening of lexical tones.","Brain lateralization of lexical tone processing remains a matter of debate. In this study we used a dichotic listening paradigm to examine the influences of the knowledge of Jyutping (a romanization writing system which provides explicit Cantonese tone markers), linguistic-processing demand and tone type on the ear preference pattern of native tone processing in Hong Kong Cantonese speakers. While participants with little knowledge of Jyutping showed a previously reported left-ear advantage (LEA), those with a good level of Jyutping expertise exhibited either a right-ear advantage or bilateral processing during lexical tone identification and contour tone discrimination, respectively. As for the effect of linguistic-processing demand, while an LEA was found in acoustic/phonetic perception situations, this advantage disappeared and was replaced by a bilateral pattern in conditions that involved a greater extent of linguistic processing, suggesting an increased involvement of the left hemisphere. Regarding the effect of tone type, both groups showed an LEA in level tone discrimination, but only the Jyutping group demonstrated a bilateral pattern in contour tone discrimination. Overall, knowledge of written codes of tones, greater degree of linguistic processing and contour tone processing seem to influence the brain lateralization of lexical tone processing in native listeners of Cantonese by increasing the recruitment of the left-hemisphere language network.","misc","wim"

The increased pulmonary vascular resistance in CTEPH is caused by unresolved proximal thrombus and secondary microvasculopathy in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to adaptive and maladaptive remodeling of the right ventricle (RV), eventual right heart failure, and death. Knowledge on the RV remodeling process in CTEPH is limited. The progression to RV failure in CTEPH is a markedly slower process. A detailed understanding of the pathophysiology and underlying mechanisms of RV remodeling may facilitate early diagnosis and the development of targeted therapy. While ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, right heart catheterization, and serum biomarkers have been used to assess cardiac function, the current treatment strategies reduce the afterload of the right heart, but are less effective in improving the maladaptive remodeling of the right heart. This review systematically summarizes the current knowledge on adaptive and maladaptive remodeling of the right heart in CTEPH from molecular mechanisms to clinical practice.","misc","wim"

Therefore, developing electrode materials with high energy density, high electrochemical activity, and remarkable flexibility is challenging. Herein, we designed nitrogen-doped porous MXene (N-MXene), using melamine-formaldehyde (MF) microspheres as a template and nitrogen source. We combined it with an electrospinning process to produce a highly flexible nitrogen-doped porous MXene nanofiber (N-MXene-F) as a self-supporting electrode material and assembled it into a symmetrical supercapacitor (SSC). On the one hand, the interconnected mesh structure allows the electrolyte to penetrate the porous network to fully infiltrate the material surface, shortening the ion transport channels; on the other hand, the uniform nitrogen doping enhances the pseudocapacitive performance. As a result, the as-assembled SSC exhibited excellent electrochemical performance and excellent long-term durability, achieving an energy density of 12.78 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 1080 W kg-1, with long-term cycling stability up to 5000 cycles. This work demonstrates the impact of structural design and atomic doping on the electrochemical performance of MXene and opens up an exciting possibility for the fabrication of highly FSCs.","misc","wim"

"2413",35966101,"The molecular signaling of exercise and obesity in the microbiota-gut-brain axis.","Obesity is one of the major pandemics of the 21st century. Due to its multifactorial etiology, its treatment requires several actions, including dietary intervention and physical exercise. Excessive fat accumulation leads to several health problems involving alteration in the gut-microbiota-brain axis. This axis is characterized by multiple biological systems generating a network that allows bidirectional communication between intestinal bacteria and brain. This mutual communication maintains the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal, central nervous and microbial systems of animals. Moreover, this axis involves inflammatory, neural, and endocrine mechanisms, contributes to obesity pathogenesis. The axis also acts in appetite and satiety control and synthesizing hormones that participate in gastrointestinal functions. Exercise is a nonpharmacologic agent commonly used to prevent and treat obesity and other chronic degenerative diseases. Besides increasing energy expenditure, exercise induces the synthesis and liberation of several muscle-derived myokines and neuroendocrine peptides such as neuropeptide Y, peptide YY, ghrelin, and leptin, which act directly on the gut-microbiota-brain axis. Thus, exercise may serve as a rebalancing agent of the gut-microbiota-brain axis under the stimulus of chronic low-grade inflammation induced by obesity. So far, there is little evidence of modification of the gut-brain axis as a whole, and this narrative review aims to address the molecular pathways through which exercise may act in the context of disorders of the gut-brain axis due to obesity.","misc","wim"

Shewanella oneidensis (S. oneidensis) has diverse electron transfer pathways and can use a variety of contaminants as electron acceptors or electron donors. This paper reviews S. oneidensis's function in removing environmental pollutants, including heavy metals, inorganic non-metallic ions (INMIs), and toxic organic pollutants. S. oneidensis can mineralize o-xylene (OX), phenanthrene (PHE), and pyridine (Py) as electron donors, and also reduce azo dyes, nitro aromatic compounds (NACs), heavy metals, and iodate by extracellular electron transfer (EET). For azo dyes, NACs, Cr(VI), nitrite, nitrate, thiosulfate, and sulfite that can cross the membrane, S. oneidensis transfers electrons to intracellular reductases to catalyze their reduction. However, most organic pollutants cannot be directly degraded by S. oneidensis, but S. oneidensis can remove these pollutants by self-synthesizing catalysts or photocatalysts, constructing bio-photocatalytic systems, driving Fenton reactions, forming microbial consortia, and genetic engineering. However, the industrial-scale application of S. oneidensis is insufficient. Future research on the metabolism of S. oneidensis and interfacial reactions with other materials needs to be deepened, and large-scale reactors should be developed that can be used for practical engineering applications.","misc","wim"

Unfortunately, they may impair the patient's ability to mount sufficient humoral and T-cellular responses to vaccination, which is of special relevance in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We present here a case series of six multiple sclerosis patients on treatment with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators who failed to develop SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and T-cells after three doses of vaccination. Due to their ongoing immunotherapy, lacking vaccination response, and additional risk factors, we offered them pre-exposure prophylactic treatment with monoclonal SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. Initially, treatment was conducted with the antibody cocktail casirivimab/imdevimab. When the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant became predominant, we switched treatment to monoclonal antibody sotrovimab due to its sustained neutralizing ability also against the Omicron strain. Since sotrovimab was approved only for the treatment of COVID-19 infection and not for pre-exposure prophylaxis, we switched treatment to tixagevimab/cilgavimab as soon as it was granted marketing authorization in the European Union. This antibody cocktail has retained, albeit reduced, neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant and is approved for pre-exposure prophylaxis. No severe adverse events were recorded for our patients. One patient had a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 under treatment with sotrovimab, but was asymptomatic. The other five patients did not develop symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection or evidence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the time of treatment up until the finalization of this report. SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody treatment should be considered individually for multiple sclerosis patients lacking adequate vaccination responses on account of their immunomodulatory treatment, especially in times of high incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","misc","wim"

A patient with symptomatic severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis was admitted to a high-volume center specializing in transfemoral TAVR with self-expanding valves. No anatomical risk factors of coronary occlusion were identified on pre-procedural computed tomography analysis. The patient was scheduled for a transfemoral TAVR with a self-expanding valve. Balloon pre-dilatation prior to prosthesis implantation was routinely used for assessing the supra-annular structure and assessing the risk of coronary occlusion. Immediately after the tubular balloon inflation, fluoroscopy revealed that the right coronary artery was not visible, and the flow in the left coronary artery was reduced. The patient would be at high-risk of coronary occlusion if a long stent self-expanding valve was implanted. Therefore, our heart team decided to suspend the ongoing procedure. A transapical TAVR with a 23 mm J-valve was performed 3 days later. The prosthesis was deployed at a proper position without blocking the coronary ostia and the final fluoroscopy showed normal flow in bilateral coronary arteries with the same filling as preoperatively. Our successful case highlights the importance of a comprehensive assessment of coronary risk and a thorough understanding of the TAVR procedure for the heart team. A short-stent prosthesis is feasible for patients at high risk of coronary occlusion. Most importantly TAVR should be called off even if the catheter has been introduced when an extremely high risk of coronary obstruction is identified during the procedure and no solution can be found.","misc","wim"

Rarely, PTA can be complicated by several other cerebrovascular disease, including arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), intracranial aneurysms, moyamoya disease, and carotid-cavernous malformations. Herein, we reported a rare case of PTA combined with an AVM in a male patient. The patient was a 28-year-old male with epileptic seizures at the onset of symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal signal foci and localized softening foci formation with gliosis in the right parietal temporal lobe. Furthermore, using a digital subtraction angiogram (DSA), it was found that an abnormal carotid-basilar anastomosis had developed through a PTA originating from the cavernous portion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and a large AVM on the surface of the right carotid artery. The lesion of AVM tightly developed and draining into superior sagittal sinus. A hybrid operating room was used for the surgery. The main feeding arteries of the AVM originating from three major arteries, including the right middle cerebral artery, the right anterior cerebral artery, and the right posterior cerebral artery, were clipped and subsequently, then the AVM was thoroughly removed. The intraoperative DSA showed that the AVM had been resected completely. Postoperative pathological examination of the resected specimen indicated the presence of an AVM. The patient recovered well after surgery and has been symptom-free for more than 3 months. In summary, the pathogenesis of the coexistence of PTA and AVM remains unknown. As highlighted in this case report, hybrid surgery can be used to remove AVMs and can improve the patients' prognosis. To our best knowledge, this is the first case in the literature of successful AVM treatment using hybrid surgery.","misc","wim"

This study applied models, including the coupling coordination degree, spatial autocorrelation, and Tobit, to explore the heterogeneous characteristics of the coupling of China's industrial agglomeration and regional economic resilience from 2005 to 2019. Additionally, by applying the perspectives of economic and geographic location, indicators were selected to analyze the associated influencing factors, including industrial externalities, new economic geographies, economic policy factors, and other aspects. We found that the overall coupling between industrial agglomeration and economic resilience increased over the study period, but with only a moderate level of coordination. Provinces with high, moderate, and low levels of coordination eventually emerged along a strip-like alternating pattern in space. The dependence increased with an increase in space, but was not significant, and there was a lack of benign interaction between the regions. With respect to interactivity between locations, the interaction of the east and the coast was the most active. There were lower levels of interaction between the west and inland regions. This further confirmed the significant temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the coupling. Environmental pollution, market consumption, the quality of space, and technological support significantly promoted the coupling; opening to the outside world did not. Specifically, with respect to economic location, market consumption and spatial quality had a significant positive effect on the eastern coupling. The center and west regions were significantly affected by economic density and market consumption, and the northeast region was affected by spatial quality and capital intensity. Concerning geographical location, market and technological forces strongly promoted interactions in both the coast and inland regions. The study found that both the government and the market need better guidance to effectively engage with and shape industrial agglomeration and economic resilience in a scientific, reasonable, localized, and distinctive manner.","misc","wim"

This study found that there was a significant linear correlation between the equivalent dose of lens and the exposure time. The tube voltage, tube current, and the size of fluoroscopic field of vision also have an impact on the radiation of workers during surgical exposure. Interventional surgery is difficult and easy. The exposure time of difficult surgery is relatively long, so the dose received by interventional staff is large. The intervention staff should improve their professional knowledge, be proficient in the operation technology, and try to reduce the exposure without affecting the diagnosis and treatment effect. During the intervention operation, the eye substance of the operator is exposed to a certain dose of radiation, and the wearing rate of protective lead glasses of the intervention staff is very low. Therefore, we must pay attention to the protection of the eyes, strengthen the protection management, and reduce the exposure dose of the intervention staff as much as possible.","misc","wim"

We conducted the study in two contrasting soils (acidic and neutral) over the course of 28 days. Our results indicated that DMPP had higher inhibitory efficacy in the acidic soil (30.7%) compared to the neutral soil (12.1%). The abundance of AOB and Nitrospira-like NOB were positively associated with nitrate content in acidic soil. In neutral soil, these communities were joined by the abundance of AOA and Nitrobacter-like NOB in being positively associated with nitrate content. By blocking the growth of AOB in acidic soil-and the growth of both AOB and comammox in neutral soil-DMPP supported higher rates of AOA growth. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that urea and urea + DMPP treatments significantly increased the diversity indices of bacteria, including Chao 1, ACE, Shannon, and Simpson in the acidic soil but did not do so in the neutral soil. However, both urea and urea + DMPP treatments obviously altered the community structure of bacteria in both soils relative to the control treatment. This experiment comprehensively analyzed the effects of urea and nitrification inhibitor on functional guilds involved in the nitrification process and non-targeted bacteria, not just focus on targeted ammonia oxidizers.","misc","wim"

However, tools to predict individualized readmission risk are lacking. This study aimed to develop machine learning models to predict 30-day unplanned readmission in children with PH. This study collected data on pediatric inpatients with PH from the Chongqing Medical University Medical Data Platform from January 2012 to January 2019. Key clinical variables were selected by the least absolute shrinkage and the selection operator. Prediction models were selected from 15 machine learning algorithms with excellent performance, which was evaluated by area under the operating characteristic curve (AUC). The outcome of the predictive model was interpreted by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). A total of 5,913 pediatric patients with PH were included in the final cohort. The CatBoost model was selected as the predictive model with the greatest AUC for 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77-0.86), high accuracy for 0.74 (95% CI: 0.72-0.76), sensitivity 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.87), and specificity 0.74 (95% CI: 0.72-0.76). Age, length of stay (LOS), congenital heart surgery, and nonmedical order discharge showed the greatest impact on 30-day readmission in pediatric PH, according to SHAP results. This study developed a CatBoost model to predict the risk of unplanned 30-day readmission in pediatric patients with PH, which showed more significant performance compared with traditional logistic regression. We found that age, LOS, congenital heart surgery, and nonmedical order discharge were important factors for 30-day readmission in pediatric PH.","misc","wim"

ALKBH4 is a member of the AlkB homolog (ALKBH) family that controls demethylation of DNA and RNA. This study enrolled 160 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent complete resection. The expression of ALKBH4 in cancer tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The correlation among the expression of ALKBH4, clinicopathological factors, and prognostic outcome was evaluated. In the NSCLC clinical samples, the expression of ALKBH4 was identified not only in cell membranes but also in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. In 140 of 160 cases, ALKBH4 was more highly expressed in the cancerous tissue than in the surrounding normal tissue. The proportion of cancer cells expressing ALKBH4 was higher in adenocarcinoma than in other histological types. In addition, the expression intensity of ALKBH4 in each cancer cell was also stronger in adenocarcinoma than in squamous cell carcinoma. The expression of ALKBH4 was not associated with clinicopathological factors, except for histological type. In adenocarcinoma, the recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were significantly lower in the ALKBH4-positive group than in the ALKBH4-negative group (P=0.008, 0.031, respectively). A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the ALKBH4 expression was an independent prognostic factor for RFS (P=0.003) and OS (P=0.013). The expression of ALKBH4 was observed in all four patients with adenocarcinoma in situ. The ALKBH4 expression may be a useful predictor of the postoperative outcomes of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients.","misc","wim"

We were inspired by mussels' adhesive components to synthesize polydopamine nanoparticles and then use a carbonization process to prepare fluorescent CNPs. Using some surfactants, we could control the sizes of CNPs and increase their dispersion in water. Fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed the excitation of CNPs at 360 nm and emission of blue light with a 400-450 nm wavelength. High quantum yields of greater than 20% were also measured. Transmission electron microscopy proved that the addition of surfactants could shrink particles to several nanometers in size. The fluorescent and conductive CNPs were applied to stain L929 fibroblast cells in vitro, finding no harmful effects on cells. Due to the polydopamine-derived CNPs' good electrical, fluorescent, and biocompatible response, we designed a platform to manipulate the cells after endocytosis of conductive CNPs to observe the effects of electrical stimulation on cell attachment, cell growth, and cell death. The nanoparticles endocytosed by cells seemed more easily attracted to the electric field, leading to enhanced cell attachment and growth. Therefore, CNP uptake can increase the attachment of cells onto a conductive plate electrode in a short time (within 10 min at 4°C). When the source of the electric field was changed to rod electrodes in the medium, cells that had been pre-adsorbed onto a non-conductive plate were desorbed from the plate and destroyed. Therefore, addition of CNPs during cell incubation can allow control of cell growth and death via manipulation of electric fields.","misc","wim"

Patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer who underwent surgical resection at two tertiary medical centers between 2010 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. A multi-state model was employed with one initial state (surgery), two intermediate states (locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis), and one absorbing state (death), comprising five transitions: surgery to locoregional recurrence, surgery to distant metastasis, surgery to death without recurrence, locoregional recurrence to death, and distant metastasis to death. Cox proportional hazards models stratified for these transitions were performed with the risk factors; transition probabilities for each patient were predicted. A total of 949 patients were identified [median age: 67 years, male: 614 (64.6%)]. Recurrence occurred in 194 (20.4%) patients (locoregional recurrence: 7.3%, distant metastasis: 13.1%). Hazard ratios for distant metastasis after surgery were higher for older age (hazard ratio: 1.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.06) and adenocarcinoma (hazard ratio: 1.67, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.61). Lower lobe location exhibited a higher hazard ratio for death after surgery without recurrence (hazard ratio: 1.59, 95% confidence interval: 1.00-2.53). Stage IIB lung cancer showed a higher probability of transition to distant metastasis after surgery than other stages. Cumulative transition hazards rapidly increased in both recurrence patterns until approximately two years after surgery (locoregional recurrence: 0.052; distant metastasis: 0.104). Patients with distant metastasis were more likely to die within 5 years of surgery than those with locoregional recurrence (6.8% and 2.6%, respectively). With the multi-state model, risk factors and post-relapse survival probabilities differed between locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis. These findings may enable clinicians to establish personalized follow-up strategies for patients undergoing curative resection for early stage non-small cell lung cancer.","misc","wim"
"1340",35966685,"The molecular diversity of transcriptional factor TfoX is a determinant in natural transformation in Glaesserella parasuis.","Natural transformation is a mechanism by which a particular bacterial species takes up foreign DNA and integrates it into its genome. The swine pathogen Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) is a naturally transformable bacterium. The regulation of competence, however, is not fully understood. In this study, the natural transformability of 99 strains was investigated. Only 44% of the strains were transformable under laboratory conditions. Through a high-resolution melting curve and phylogenetic analysis, we found that genetic differences in the core regulator of natural transformation, the tfoX gene, leads to two distinct natural transformation phenotypes. In the absence of the tfoX gene, the highly transformable strain SC1401 lost its natural transformability. In addition, when the SC1401 tfoX gene was replaced by the tfoX of SH0165, which has no natural transformability, competence was also lost. These results suggest that TfoX is a core regulator of natural transformation in G. parasuis, and that differences in tfoX can be used as a molecular indicator of natural transformability. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the SC1401 wildtype strain, and a tfoX gene deletion strain showed that differential gene expression and protein synthesis is mainly centered on pathways related to glucose metabolism. The results suggest that tfoX may mediate natural transformation by regulating the metabolism of carbon sources. Our study provides evidence that tfoX plays an important role in the natural transformation of G. parasuis.","misc","wim"

Methods: Eleven healthy participants undertook several BFR sessions with 2 different cuffs of similar width on their lower and upper limbs at different pressures [200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 mmHg for BStrong and 0, 40, and 60% of the arterial occlusion pressure (AOP) for Hokanson]. Doppler ultrasound recorded blood flows through the brachial and femoral artery at rest. Results: With BStrong, only 350 and 400 mmHg pressures were significantly different from resting values (0% AOP). With Hokanson, both 40% and 60% of the AOP were significantly different from resting values (p < 0.05). Discussion: While both cuffs elicited BFR, they failed to accurately modulate blood flow. Hokanson is appropriate for research settings while BStrong appears to be a convenient tool for practitioners due to its safety (i.e., the impossibility of completely occluding arteries) and the possibility of exercising freely detached from the pump.","misc","wim"

A systematic search of the PubMed database was performed to identify clinical presentations, imaging strategies, stent types, and treatment modalities for stent migration in hemodialysis patients. A total of 14 case reports on stent migration in TCVO procedures for hemodialysis patients were included and analyzed. Ten cases included migration to the cardiac chambers and the remainder migration to the pulmonary artery. The common symptoms of stent migration in TCVO procedures are reported to be chest pain and dyspnea, while three of the cases studied involved no symptoms. Echocardiography, chest X-ray, and computed tomography are the commonly used methods for the diagnosis of stent migration and identification of the precise positioning of the stent. Stent migration to the right subclavian or innominate veins was the most prevalent case (seven cases). All were bare stents. Seven cases involved retrieval by interventional surgery, while four cases involved retrieval by open heart surgery. However, there were three cases in which the wait-and-see approach was adopted since the patients were asymptomatic. Stent migration in TCVO procedures is a rare but extremely serious complication. The causes are not fully understood. The current treatment strategies include interventional surgery, open heart surgery, and the wait-and-see approach.","misc","wim"

Our study updates the comprehensive studies of Felix (1912), van Wagenen and Simpson (1965), and Juric-Lekic et al. (2013), which were published in books and thus are unsearchable via PubMed. Human gonads develop from the germinal ridge, a thickening of coelomic epithelium on the medial side of the urogenital ridge. The bilateral urogenital ridges contain elements of the mesonephric kidney, namely the mesonephric duct, mesonephric tubules, and mesonephric glomeruli. The germinal ridge, into which primordial germ cells migrate, is initially recognized as a thickening of coelomic epithelium on the urogenital ridge late in the 4th week of gestation. Subsequently, in the 5th week of gestation, a dense mesenchyme develops sub-adjacent to the epithelium of the germinal ridge, and together these elements bulge into the coelomic cavity forming bilateral longitudinal ridges attached to the urogenital ridges. During development, primordial cells migrate into the germinal ridge and subsequently into testicular cords that form within the featureless dense mesenchyme of the germinal ridge at 6-8 weeks of gestation. The initial low density of testicular cords seen at 8 weeks remodels into a dense array of testicular cords surrounded by α-actin-positive myoid cells during the second trimester. Human testicular development shares many features with that of mice being derived from 4 elements: coelomic epithelium, sub-adjacent mesenchyme, primordial germ cells, and the mesonephros.","misc","wim"

Survival was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models. A total of 85 patients with SCP and 32 patients with CSP were included in the study. There was no difference in the patient age, race distribution, year of diagnosis, primary site, tumor size, tumor stage, receipt of chemotherapy and receipt of radiotherapy between the two groups. However, more patients with CSP received surgical treatment (P<0.001) when compared to patients with SCP. Overall survival was comparable between the two groups (P=0.562) with a 1-year survival rate of 20.8% and 22.2% for SCP and CSP, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that surgical resection was independent prognostic factor of both SCP (HR: 0.34, P=0.017) and CSP (HR: 0.17, P=0.017). Chemotherapy was a prognostic factor of CSP in univariate analysis, but not of SCP. SCP and CSP are rare malignant tumors of the pancreas with a dismal prognosis.

We underscore the eco-evolutionary significance of using cross-kingdom (bacterial-fungal) co-occurrence networks to increase the network's representability of natural communities. To do so, we demonstrate how ecosystem-level interpretation of plant microbiome evolution changes with and without multi-kingdom analysis. Then, to overcome oversimplified interpretation of the networks stemming from the stereotypical dichotomy between bacteria and fungi, we recommend three avenues for ecological interpretation: (1) understanding dynamics and mechanisms of co-occurrence networks through generalized Lotka-Volterra and consumer-resource models, (2) finding alternative ecological explanations for individual negative and positive fungal-bacterial edges, and (3) connecting cross-kingdom networks to abiotic and biotic (host) environments.","misc","wim"

A Joinpoint regression model was used to analyze the annual percent change (APC) of the age-standardized incidence and prevalence. The age-standardized prevalence of Crohn's disease (CD) increased from 1.59/100,000 in 2013 to 3.39/100,000 (p < 0.05) in 2016, and that of ulcerative colitis (UC) increased from 8.72/100,000 to 17.24/100,000 (p < 0.05) during the period, with a UC/CD ratio of 5.09 in 2016.

We examined the visual N1, the electrophysiological correlate of vOTC activation across five time points in kindergarten (T1, mean age 6.60 years), middle and end of first grade (T2, 7.38 years; T3, 7.68 years), second grade (T4, 8.28 years), and fifth grade (T5, 11.40 years). A combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal EEG data of a total of 62 children (35 female) at varying familial risk for dyslexia were available to form groups of 23, 22, 27, 27, and 42 participants for each of the five time points. The children performed a target detection task which included visual presentation of single digits (DIG), false fonts (FF), and letters (LET) to derive measures for coarse (DIG vs. FF) and fine (DIG vs. LET) digit sensitive processing across development. The N1 amplitude analyses indicated coarse and fine sensitivity characterized by a stronger N1 to digits than false fonts across all five time points, and stronger N1 to digits than letters at all but the second (T2) time point. In addition, lower arithmetic skills were associated with stronger coarse N1 digit sensitivity over the left hemisphere in second grade (T4), possibly reflecting allocation of more attentional resources or stronger reliance on the verbal system in children with poorer arithmetic skills. To summarize, our results show persistent visual N1 sensitivity to digits that is already present early on in pre-school and remains stable until fifth grade. This pattern of digit sensitivity development clearly differs from the relatively sharp rise and fall of the visual N1 sensitivity to words or letters between kindergarten and middle of elementary school and suggests unique developmental trajectories for visual processing of written characters that are relevant to numeracy and literacy.","misc","wim"

Firstly, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between radiotherapy-sensitivity and radiotherapy-resistance were identified by GEO2R from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) website, and prognosis-related genes for cervical cancer were obtained from the HPA database. Subsequently, the DAVID database analyzed gene ontology (GO). Meanwhile, the protein-protein interaction network was constructed by STRING; By online analysis of DEGs, prognostic genes, and CCDB data that are associated with cervical cancer formation through the OncoLnc database, we aim to search for the key DEGs associated with CC, Finally, the key gene(s) was further validated by immunohistochemistry. 298 differentially expressed genes, 712 genes associated with prognosis, and 509 genes related to cervical cancer formation were found. The results of gene function analysis showed that DEGs were mainly significant in functional pathways such as variable shear and energy metabolism. By further verification, two genes, ASPH and NKAPP1 were identified through validation as genes that affect both sensitivities to radiotherapy and survival finally. Then, immunohistochemical results showed that the ASPH gene was highly expressed in the radiotherapy-resistant group and had lower Overall survival (OS) and Progression-free survival (PFS). This study aims to better understand the characteristics of cervical cancer radiation therapy resistance-related genes through bioinformatics and provide further research ideas for finding new mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets related to cervical cancer radiation therapy.","misc","wim"

We succeeded in directly measuring the local SPV by AC-KPFM with higher resolution, thanks to the exclusion of the thermal drift. We found that AC-KPFM can achieve a SPV response faster by about one to eight orders of magnitude than classical KPFM. Moreover, AC-KPFM is applicable in both amplitude modulation and frequency modulation mode. Thus, it contributes to advancing SPV measurements in various environments, such as vacuum, air, and liquids. This method can be utilized for direct measurements of changes in surface potential induced by modulated external disturbances.","misc","wim"

"1843",35963043,"Campylobacter biofilms.","Campylobacter infection is one of the most widespread foodborne gastroenteritis worldwide. As a commensal microbe in the intestinal tracts of food-producing animals, Campylobacter easily enters the food chain and eventually transmits to human hosts through the consumption of contaminated food products. The survival of Campylobacter in food chain remains as a paradox considering its fastidious growth requirement in laboratory settings and ubiquitous presence in unfavorable environment. Biofilm is suggested as a key persistence mechanism used by Campylobacter during its transmission from animals to humans. This review summarizes Campylobacter biofilm characteristics, identifies biological and non-biological factors that influence biofilm formation, and discusses the control strategies. Overall, biofilm formation ability shows strain-to-strain variation in Campylobacter and is affected by the presence of other co-cultivated bacteria. Carbohydrates and eDNA are recognized as significant portions of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in Campylobacter biofilm. Advanced techniques such as super resolution microscopy and chemical imaging platforms can demonstrate the structure and EPS biochemical compositions. Biofilm formation relies on various biological factors (e.g., flagella, cell surface hydrophobicity, and quorum sensing) and environmental factors (e.g., substrate properties, hydrodynamic condition, and nutrients). Different biological and inorganic compounds can inactivate Campylobacter biofilm along with the feasibility of discovering specific chemicals to quench quorum sensing of this microbe so as to indirectly reduce its biofilm. Taken together, Campylobacter biofilm research is still in its infancy and future research can focus on investigating dormancy state and antimicrobial resistance evolution in biofilms as well as in vivo characterization.","misc","wim"

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of calcium propionate feeding levels on the immune function, liver function, and fecal microbial composition of dairy cows in early lactation. Thirty-two multiparous Holstein cows were randomly assigned to four treatments after calving. Treatments were a basal diet plus 0, 200, 350, and 500 g calcium propionate per cow per day throughout a 5-week trial period. Cows were milked three times a day, and blood was sampled to measure immune function and liver function on d 7, 21, and 35. The rectal contents were sampled and collected on d 35 to analyze the microbial composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicated that increasing amounts of calcium propionate did not affected the serum concentrations of total protein, IgG, IgM, and calcium, but the concentrations of albumin and IgA changed quadratically. With the increase of calcium propionate, the activity of serum alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase increased linearly, in contrast, the activity of alkaline phosphatase decreased linearly. Moreover, dietary supplementation with increasing levels of calcium propionate tended to quadratically decrease the relative abundance of Firmicutes while quadratically increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes, and consequently linearly decreased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the rectal microbiota. Additionally, the supplementation of calcium propionate increased the relative abundances of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 and Prevotellaceae_UCG-004 linearly, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 quadratically, but decreased the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group and Family_XIII_AD3011_group quadratically. Compared with the CON group, the calcium propionate supplementation significantly decreased the relative abundance of Acetitomaculum but increased the abundances of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Alistipes. In summary, these results suggested that the supplementation of calcium propionate to dairy cows in early lactation could beneficially alter the rectal microbiota.","misc","wim"

We retrospectively reviewed 297 untreated primary lung adenocarcinoma patients with exact EGFR status. Based on their EGFR status, the patients were divided into a mutant-type group (138 patients) and wild-type group (159 patients). General patient characteristics and possible factors reflecting the status of EGFR were also evaluated. Of the 297 lung adenocarcinoma patients analyzed for EGFR status who underwent positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) between January 2013 and December 2017, mutations in the EGFR gene were detected in 138 patients (46.5%). EGFR mutations were more frequently associated with women, never smokers, and low 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT maximal standard uptake value of the primary tumor (pSUVmax). Multivariate analysis indicated that women [odds ratio (OR) =2.853; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.451-5.611; P=0.002], never smokers (OR =2.414; 95% CI: 1.217-4.789; P=0.012), tumor size <3.5 cm (OR, 2.170; 95% CI: 1.205-3.908; P=0.010), and pSUVmax <8.2 (OR =1.904; 95% CI: 1.098-3.302; P=0.022) were effective predictors of EGFR mutation. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) of pSUVmax and tumor size was 0.623 and 0.600, respectively. Combined with clinical characteristics, including sex and smoking status, the AUC of the 4 predictors was 0.770. These indicators could be helpful for enhancing predictive accuracy of EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma patients, especially in those for whom EGFR detection is unavailable.","misc","wim"

The precise and simplistic approach such as the correlation of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) parameters, Resting Motor Threshold (RMT) and Motor Evoked Potential (MEP), in patients with stroke might play a critical role, given the prognostic value of MEP, a measure of cortical excitability, and might be the key point in prescribing appropriate therapeutic strategies. The study aimed to determine the correlation of FMA-based impairment in the upper extremity function specifically of the wrist and hand with respect to the neurophysiological parameters of corticospinal tract integrity. The Institutional Review Board approved the study and 67 (n) patients with stroke were enrolled in the Department of Neurology, AIIMS, New Delhi, India. The motor assessment was performed on patients by the upper extremity subset of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and the clinical history was obtained. RMT and MEP of Extensor Digitorum Communis (EDC) muscle were measured via TMS. A significant positive correlation was observed between Fugl-Meyer Assessment Wrist/Hand (FMA W/H) and MEP scores (r = 0.560, <0.001). Also, Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA UE) scores demonstrated a moderate positive association with MEP responsiveness (r = 0.421, <0.001). MEP of the EDC muscle was found to be associated with sensorimotor control as measured by FMA. Moreover, FMA W/H score values might be a better prognostic indicator of EDC MEP responsiveness. Interestingly, a novel element comprising the range of FMA UE and FMA W/H components was observed to be a potential indicator of MEP responsiveness and could also indicate establishing FMA as a surrogate for TMS in resource-limited settings for prognostification.","misc","wim"
"2184",35959036,"Investigating employee perceptions: Association between recognized individual talents and social wellbeing.","Organizations worldwide increasingly adopt inclusive talent management, and this approach appears to rhyme particularly well with the Nordic welfare model. Questions about its value remain understudied, however. The inclusive approach is rooted in positive psychology and focuses on recognizing each employee's individual talents and assessing whether they fit the long-term needs of the organization, since a fit is assumed to be associated with employees' wellbeing. In the present study, we test this assumption focusing specifically on a key talent management practice, talent identification, and the social dimension of employee wellbeing. Data were collected through an employee survey conducted within the Finnish units of four international manufacturing organizations and analyzed using logistic regression (n = 618). We found that the recognition of individual talents for long-term deployment by the organization is positively associated with social wellbeing in terms of supervisor support and social climate in the work unit, as perceived by the employees. Our results tentatively suggest that inclusive talent management creates value through the identification of employees' individual talents as this practice can be associated with their enhanced wellbeing.","misc","wim"

However, excipients often carry contaminants/ impurities and may also increase moisture levels in solid formulations, which can have detrimental effects on the drugs, including drug degradation and stability. Hence, achieving adequate shelf life of drug products has been among the most challenging issues for pharmaceuticals. Here we report a case study where we systematically studied the oxidative degradation of a pharmaceutical compound GENE-A, spray-dried and dispersed in hydroxypropyl methylcellulose-acetate succinate polymer matrix. Three different oxidative degradation products were observed, and their mechanisms of formation were investigated via forced degradation studies. Finally, we used several antioxidants based on their mechanisms of action to reduce/ prevent the drug degradation process. Propyl gallate alone and in combination with Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid completely prevented the formation of two degradation products, whereas there was no significant impact observed on the third one. The results showed that both metal chelators and free radical terminators most effectively prevented drug degradation. This study may address some of the key issues that pharmaceutical companies encounter and offer appropriate solutions to counter the oxidative degradation process of pharmaceuticals.","misc","wim"

We investigated the global myocardial work of the left ventricle in two types of hypertrophies using the non-invasive myocardial work index (NMWI). Conventional echocardiography was performed on 107 subjects with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≥ 50%), who comprised patients with HCM (n = 40), H-LVH (n = 35), and healthy people with normal blood pressure and left ventricular structure (n = 32). Except for the conventional echocardiographic parameters, the left ventricular myocardial work parameters based on pressure-strain loops, including global myocardial work index (GWI), global constructive work (GCW), global wasted work (GWW), and global work efficiency (GWE), were evaluated in three groups. Multivariate discriminant analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the incremental value of NMWI for distinguishing HCM from H-LVH. Compared to the control group, GWI and GCW were significantly lower in HCM patients (P < 0.05), whereas GWI was significantly higher in H-LVH patients. GWW was higher and GWE was significantly decreased in both HCM and H-LVH patients than in the control group (P < 0.05). Multivariate discriminant analysis and ROC curve revealed that the inter-ventricular septum thickness (IVST)/left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT) and GCW were each able to distinguish HCM from H-LVH. The combination of IVST/LVPWT and GCW discriminated HCM and H-LVH with a higher predictive accuracy of 94.7%. NMWI may provide additional information in evaluating the myocardial function in patients with HCM and H-LVH. Myocardial work combined with conventional echocardiography could improve the clinical diagnostic accuracy of distinguishing HCM and H-LVH.","misc","wim"

This study aimed at evaluating the validity of a 7-IMUs system against the optoelectronic system. Ten asymptomatic subjects were included. They wore IMUs on their feet, shanks, thighs and pelvis. The IMUs were embedded in clusters with reflective markers. Reference kinematics was computed from anatomical markers. Gait kinematics was obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope data after sensor orientation estimation and sensor-to-segment (S2S) calibration steps. The S2S calibration steps were also applied to the cluster data. IMU-based and cluster-based kinematics were compared to the reference through root mean square errors (RMSEs), centered RMSEs (after mean removal), correlation coefficients (CCs) and differences in amplitude. The mean RMSE and centered RMSE were, respectively, 7.5° and 4.0° for IMU-kinematics, and 7.9° and 3.8° for cluster-kinematics. Very good CCs were found in the sagittal plane for both IMUs and cluster-based kinematics at the hip, knee and ankle levels (CCs &gt; 0.85). The overall mean amplitude difference was about 7°. These results reflected good accordance in our system with the reference, especially in the sagittal plane, but the presence of offsets requires caution for clinical use.","misc","wim"

Small, short-term cohort studies of similar systems have been published, but to detect low rates of complications requires a large study sample and longer-term follow-up. This study details the outcomes of all patients with injuries suitable for a direct discharge protocol over a four-year period, reviewed at a minimum of three years after attendance. All TTC records between February 2014 and December 2017 were collated from a prospective database. Fractures of the radial head, little finger metacarpal, fifth metatarsal, toe phalanges and mallet finger injuries were included. TTC outcome, including any deviations from a well-established direct discharge protocol, were noted. All records were re-assessed at a minimum of 36 months after TTC triage (mean 54 months) to ascertain which injuries attended the trauma clinic after initial discharge. Reasons for attendance, the source of referral and any subsequent surgical procedures were identified. There were 6688 patients with fractures of the radial head (1861), little finger metacarpal (1621), fifth metatarsal (1916), toe phalanges (920) and mallet finger injuries (370). 298 (6%) patients were re-referred after direct discharge and attended trauma clinic at a mean time after injury of 11.9 weeks, of whom 11 (0.2%) underwent a surgical intervention. Serious adverse events, defined as those in which a patient may not have come to harm if early clinical review had been undertaken, occurred in 1 patient (0.01%).

"48",35965225,"Urodynamic evaluation of the efficacy of vibegron, a new β3-adrenergic receptor agonist, on lower urinary tract function in children and adolescents with overactive bladder.","Idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as an urgency symptom with or without urge incontinence, which is not due to known neurological abnormalities. Since children present with variable symptoms, pediatric nonneurogenic idiopathic OAB is a condition that is difficult to diagnose and treat. Although there are few reports on bladder function in pediatric patients compared to adult patients, it can be useful for diagnosis. Antimuscarinic therapy is the pharmacological mainstay of OAB management. However, antimuscarinic use is limited by side effects and Insufficient effects. Vibegron, a new drug with a different mechanism of action (β3-adrenoreceptor agonist), was recently introduced for treating OAB in adults but has not been studied in the pediatric population. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and tolerability of vibegron in children and adolescents with idiopathic OAB. We conducted a retrospective study enrolling pediatric patients with OAB whose symptoms did not improve with behavioral therapy or pharmaceutical therapy. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed via a question, and patients underwent video-urodynamic testing before and during treatment with once-daily 50 mg vibegron. Statistical differences were evaluated using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. Out of the 17 patients that were recruited, full study with two urodynamic studies were confirmed by 11 patients. OAB symptoms improved in 14 (82.4%) patients, and 3 patients discontinued treatment because of ineffectiveness. No patients discontinued treatment because of intolerance to vibegron. The median (IQR) first desire to void (133 [82-185]-161 [123-227] mL), bladder capacity (158 [136-238]-204 [150-257] mL), and bladder compliance (18.1 [9.1-76.7]-34.0 [30.0-82.3] mL/cm H2O) improved significantly post treatment compared to before treatment. Detrusor overactivity disappeared in one of the eight patients with this condition. The parameters of voiding function did not change significantly after the administration of vibegron. Treatment with vibegron significantly improved clinical and urodynamic parameters of pediatric OAB with no adverse effects. Little information is available regarding the feasibility of switching drugs when patients discontinue prior pharmacological therapy because of insufficient efficacy or poor tolerability in children. Vibegron may be a promising OAB treatment option with a better balance of efficacy and tolerability. Vibegron is an alternative agent for pediatric patients with idiopathic OAB for improving both subjective symptoms and lower urinary tract function. Future prospective randomized studies with larger sample sizes must be conducted to validate the results of the present study.","misc","wim"

Thermal treatment promoted the formation of 7S-C3G complexes via hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds but did not induce the formation of 7S-C3G covalent products. Thermal treatment at 65 °C and 121 °C enhanced the binding affinity of 7S-C3G complexes by 46.19 % and 1203 % compared with 25 °C.

Different methods and procedures are adopted to detect and diagnose heart abnormalities. Data scientists are working on finding the different methods with the required accuracy (Strodthoff et al., 2021). Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the procedure to find the heart condition in the waveform. For ages, the machine learning techniques, which are feature based, played a vital role in the medical sciences and centralized the data in cloud computing and having access throughout the world. Furthermore, deep learning or transfer learning widens the vision and introduces different transfer learning methods to ensure accuracy and time management to detect the ECG in a better way in comparison to the previous and machine learning methods. Hence, it is said that transfer learning has turned world research into more appropriate and innovative research. Here, the proposed comparison and accuracy analysis of different transfer learning methods by using ECG classification for detecting ECG Arrhythmia (CAA-TL). The CAA-TL model has the multiclassification of the ECG dataset, which has been taken from Kaggle. Some of the healthy and unhealthy datasets have been taken in real-time, augmented, and fused with the Kaggle dataset, i.e., Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH dataset). The CAA-TL worked on the accuracy of heart problem detection by using different methods like ResNet50, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet. All three deep learning methods showed remarkable accuracy, which is improved from the previous research. The comparison of different deep learning approaches with respect to layers widens the research and gives the more clarity and accuracy and at the same time finds it time-consuming while working with multiclassification with massive dataset of ECG.

Our research covered three separate time points of hospitalization (days 1, 4, and 10). We did not exclude patients treated with glucocorticoids but, instead, compared them with patients not treated with steroids. We correlated the results of thyroid function tests with markers of systemic inflammation. We checked if abnormal thyroid function can predict unfavorable outcomes defined as combined primary endpoint and/or secondary endpoints; the combined primary endpoint was the occurrence of death, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressor infusion, or prolonged hospital stay, and the secondary endpoint was any of the listed events. In general, 80.46% of evaluated patients displayed abnormalities in thyroid function tests over at least one time point throughout the observation. We noticed a high prevalence of features typical for thyroid dysfunction in non-thyroidal illness (NTI). Free triiodothyronine (fT3) concentration was significantly lower in the group requiring glucocorticoids. Patients displaying abnormal thyroid function were statistically more likely to meet the predefined combined primary endpoint. We found that fT3 measured at admission could be perceived as an independent predictor of endpoint completion for all analyzed groups. Thyroid involvement is common in COVID-19. Our study supports the idea of thyroid function abnormalities being important clinical tools and allowing early recognition of possible detrimental outcomes of the disease.","misc","wim"

Here, we provide evidence supporting that natural subclinical infection with isolate NcUru3 of N. caninum in a pregnant heifer did not provide protection against abortion caused by a different N. caninum genotype in the subsequent gestation. A Holstein heifer delivered a healthy calf congenitally infected with N. caninum. Specific anti-N. caninum IgG was detected by indirect ELISA in sera obtained from the dam at calving and the calf before ingestion of colostrum, indicating in utero exposure to the parasite in the latter. A N. caninum strain named NcUru3 was isolated and characterized by multilocus microsatellite typing from the brain of this neonate euthanized at 9 days of age. Sixty days after calving, the cow got pregnant, although she aborted spontaneously at ~6 months of gestation. Pathologic examination of the aborted fetus and placenta revealed typical lesions of neosporosis, including encephalitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, myositis, and placentitis. Neospora caninum DNA was amplified from the fetal brain, heart, kidney, and placenta, and multilocus microsatellite typing revealed a genotype that differed from isolate NcUru3 at the level of microsatellite marker 6A (MS6A). Serum obtained from the dam at the time of abortion had IgG that cross-recognized isolate NcUru3, as demonstrated by immunoblotting, indicating that the humoral immune response did not prevent the other genotype from infecting the fetus and inducing fetoplacental lesions and abortion.

CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CTFFR) based on CCTA has been proven to be accurate in the diagnosis of non-calcified patients, but its clinical use in patients with calcified coronary artery disease remains to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of coronary artery calcification on CTFFR. CCTA, coronary angiography, and FFR were performed on 128 patients in three clinical medical centers. Local investigators performed an assessment of stenosis for CCTA and the core laboratory performed the CTFFR calculations. CTFFR ≤0.8 and diameter stenosis ≥50% for CCTA was identified as lesion-specific ischemia. The diagnostic performance of CTFFR in identifying the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was analyzed using an invasive FFR ≤0.8 as the gold standard. We compared the diagnostic performances between CTFFR and CCTA according to the level of calcification. We divided patients into four groups based on the coronary artery calcification score [coronary artery calcification score (CACS) =0, >0 to <100, ≥100 to <400, and ≥400]. The Youden index indicated an optimal threshold of 0.80 for CTFFR to identify functionally ischemic lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for CTFFR on a per-patient basis were 90% (80-96%), 98% (92-99%), 94% (89-97%), 98% (91-99%), 92% (83-97%), and 96.9% (94.2-99.6%), respectively. Compared to CCTA, CTFFR had a higher specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV, and AUC in both the low to intermediate calcification group and the high calcification group. The diagnostic efficacy of CTFFR was higher than that of CCTA without the influence of calcification. This Chinese multi-center study showed that CTFFR based on novel computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling demonstrated very high diagnostic efficacy compared to the invasive measurement of FFR in all lesions suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Of particular note are the high specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of CTFFR, even in patients with calcification, which were significantly better than previous CCTA assessments.","misc","wim"

The training cohort, validation cohort, and entire cohort of endometrial cancer patients were then split into high-risk and low-risk categories. To investigate variations across different risk groups, we used survival analysis, enrichment analysis, and immune microenvironment analysis. The platform for analysis is R software (version X64 3.6.1). Based on the transcript expression of IFN-γ-related lncRNAs, two distinct subgroups of EC from TCGA cohort were formed, each with different outcomes. Ten IFN-γ-related lncRNAs were used to build a predictive signature using Cox regression analysis and the LASSO regression, including CFAP58, LINC02014, UNQ6494, AC006369.1, NRAV, BMPR1B-DT, AC068134.2, AP002840.2, GS1-594A7.3, and OLMALINC. The high-risk group had a considerably worse outcome (p < 0.05). In the immunological microenvironment, there were also substantial disparities across different risk categories. Our findings give a reference for endometrial cancer prognostic type and immunological status assessment, as well as prospective molecular markers for the disease.","misc","wim"
"1697",35957913,"Molecular Changes In Cardiac Tissue As A New Marker To Predict Cardiac Dysfunction Induced By Radiotherapy.","The contribution of radiotherapy, per se, to late cardiotoxicity remains controversial. To clarify its impact on the development of early cardiac dysfunction, we developed an experimental model in which the hearts of rats were exposed, in a fractionated plan, to clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation for oncological patients that undergo thoracic radiotherapy. Rat hearts were exposed to daily doses of 0.04, 0.3, and 1.2 Gy for 23 days, achieving cumulative doses of 0.92, 6.9, and 27.6 Gy, respectively. We demonstrate that myocardial deformation, assessed by global longitudinal strain, was impaired (a relative percentage reduction of >15% from baseline) in a dose-dependent manner at 18 months. Moreover, by scanning electron microscopy, the microvascular density in the cardiac apex was significantly decreased exclusively at 27.6 Gy dosage. Before GLS impairment detection, several tools (qRT-PCR, mass spectrometry, and western blot) were used to assess molecular changes in the cardiac tissue. The number/expression of several genes, proteins, and KEGG pathways, related to inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiac muscle contraction, were differently expressed in the cardiac tissue according to the cumulative dose. Subclinical cardiac dysfunction occurs in a dose-dependent manner as detected by molecular changes in cardiac tissue, a predictor of the severity of global longitudinal strain impairment. Moreover, there was no dose threshold below which no myocardial deformation impairment was detected. Our findings i) contribute to developing new markers and exploring non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging to assess cardiac tissue changes as an early predictor of cardiac dysfunction; ii) should raise red flags, since there is no dose threshold below which no myocardial deformation impairment was detected and should be considered in radiation-based imaging and -guided therapeutic cardiac procedures; and iii) highlights the need for personalized clinical approaches.","misc","wim"

This study analyzed the outcomes after nonreinforced RAA in two Austrian centers. Patients with RAA at two Austrian centers between 6/2,009 and 6/2,017 were retrospectively analyzed. Aortic diameters were measured by CT pre- and post-operatively. Patients were assigned according to valve morphology and imaging modality. Overall, 253 patients underwent RAA [women: 30.8%; median age 74 (63-79) years] with a mean preoperative ascending diameter of 44.7 (±3.5) mm. RAA-related postoperative adverse events occurred in 1.2% (n = 3) over a follow-up of a median of 3.8 (2.4-5.5) years: One type A aortic dissection, one lethal aortic rupture at the suture line, and one suture line bleeding with cardiac tamponade and need of surgical revision. The overall survival rate was 89.7%. Aortic valve morphology itself was no risk factor for mortality (Log-Rank: 0.942). One hundred and forty patients had a tricuspid [TAV: (55.3%)] aortic valve and 113 patients had a bicuspid aortic valve [BAV: (44.7%)]. Redilatation to a diameter >50 mm according to CT follow-up occurred in 5.7% (n = 5 of 87). One patient needed reoperation with RAA and aortic valve replacement due to a prosthesis-patient mismatch after aortic valve replacement and aortic redilatation. Non-reinforced RAA is a safe, feasible, and reproducible procedure with low rates of perioperative complications in selected patients primarily undergoing aortic valve repair with a dilated ascending aorta. Aortic valve morphology has no impact on mortality after RAA.","misc","wim"
"1222",35957291,"Dual-Coupled CNN-GCN-Based Classification for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data.","Deep learning techniques have brought substantial performance gains to remote sensing image classification. Among them, convolutional neural networks (CNN) can extract rich spatial and spectral features from hyperspectral images in a short-range region, whereas graph convolutional networks (GCN) can model middle- and long-range spatial relations (or structural features) between samples on their graph structure. These different features make it possible to classify remote sensing images finely. In addition, hyperspectral images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) images can provide spatial-spectral information and elevation information of targets on the Earth's surface, respectively. These multi-source remote sensing data can further improve classification accuracy in complex scenes. This paper proposes a classification method for HS and LiDAR data based on a dual-coupled CNN-GCN structure. The model can be divided into a coupled CNN and a coupled GCN. The former employs a weight-sharing mechanism to structurally fuse and simplify the dual CNN models and extracting the spatial features from HS and LiDAR data. The latter first concatenates the HS and LiDAR data to construct a uniform graph structure. Then, the dual GCN models perform structural fusion by sharing the graph structures and weight matrices of some layers to extract their structural information, respectively. Finally, the final hybrid features are fed into a standard classifier for the pixel-level classification task under a unified feature fusion module. Extensive experiments on two real-world hyperspectral and LiDAR data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art baseline methods, such as two-branch CNN and context CNN. In particular, the overall accuracy (99.11%) on Trento achieves the best classification performance reported so far.","misc","wim"

Eighty-six patients with femoral trochanteric fracture admitted to Taizhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine between January 2019 and June 2021 were enrolled in the study and assigned into a PFNA group and DHS group (n=43 in each group) before undergoing these treatments. The clinical efficacy, inflammatory factors, and myocardial injury markers were compared between the two groups. The influencing factors on recovery after PFNA treatment were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis. Compared to the DHS group, the PFNA group had shorter surgical time, length of stay in hospital, postoperative weight-bearing time, time of healing and detumescence, and less intraoperative blood loss (all P<0.001). The incidence of post-surgical complications with PFNA was lower than with DHS (P<0.05). The serum levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-αof the PFNA group were lower than those of the DHS group (all P<0.05). Moreover, the serum levels of cardiac troponin T, creatine kinase-MB and myoglobin in the PFNA group were also lower than for the DHS (all P<0.05). At the first, third, and sixth months after surgery, the Harris scores for PFNA were higher than for DHS (all P<0.05). The univariate and multivariate analysis showed that instability of fracture, history of osteoporosis, excessive intraoperative bleeding, poor compliance with rehabilitation exercise, and long time from injury to surgery were risk factors for poor recovery following PFNA treatment for patients with femoral trochanteric fracture. Compared to DHS, PFNA had better clinical efficacy and gave lower serum levels of inflammatory factors and myocardial injury markers. Fracture classification, history of osteoporosis, intraoperative amount of bleeding, compliance of rehabilitation exercise, and time from injury to surgery were closely associated with recovery following PFNA treatment.","misc","wim"

Totally 100 patients who were clinically diagnosed with lung cancer from January 2018 to December 2020 were enrolled in our study. They were assigned into two groups according to the presence of lymph node metastasis. The VASP levels were measured by flow cytometry. The correlation between the expression of VASP in tumor tissue and the clinical characteristics and prognosis in patients was analyzed. The diagnostic efficacy of plasma VASP with squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA21-1), prosecretin-releasing peptide (proGRP), and lung cancer was analyzed. The results were compared with APACHE III score to evaluate the accuracy of VASP in determining the severity of patients. This paper finds that the value of VASP in the non-lymph node metastasis group was significantly higher than that in the healthy control group, and the VASP level in the lymph node metastasis group was significantly higher than that in the non-lymph node metastasis group and the healthy control group (all p values <0.05). The APACHE III score of the lymph node metastasis group was higher than that of the non-lymph node metastasis group (p value <0.05). The diagnostic efficacy of VASP is similar to that of SCC, NSE, CYFRA21-1, and proGRP. The plasma VASP value was statistically different in the survival group and the death group, with higher level observed in the death group compared to survival group (all p values <0.05). The value of plasma VASP alone and acute physiology and chronic health evaluations III (APACHE III) score for lung cancer mortality was similar (47.06% vs. 52.94%, p value >0.05). Similar accuracy was observed in VASP and APACHE III score in predicting mortality of lung cancer (84.37% vs. 85.77%, p value>0.05). This paper concludes that the level of VASP correlates to the severity of the lung cancer and survival of the patients.","misc","wim"

In this study, orange and lemon peels-derived activated carbon (OLPAC) was successfully synthesized and activated using phosphoric acid. Characterization was performed on the OLPAC and the material was used for the removal of methyl orange (MO) and methylene (MB) dyes from wastewater. The results of the scanning electron microscope and N2 adsorption/desorption examination affirmed that the prepared nanocomposite is permeable, which is an advantage for the efficient removal of contaminants. Optimal conditions for the batch removal process were investigated using a one-factor time approach in different conditions of adsorption (Dye concentration 50-200 mg L-1, pH 2-10, adsorbent mass 0.010-0.8, and contact time 5-180 min. The adsorption isotherm equilibrium data were examined by Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin, isotherm model. As shown by the correlation coefficient (R2), the data were best described by Langmuir isotherms with maximum adsorption capacities of 33 and 38 mg g─1 for methyl orange and methylene blue, respectively. Adsorption kinetic data were described using the pseudo-second-order model which suggests that adsorption of MO and MB was by chemisorption mechanism. The method was applicable to real wastewater samples, with satisfactory removal percentages of OM and MB (96 and 98 %). The results of this study show that OLPAC is an inexpensive biosorbent that is successfully utilized in removing methyl orange and methylene blue dyes from wastewater.","misc","wim"

We assessed the relationship between high access flow (Qa) and myocardial fibrosis in HD patients. Myocardial fibrosis was assessed by native T1 relaxation times on non-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and a potential marker of fibrosis. Serum levels of galectin-3, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) were measured in 101 HD patients who underwent regular monitoring of AVF Qa. A high-flow AVF was defined as a Qa >2 L/min. Hemodialysis patients showed significantly higher galectin-3 value and increased T1 relaxation time compared to healthy volunteers, suggesting increased myocardial fibrosis in uremic cardiomyopathy. In HD patients, 20 (19.8%) had a Qa > 2L/min, and they had significantly higher cardiac output, cardiac index, left ventricular mass, and increased T1 times than those with a Qa ≤ 2 L/min. Also, serum galectin-3 and NT-proBNP levels were much higher in the high Qa group, indicating a close relationship between the high Qa, increased myocardial fibrosis, and the risk of heart failure (HF) in HD patients. It is interesting that a higher AVF Qa for myocardial fibrosis was independent of several traditional cardiovascular risk factors as well as serum levels of NT-proBNP and MCP-1. A supra-physiologically high Qa can be related to myocardial fibrosis and increased risk of HF in HD patients. Regular Qa monitoring could allow early detection of a high-flow AVF that could arise cardiac complications.","misc","wim"
"1438",35957062,"Effect of Nanoencapsulation on the Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm Activities of Algerian Origanum glandulosum Desf. against Multidrug-Resistant Clinical Isolates.","The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is a danger to public health and exposes patients to high risk, increasing morbidity and mortality worldwide. For this purpose, three months of evaluation of MDR's prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in the military regional university hospital of Constantine from different services and samples was carried out. Among a total of 196 isolates, 35.2% were MDR. The use of essential oils such as Origanum glandulosum Desf. as an alternative to antibiotics is attractive due to their rich content of bioactive compounds conferring many biological activities. Also, to overcome the drawbacks of using oils as the hydrophobicity and negative interaction with the environmental conditions, in addition to increasing their activity, encapsulation for the oil was performed using high-speed homogenization (HSH) into nanocapsules and high-pressure homogenization (HPH) into nanoemulsion. Nine volatile constituents were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (GC-MS) in hydrodistilled oil with thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, and γ-terpinene as dominants. A dramatic decrease in the major volatile components was observed due to the use of HSH and HPH but generated the same oil profile. The mean particle size of the nanoemulsion was 54.24 nm, while that of nanocapsules was 120.60 nm. The antibacterial activity of the oil and its nanoparticles was estimated on MDR isolates using the disk diffusion, aromatogram, and broth microdilution methods. Consistent with the differences in volatile constituents, the oil exhibited a higher antibacterial activity compared to its nanoforms with the diameters of the inhibition zone against E. coli (20 mm), S. aureus (35 mm), and A. baumannii (40 mm). Both formulations have shown relatively significant activity against the biofilm state at sub-inhibitory concentrations, where nanoemulsion was more potent than nanocapsules. The results obtained suggested that nanoformulations of essential oils are strongly recommended for therapeutic application as alternatives to antibiotics.","misc","wim"

PD-L1/PD-1 axis is a critical target for tumor immunotherapy, blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 axis is recognized and has achieved unprecedented success in clinical applications. However, the clinical efficacy of therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway remains limited, emphasizing the need for the mechanistic elucidation of PD-1/PD-L1 expression. In this study, we found that RNF125 interacted with PD-L1 and regulated PD-L1 protein expression. Mechanistically, RNF125 promoted K48-linked polyubiquitination of PD-L1 and mediated its degradation. Notably, MC-38 and H22 cell lines with RNF125 knockout, transplanted in C57BL/6 mice, exhibited a higher PD-L1 level and faster tumor growth than their parental cell lines. In contrast, overexpression of RNF125 in MC-38 and H22 cells had the opposite effect, resulting in lower PD-L1 levels and delayed tumor growth compared with parental cell lines. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of MC-38 tumors with RNF125 overexpression showed significantly increased infiltration of CD4+, CD8+ T cells and macrophages. Consistent with these findings, analyses using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) public database revealed a positive correlation of RNF125 expression with CD4+, CD8+ T cell and macrophage tumor infiltration. Moreover, RNF125 expression was significantly downregulated in several human cancer tissues, and was negatively correlated with the clinical stage of these tumors, and patients with higher RNF125 expression had better clinical outcomes. Our findings identify a novel mechanism for regulating PD-L1 expression and may provide a new strategy to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy.","misc","wim"

It typically presents with unilateral sweating and flushing of the face. It could be caused not only by autonomic dysfunction or space-occupying central neuropathy, but by some clinical interventions as well. Although iatrogenic Harlequin syndrome is rare, clinicians should be aware of this condition to diagnose correctly and provide suitable assistance. Here we report a case of iatrogenic Harlequin syndrome. The unique part of this case is that this patient presented with successive presentations of Harlequin syndrome on different sides of the body. The patient was a 30-40-year-old woman who had flushing and sweating on one side of the face after intraspinal analgesia. This symptom disappeared on its own after a period of persistence, and reappeared several days later after increasing the dose of the drug injected into the epidural cavity. Interestingly, the second blush appeared on the other side of the patient's face. Triggered by intraspinal analgesia and manifested in different body parts, Harlequin syndrome is proven here to be derived from iatrogenic stimuli. We believe that the different distribution states of analgesic drugs after entering the spinal canal can promote Harlequin syndrome to manifest in different body parts.","misc","wim"

A total of 380 participants were recruited (mean age: 72.5 ± 5.19 years). We performed an untargeted metabolomics analysis on older adults who underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and physical performance tests such as hand grip, Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT), and walking speed. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and heat map were utilized to distinguish the metabolites that differ between groups. Among all the subjects, 47 subjects were diagnosed with MCI, and methods based on the propensity score are used to match the MCI group with the normal control (NC) group (n = 47). The final analytic sample comprised 94 participants (mean age: 75.2 years). The data process from the metabolic profiles identified 1,008 metabolites. A cluster and pathway enrichment analysis showed that sphingolipid metabolism is involved in the development of MCI. Combination of metabolite panel and physical performance were significantly increased discriminating abilities on MCI than a single physical performance test [model 1: the area under the curve (AUC) = 0.863; model 2: AUC = 0.886; and model 3: AUC = 0.870, P < 0.001].

Finally, the training of the neural network after recombination was quantified to further compress the computational amount of the neural network. The results show that the method can significantly reduce the computational effort of the neural network and compress the number of parameters in the model. Based on experimental results on ResNet56, this method can reduce the number of parameters to 1/4 and the amount of calculation to 1/5, and the loss of model accuracy is only 0.01.

We also investigate how PEGylation, temperature, ionic strength and pH affect the rFVIII aggregation and adsorption at the interface over time. The aggregation and adsorption of rFVIII are significantly reduced by decreasing electrostatic attractions in the solution. We observed that the PEGylation endows rFVIII molecules with high stability at the liquid-glass interface in a wide range of temperature, ionic strength and pH.

Here, we propose a decision tree for the diagnosis of the most frequent viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases starting from their oral lesions in children. By first focusing on describing the elementary lesion itself before its localization and characteristics, it aims to guide the practitioner toward the diagnosis and any necessary complementary exams. To generate this tool, we conducted a literature review of the childhood viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic diseases with oral mucosal symptoms. For each of the 42 reported diagnoses-20 viral, 9 bacterial, 5 fungal, and 8 parasitic-we collected the infection mechanism and agent(s), the oral lesions and their description, the associated systemic signs and the incidence/prevalence. In fine, our decision tree indexes the 28 diseases for which epidemiological data was available, mainly in Europe and the United States.","misc","wim"

Though it is globally practiced, the safety of those involved is yet to be fully established. It is thought to be highly prevalent in pregnant women because of its antinausea or therapeutic effects. This practice is also thought to be provoked by some nutritional needs, but in modern society its etiology is obscure. The mineralogical and chemical compositions of clay may vary from one region to another and even in all form of rocks clay constitutes. Published articles in geophagy indicate lack of adequate investigations into the toxicity of geophagy, though it is globally practiced and more prevalent in Africa (as a continent) or in Africans migrants. Some studies have helped to identify some minerals that are toxic to human if ingested. In most cases, the potential toxicity emphasized by these studies is based on the detection of the presence of these nuisance elements in the geophagic materials. Scientifically, a lot has been done in the light of detection of toxic matter, but more investigations on metabolic studies are still necessary. The variability of clay content with respect to source motivated this review on geophagy and its potential toxicity to human. This review is aimed at bringing out findings that would enable a better understanding of the toxicity potential of geophagy across context and taxa.","misc","wim"

Although students' efforts in rubric use vary, few studies have investigated the hidden motivations when rubrics are utilized for classroom assessment. This qualitative study attempts to categorize students' effort in rubric use and identify personal differences and contextual factors influencing the effort in the EFL classroom assessment environment. A total of 79 students at a Chinese university participated in the study. The data collected included their classroom oral presentation results and nine case study informants' retrospective interviews on their processes of rubric use. Focuses were drawn upon students' perceptions and practices of rubric use throughout the task process. Totally, three types of effort patterns emerged in light of students' self-ratings and descriptions of the use. The intense kind held firm trust in rubric utility and thus utilized the rubric to develop the targeted competence throughout the whole process. The medium type either selectively followed the rubric in optional phases of the process due to their judgments of the rubric and the task. The loose type was least responsive to the rubric since their actions seemed largely affected by their self-efficacy and prior experience. Results showed that students' effort in rubric use in classroom assessment was the outcome of cognitive appraisals of a rubric, students themselves, and a task. The study highlights trait motivation and task motivation in the effectiveness of rubric use in assessment practices. Implications on rubric employment and task design are drawn to tap students' motivation for rubric use to achieve assessment for learning.","misc","wim"

Thus, these techniques are advantageous in terms of being faster, safer, less invasive, and cheaper. There are a few fluorescent dyes available, but the most commonly used dye is indocyanine green. It can be used in its natural form, but different nanocapsulated and targeted modifications are possible, making this dye more stable and specific. A new active tumor-targeting strategy is the conjugation of indocyanine green nanoparticles with antibodies, making this dye targeted and highly selective to various tumor proteins. In this mini-review, we discuss the application of near-infrared fluorescence-guided techniques in thoracic surgery. During lung surgery, it can help find small, non-palpable, or additional tumor nodules, it is also useful for finding the sentinel lymph node and identifying the proper intersegmental plane for segmentectomies. Furthermore, it can help visualize the thoracic duct, smaller bullae of the lung, phrenic nerve, or pleural nodules.

Thus, research is urgently needed to explore the relationship between ACEs pattern and trajectory of depressive symptom levels at multiple time points in order to provides early targeted interventions to those who are most at risk. We aimed to explore patterns of ACEs, including types and timing, associated with depression trajectories in college students. A school-based health survey was used to collect data as part of a longitudinal study in two medical college in Anhui province, China. Questionnaires were issued to 3,662 participants aged 17-22 and recorded details of ACEs (types and timing) and depression. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify patterns of ACEs type and timing. Depressive symptom trajectories employed latent class growth analysis (LCGA). Multiple logistic regressions were employed to evaluate the relationships between ACEs patterns and depressive symptom trajectories. We identified five ACEs patterns: High neglect/emotional abuse/community violence, High neglect/emotional abuse, High neglect/family dysfunction, High neglect, Low ACEs. We traced three depression trajectories: High depressive symptom Moderate depressive symptom, Low depressive symptom. High neglect/emotional abuse/community violence, High neglect/emotional abuse and High neglect/family dysfunction demonstrated a high risk for High depressive symptom and Moderate depressive symptom. High neglect showed a high risk for Moderate depressive symptom but not for High depressive symptom (P < 0.05). The findings address the need for a comprehensive consideration of exposure to childhood adversity associated with the risk of depression in young adults through identifying more problematic ACEs patterns amongst exposed children.","misc","wim"

In this paper, we propose a single-stage detection network based on YOLOv5. This method introduces the MS Transformer module at the end of the feature extraction network of the original network to enhance the feature extraction capability of the network model and integrates the Convolutional Block Attention Model (CBAM) to find the attention area in dense scenes. In addition, the YOLOv5 target detection network is improved by incorporating a rotation angle approach from the a priori frame design and the bounding box regression formulation to make it suitable for rotating frame-based detection scenarios. Finally, the weighted combination of the two difficult sample mining methods is used to improve the focal loss function, so as to improve the detection accuracy. The average accuracy of the test results of the improved algorithm on the DOTA data set is 77.01%, which is higher than the previous detection algorithm. Compared with the average detection accuracy of YOLOv5, the average detection accuracy is improved by 8.83%.

We aimed to verify the main risk factors related to DM that contribute to COVID-19 progression and mortality in a kidney transplant setting. From March to August 2020, we evaluated 300 kidney transplant recipients affected by COVID-19. We used propensity score matching (PSM) to estimate the impact of DM on COVID-19. After matching, all baseline characteristics were well balanced between those with and without DM (n = 100 in each group). Case fatality rate, the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and acute kidney injury (AKI) were associated with previous fasting blood glucose, and C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels on admission. These findings were similar in kidney transplant patients with and without DM. Glycemia on admission and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) either on admission or basal correlated to the need of IMV and development of AKI, respectively. Poor glycaemic control, eGFR, markers of inflammation (CRP) and tissue damage (LDH) were indicative of COVID-19 burden in kidney transplant recipients and may be useful tools for risk-stratifying this population, independently of the DM status, during the pandemic.","misc","wim"

Eighteen institutions enrolled 259 low- and intermediate-risk patients. Median follow-up is 5.5 years, with 66 patients followed ≥ 10 years. This SBRT regimen specifically emulated an existing HDR brachytherapy dose schedule and isodose morphology, prescribed to 38 Gy/4 fractions, delivered daily by robotic SBRT, mandating > 150% dose escalation in the peripheral zone. Androgen deprivation therapy was not allowed, and a hydrogel spacer was not available at that time. Median pre-SBRT PSA 5.12 ng/mL decreased to 0.1 ng/mL by 3.5 years, with further decrease to a nadir of < 0.1 ng/mL by 7 years, maintained through 10 years. Ten-year freedom from biochemical recurrence measured 100% for low-risk, 84.3% for favorable intermediate risk (FIR), and 68.4% for unfavorable intermediate (UIR) cases. Multivariable analysis revealed that the UIR group bifurcated into two distinct prognostic subgroups. Those so classified by having Gleason score 4 + 3 and/or clinical stage T2 (versus T1b/T1c) had a significantly poorer 10 year freedom from biochemical recurrence rate, 54.8% if either or both factors were present, while UIR patients without these specific factors had a 94.4% 10-year freedom from biochemical recurrence rate. The cumulative incidence of grade 2 GU toxicity modestly increased over time - 16.3% at 5 years increased to 19.2% at 10 years-- while the incidence of grade 3+ GU and GI toxicity remained low and stable to 10 years - 2.6% and 0%, respectively. The grade 2 GI toxicity incidence also remained low and stable to 10 years - 4.1% with no further events after year 5. This HDR-like SBRT regimen prescribing 38 Gy/4 fractions but delivering much higher intraprostatic doses on a daily basis is safe and effective. This treatment achieves a median PSA nadir of <0.1 ng/mL and provides high long-term disease control rates without ADT except for a subgroup of unfavorable intermediate-risk patients.","misc","wim"

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress results from protein misfolding imbalance and has been shown to participate in the development of cancer. We aimed to develop and validation a reliable and robust ER stress-related prognostic signature to accurately predict prognosis for patients with LUAD. The mRNA expressions data and the clinical information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as training set. The data of external validation sets were downloaded from GEO database with the accession number GSE 30219, GSE 31210, GSE 50081 and GSE 37745. Univariate Cox regression analyses was performed to identify mRNAs associated with overall survival (OS) in LUAD. ER-associated genes were retrieved using GeneCards database. Next, we construct the best risk score model by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression with tenfold cross-validation. Subsequently, predictive models and risk scores were developed in the TCGA training dataset. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for univariate and multivariate analysis of risk score and clinicopathologic characteristics. As a validation set GSE30219, GSE31210 and (GSE50081+GSE37745) were used to validate the predictive performance of the model in TCGA. Finally, functional enrichment analysis, including the gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathways and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to further explore function and mechanisms. A prognostic prediction model based on eight genes was developed in the TCGA training dataset. As expected, in validation sets, patients with higher risk scores were found to have worse prognosis. Time-dependent ROC curve analyses demonstrated that the risk score model was reliable. The nomograms showed excellent predictive ability. Multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that the risk score was an independent prognostic factor for LUAD. Additionally, functional enrichment analysis showed that the relevant biomarkers were enriched in cell cycle and glycolysis related signaling pathways. The 8-gene signature may enable improved the prediction of clinical events and decisions about management of LUAD.","misc","wim"

In order to remove organic micro-pollutants and natural organic substances in water bodies and kill pathogenic microorganisms simultaneously, this study synthesized a multifunctional porous β-cyclodextrin polymer with a high specific surface area by introducing quaternary ammonium groups and rigid benzene rings, respectively, which was then polymerized with crosslinking agent-4,4'-bis (chloromethyl)-1,1'-biphenyl (BCMBP) in an ionic liquid system. The grafting of quaternary ammonium groups was beneficial for the removal of negative-charged humic acid (HA) and sterilization. The introduction of numerous rigid structures during benzylation and Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction could significantly improve the porosity and specific surface area of the polymer, conducive to the exposure of cyclodextrin binding sites and contaminant adsorption. By changing the proportions of quaternization and benzylation, the structure and surface properties of the polymer could be adjusted, thus further regulating the adsorption performance. Compared with activated carbon, the polymer named BQCD-BP with a huge surface area of 1133 m2 g-1 prepared under optimized conditions showed outstanding adsorption performance and sterilization ability. The pseudo-second-order kinetic constant of BQCD-BP reached 1.2058 g·mg-1·min-1, which was approximately 50 times greater than that of activated carbon (0.0256 g·mg-1·min-1) under the same experimental condition. The adsorption capacity of BQCD-BP to HA was twice as high as that to AC, and the antibacterial ability of BQCD-BP was significant, achieving 90% at the dosage of 1g L-1. Moreover, the adsorption process was hardly affected by the hydrochemical conditions, and the polymer was easy to regenerate. In addition, the excellent adsorption and antibacterial performance of the polymer were also identified by natural water treatment. COD was almost completely removed, and the removal efficiency of TP reached 92% after contact with BQCD-BP. The sterilization rate of BQCD-BP to viable bacteria in complex water bodies reached 82%. Undoubtedly, BQCD-BP is a potential multifunctional water treatment material with reasonable design in the actual water purification.","misc","wim"

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies offer high capacity at the cost of high attenuation and blockage losses. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted mmWave networks consist of smaller antenna elements that control the propagation channel between the base station (BS) and the user by appropriately tuning the phase and the reflection of the incident electromagnetic signal. The deployment of RIS is considered to be an energy efficient solution to improve the coverage of regions with high blocking probability. However, if every BS is associated with one or more dedicated RIS, then the density of RIS increases proportionally with the density of BSs. Hence in this work, we propose RIS sharing mechanisms where multiple BSs share one RIS. We formulate resource allocation of RIS sharing in terms of time and the RIS elements as an optimization problem, and we propose heuristics to solve both. Further, we present detailed simulation results to compare time and the element based RIS sharing methods for various scenarios with the benchmark and the RIS system without sharing. The proposed time and element based RIS sharing methods improve throughput upto 53% and 25%, respectively, compared to the RIS system without sharing in specific scenarios.","misc","wim"

BCOR regulates downstream genes via BCL6 as a transcriptional corepressor. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the occurrence of radiculomegaly is still unknown. Thus, this study was aimed at identifying BCOR-regulated genetic pathways in radiculomegaly. The microarray profile of affected tissues revealed that the gene-specific transcriptional factors group, wherein nucleus factor 1B, distal-less homeobox 5, and zinc finger protein multitype 2 (ZFPM2) were the most upregulated, was significantly expressed in periodontal ligament (PDL) cells of the diseased patient with a frameshift mutation (c.3668delC) in BCOR. Wild-type BCOR overexpression in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts cells significantly hampered cellular proliferation and ZFPM2 mRNA downregulation. Promoter binding assays showed that wild-type BCOR was recruited in the BCL6 binding of the ZFPM2 promoter region after immunoprecipitation, while mutant BCOR, which was the same genotype as of our patient, failed to recruit these promoter regions. Knockdown of ZFPM2 expression in mutant PDL cells significantly reduced cellular proliferation as well as mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase, an important marker of odontoblasts and cementoblasts. Collectively, our findings suggest that BCOR mutation-induced ZFPM2 regulation via BCL6 possibly contributes to hyperactive root formation in OFCD syndrome.

OA is a global challenge because its specific pathogenesis is unclear, and no effective disease-modifying drugs are currently available. Exosomes are small and single-membrane vesicles secreted via the formation of endocytic vesicles and multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are eventually released when MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane. Exosomes contain various integral surface proteins derived from cells, intercellular proteins, DNAs, RNAs, amino acids, and metabolites. By transferring complex constituents and promoting macrophages to generate chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines, exosomes function in pathophysiological processes in OA, including local inflammation, cartilage calcification and degradation of osteoarthritic joints. Exosomes are also detected in synovial fluid and plasma, and their levels continuously change with OA progression. Thus, exosomes, specifically exosomal miRNAs and lncRNAs, potentially represent multicomponent diagnostic biomarkers for OA. Exosomes derived from various types of mesenchymal stem cells and other cell or tissue types affect angiogenesis, inflammation, and bone remodeling. These exosomes exhibit promising capabilities to restore OA cartilage, attenuate inflammation, and balance cartilage matrix formation and degradation, thus demonstrating therapeutic potential in OA. In combination with biocompatible and highly adhesive materials, such as hydrogels and cryogels, exosomes may facilitate cartilage tissue engineering therapies for OA.

Healthy participants aged 40-80 years were prospectively recruited, and three models were built to predict individual step length. The first model was the best-fit model (R2 = 0.244, p &lt; 0.001); the root mean square (RMS) values at maximal knee flexion and height were included as significant variables.

From the perspective of security and economy, the effective control of COVID-19 has a profound impact on the entire society. An effective strategy is to diagnose earlier to prevent the spread of the disease and prompt treatment of severe cases to improve the chance of survival. The method of this paper is as follows: Firstly, the collected data set is processed by chest film image processing, and the bone removal process is carried out in the rib subtraction module. Then, the set preprocessing method performed histogram equalization, sharpening, and other preprocessing operations on the chest film. Finally, shallow and high-level feature mapping through the backbone network extracts the processed chest radiographs. We implement the self-attention mechanism in Inception-Resnet, perform the standard classification, and identify chest radiograph diseases through the classifier to realize the auxiliary COVID-19 diagnosis process at the medical level, all in an effort to further enhance the classification performance of the convolutional neural network. Numerous computer simulations demonstrate that the Inception-Resnet convolutional neural network performs CT image categorization and enhancement with greater efficiency and flexibility than conventional segmentation techniques. The experimental COVID-19 CT dataset obtained in this paper is the new data for CT scans and medical imaging of normal, early COVID-19 patients and severe COVID-19 patients from Jinyintan hospital. The experiment plots the relationship between model accuracy, model loss and epoch, using ACC, TPR, SPE, F1 score and G-mean to measure the image maps of patients with and without the disease. Statistical measurement values are obtained by Inception-Resnet are 88.23%, 83.45%, 89.72%, 95.53% and 88.74%.

Our results show that the relation between the free-energy difference divided by kBT and the number of molecules to the power minus one-third is linear for n>6 . Consequently, the surface tension can be extracted from the straight line slope, whereas the vapor density can be extracted from the intercept, which is proportional to the logarithmic ratio of liquid density to that of vapor density. By scaling the free-energy differences, for at least three different temperatures, to TCT-1, we estimated the critical temperature and hence the surface tension and the vapor density at a wide range of temperatures.

Thus, new strategies to design organ-specific drugs that induce little toxicity are needed. Based on characteristic tissue niche-mediated drug distribution (TNMDD) and patterns of drug metabolism into specific intermediates, we propose a strategy of distribution- and metabolism-based drug design (DMBDD); through a physicochemical property-driven distribution optimization cooperated with a well-designed metabolism pathway, SH-337, a candidate potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), was designed. SH-337 showed specific distribution in the stomach in the long term and was rapidly cleared from the systemic compartment. Therefore, SH-337 exerted a comparable pharmacological effect but a 3.3-fold higher no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) compared with FDA-approved vonoprazan. This study contributes a proof-of-concept demonstration of DMBDD and provides a new perspective for the development of highly efficient, organ-specific drugs with low toxicity.","misc","wim"

The amorphous PEDOT granules as the catalyst supports provide plenty of attachment sites for PdCu and PdNi nanoparticles. The optimized Pd1Cu3/PEDOT and Pd7Ni3/PEDOT catalysts both perform superior mass-based activity, area-based activity and intrinsic activity for EG oxidation as compared to other control samples. Moreover, chronoamperometry and long-term cyclic voltammetry tests demonstrate that the Pd1Cu3/PEDOT catalyst performs optimal anti-poisoning capability and catalytic durability. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the favourable dispersion of Pd1Cu3 and Pd7Ni3 nanoparticles on the PEDOT granules and the synergistic effects between Pd, Cu/Ni atoms and the electron-rich conjugated structure of PEDOT. In summary, this work synthesized two Pd/PEDOT-based electrocatalysts with promising catalytic application prospect in direct ethylene glycol fuel cell (DEGFC), which may provide some theoretical support for the design and synthesis of competent electrocatalysts for DEGFC.","misc","wim"

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in S100A4 could directly influence the biomolecular interaction with the tumor suppressor protein Tp53 due to their aberrant conformations. Hence, the study was designed to predict the deleterious SNP and its effect on the S100A4 protein structure and function. Twenty-one SNP data sets were screened for nonsynonymous mutations and subsequently subjected to deleterious mutation prediction using different computational tools. The screened deleterious mutations were analyzed for their changes in functionality and their interaction with the tumor suppressor protein Tp53 by protein-protein docking analysis. The structural effects were studied using the 3DMissense mutation tool to estimate the solvation energy and torsion angle of the screened mutations on the predicted structures. In our study, 21 deleterious nonsynonymous mutations were screened, including F72V, E74G, L5P, D25E, N65S, A28V, A8D, S20L, L58P, and K26N were found to be remarkably conserved by exhibiting the interaction either with the EF-hand 1 or EF-hand 2 domain. The solvation and torsion values significantly deviated for the mutant-type structures with S20L, N65S, and F72L mutations and showed a marked reduction in their binding affinity with the Tp53 protein. Hence, these deleterious mutations might serve as prospective targets for diagnosing and developing personalized treatments for cancer and other related diseases.","misc","wim"

A total of 75 patients suffering from EFIF receiving intramedullary fixation were retrospectively collected. According to intramedullary fixation methods, the patients were separated into InterTanIN group and PFNA group. Parameters including the surgery time, blood loss, number of X-ray fluoroscopy, hospital stays, bone-healing time, postoperative Harris hip score (HIS) (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months), and complications were collected and analyzed. The results showed surgery time, blood loss, and number of X-ray fluoroscopy in InterTanIN group were higher than those in PFNA group (P < 0.05). The mean hospital stay in the InterTanIN group was comparable to that in the PFNA group (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in bone-healing time between the InterTanIN group and PFNA group (P > 0.05). The postoperative HIS of InterTanIN group was statistically better than PFNA group at the 3rd month and the 6th month (P < 0.05). With the extension of recovery time, the gap between the two groups gradually narrowed. The postoperative implant displacement happened more often in the PFNA group than in the InterTanIN group. EFIF treated with InterTanIN or PFNA could achieve good long-term efficacy. Although InterTanIN has the disadvantages of increased operative time, blood loss, and radiation exposure compared to PFNA, the postoperative hip function recovery of InterTanIN seems to be more reliable and stable than PFNA.","misc","wim"

However, these effects in the pediatric population are less studied and there is no standard method to identify those at risk for developing infections. Our goal was to better understand immune dysfunction and identify soluble protein markers following pediatric thermal injury. Further we wanted to determine which early inflammatory, soluble, or immune function markers are most predictive of the development of nosocomial infections (NI) after burn injury. We performed a prospective observational study at a single American Burn Association-verified Pediatric Burn Center. A total of 94 pediatric burn subjects were enrolled and twenty-three of those subjects developed a NI with a median time to diagnosis of 8 days. Whole blood samples, collected within the first 72 hours after injury, were used to compare various markers of inflammation, immune function, and soluble proteins between those who recovered without developing an infection and those who developed a NI after burn injury. Within the first three days of burn injury, innate and adaptive immune function markers (ex vivo lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha production capacity, and ex vivo phytohemagglutinin-induced interleukin-10 production capacity, respectively) were decreased for those subjects who developed a subsequent NI. Further analysis of soluble protein targets associated with these pathways displayed significant increases in soluble CD27, BTLA, and TIM-3 for those who developed a NI. Our findings indicate that suppression of both the innate and adaptive immune function occurs concurrently within the first 72 hours following pediatric thermal injury. At the same time, subjects who developed NI have increased soluble protein biomarkers. Soluble CD27, BTLA, and TIM-3 were highly predictive of the development of subsequent infectious complications. This study identifies early soluble protein makers that are predictive of infection in pediatric burn subjects. These findings should inform future immunomodulatory therapeutic studies.","misc","wim"

This research incorporates ultrasonic extraction to extract the aromatic compound in pandan leaves. The parameters varied in this study are the extraction time, sonicator amplitude, concentration of solvent and the mass of pandan leaves. The experiment was conducted using a central composite design (CCD) model generated by the response surface methodology (RSM). From the extraction process, it can be deduced that the effect of leaves' mass is comparably higher than other parameters, while sonicator amplitude gives the most negligible impact on the process. The obtained p-value was 0.0014, which was less than 0.05. The high R-squared 0.9603 and adjusted R-squared 0.8809 indicate the model is well agreed with the actual data. The optimal control variables of ultrasonic extraction of 2AP are at an extraction time of 20 min, 60% of solvent concentration, amplitude of 25% and 12.5 g of pandan leaves, which produced 60.51% of yield of the extract and 1.43 ppm of 2AP.

"1604",35958665,"Reduced childhood social attention in autism model marmosets predicts impaired social skills and inflexible behavior in adulthood.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social and communication impairments and restricted and repetitive behavior. Although there is currently no established cure for ASD, early interventions for deficits of attention to other individuals are expected to reduce the progression of ASD symptoms in later life. To confirm this hypothesis and improve early therapeutic interventions, it is desirable to develop an animal model of ASD in which social attention is impaired in childhood and ASD-like social behavior is observed in adulthood. However, rodent models of ASD have difficulty in recapitulating the deficit of gaze-based social attention. In this study, we examined the direction of gaze toward other conspecifics during childhood and puberty in a three-chamber test setting using an ASD marmoset model produced by maternal exposure to valproic acid (VPA). We also conducted a reversal learning test in adult VPA-exposed marmosets as an indicator of perseveration, a core symptom of ASD that has not previously been investigated in this model. The results showed that time spent gazing at other conspecifics was reduced in VPA-exposed marmosets in childhood, and that mature animals persisted with previous strategies that required long days for acquisition to pass the test. In a longitudinal study using the same animals, deficits in social attention in childhood correlated well with ASD-like social disturbance (inequity aversion and third-party reciprocity) and inflexible behavior in adulthood. Since VPA-exposed marmosets exhibit these diverse ASD-like behaviors that are consistent from childhood to adulthood, VPA-exposed marmosets will provide a valuable means of elucidating mechanisms for early intervention and contribute to the development of early therapies.","misc","wim"

At present, there are about 10 million patients with PD in the world, and its comorbidities and complications are numerous and incurable. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the pathogenesis of PD and find possible therapeutic targets. Because the etiology of PD is complex, involving genes, environment, and aging, finding common factors is the key to identifying intervention targets. Hypoxia is ubiquitous in the natural environment and disease states, and it is considered to be closely related to the etiology of PD. Despite research showing that hypoxia increases the expression and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn), the most important pathogenic protein, there is still a lack of systematic studies on the role of hypoxia in α-syn pathology and PD pathogenesis. Considering that hypoxia is inextricably linked with various causes of PD, hypoxia may be a co-participant in many aspects of the PD pathologic process. In this review, we describe the risk factors for PD, and we discuss the possible role of hypoxia in inducing PD pathology by these risk factors. Furthermore, we attribute the pathological changes caused by PD etiology to oxygen uptake disorder and oxygen utilization disorder, thus emphasizing the possibility of hypoxia as a critical link in initiating or promoting α-syn pathology and PD pathogenesis. Our study provides novel insight for exploring the pathogenesis and therapeutic targets of PD.","misc","wim"

This article presents a monitoring system applied to an aeroponic greenhouse based on an IoT architecture that provides user information on the status of the climatic variables and the appearance of the crop in addition to managing the irrigation timing and the frequency of visual inspection using an application developed for Android mobile devices called Aeroponics Monitor. The proposed IoT architecture consists of four layers: a device layer, fog layer, cloud layer and application layer. Once the information about the monitored variables is obtained by the sensors of the device layer, the fog layer processes it and transfers it to the Thingspeak and Firebase servers. In the cloud layer, Thingspeak analyzes the information from the variables monitored in the greenhouse through its IoT analytic tools to generate historical data and visualizations of their behavior, as well as an analysis of the system's operating status. Firebase, on the other hand, is used as a database to store the results of the processing of the images taken in the fog layer for the supervision of the leaves and roots. The results of the analysis of the information of the monitored variables and of the processing of the images are presented in the developed app, with the objective of visualizing the state of the crop and to know the function of the monitoring system in the event of a possible lack of electricity or a service line failure in the fog layer and to avoid the loss of information. With the information about the temperature of the plant leaf and the relative humidity inside the greenhouse, the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in the cloud layer is calculated; the VPD values are available on the Thingspeak server and in the developed app. Additionally, an analysis of the VPD is presented that demonstrates a water deficiency from the transplanting of the seedling to the cultivation chamber.

GHS-R is a G-protein coupled receptor that has great druggable potential. Understanding the precise ligand and receptor interactions is crucial to advance the application of GHS-R. We used radiolabeled ligand-binding assay and growth hormone release assay to assess the binding and functional characteristics of GHS-R to synthetic agonists MK-0677 and GHS-25, as well as to endogenous peptide ligand ghrelin. We analyzed the ligand-dependent activity of GHS-R by measuring aequorin-based [Ca++]i responses. To define a ligand-binding pocket of GHS-R, we generated a series of human/puffer fish GHS-R chimeras by domain swapping, as well as a series of mutants by site-directed mutagenesis. We found that the synthetic ligands have high binding affinity to GHS-R in the in vitro competitive binding assay. Remarkably, the in vivo GH secretagogue activity is higher with the synthetic agonists MK-0677 and GHS-25 than that of ghrelin. Importantly, the activity was completely abolished in GHS-R knockout mice. In GHS-R chimera analysis, we identified the C-terminal region, particularly the transmembrane domain 6 (TM6), to be critical for the ligand-dependent activity. Our site-directed mutagenesis study further revealed that amino acid residues D99 and W276 in GHS-R are essential for ligand binding. Interestingly, critical residues distinctively interact with different ligands, MK-0677 activation depends on E124, while ghrelin and GHS-25 preferentially interact with F279. The ligand-binding pocket of human GHS-R is mainly defined by interactive residues in TM6 and the adjacent region of the receptor. This novel finding in GHS-R binding domains advances the structural/ functional understanding of GHS-R, which will help to select/design better GHS-R agonists/ antagonists for future therapeutic applications.","misc","wim"
"1409",35965997,"An Expanded Framework for Situation Control.","There is an extensive body of literature on the topic of estimating situational states, in applications ranging from cyber-defense to military operations to traffic situations and autonomous cars. In the military/defense/intelligence literature, situation assessment seems to be the sine qua non for any research on surveillance and reconnaissance, command and control, and intelligence analysis. Virtually all of this work focuses on assessing the situation-at-the-moment; many if not most of the estimation techniques are based on Data and Information Fusion (DIF) approaches, with some recent schemes employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods. But estimating and recognizing situational conditions is most often couched in a decision-making, action-taking context, implying that actions may be needed so that certain goal situations will be reached as a result of such actions, or at least that progress toward such goal states will be made. This context thus frames the estimation of situational states in the larger context of a control-loop, with a need to understand the temporal evolution of situational states, not just a snapshot at a given time. Estimating situational dynamics requires the important functions of situation recognition, situation prediction, and situation understanding that are also central to such an integrated estimation + action-taking architecture. The varied processes for all of these combined capabilities lie in a closed-loop situation control framework, where the core operations of a stochastic control process involve situation recognition-learning-prediction-situation error assessment-and action taking to move the situation to a goal state. We propose several additional functionalities for this closed-loop control process in relation to some prior work on this topic, to include remarks on the integration of control-theoretic principles. Expanded remarks are also made on the state of the art of the schemas and computational technologies for situation recognition, prediction and understanding, as well as the roles for human intelligence in this larger framework.","misc","wim"

We explored the mediating role of vitamin D on the cross-sectional association between physical frailty and cognitive function using data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). We analyzed data from 1944 subjects aged 60 years and older from the 2011 CLHLS cohort. Frailty status was identified by the Osteoporotic Fracture Study (SOF) index. The Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function. Linear regression models were used to examine the association between frailty, vitamin D, and cognition, adjusted for a range of covariates. Mediation analyses tested the indirect effects of vitamin D on physical frailty and cognitive function. Physical frailty was negatively associated with vitamin D levels and scores on the MMSE, and vitamin D levels were positively associated with scores on the MMSE. Linear regression analysis showed that physical frailty and serum vitamin D concentration were significant predictors of cognitive function. Importantly, mediation analysis showed that serum vitamin D concentration significantly mediated the relationship between physical frailty and cognitive function. The association between physical frailty and cognitive function appears to be mediated by vitamin D. Future studies should explore whether serum vitamin D concentrations may mediate the association between physical frailty and cognitive decline and whether this mediating role is moderated by other factors.","misc","wim"

A 62-year-old man with T2DM treated with an SGLT2i developed EC. His moderately controlled T2DM was treated for over 20 years with metformin, saxagliptin/metformin, and pioglitazone to which empagliflozin was added due to his consistently elevated hemoglobin A1c level, slightly reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria. Four months after initiation of the SGLT2i, he reported lower urinary tract symptoms and was found to have EC radiographically. His urine cultures were positive for Klebsiella pneumonia and was found to have asymptomatic urinary retention. He was treated conservatively, and his outcome was favorable. EC is commonly seen in patients with diabetes mellitus, and symptoms range from asymptomatic to severe sepsis. Most urine cultures grow Escherichia coli and K. pneumonia. The association of increased UTIs in susceptible patients with T2DM with the use of SGLT2i is yet to be determined. Most cases of EC are diagnosed radiographically and treated conservatively, although some cases require surgical intervention.

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed on mRNA and lncRNA to screen out modules that were highly correlated with tumor progression. The two datasets were subjected to differential analysis after removing batch effects, and then Venn diagrams were used to screen for overlapping genes in the module genes and differential genes. The lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was then constructed, and key mRNAs were identified by MCODE analysis and expression analysis. GSEA analysis and qRT-PCR were performed on key mRNAs. Through a series of analyses, we speculated that BTK, CD72, PTPN6, and VAV1 may be independent predictors of the prognosis of NPC patients.Taken together, our study provides potential candidate biomarkers for NPC diagnosis, prognosis, or precise treatment.","misc","wim"

Seeds against Drug-Resistant Clinically Pathogenic Microorganisms.","Nigella sativa (NS) is a plant that has long been utilized in traditional medicine as a treatment for certain diseases. The aim of this work was to valorize the essential oil (EO) of this species by phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial and antioxidant evaluation. EO was extracted by hydrodistillation from the seeds of Nigella sativa (EO-NS). Phytochemical content of EO-NS was evaluated by use of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Antioxidant ability was in vitro determined by use of three assays: 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing power (FRAP), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) relative to two synthetic antioxidants: BHT and quercetin. Antimicrobial effect was evaluated against four clinically important bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 6633; Escherichia coli, K12; Bacillus subtilis, DSM 6333; and Proteus mirabilis, ATCC 29906) and against four fungal strains (Candida albicans, ATCC 10231; Aspergillus niger, MTCC 282; Aspergillus flavus, MTCC 9606; and Fusarium oxysporum, MTCC 9913). Fifteen constituents that accounted for the majority of the mass of the EO-NS were identified and quantified by use of GC-MSMS. The main component was O-cymene (37.82%), followed by carvacrol (17.68%), α-pinene (10.09%), trans-sabinene hydrate (9.90%), and 4-terpineol (7.15%). EO-NS exhibited significant antioxidant activity with IC50, EC50, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of 0.017 ± 0.0002, 0.1196 ± 0.012, and 114.059 ± 0.97 mg EAA/g, respectively. Additionally, EO-NS exhibited promising antibacterial activity on all strains under investigation, especially on E. coli K12 resulting in inhibition diameter of 38.67 ± 0.58 mm and a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.34 ± 0.00 μg/mL. Also, EO-NS had significant antifungal efficacy, with a percentage of inhibition of 67.45 ± 2.31% and MIC of 2.69 ± 0.00 μg/mL against F. oxysporum, MTCC 9913 and with a diameter of inhibition 42 ± 0.00 mm and MIC of 0.67 ± 0.00 μg/mL against C. albicans. To minimize development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, EO-NS can be utilized as a natural, alternative to synthetic antibiotics and antioxidants to treat free radicals implicated in microbial infection-related inflammatory reactions.","misc","wim"

As a result, a new approach is required to realise the integration and recommendation of educational resources. This paper examines the intelligent integration and recommendation of online learning resources for English language and literature majors based on CF. The development of online English language and literature education resources is currently in the process of being discussed, and some flaws in the process are being examined in this paper. The creation and incorporation of a network education resource database are proposed as some strategies and recommendations. The information entropy method is employed to address the cold start problem brought on by the data sparseness of new users and new projects in CF. While this is happening, the recommendation process's similarity algorithm is being enhanced. This algorithm's decision support accuracy has been found to be 96.01% after extensive testing. Its accuracy is roughly 8% better than that of conventional CF, which has a precision of 8%. The results demonstrated a degree of accuracy in the improved algorithm.","misc","wim"

A 49-year-old female with Steven-Johnson Syndrome secondary to sulfonamide use presented for routine follow up evaluation of her customized ocular surface prosthetic device (PD). Her ocular history was significant for mucous membrane grafting and limbal stem cell transplant in both eyes. The ocular surface examination of the left eye was notable for chronic dense neovascularization and scarring of the temporal and inferior cornea which extended into the visual axis. Scheimpflug imaging and densitometry analysis were performed in order to quantify the severity of the scar, however, there was significant difficulty in acquiring densitometry data. During a subsequent follow-up visit to monitor the scar, standardized room lighting and a neutral density filter were used to obtain reproducible and reliable imaging for densitometry analysis. The corneal scar was monitored over time using this standardized imaging protocol and by densitometry analysis minimal progression of the scar was evident, suggesting that recently documented significant vision loss in the left eye could not be attributed solely to changes in the scar. The use of a neutral density filter along with standardized ambient lighting conditions when performing Scheimpflug imaging may be necessary to reliably monitor densitometry progression of clinically severe corneal opacities.","misc","wim"

The repetition of lifting tasks increases the risk of back and shoulder injuries among these workers. While lifting in this industry is composed of loaded and unloaded picking and placing, the existing literature does not address the separate analysis of the biomechanics of the back and shoulder for these events. To that end, we investigated the kinematics of the back and shoulder movements of nine healthy male participants who performed three sessions of a simulated de/palletization task. Their back and shoulder kinematics were sensed using an optical motion capture system to determine the back inclination and shoulder flexion. Comparison of the kinematics between the first and last sessions indicated statistically significant changes in the timings, angles, coordination between the back and shoulder, and moments around the shoulder (p&lt;0.05). The majority of the significant changes were observed during the loaded events, which confirms the importance of the separation of these events for biomechanical analysis. This finding suggests that focusing worker evaluation on the loaded periods can provide important information to detect kinematic changes that may affect musculoskeletal injury risk.","misc","wim"
"40",35966096,"Genetic Basis of Sexual Maturation Heterosis: Insights From Ovary lncRNA and mRNA Repertoire in Chicken.","Sexual maturation is fundamental to the reproduction and production performance, heterosis of which has been widely used in animal crossbreeding. However, the underlying mechanism have long remained elusive, despite its profound biological and agricultural significance. In the current study, the reciprocal crossing between White Leghorns and Beijing You chickens were performed to measure the sexual maturation heterosis, and the ovary lncRNAs and mRNAs of purebreds and crossbreeds were profiled to illustrate molecular mechanism of heterosis. Heterosis larger than 20% was found for pubic space and oviduct length, whereas age at first egg showed negative heterosis in both crossbreeds. We identified 1170 known lncRNAs and 1994 putative lncRNAs in chicken ovary using a stringent pipeline. Gene expression pattern showed that nonadditivity was predominant, and the proportion of nonadditive lncRNAs and genes was similar between two crossbreeds, ranging from 44.24% to 49.15%. A total of 200 lncRNAs and 682 genes were shared by two crossbreeds, respectively. GO and KEGG analysis showed that the common genes were significantly enriched in the cell cycle, animal organ development, gonad development, ECM-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway and GnRH signaling pathway. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified that 7 out of 20 co-expressed lncRNA-mRNA modules significantly correlated with oviduct length and pubic space. Interestingly, genes harbored in seven modules were also enriched in the similar biological process and pathways, in which nonadditive lncRNAs, such as MSTRG.17017.1 and MSTRG.6475.20, were strongly associated with nonadditive genes, such as CACNA1C and TGFB1 to affect gonad development and GnRH signaling pathway, respectively. Moreover, the results of real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) correlated well with the transcriptome data. Integrated with positive heterosis of serum GnRH and melatonin content detected in crossbreeds, we speculated that nonadditive genes involved in the GnRH signaling pathway elevated the gonad development, leading to the sexual maturation heterosis. We characterized a systematic landscape of ovary lncRNAs and mRNAs related to sexual maturation heterosis in chicken. The quantitative exploration of hybrid transcriptome changes lays foundation for genetic improvement of sexual maturation traits and provides insights into endocrine control of sexual maturation.","misc","wim"

The safety test results of subcutaneous inoculation in mice showed that Oli vaccine had the most severe side effects, with a combined score of 35, followed by the ISA201 vaccine (25 points), Alh vaccine (20 points), GEL vaccine (10 points), and IMS1313 vaccine (10 points). A dose of 1.5LD50 of strain HG-1 was used to challenge the mice intraperitoneally, 14 days after their second immunization. The protective efficacy of Oli vaccine and Alh vaccine was 100% (8/8), whereas that of the other three adjuvanted vaccines was 88% (7/8). Challenge with 2.5LD50 of strain HG-1 resulted in a 100% survival rate, demonstrating the 100% protective efficacy of the Oli vaccine, followed by the GEL vaccine (71%, 5/7), IMS1313 vaccine (57%, 4/7), ISA201 vaccine (43%, 3/7), and Alh vaccine (29%, 2/7). Challenge with 4LD50 of strain HG-1 showed 100% (7/7) protective efficacy of the Oli vaccine and 71% (5/7) protective efficacy of the GEL vaccine, whereas the protective efficacy of other three adjuvanted vaccine was 14% (1/7). The Alh and GEL vaccines were selected for comparative tests in piglets, and both caused minor side effects. A second immunization with these two adjuvanted vaccines conferred 60 and 100% protective efficacy, respectively, after the piglets were challenged via an ear vein with 8LD100 of strain HG-1. After challenge with 16LD100 of strain HG-1, the Alh and GEL vaccines showed 40% and 100% protective efficacy, respectively.

Although the energetic costs of these responses are expected, with their consequences going far beyond an individual, their underlying molecular and metabolic mechanisms are not fully known. One, so far hardly considered, is if and how the photosynthetic efficiency of phytoplankton might change in response to the predation cues. Our main aim was to identify such responses in phytoplankton and to detect if they are taxon-specific. We exposed seven algae and seven cyanobacteria species to the chemical cues of an efficient consumer, Daphnia magna, which was fed either a green alga, Acutodesmus obliquus, or a cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus (kairomone and alarm cues), or was not fed (kairomone alone). In most algal and cyanobacterial species studied, the quantum yield of photosystem II increased in response to predator fed cyanobacterium, whereas in most of these species the yield did not change in response to predator fed alga. Also, cyanobacteria tended not to respond to a non-feeding predator. The modal qualitative responses of the electron transport rate were similar to those of the quantum yield. To our best knowledge, the results presented here are the broadest scan of photosystem II responses in the predation context so far.","misc","wim"

Our previous study demonstrated that dimethyl trisulfide (DT) from Chinese leek (Allium tuberosum) significantly suppressed the mycelial growth of B. dothidea and inhibited the incidence of apple ring rot postharvest. However, the mechanism underlying the inhibitory role of DT against B. dothidea is not fully understood. Comparing the control and the DT-treated B. dothidea mycelial transcriptomes revealed that heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) strongly responded to DT treatment. This study identified four Hsp20 genes throughout the B. dothidea genome (BdHsp20_1-4). Each BdHsp20 gene had a conserved ACD with a variable N-terminal region and a short C-terminal extension. The segmental duplication event has contributed to the expansion of the BdHsp20 gene family. Compared to the wild-type strain, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited BdHsp20 mutant (ΔBdHsp20) decreased the mycelial growth by 55.95% and reduced the disease symptom in postharvest apple fruit by 96.34%. However, the BdHsp20 complemented strain (ΔBdHsp20_C) significantly restored the growth and pathogenicity, which suggested that the BdHsp20 gene was closely involved in the growth and pathogenicity of B. dothidea. This study would accelerate the exploration of the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effect of DT against B. dothidea and also provide new insights for the management of apple ring rot disease.","misc","wim"

Methodologically, the article is based on interdisciplinary scientific approach that allows to study medical, social and economic components of public health, considering observed trends: digitalization of health care and epidemic of new coronavirus infection. Based on statistical analysis of open data on morbidity and mortality of population in the Russian Federation over past few years, results were obtained indicating that collection of medical statistics is not built consistently that medical care in health care is not organized sequentially as cycle or process, but is presented in fragments. This leads to the fact that rural population has very limited access to multidisciplinary and high-tech medical services, and in structure of mortality there is high gender bias (males die more often than females in same classes of causes). Based on identified problems, two organizing solutions are proposed. The first solution is to create, on the basis of the Ministry of Health Care of Russia, special portal for complete, reliable and up-to-date medical statistics, which will be generated and processed using Big Data technologies. The second solution consists in transition from fragmentation to systematic organization of medical care in the education and prevention-treatment-rehabilitation continuum, while for each stage special set of key performance indices is established that allows to solve the tasks of improving public health, but also to develop harmonized social and economic public policy.","misc","wim"

However, additional IC may lead to immunosuppression and can negatively affect the prognosis. We evaluated whether receiving IC improved the prognosis of patients with NPC co-infected with HBV, on the basis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). This large-scale retrospective cohort study included data of patients with pathologically confirmed NPC that were collected from two hospitals between January 2010 and March 2014. Patients were followed-up every 3 months during the first 2 years and once every 6 months thereafter. Univariate analysis identified confounding factors associated with prognosis. Stage-based subgroup analyses and 1:1 random-matched pair analyses were performed to compare the survival differences between patients treated with IC + CCRT and those treated with CCRT alone. Among the 1,076 enrolled patients, 16.6% were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive. Among HBsAg-positive patients with stage II/III/IV NPC, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (79.3% vs. 89.9%; P=0.045) and progression-free survival (PFS) (70.6% vs. 83.7%; P=0.025) were lower in patients who received IC + CCRT than in those who received CCRT alone. After adjusting for confounding factors, IC + CCRT was validated as a negative prognosticator for DMFS and PFS, while matched-pair analysis with HBsAg-negative patients showed a better overall survival (OS) for IC + CCRT (88.4% vs. 82.6%; P=0.04). Compared with CCRT alone, IC + CCRT negatively affects DMFS and PFS in patients with NPC with chronic HBV infection. We advocate withholding IC but administering stronger initial treatment in NPC patients complicated with HBV infection.","misc","wim"

Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were used to simulate and analyze the interactions and binding free energies between HLA-A*2402-restricted antigen peptides and HLA molecules, before and after the single residue substitution. HLA-A*2402 restricted antigen peptides before and after the single residue replacement were loaded into dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro, and further Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELispot) test was carried out to evaluate the effect of modified antigen peptides on the immune activation of CTL cells. After replacing the antigen peptides with a single residue, some of them could promote the formation of pi-stacking interaction. The binding free energy between the modified antigen peptides and HLA-A*2402, as well as the level of immune activation of CTL cells were mostly higher than before, especially after the replacement of the 9th residue of the polypeptide, such as C9F and C9W. There was a significant negative correlation between the level of activated CTL cells by modified antigen peptides and the total interaction amount of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Promoting the formation of pi-stacking interaction between antigen peptides and HLA-A*2402 molecules could increase the total binding free energy of p-HLA complex and the level of CTL cells activation. In addition, the amount of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between peptides and HLA could reduce the level of immune activation.

The preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus coordinates body temperature by responding to both external temperature cues and internal brain temperature. Here we describe an autonomous circadian clock system in the murine ventromedial POA (VMPO) in close proximity to cells which express the atypical violet-light sensitive opsin, Opn5. We analyzed the light-sensitivity and thermal-sensitivity of the VMPO circadian clocks ex vivo. The phase of the VMPO circadian oscillations was not influenced by light. However, the VMPO clocks were reset by temperature changes within the physiological internal temperature range. This thermal-sensitivity of the VMPO circadian clock did not require functional Opn5 expression or a functional circadian clock within the Opn5-expressing cells. The presence of temperature-sensitive circadian clocks in the VMPO provides an advancement in the understanding of mechanisms involved in the dynamic regulation of core body temperature.","misc","wim"

Chromosome size varied from 4.7-4.8 Mbp (phylogenetic Lineage 1 of P. agardhii/P. rubescens thriving in shallow waterbodies) to 5.4-5.6 Mbp (Lineage 2 of P. agardhii/P. rubescens thriving in deeper physically stratified lakes and reservoirs) and 6.3-6.6 Mbp (Lineage 3, P. pseudagardhii/P. tepida including planktic and benthic ecotypes). Although the variation in chromosome size was positively related to the proportion of IS elements (1.1-3.7% on chromosome), quantitatively, IS elements and other paralogs only had a minor share in chromosome size variation. Thus, the major part of genomic variation must have resulted from gene loss processes (ancestor of Lineages 1 and 2) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Six of seven peptide synthesis gene clusters were found located on the chromosome and occurred already in the ancestor of P. agardhii/P. rubescens, and became partly lost during evolution of Lineage 1. In general, no increased IS element frequency in the vicinity of peptide synthesis gene clusters was observed. We found a higher proportion of IS elements in ten breaking regions related to chromosomal rearrangements and a tendency for colocalization of toxic/bioactive peptide synthesis gene clusters on the chromosome.","misc","wim"

This research was performed to evaluate the effects of B toxicity on cell wall architecture of Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima Blume) pollen tubes with emphasis on the relationship among pectins, cellulose, and callose. Results showed that 0.8 mM H3BO3 inhibited pollen germination and led to abnormal morphology of the pollen tubes. B toxicity also affected the distribution of cell wall components of the pollen tube. In control pollen tube, esterified and acid pectins were distributed unevenly, with the former mainly at the tip and the latter on the distal region. Cellulose was distributed uniformly on the surface with less at the tip; callose reduced gradually from base to sub-tip of the pollen tubes and no callose at the tip of the tube was detected. B toxicity led to the deposition of esterified and acid pectins, cellulose, and callose at the tip of the pollen tube. Results from scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that B toxicity also altered pollen tube wall ultrastructure. The results from enzymatic treatment illustrated that there existed a close relationship among pectins, cellulose, and callose. B toxicity also altered the relationship. In a word, B toxicity altered deposition and relationship of pectins, cellulose, and callose of pollen tube wall.","misc","wim"
"2493",35960943,"A Paradigm Shift for Asthma Care.","Asthma remains a substantial health burden, despite continued treatment advances. Patients with mild or moderate asthma, even those with intermittent symptoms, are at risk for severe or fatal exacerbations. Use of short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA)-only rescue therapy is associated with an increased risk of exacerbations, beginning at about the second fill annually. Systemic corticosteroids have shortterm and long-term adverse effects, and long-term adverse effects are driven by cumulative lifetime doses starting at 0.5 to 1.0 g. Expert opinion on the use of SABA only for rescue therapy differs, but recent evidence suggests that a fast-acting bronchodilator combined with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is more effective at reducing the risk of exacerbations than SABA alone. There is a window of opportunity just prior to an asthma exacerbation during which use of fast-acting bronchodilator + ICS may play a significant role in mitigating the risk of exacerbation. Patients may respond better to a combination inhaler of a fast-acting bronchodilator and an ICS as needed for rescue therapy or as part of a maintenance and rescue therapy paradigm, rather than attempting to use separate inhalers. However, there is currently no fixed-dose, fast-acting bronchodilator + ICS approved in the United States for as-needed use.","misc","wim"

Many researchers used planarians as a model system for the study of drug abuse because they display high similarities with the nervous system of vertebrates at cellular and molecular levels (e.g., neuronal morphology, neurotransmitter ligands, and receptor function). This research field recently led to the discovery of causal relationships between the expression of Transient Receptor Potential ion channels in planarians and their behavioral responses to noxious stimuli such as heat, cold or pharmacological analogs such as TRP agonists, among others. It has also been shown that some antinociceptive drugs modulate these behaviors. However, among the few authors that tried to implement a full behavior analysis, none reached a consensual use of the terms used to describe planarian gaits yet, nor did they establish a comprehensive description of a potential planarian nociceptive system. The aim of this review is therefore to aggregate the ancient and the most recent evidence for a true nociceptive behavior in planarians. It also highlights the convenience and relevance of this invertebrate model for nociceptive tests and suggests further lines of research. In regards to past pharmacological studies, this review finally discusses the opportunities given by the model to extensively screen for novel antinociceptive drugs.","misc","wim"
"1289",35958145,"Biocrust Amendments to Topsoils Facilitate Biocrust Restoration in a Post-mining Arid Environment.","Soil cryptogamic biocrusts provide many ecological functions in arid zone ecosystems, though their natural reestablishment in disturbed areas is slow. Accelerating reestablishment of biocrusts may facilitate the establishment of vascular plant communities within the timeframes of restoration targets (typically 5-15 years). One technique is to inoculate the soil surface using slurries of biocrust material harvested from another site. However, this is destructive to donor sites, and hence the potential to dilute slurries will govern the feasibility of this practice at large spatial scales. We conducted a replicated experiment on a disturbed mine site to test the individual and combined effects of two strategies for accelerating soil cryptogamic biocrust reestablishment: (1) slurry inoculation using biocrust material harvested from native vegetation; and (2) the use of psyllium husk powder as a source of mucilage to bind the soil surface, and to potentially provide a more cohesive substrate for biocrust development. The experiment comprised 90 experimental plots across six treatments, including different dilutions of the biocrust slurries and treatments with and without psyllium. Over 20 months, the reestablishing crust was dominated by cyanobacteria (including Tolypothrix distorta and Oculatella atacamensis), and these established more rapidly in the inoculated treatments than in the control treatments. The inoculated treatments also maintained this cover of cyanobacteria better through prolonged adverse conditions. The dilute biocrust slurry, at 1:100 of the biocrust in the remnant vegetation, performed as well as the 1:10 slurry, suggesting that strong dilution of biocrust slurry may improve the feasibility of using this technique at larger spatial scales. Psyllium husk powder did not improve biocrust development but helped to maintain a soil physical crust through hot, dry, and windy conditions, and so the potential longer-term advantages of psyllium need to be tested.","misc","wim"
"512",35958197,"Characterization of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) accessions using morpho-physiological traits under varying levels of salinity stress at seedling stage.","Abiotic stresses are the major stressors affecting wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production worldwide. The world population is increasing continuously. It is very difficult to feed the population because one-third world's population consumes wheat as a staple food. Among all abiotic stresses, salinity is one that led to a drastic reduction in wheat crop fitness and productivity. Thus, understanding the effects of salinity stress becomes indispensable for wheat improvement programs which have depended mainly on the genetic variations present in the wheat genome through conventional breeding. Therefore, an experiment was conducted using a complete randomized design with four replications, to determine the selection criteria for salinity-tolerant germplasm based on morphophysiological traits at the seedling stage. Three levels of salt solutions, i.e., 4, 8, and 12 dSm-1 were applied and the performance of different genotypes under these three salinities levels was observed. Results depicted that leaf water content and relative water content were correlated with each other. Notably, selection based on these traits increased the performance of other characters. The genotypes G11, G13, G18, G22, and G36 performed best in the salinity stress. So, these genotypes are considered salinity-tolerant genotypes. The genotypes G4, G17, G19, G30, and G38 performed worst in the stress and these were salinity-susceptible genotypes. From the results of the principal component (PC) analysis, the first five PCs were indicated to have a substantial genetic variation from the total of 14 PCs. These PCs showed 75, 73, 65.324, and 65.162% of total variation under normal, salinity level 4, 8, and 12 dSm-1, respectively. Stomatal conductance, fresh shoot weight and fresh root weight, and dry shoot weight and dry root weight were not significant and negatively associated with all other traits studied, except for relative water and leaf water content. Overall, the results suggested that selection based on leaf water content and relative water content at the seedling stage would genetically improve salinity tolerance. Genotypes with good performance under salt stress conditions may be useful in future breeding programs and will be effective in developing high-yielding salt-tolerant wheat varieties.","misc","wim"

Notably, immune cell activation requires high level of cellular energy that is predominately generated by the mitochondria. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS), the byproduct of mitochondrial energy generation, serves as an essential mediator to control the activation and differentiation of cells and regulate the antigenicity of oxidized nucleoids within the mitochondria. Recently, clinical trials on normalization of mitochondrial redox imbalance by mROS scavengers and those investigating the recovery of defective mitophagy have provided novel insights into SLE prophylaxis and therapy. However, the precise mechanism underlying the role of oxidative stress-related mitochondrial molecules in skewing the cell fate at the molecular level remains unclear. This review outlines distinctive mitochondrial functions and pathways that are involved in immune responses and systematically delineates how mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to SLE pathogenesis. In addition, we provide a comprehensive overview of damaged mitochondrial function and impaired metabolic pathways in adaptive and innate immune cells and lupus-induced organ tissues. Furthermore, we summarize the potential of current mitochondria-targeting drugs for SLE treatment. Developing novel therapeutic approaches to regulate mitochondrial oxidative stress is a promising endeavor in the search for effective treatments for systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly SLE.","misc","wim"

Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) has been widely used in children with Rb and has achieved an ideal therapeutic effect. However, IAC has side effects, including anemia and bone marrow suppression, for which explicit evidence on the risk factors is lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the covariates that may affect the occurrence of anemia and bone marrow suppression in children with Rb after IAC. Children with Rb admitted between May 2019 and January 2021 were included into the study. The differences in the number of children with anemia and bone marrow suppression before and after IAC according to different covariates were recorded. All potential impact factors were included into the univariate and multivariate regression models to identify the related covariates of post-IAC anemia and bone marrow suppression. Data of 282 children with Rb were retrospectively collected. After IAC, children with Rb had increased severities of anemia (p <0.0001, chi-square test) and bone marrow suppression (p = 0.001, chi-square test). Moreover, the number of children with Rb who had an increased cross-level change in the severity of anemia and degree of bone marrow suppression was 80 (41.24%) and 64 (32.49%), respectively. The univariate regression analysis showed that numerous factors (such as pre-IAC intravenous chemotherapy, results of pre-IAC routine blood tests, and some serological indicators for liver and kidney function) affected the anemia severity and degree of bone marrow suppression in children with Rb after IAC. Additionally, the predictive model of the multivariate regression could predict anemia and bone marrow suppression. Children with Rb may have an increased risk of anemia and bone marrow suppression after IAC, but this is temporary and can be influenced by several factors. Therefore, IAC should be maintained as the standard of care. We generated predictive equations for predicting anemia severity and degree of bone marrow suppression, which can guide the prediction and timely control of anemia and bone marrow suppression after IAC.","misc","wim"

The aim of this study was to analyze the molecular mechanisms of florfenicol and oxazolidinone resistance in Enterococcus isolates from anal feces of domestic animals. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels were determined by the agar dilution method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to analyze the distribution of the resistance genes. Whole-genome sequencing and comparative plasmid analysis was conducted to analyze the resistance gene environment. A total of 351 non-duplicated enteric strains were obtained. Among these isolates, 22 Enterococcus isolates, including 19 Enterococcus. faecium and 3 Enterococcus. faecalis, were further studied. 31 florfenicol resistance genes (13 fexA, 3 fexB, 12 optrA, and 3 poxtA genes) were identified in 15 of the 19 E. faecium isolates, and no florfenicol or oxazolidinone resistance genes were identified in 3 E. faecalis isolates. Whole-genome sequencing of E. faecium P47, which had all four florfenicol and oxazolidinone resistance genes and high MIC levels for both florfenicol (256 mg/L) and linezolid (8 mg/L), revealed that it contained a chromosome and 3 plasmids (pP47-27, pP47-61, and pP47-180). The four florfenicol and oxazolidinone resistance genes were all related to the insertion sequences IS1216 and located on two smaller plasmids. The genes fexB and poxtA encoded in pP47-27, while fexA and optrA encoded in the conjugative plasmid pP47-61. Comparative analysis of homologous plasmids revealed that the sequences with high identities were plasmid sequences from various Enterococcus species except for the Tn6349 sequence from a Staphylococcus aureus chromosome (MH746818.1). The current study revealed that florfenicol and oxazolidinone resistance genes (fexA, fexB, poxtA, and optrA) were widely distributed in Enterococcus isolates from animal in China. The mobile genetic elements, including the insertion sequences and conjugative plasmid, played an important role in the horizontal transfer of florfenicol and oxazolidinone resistance.","misc","wim"

In European countries, MRSA isolates belonging to clonal complex 398 have been detected at high rates in pigs. However, the prevalence of MRSA in pigs and farm environments in Japan remains unclear. MRSA isolates were obtained from pigs in slaughterhouses, diseased pigs on farms, imported breeding pigs, and farm dust. We conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and analyzed the molecular epidemiological relationship between these MRSA isolates using core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). The prevalence rates of MRSA among pigs in slaughterhouses, diseased pigs on farms, imported breeding pigs, and farm dust were 5.2 %, 3.4 %, 28.8 %, and 0.06 %, respectively. ST 398 isolates that classified as ST398/t034 were isolated from pigs from all sources. The results of cgMLST showed that ST398/t034 isolates originating from domestic pigs clustered into the same cluster as the isolates from imported breeding pigs. However, some clusters only included isolates of domestic pig origin. Most MRSA isolates in this study carried resistance genes for aminoglycosides, β-lactams, macrolides, tetracyclines, and zinc. None of the MRSA isolates in this study harbored Panton-Valentine leukocidin toxin genes. Molecular epidemiological analysis suggested a relationship between isolates from slaughter pigs and imported breeding pigs and the presence of MRSA isolates of domestic origin.

Nck-associated protein 1 (NCKAP1) is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression in several cancer types, but the function and prognostic value of NCKAP1 in ccRCC remain poorly understood. Methods: Using the Ualcan database, we evaluated the correlation between NCKAP1 expression and clinical features of ccRCC. These data were validated by immunohistochemical staining for NCKAP1 in a cohort of ccRCC patients. We assessed the prognostic value of NCKAP1 using GEPIA2 survival analysis. NCKAP1 function was characterized in vitro and in vivo using NCKAP1-overexpression ACHN cell lines. The LinkedOmics and GSCALite databases were used to investigate identify potential NCKAP1-targeted medicines that may play a role in the treatment of ccRCC. The impact of NCKAP1 expression on immune infiltration was also evaluated. Results: NCKAP1 was significantly downregulated in ccRCC and correlated with advanced clinicopathological features and poor prognosis. Overexpression of NCKAP1 in ACHN cells reduced proliferation, invasion and migration capacity in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. According to the LinkedOmics, GSCALite and TIMER databases, NCKAP1 and related genes function primarily in ribosomal signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, TGF-β, and EMT-related signaling pathways. NCKAP1 was also shown to positively correlate with immune cell types, biomarkers, and immune checkpoints in ccRCCs. Conclusions: NCKAP1 may play a vital tumor-suppressive role in ccRCC and is potentially a useful prognostic biomarker.","misc","wim"

To classify nonmagnetic metals in three shapes-planar, cylindrical, and spherical-a triple-coil electromagnetic sensor that operates as two coil pairs is used, and the difference in the phase tangent of the impedance change of the two coil pairs is used as a feature for the classification. The effect of spatial position drift between the sensor and the sample divided into lift-off vertically and horizontal drift horizontally on this feature is considered. Experimental results prove that there is a linear relationship between the feature and lift-off regardless of the metal shape, whereas horizontal drift has no effect on this feature. In addition, the slope of the curve between the feature and the lift-off is different for different shapes. Finally, a classification method eliminating the effect of lift-off variation has been constructed, and the classification accuracy of Cu-Al-Zn-Ti metals reached 96.3%, 96.3%, 92.6%, and 100%, respectively, with an overall correct classification rate of 96.3%.","misc","wim"

In this study, the research model was analyzed through multilevel analysis to contribute to the literature on the mechanism by which CSR affects employees' job attitudes and perceptions of CSR authenticity. First, hypothesis testing confirmed that external CSR is positively associated with employees' perceptions of CSR authenticity. Second, CSR authenticity mediates a positive relationship between external CSR and emotional commitment. As the direct effect of external CSR on emotional commitment was not statistically significant, it could be confirmed that the full mediation relationship was significant through CSR authenticity. This study makes three theoretical contributions to the literature on employees' perceptions of CSR. First, it examines the mechanism of the impact of CSR on employees. By examining the mechanism by which employees recognize and interpret CSR, this study attempts to uncover the black box that CSR affects employees. Second, this study contributes to the literature on CSR authenticity by explaining the mediating role of CSR authenticity in the relationship between CSR and employee job attitudes through construal level theory.

Recent evidence, however, points to the production of MeHg also in oxic pelagic waters, but the magnitude and the drivers for this process remain unclear. Here, we performed a controlled experiment testing the hypothesis that inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (tDOM) to coastal waters enhance MeHg formation via increased bacterial activity. Natural brackish seawater from a coastal area of the Baltic Sea was exposed to environmentally relevant levels of Hg(II) and additions of tDOM according to climate change scenarios. MeHg formation was observed to be coupled to elevated bacterial production rates, which, in turn, was linked to input levels of tDOM. The increased MeHg formation was, however, not coupled to any specific change in bacterial taxonomic composition nor to an increased abundance of known Hg(II) methylation genes. Instead, we found that the abundance of genes for the overall bacterial carbon metabolism was higher under increased tDOM additions. The findings of this study may have important ecological implications in a changing global climate by pointing to the risk of increased exposure of MeHg to pelagic biota.","misc","wim"

We review publicly available sources to estimate the amount of CO2 that has been stored by facilities since 1996. We organize these sources into three categories corresponding to the associated degree of assurance: (1) legal assurance, (2) quality assurance through auditing, and (3) no assurance. Data were found for 20 facilities, with an aggregate capture capacity of 36 Mt of CO2 year-1. Combining data from all categories, we estimate that 29 Mt of CO2 was geologically stored in 2019 and there was cumulative storage of 197 Mt over the period of 1996-2020. These are climate relevant scales commensurate with recent cumulative and ongoing emissions impacts of renewables in some markets, e.g., solar photovoltaics in the United States. The widely used capture capacity is in aggregate 19-30% higher than storage rates and is not a good proxy for estimating storage volumes. However, the discrepancy is project-specific and not always a reflection of project performance.

Using a multistage, stratified, and cluster random sampling method, the prospective cohort study with a median follow-up of 3.51 years enrolled 10,678 hypertensive participants at baseline. The prevalence, awareness, and anticoagulation data of AF in this focal population were carefully assessed. Stepwise logistic regression and Cox regression analysis were respectively performed to evaluate the determinants of AF and the association between AF and CVD-related mortality. The overall prevalence of AF was 1.3% (95% CI, 1.1%-1.6%) in the hypertensive population, and it was higher in men than in women (1.8% vs. 1.0%, respectively; p=0.001). The awareness of AF was 53.1%, and the rate of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy was only 4.2%, although all AF participants should have required according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. The determinants of AF included elder, male, and history of coronary heart disease in the hypertensive population. Besides, compared with individuals without AF, the risk of CVD-related mortality significantly increased in the hypertensive population with AF (HR 3.37, 95% CI 2.10-5.40). Our results indicated a huge burden of AF and underuse of OAC therapy for them in a community-based hypertensive population.

The sensor incorporates a unique four-line, single-sensor chemiluminescence imaging-based approach, which relies on the ratio of C2* and CH* radical-species intensities to obtain measurements of equivalence ratios. The advantage of the four-line sensor is the use of additional filtering to mitigate broadband luminescence signals, and its improvements over conventional two-line chemiluminescence diagnostics are discussed. The sensor was calibrated using a premixed bluff-body jet burner with a propane-air flame operating over a wide range of equivalence ratios. The results showed that the four-line processing technique improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the chemiluminescence images for all test cases. Calibrations of C2*/CH* intensity ratio to equivalence ratio were developed for both the four-line and two-line techniques. The calibrations were then used to create maps of local equivalence ratios in the flame-holding region. The maps revealed a non-uniform field of equivalence ratios due to the nature of the radical-species intensity profiles within the flame. Therefore, special consideration is required for calibration in order to accurately quantify equivalence ratios and apply these to diffusion flames.","misc","wim"

A novel PET/CT parameter characterizing lesion dissemination, the distance between two lesions that were furthest apart (D max), was calculated. The total metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were computed by using 41% of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) thresholding method. The 5-year PFS rate was 51.9% for all patients. In the multivariate analysis, high D max [P = 0.046; hazard ratio (HR) = 2.877], high TLG (P = 0.004; HR = 3.612), and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.041; HR = 2.287) were independent predictors of PFS.

The receiver operating characteristic curves and decision curve analysis demonstrated that the scoring system had better differentiation and clinical utility than these existing indices. In addition, the median SUVmax was significantly higher in grade 3A (36 cases) than in grades 1 and 2 FL (90 cases) (median: 13.63 vs. 11.45, P = 0.013), but a substantial overlap existed (range: 2.25-39.62 vs. 3.17-39.80). TLG and D max represent two complementary aspects of the disease, capturing the tumor burden and lesion dissemination. TLG and D max are promising metrics for identifying patients at a high risk of progression or relapse. Additionally, SUVmax seems to have some value for distinguishing grade 3A from low-grade FL but cannot substitute for biopsy.","misc","wim"

Although parental reports have been traditionally used, emerging research highlights the importance of child and adolescent reports of the household food environment. Extending research from high- and upper-middle-income countries, this study of adolescent compared with adult reports of household food insecurity in Kenya, a lower-middle-income country, examined 1) prevalence of and correspondence between adolescent and adult reports of household food insecurity, and 2) associations of adolescent and adult reports of household food insecurity with adolescent nonnutritional and nutritional outcomes. Using data from the Kenya Violence Against Children Surveys (n = 1182), we assessed prevalence of household food insecurity reported by adolescents (ages 13-17 y) and adults, with McNemar χ2 and κ analysis of correspondence between reports. Ordinal and binary logistic regression assessed associations between adolescent and adult reports and adolescent mental health and self-rated physical health and food sufficiency outcomes. Household food insecurity was reported by 36% of adolescents and 63% of adults; 36% of adult reports were discordant with adolescent reports (κ = 0.333). Odds of adolescent mental health difficulties were highest with adolescent-only report (OR = 2.11, P = 0.02), followed by adult and adolescent (OR = 1.83, P = 0.001) and adult-only (OR = 1.06, P = 0.77) report. Odds of poor adolescent self-rated physical health were highest with adult and adolescent report (OR = 2.47, P < 0.001) followed by adolescent-only (OR = 2.04, P = 0.08) and adult-only (OR = 1.37, P = 0.20) report. Odds of adolescents eating ≤1 meals the previous day were highest with adult and adolescent (OR = 21.38, P < 0.001) followed by adult-only (OR = 7.44, P = 0.01) and adolescent-only (OR = 2.31, P = 0.34) report. Measuring household food insecurity with both adolescent report and adult report is important for having a comprehensive understanding of household resources and needs and of the nonnutritional (mental and physical health) and nutritional (diet and food) outcomes of household food insecurity for adolescents.","misc","wim"

Eleven hens, approximately 104 weeks old, were randomly assigned to BDL (n = 4) and sham surgery (SHAM; n = 7) groups. In BDL hens, histopathology revealed marked bile duct proliferation and liver fibrosis. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of myofibers from both the pectoralis (PCT) muscles significantly decreased in the BDL group compared with the SHAM group (P < 0.01). In contrast, the CSA of myofibers from the femorotibialis lateralis (FTL) muscle did not decrease in the BDL group. Type I fibers were large, round, and hypertrophic. Elongated type IIA and IIB fibers were also present. For IGF-1 immunostaining, the immunoreaction intensity was higher in the PCT in the BDL group than the SHAM group. Within the BDL group, type I fibers from FTL had a stronger immunoreaction intensity than the type II fibers. For IGF-1R immunostaining, the intensity of the immunoreactions was similar within the PCT in the BDL group compared with the SHAM group. For FTL, type I fibers had stronger reactions to IGF-1R than type II fibers in the BDL group. These results suggest that type I fibers express both IGF-1 and IGF-1R and become hypertrophic in chickens with hepatic fibrosis.","misc","wim"

In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in medical imaging due to the powerful learning ability with the help of the advanced hardware technology. Unfortunately, CNNs have significant overhead on memory usage and computational resources and are labeled 'black-box' by scholars for their complex underlying structures. To this end, an interpretable graph-based method has been proposed for motion artifacts detection from head CT images in this paper. From a topological perspective, the artifacts detection problem has been reformulated as a complex network classification problem based on the network topological characteristics of the corresponding complex networks. A motion artifacts detection method based on complex networks (MADM-CN) has been proposed. Firstly, the graph of each CT image is constructed based on the theory of complex networks. Secondly, slice-to-slice relationship has been explored by multiple graph construction. In addition, network topological characteristics are investigated locally and globally, consistent topological characteristics including average degree, average clustering coefficient have been utilized for classification. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed MADM-CN has achieved better performance over conventional machine learning and deep learning methods on a real CT dataset, reaching up to 98% of the accuracy and 97% of the sensitivity.","misc","wim"

Given its prevalence, a precise and efficient stratification system based on AD symptomology that uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has great potential in the clinical diagnosis and prognosis estimation of AD patients. It was evident that deep learning methods have performed extremely well in the field of automated stratification of AD based on MRI because of their high predicting accuracy and reliability. We proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and iterated random forest (RF) architecture for MRI image stratification by both anatomical location and image modality using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We employed 3 cross-sectional data sets from the ADNI to conduct our binary-stratification [AD and normal controls (NCs), or AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)], and multi-stratification (AD, MCI, and NCs) process using MRI. And the accuracy, recall, specificity, area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), F1 and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) scores to assess accuracy of auxiliary clinical diagnoses. Compared to other combinations of algorithms, our model obtained remarkable overall stratification accuracies in all different classification sets. In terms of AD vs. MCI, the mean training AUC of the 3 runs were 85.1% in 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In terms of AD vs. NC, the mean training AUC of the 3 runs was 90.6% in 95% CIs. In terms of the 3 stratifications of AD, MCI, and NC, relative precision, recall, and specificity for each category in the training test (TS) were all near 89%, while the F1 and MCC scores of both sets were 59.9% and 59.5%, respectively. Using a deep CNN and iterated RF architecture, we showed that brain image stratification is a promising means for evaluating AD, and examining the underlying etiology of the disease, by applying computer and medical images to achieve the early auxiliary diagnosis of AD. However, we still have a long way to go from the discovery of image markers to clinical application.","misc","wim"

This has been partly due to the technology's simplicity, which has promoted its adoption throughout biomedical science. However, accumulating evidence indicates that this technology can possess significant shortcomings. This review highlights the overwhelming evidence that RNAi can be prone to off-target effects and is capable of inducing cytotoxicity in some cases. With this in mind, we consider alternative CRISPR/Cas-based approaches, which may be safer and more reliable for gene knockdown. We also discuss the pros and cons of each approach.","misc","wim"

Alongside morphological constraints, phenomena in both fields highly depend on the materials' optical properties, dimensions, and surroundings. Building up the required knowledge and experience to design next-generation photonic devices can be a complex task for novice and experienced researchers who intend to evaluate the impact of subtle material and morphology variations while setting up experiments or getting a general overview. Here, we introduce the Photonic Materials Cloud (PMCloud), a web-based, interactive open tool for designing and analyzing photonic materials. PMCloud allows identification of the subtle differences between optical material models generated from a database, experimental data input, and inline-generated materials from various analytical models. Furthermore, it provides a fully interactive interface to evaluate their performance in important fundamental (numerical) optical experiments. We demonstrate PMCloud's applicability to state-of-the-art research questions, namely the comparison of the novel plasmonic materials aluminium-doped zinc oxide and zirconium nitride and the design of an optical, dielectric thin-film Bragg reflector. PMCloud opens a rapid, freely accessible path towards prototyping optical materials and simple fundamental devices and may serve as an educational platform for photonic materials research.","misc","wim"

Previous studies have shown distinctive differences in cellular electrophysiology and excitability between myocytes and fibroblasts. However, it is still unclear how the electrical coupling between the two and the increased population of fibroblasts affects the electromechanical dynamics of cardiac tissue. This paper focuses on investigating effects of fibroblast-myocyte electrical coupling (FMEC) and fibroblast population on atrial electrical conduction and mechanical contractility by using a two-dimensional Discrete Element Method (DEM) model of cardiac tissue that is different to finite element method (FEM). In the model, the electro-mechanics of atrial cells are modelled by a biophysically detailed model for atrial electrical action potentials and myofilament kinetics, and the atrial fibroblasts are modelled by an active model that considers four active membrane ionic channel currents. Our simulation results show that the FMEC impairs myocytes' electrical action potential and mechanical contractibility, manifested by reduced upstroke velocity, amplitude and duration of action potentials, as well as cell length shortening. At the tissue level, the FMEC slows down the conduction of excitation waves, and reduces strain of the tissue produced during a contraction course. These findings provide new insights into understandings of how FMEC impairs cardiac electrical and mechanical dynamics of the heart.","misc","wim"

In 1977, F. Sanger proposed a DNA sequencing method, which allowed the complete sequences of a number of genomes to be determined. Then high-throughput and cost-effective next-generation/second-generation sequencing methods, producing up to billions of short reads, made it possible to sequence genomes of a significant number of species and provided a breakthrough in plant genetic studies. Finally, third-generation sequencing technologies allowed the determination of single-molecule sequences up to a million nucleotides in length, which is key for high-quality genome assemblies. An important task is to obtain a pan-genome, which includes an entire set of nucleotide sequences presented in various genotypes of the same species. The sequencing of plant genomes made it possible to assess intraspecific polymorphism, identify key genes influencing the formation of significant features, and develop molecular markers of economically valuable traits and this has become the basis for the development of marker-assisted and genomic selection.

At the sensor node level, we established the refractive index-thickness models for both gold and silver in the sensor and calculated the depth-width ratio (DWR) and penetration depth (PD) values of the sensor of different gold and silver thicknesses by the Jones transfer matrix and Kriging interpolation. We optimized the DWR and PD simultaneously by using the multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm (MOGA). In the following performance optimization of WSN, we simultaneously optimized the transmission success rate and information dimension with the number of nodes and transmission failure rate of the sensor node as variables by the same algorithm. By calculating the information dimension and the transmission success rate of each Pareto optimal solution, we obtained the number of nodes and transmission failure probability of the node available for practical deployment of WSN. The above results indicate that the Pareto optimal solution set obtained from MOGA can help to provide the best solution for the optimization of some certain performance parameters and also assist us in making the trade-off decision in the structure design and network deployment if optimal values of all the performance parameters can be obtained simultaneously.","misc","wim"

In this study, we aim to evaluate the relative role of geographical and ecological forces in the origin and evolution of the Madeiran ivy (Hedera maderensis), a single-species endemic belonging to the western polyploid clade of Hedera. To determine the phylogenetic placement of H. maderensis within the western polyploid clade, we analyzed 40 populations (92 individuals) using genotyping-by-sequencing and including Hedera helix as outgroup. Climatic niche differences among the study species were evaluated using a database with 867 records representing the entire species ranges. To test species responses to climate, 13 vegetative and reproductive functional traits were examined for 70 populations (335 individuals). Phylogenomic results revealed a nested pattern with H. maderensis embedded within the south-western Iberian H. iberica. Gradual niche differentiation from the coldest and most continental populations of H. iberica to the warm and stable coastal population sister to H. maderensis parallels the geographical pattern observed in the phylogeny. Similarity in functional traits is observed for H. maderensis and H. iberica. The two species show leaves with higher specific leaf area (SLA), lower leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and thickness and fruits with lower pulp fraction than the other western polyploid species H. hibernica. Acquisition of a Macaronesian climatic niche and the associated functional syndrome in mainland European ivies (leaves with high SLA, and low LDMC and thickness, and fruits with less pulp content) was a key step in the colonization of Madeira by the H. iberica/H. maderensis lineage, which points to climatic pre-adaptation as key in the success of island colonization (dispersal and establishment). Once in Madeira, budding speciation was driven by geographical isolation, while ecological processes are regarded as secondary forces with a putative impact in the lack of further in situ diversification.","misc","wim"

Existing approaches suffer from subjective variability or interference with voluntary motion. This work is aimed to establish an objective assessment system to quantify bradykinesia in DBS surgery. Based on the analysis of the requirements for intraoperative assessment, we developed a system with non-contact measurement, online movement feature extraction, and interactive data analysis and visualization. An optical sensor, Leap Motion Controller (LMC), was taken to detect hand movement in three clinical tasks. A graphic user interface was designed to process, compare and visualize the collected data and assessment results online. Quantified movement features include amplitude, frequency, velocity, their decrement and variability, etc. Technical validation of the system was performed with a motion capture system (Mocap), with respect to data-level and feature-level accuracy and reliability. Clinical validation was conducted with 20 PD patients for intraoperative assessments in DBS surgery. Treatment responses with respect to the bradykinesia movement features were analyzed. Single case analysis and group statistical analysis were performed to examine the differences between preoperative and intraoperative performance, and the correlation between the clinical ratings and the quantified assessment was analyzed. For the movements measured by LMC and Mocap, the average Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.986, and the mean amplitude difference was 2.11 mm. No significant difference was found for all movement features quantified by LMC and Mocap. For the clinical tests, key movement features showed significant differences between the preoperative baseline and intraoperative performance when the brain stimulation was ON. The assessment results were significantly correlated with the MDS-UPDRS clinical ratings.

However, the antitumor effect of B7-H4 is unstable during cell generation and further research is necessary to strengthen the antitumor efficacy of B7-H4. To explore the potential of B7-H4-targeted immunotherapy of breast cancer, current study generated four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against B7-H4 through immunization of mice followed by phage display technology. T cell-engaged bispecific antibodies and immunotoxins were created based on these mAbs. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of B7-H4-targeting bispecific antibody and immunotoxin, the anti-tumor efficacy test in vitro and in mice models in vivo were performed. Moreover, to boost the efficacy, oncolytic virus herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) was combined with the bispecific antibody and tested in mice models. Rigorous in vitro cytotoxicity assay showed that both B7-H4 bispecific antibodies and immunotoxins were toxic to B7-H4 positive cells, with the former being more potent. However, in vivo studies showed that immunotoxin was slightly more effective in suppressing tumor growth. Further, bispecific antibody combined with oncolytic virus HSV-2 revealed a synergistic effect in suppressing tumor growth without causing obvious adverse effects.

Of the 123 patients with MD recruited in this study, 80 had definite MD, 11 had probable MD, and 32 had possible MD based on the 1995 AAO-HNS guidelines. The EH grade based on HYDROPS MRI was determined independently by two otorhinolaryngologists and compared with several clinical parameters, including the diagnostic scale of MD (1995 AAO-HNS guidelines), pure tone average (PTA), low tone average (LTA), canal paresis (CP) on the caloric test, and disease duration. Cochlear hydrops and vestibular hydrops were detected in 58 and 80% of 80 definite MD ears, in 33 and 58% of 12 probable MD ears, and in 5 and 27% of 37 possible MD ears, respectively. The proportion of higher hydrops grades increased significantly with grade according to the MD diagnostic scale (p < 0.0001). Both PTA and LTA were significantly higher in patients with hydrops grade 2 than hydrops grade 0 in both the cochlea and the vestibule. CP was significantly higher in patients with grade 2 than grade 0 vestibular hydrops. Disease duration was not associated with hydrops grade. Radiological evaluation of MD using the HYDROPS protocol is useful for evaluation of the extent and severity of EH in the diagnosis of MD based on its pathophysiological mechanism.","misc","wim"

Such data are essential for updating seismic hazard maps and consequently building codes and earthquake-resistant design. This paper aims to present the Italian Strong Motion Network (RAN), describing its current status, employment, and further developments. It has 648 stations and is the result of a fruitful co-operation between the Italian government, regions, and local authorities. In fact, the network can be divided into three sub-networks: the Friuli Venezia Giulia Accelerometric Network, the Irpinia Seismic Network, and all the other stations. The Antelope software automatically collects, processes, and archives data in the data acquisition centre in Rome (Italy). The efficiency of the network on a daily basis is today more than 97%. The automatic and fast procedures that run in Antelope for the real-time strong motion data analysis are continuously improved at the University of Trieste: a large set of strong motion parameters and correspondent Ground Motion Prediction Equations allow ground shaking intensity maps to be provided for moderate to strong earthquakes occurring within the Italian territory. These maps and strong motion parameters are included in automatic reports generated for civil protection purposes.","misc","wim"

Therefore, breeding varieties with a thin pericarp is important for the quality breeding of sweet corn. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pericarp development remain largely unclear. We performed an integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA sequencing to elucidate the genetic mechanism regulating pericarp thickness during kernel development (at 15 days, 19 days, and 23 days after pollination) of two sweet corn inbred lines with different pericarp thicknesses (M03, with a thinner pericarp and M08, with a thicker pericarp). A total of 2,443 and 1,409 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in M03 and M08, respectively. Our results indicate that phytohormone-mediated programmed cell death (PCD) may play a critical role in determining pericarp thickness in sweet corn. Auxin (AUX), gibberellin (GA), and brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction may indirectly mediate PCD to regulate pericarp thickness in M03 (the thin pericarp variety). In contrast, abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), and ethylene (ETH) signaling may be the key regulators of pericarp PCD in M08 (the thick pericarp variety). Furthermore, 110 differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMIs) and 478 differentially expressed target genes were identified. miRNA164-, miRNA167-, and miRNA156-mediated miRNA-mRNA pairs may participate in regulating pericarp thickness. The expression results of DEGs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating pericarp thickness and propose the objective of breeding sweet corn varieties with a thin pericarp.","misc","wim"

The aim of the present study was to prospectively analyse digitally recorded laparoscopic cholecystectomy to assess the impact of operative technical difficulty on operative process. Video of laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed at Christchurch Hospital, NZ and North Shore Private Hospital, Sydney Australia were prospectively recorded. Using a framework derived from a previously published standard process video was annotated using a standardized template and stratified by operative grade to evaluate the impact of grade on operative process. 317 patients had their laparoscopic cholecystectomy operations prospectively recorded. Seventy one percent of these videos (n = 225) were annotated. Single ICC of operative grade was 0.760 (0.663-0.842 p < 0.010). Median operative time, rate of operative errors significantly increased and rate of CVS decreased with increasing operative grade. Significant differences in operative anatomy, operative process and instrumentation were seen with increasing grade. Operative technical difficulty is accurately predicted by operative grade and this impacts on operative process with significant implications for both surgeons and patients. Consequently operative grade should be documented routinely as part of a culture of safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","misc","wim"

To meet the demand of the ever-growing population in the next few decades, an extra increase in rice yield is an urgent need. Given that various agronomic traits contribute to the yield of rice, deciphering the key regulators involved in multiple agronomic trait formation is particularly important. As a superfamily of transcription factors, zinc finger proteins participate in regulating multiple genes in almost every stage of rice growth and development. Therefore, understanding zinc finger proteins underlying regulatory network would provide insights into the regulation of agronomic traits in rice. To this end, we intend to summarize the current advances in zinc finger proteins, with emphasis on C2H2 and CCCH proteins, and then discuss their potential in improving rice yield.","misc","wim"

The present study aimed to provide an update on the incidence, mortality, and burden of FBC in 2019, based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study. The incidence, death rate, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), the age-standardized rates (ASR) of FBC in 204 countries, and a variety of classifications, were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease Study. Data on tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and drug use were collected. The incidence, mortality, and burden of FBC were registered and compared between regions. Associations between age-standardized incidence rates and age-standardized mortality rates of FBC with smoking, drinking, and drug use were determined. The highest incidence of FBC was observed in countries with a high socioeconomic status such as those of the European continent. Despite the lower incidence of FBC in countries with a low socio-demographic index (SDI), mortality rates secondary to FBC are higher in these countries than in high-income countries. The highest age-standardized mortality rate has been reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO), followed by the African Region (AFRO). The highest age-standardized rates of DALY and YLL per 100,000 population in 2019 were observed in lower-income countries, while the highest ASR of YLD per 100,000 population was reported in high-income countries. The present GBD-based study provides a comprehensive review of the incidence, mortality, and burden of FBC in 2019. The incidence of FBC is higher in regions with a higher socioeconomic status, whereas mortality rates and DALYs are higher in poorly developed regions. We suggest better screening measures and early detection programs for the latter regions.","misc","wim"

An organizational context of the immigration officer is explored by using the data collected from a survey of 453 immigration officers from 26 immigration officer teams in Taiwan. This study has verified the transformational leadership and organizational commitment that they have positive effect on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) of the immigration officers. Moreover, it showed that the organizational climate has a context effect on organizational commitment and OCB. Furthermore, the results of this study have shown that an aggregated transformational leadership has cross-level interactions on OCB. This study also found that the transformational leadership has strong effect on organizational commitment and OCB. This study adopts a cross-level study taking organizational environmental factors and cross-level interactions as research considerations. Because of the focus on group-level impact, the research methodology can apply the supervisor's leadership style and the organizational climate to measure whether the immigration officers have a high degree of organizational commitment and influence their OCB performance across levels. The organizational commitment of the immigration officers and their individual OCB performance could be improved by converging the organizational context effect of aggregated transformational leadership and organizational climate.

Reprogramming of lipid metabolism plays important roles in tumorigenesis and progression and has been newly recognized a new hallmark of malignancy, and some related molecules in the signal pathways could be prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. However, the clinical value of lipid metabolism reprogramming in AML has not been systematically explored. In this study, we aim to explore the clinical value of lipid metabolism reprogramming and develop a prognostic risk signature for AML. We implemented univariate Cox regression analysis to identify the prognosis-related lipid metabolism genes, and then performed LASSO analysis to develop the risk signature with six lipid metabolism-related genes (LDLRAP1, PNPLA6, DGKA, PLA2G4A, CBR1, and EBP). The risk scores of samples were calculated and divided into low- and high-risk groups by the median risk score. Survival analysis showed the high-risk group hold the significantly poorer outcomes than the low-risk group. The signature was validated in the GEO datasets and displayed a robust prognostic value in the stratification analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed the signature was an independent prognostic factor for AML patients and could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in clinical evaluation. Furthermore, the risk signature was also found to be closely related to immune landscape and immunotherapy response in AML. Overall, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of lipid metabolism in AML and constructed a risk signature with six genes related to lipid metabolism for the malignancy, prognosis, and immune landscape of AML, and our study might contribute to better understanding in the use of metabolites and metabolic pathways as the potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AML.","misc","wim"

Knowledge is limited on the relationship between circadian genes, chronotype, sleeping patterns, chronutrition and obesity. The aim was to explore these associations within the EPIC-Spain cohort study. There were 3183 subjects with information on twelve genetic variants of six genes (PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1, NR1D1, CLOCK). Their association was evaluated with: chronotype and sleeping duration/quality (assessed by questionnaires), chrononutrition (number of meals and timing of intake assessed by a diet history), and also anthropometric measures of obesity at early and late adulthood (in two points in time), such as weight and waist circumference (assessed by physical measurements). Multivariable logistic and linear regression as well as additive genetic models were applied. Odds ratios (ORs), β coefficients, and p-values corrected for multiple comparisons were estimated. Genetic risk scores (GRS) were built to test gene-outcome associations further. At nominal significance level, the variant rs2735611 (PER1 gene) was associated with a 11.6% decrease in long-term weight gain (per-allele β = -0.12), whereas three CLOCK gene variants (rs12649507, rs3749474 and rs4864548), were associated with a ∼20% decrease in waist circumference gain (per-allele β ∼ -0.19). These and other associations with body measures did not hold after multiple testing correction, except waist-to-hip ratio and rs1801260, rs2070062 and rs4580704 (CLOCK gene). Associations with chrononutrition variables, chronotype and sleep duration/quality failed to reach statistical significance. Conversely, a weighted GRS was associated with the evening/late chronotype and with all other outcomes (p < 0.05). The chronotype-GRS was associated with an increased overweight/obesity risk (vs normal weight) in both early and late adulthood (OR = 2.2; p = 0.004, and OR = 2.1; p = 0.02, respectively). Genetic variants of some circadian clock genes could explain the link between genetic susceptibility to the individual's chronotype and obesity risk.","misc","wim"

Graphene in solution, obtained through electrochemical exfoliation or other methods, is typically polydisperse, containing particles of various sizes, which is not optimal for applications. We employed cascade centrifugation to select specific particle sizes in solution and prepared thin films from those graphene particles using the Langmuir-Blodgett assembly. Employing centrifugation speeds of 3, 4, and 5 krpm, further diluting the solutions in different volumes of solvent, we reliably and consistently obtained films of tunable thickness. We show that there is a limit to how thin these films can be, which is imposed by the percolation threshold. The percolation threshold is quantitatively compared to results found in literature that are obtained using other, more complex graphene film fabrication methods, and is found to occur with a percolation exponent and percolative figure of merit that are of the same order as results in literature. A maximum optical transparency of 82.4% at a wavelength of 660 nm is obtained for these films, which is in agreement with earlier works on Langmuir-Blodgett assembled ultrasonic-assisted liquid-phase exfoliated graphene. Our work demonstrates that films that are in all respects on par with films of graphene obtained through other solution-based processes can be produced from inexpensive and widely available centrifugal post-processing of existing commercially available solutions of electrochemically exfoliated graphene. The demonstrated methodology will lower the entry barriers for new research and industrial uses, since it allows researchers with no exfoliation experience to make use of widely available graphene materials.","misc","wim"

Average age and age at BD (BD-I n = 66, 55%; BD-II n = 54, 45%) onset were 46.14 (±4.23), and 27.45 (±10.35) years, with mean disease duration of 18.56 (±13.08) years. Most participants were female (n = 71; 59.2%) and 40 (33%) of them experienced lifetime abuse, with an average of 1.05 (±0.78) suicide attempts. DES scores (mean 31.8, ±21.6) correlated with ISMI total-score, with significant association with spikes in Alienation (13.1, SD±3.1) (p < 0.001) and Stereotype (13.8, SD±3.9) (p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis has shown a significant association between DES total score and alienation (p < 0.001), stereotype (p < 0.001) and MANSA total-score (p < 0.001).

Although their main cellular function, generation of energy in the form of ATP is dispensable for cancer cells, their capability to drive their adaptation to stress originating from tumor microenvironment makes them a plausible therapeutic target. Recent research has revealed that cancer cells with damaged oxidative phosphorylation import healthy (functional) mitochondria from surrounding stromal cells to drive pyrimidine synthesis and cell proliferation. Furthermore, it has been shown that energetically competent mitochondria are fundamental for tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis. The spatial positioning and transport of mitochondria involves Miro proteins from a subfamily of small GTPases, localized in outer mitochondrial membrane. Miro proteins are involved in the structure of the MICOS complex, connecting outer and inner-mitochondrial membrane; in mitochondria-ER communication; Ca2+ metabolism; and in the recycling of damaged organelles via mitophagy. The most important role of Miro is regulation of mitochondrial movement and distribution within (and between) cells, acting as an adaptor linking organelles to cytoskeleton-associated motor proteins. In this review, we discuss the function of Miro proteins in various modes of intercellular mitochondrial transfer, emphasizing the structure and dynamics of tunneling nanotubes, the most common transfer modality. We summarize the evidence for and propose possible roles of Miro proteins in nanotube-mediated transfer as well as in cancer cell migration and metastasis, both processes being tightly connected to cytoskeleton-driven mitochondrial movement and positioning.","misc","wim"

However, the self-ratings from the group that received monthly objective feedback were not more accurate than those participating in regular group supervision. These results expand findings from previous studies and have important implications for assessment of practitioners' treatment fidelity: Practitioners may learn to improve the accuracy of self-assessment of competence, but to ensure that patients receive intended care, adherence and competence should be assessed objectively.","misc","wim"

The study was designed as a retrospective cohort trial at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. From January 2017 to December 2020, a total of 1,262 patients with DM were enrolled to assess the risk factors for DPN. The patients were divided into two groups (DPN group and non-DPN group). The Mann-Whitney U test or t-test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, univariate chi-square analyses, and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the adjusted predictors of DPN. The overall prevalence of DPN in DM patients was 72.7% (n = 793/1,091). Multivariate analysis revealed that age > 66 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.647; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.469-4.770; p = 0.002), history of hypertension (OR, 1.829; 95% CI 1.146-2.920; p = 0.011), neutrophil (NE) levels exceeding 4.0 × 109/L (OR 0.256; 95% CI 0.162-0.405; p = 0.001), lymphocyte (LY) levels over 3.0 × 109/L (OR 7.173; 95% CI 4.258-12.086; p = 0.000), HbA1c > 7.7% (OR 3.151; 95% CI 1.959-5.068; p = 0.000), and FT3 > 4.4 pmol/L (OR 0.417; 95% CI 0.263-0.662; p = 0.000) were six significant predictive factors for the prevalence of DPN. High levels of LY, HbA1c, history of hypertension, and > 66 years of age increase the risk of DPN in adult patients with DM, while high levels of NE and FT3 were protective factors of DPN. Thus, the prediction of DPN can significantly be improved by identifying older patients over the age of 66 and history of hypertension, as well as establishing the biochemical cutoff values of NE, LY, HbA1c, and FT3.","misc","wim"

Through a scalable photolithographic process in this study, we fabricated graphene-based ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) arrays that can continuously monitor sodium ions in real-time. As the sodium ion concentration increased, the current-gate voltage characteristic curves shifted towards the negative direction, showing that sodium ions were captured and could be detected over a wide concentration range, from 10-8 to 10-1 M, with a sensitivity of 152.4 mV/dec. Time-dependent measurements and interfering experiments were conducted to validate the real-time measurements and the highly specific detection capability of our sensor. Our graphene ISFETs (G-ISFET) not only showed a fast response, but also exhibited remarkable selectivity against interference ions, including Ca2+, K+, Mg2+ and NH4+. The scalability, high sensitivity and selectivity synergistically make our G-ISFET a promising platform for sodium sensing in health monitoring.","misc","wim"

However, it is unclear how to implement these codes in practice. Seminal results of Bravyi et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 050503 (2010)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.104.050503] have shown that quantum LDPC codes implemented through local interactions obey restrictions on their dimension k and distance d. Here we address the complementary question of how many long-range interactions are required to implement a quantum LDPC code with parameters k and d. In particular, in 2D we show that a quantum LDPC code with distance d∝n^{1/2+ϵ} requires Ω(n^{1/2+ϵ}) interactions of length Ω[over ˜](n^{ϵ}). Further, a code satisfying k∝n with distance d∝n^{α} requires Ω[over ˜](n) interactions of length Ω[over ˜](n^{α/2}). As an application of these results, we consider a model called a stacked architecture, which has previously been considered as a potential way to implement quantum LDPC codes. In this model, although most interactions are local, a few of them are allowed to be very long. We prove that limited long-range connectivity implies quantitative bounds on the distance and code dimension.","misc","wim"

Current consensus guidelines recommend against its routine use, but recent reviews show some benefit when managing recalcitrant disease after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). Evaluate the effect of culture-directed topical antibiotics on sinonasal outcomes in AERD patients with a positive perioperative sinonasal bacterial culture who have undergone ESS. A retrospective cohort study of AERD patients with positive sinonasal culture, who underwent ESS from 2016 to 2021 was performed. Forty-four patients were identified and stratified based on their postoperative medical treatment. Twenty-six underwent postoperative intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) alone, while eighteen underwent INCS plus a 4-weeks treatment with topical antibiotics. SNOT-22 and Lund-Kennedy score (LKS) were assessed preoperatively and at 4-weeks and 4-6 months after ESS. A statistically significant improvement in the 4-weeks and 4-6 months postoperative SNOT-22 and LKS were noted within both groups (p<0.05). However, only a statistically significant difference was found in the 4-weeks postoperative LKS when comparing between treatment groups (p=0.01). Our linear regression model demonstrated a relationship between the use of combined therapy with INCS and topical antibiotics and the LKS 4-weeks post ESS (p=0.015). In AERD patients with a confirmed sinus infection, the combination of culture-directed topical antibiotics and intranasal corticosteroid irrigations in the postoperative period can provide a short-term improvement in endoscopic scores.","misc","wim"

Electrospun fibers can gain further functionality when introduced topographic details to their surfaces. In this regard, we produced random and aligned polycaprolactone (PCL) micron/submicron fibers by the electrospinning method. Simultaneously, the surface structure of the fibers was altered by applying phase separation processes including non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) and vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) mechanisms. As a result, PCL fibers with porous, wrinkled, grooved, and crater-like morphology were obtained. Human dermal fibroblasts (BJ cells) and human keratinocytes (HS2) were cultured onto the fiber surfaces and the data were evaluated in terms of cell-material interactions. Results showed that not only the orientation of fibers but also fiber topography affected both cell-fiber and cell-cell interactions in different manners. It was observed that the wrinkled topography is the most suitable for both dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes in terms of cell attachment and proliferation. We also concluded that cellular behavior was varied according to the morphology of the cells used. Morphological observations showed that HS2 cells proliferated more intensively on all surfaces compared to BJ cells. All these findings can be evaluated in terms of the design of tissue scaffolds, especially in skin tissue engineering.","misc","wim"

Dementia and MCI were diagnosed, respectively, with DSM-IV and Petersen criteria. Performance in activities of daily living (ADL) at three different levels [basic (The Katz Index of Independence), instrumental (Lawton instrumental ADL scale) and advanced (Reuben's advanced ADL scale)], measured through self- and informant-report, as well as awareness (discrepancy between self- and informant-report), were compared between groups. Stepwise regression models explored predictors of ADL and their awareness. PwD showed impairment in all ADL levels, particularly when measured through informant-report. No differences were seen between controls and PwMCI regardless of measurement type. PwD differed in awareness of instrumental and basic, but not of advanced ADL, compared to controls. Age, gender, education and fluency were the most consistent predictors for ADL. Diagnosis was a significant predictor only for instrumental ADL. Awareness of basic ADL was predicted by memory, and awareness of instrumental ADL was predicted by general cognitive status, educational level, and diagnosis. Results reinforce the presence of lack of awareness of ADL in PwD. Use of informant-reports and cognitive testing for fluency are suggested for the clinical assessment of ADL performance. Finally, assessment of instrumental ADL may be crucial for diagnostic purposes.","misc","wim"

These extracellular structures are decondensed chromatin fibers loaded with antimicrobial granular proteins, peptides, and enzymes. NETs clear microorganisms, thus keeping a check on infections at an early stage, but if dysregulated, may be self-destructive to the body. Indeed, NETs have been associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), psoriasis, and gout. More recently, increased NETs associate with COVID-19 disease severity. While there are rigorous and reliable methods to quantify NETs from neutrophils via flow cytometry and immunofluorescence, the accurate quantification of NETs in patient plasma or serum remains a challenge. Here, we developed new methodologies for the quantification of NETs in patient plasma using multiplex ELISA and immunofluorescence methodology. Plasma from patients with SLE, non-genotyped healthy controls, and genotyped healthy controls that carry either the homozygous risk or non-risk IRF5-SLE haplotype were used in this study. The multiplex ELISA using antibodies detecting myeloperoxidase (MPO), citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) and DNA provided reliable detection of NETs in plasma samples from SLE patients and healthy donors that carry IRF5 genetic risk. An immunofluorescence smear assay that utilizes only 1 µl of patient plasma provided similar results and data correlate to multiplex ELISA findings. The immunofluorescence smear assay is a relatively simple, inexpensive, and quantifiable method of NET detection for small volumes of patient plasma.","misc","wim"

These cereal species exhibit physiological diversity, such as different photosynthetic systems and environmental stress tolerance. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in Poaceae is encoded by a small multigene family and plays a central role in C4-photosynthesis and dicarboxylic acid metabolism. Here, to better understand the molecular basis of the cereal species diversity, we analyzed the PEPC gene family in wheat together with other grass species. We could designate seven plant-type and one bacterial-type grass PEPC groups, ppc1a, ppc1b, ppc2a, ppc2b, ppc3, ppc4, ppcC4, and ppc-b, respectively, among which ppc1b is an uncharacterized type of PEPC. Evolutionary inference revealed that these PEPCs were derived from five types of ancient PEPCs (ppc1, ppc2, ppc3, ppc4, and ppc-b) in three chromosomal blocks of the ancestral Poaceae genome. C4-photosynthetic PEPC (ppcC4 ) had evolved from ppc1b, which seemed to be arisen by a chromosomal duplication event. We observed that ppc1b was lost in many Oryza species but preserved in Pooideae after natural selection. In silico analysis of cereal RNA-Seq data highlighted the preferential expression of ppc1b in upper ground organs, selective up-regulation of ppc1b under osmotic stress conditions, and nitrogen response of ppc1b. Characterization of wheat ppc1b showed high levels of gene expression in young leaves, transcriptional responses under nitrogen and abiotic stress, and the presence of a Dof1 binding site, similar to ppcC4 in maize. Our results indicate the evolving status of Poaceae PEPCs and suggest the functional association of ppc1-derivatives with adaptation to environmental changes.","misc","wim"

Internet search reflects the public's attention toward and potential demand for a particular thing. Research on the spatiotemporal characteristics of online attention to vaccines can determine the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccine demand in China and provides a basis for global public health policy making. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal characteristics of online attention to vaccines and their influencing factors in 31 provinces/municipalities in mainland China with Baidu Index as the data source by using geographic concentration index, coefficient of variation, GeoDetector, and other methods. The following findings are presented. First, online attention to vaccines showed an overall upward trend in China since 2011, especially after 2016. Significant seasonal differences and an unbalanced monthly distribution were observed. Second, there was an obvious geographical imbalance in online attention to vaccines among the provinces/municipalities, generally exhibiting a spatial pattern of high in the east and low in the west. Low aggregation and obvious spatial dispersion among the provinces/municipalities were also observed. The geographic distribution of hot and cold spots of online attention to vaccines has clear boundaries. The hot spots are mainly distributed in the central-eastern provinces and the cold spots are in the western provinces.

According to the Gensini scores, these patients were also assigned into three groups: the low-risk group, middle-risk group, and high-risk group. 150 patients without AMI confirmed by coronary angiography were included in the control group in the same period. TET-2 and cardiac troponin T (cTNT) levels were detected by ELISA analysis and compared among different groups. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlations of TET-2 levels and cTNT levels/Gensini scores. The levels of TET-2 in AMI patients increased remarkably with the increase of disease severity. Patients in the single lesion group or low-risk group had the lowest levels of TET-2. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that TET-2 levels were positively associated with cTNT levels and Gensini scores, respectively (all P < 0.001). The levels of TET-2 were upregulated in AMI patients and positively correlated with cTNT levels or Gensini scores, suggesting that the examination of TET-2 expression levels could be exploited for predicting the disease severity.","misc","wim"

This study aimed to explore how the addition of RhoA recombinant protein affected the viability and subcellular structure of rooster sperm after freeze-thawing and elucidated the molecular mechanisms of sperm cryopreservation. Semen quality and acrosome integrity testing revealed that the addition of 0.5 μg/mL RhoA recombinant protein to the cryoprotectant fluid significantly increased sperm motility, survival rate, linearity, straight-line velocity, and acrosome integrity after freeze-thawing (P < 0.05). Ultrastructure analysis of cryopreserved sperm showed structural damage to the sperm plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, and tail. However, compared to the control, these structural changes were reduced upon the addition of RhoA recombinant protein to the cryoprotective fluid (P < 0.05). Western blotting revealed that the expression of Rho/RhoA-associated kinase and p-cofilin was increased, and cofilin expression was decreased after sperm cryopreservation with recombinant RhoA protein. Treatment with Y-27632, a ROCK antagonist, suppressed ROCK and p-cofilin expression and decreased semen quality, acrosome integrity, and ultrastructure integrity. In summary, we have demonstrated a cryoprotective effect in spermatozoa involving the Rho/ROCK pathway during freeze-thawing. Furthermore, the addition of 0.5 μg/mL RhoA recombinant protein to the cryoprotective fluid improved rooster semen quality and subcellular structural homeostasis after freeze-thawing via the Rho/ROCK pathway.

Foot lift and preening activities were recorded for 45 minutes following injection of formalin and scored by an investigator blinded to the treatment. An open field test was used to evaluate motor activity. Treatments included SC saline, SC morphine (1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg kg-1) and oral ibuprofen (5 and 10 mg kg-1). The treatment effect was analyzed by one-way anova and the time course effect analyzed using repeated measures anova, both followed by Dunnett's post hoc test (p < 0.05). All formalin concentrations induced significant foot lifting activity in the first phase (0-5 minutes), whereas only 0.6% and 0.9% formalin elicited responses in both the first and second (25-45 minutes) phases. Neither morphine nor ibuprofen affected phase 1 of the formalin test. Morphine (2.5 and 5 mg kg-1) and ibuprofen (5 and 10 mg kg-1) significantly reduced foot lift responses. Preening activity was significantly decreased following injection of 0.6% and 0.9% formalin. Preening was normalized with ibuprofen, but not with morphine. Morphine, but not ibuprofen, reduced quail activity. These results suggest that the formalin test was a reliable method for assessing tonic pain behavior in quail. The acute phase of the formalin test was not affected by morphine or ibuprofen. Although ibuprofen reduced the pain response in phase 2, the analgesic effects of morphine were not conclusive because morphine appeared to induce sedation.","misc","wim"

LPP2 increases cell growth and LPP2 expression is elevated in a variety of malignancies, implying that LPP2 is a pro-tumorigenic factor. Methods: LPP2 expression in human breast tumors and normal breast tissue was measured by qPCR. To understand the role of LPP2, we knocked out its expression in multiple cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9. Cell proliferation and migration were compared between wild type and LPP2 knockout cells. Cell cycle was measured by flow cytometry, and cell cycle proteins were determined by western blotting. Effects of LPP2 on tumor growth were investigated using syngeneic and xenograft mouse breast cancer models. Results: LPP2 mRNA levels were higher in ER/PR positive, ER/HER2 positive, and triple negative human breast tumors, relative to normal breast tissue. Higher levels of LPP2 in breast tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and melanomas were prognostic of poorer survival. LPP2 mRNA expression is also increased in Hs-578T, MDA-MB-231, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell lines, relative to non-malignant Hs-578Bst, MCF10A and MCF-12A cells. LPP2 knockout in breast cancer cells decreased cell growth by inhibiting G1/S transition, whereas, increasing LPP2 levels in Hs-578Bst and MCF10A cells promoted proliferation. The effects of LPP2 on cell cycle were associated with changes in cyclin A2, cyclin B1, and cell cycle inhibitors, p27 or p21. The level of c-Myc was downregulated by knocking out LPP2, and it was partly restored by re-expressing LPP2. The positive correlation between the expression of LPP2 and c-Myc exists in multiple cancer cell lines including breast, lung, upper aerodigestive tract and urinary tract cancer. LPP2 knockout in MDA-MB-231 or 4T1 cells suppressed tumor formation in mouse breast cancer models, and decreased the in vivo expression of Ki67 and c-Myc of the cancer cells.

The study included 19 patients with frontal sinus fungal osteomyelitis. The main line of treatment was surgical debridement (sequestrectomy). Approaches included combined external and endoscopic approaches (n = 15) and pure endoscopic approaches (n = 4) according to the extent and accessibility of the sequestrum. Postoperative healing was satisfactory in all patients. All patients returned to their normal daily activity within 4-6 weeks, without residual or recurrent frontal sinus infection, osteomyelitis or need for revision procedures. Within the limitation of this case series, it seems that there is no need to adopt a new therapy regimen for treatment of frontal sinus fungal osteomyelitis because the conventional and well-known treatment approach combining surgery and antifungal drugs seems to work well. However, early, and adequate debridement and sequestrectomy is crucial. Furthermore, an open approach may be required according to the extent of osteomyelitis.","misc","wim"
"611",35957010,"Improving Output Efficiency of InGaN-Based MQW Green Laser Diodes by Modulating Indium Content of Quantum Barriers and Using Composite Lower Waveguide Layers.","Potential barriers between the waveguide layer and MQW active region may influence injection efficiency significantly, which is important in improving output characteristics of GaN-based green laser diodes (LDs). In this study, potential barriers and injection efficiency of LDs are investigated by simulation methods. It is found that different indium content in quantum barrier layers results in different potential barrier heights, leading to different recombination rates in upper and lower waveguide layers, and the injection efficiency can be modulated effectively. An eclectic choice of indium content can suppress recombination in two waveguide layers, improving the output characteristics of green LDs. Additionally, a composite lower waveguide layer structure is proposed to reduce the negative effect of potential barriers. High output power and low threshold current are achieved owing to the reduction in electron injection blockage and hole leakage effects.","misc","wim"

Most common sites of extramedullary dissemination reported in the literature are skin, liver, kidneys and central nervous system. Multiple Myeloma is rarely associated with lung plasmacytoma. In fact; dissemination of MM in lung is relatively uncommon being described in only 5% of cases and therefore the diagnosis of this entity can be misleading to most clinicians. We report a rare case of lung plasmacytoma with MM in a 65-year-old, smoker, male who presented with shortness of breath and a heterogeneous mass involving the lower left lobe visualized on CT scan. Careful integration of the clinical manifestations with the radiological and pathological data from CT-guided transparietal lung biopsy and bone marrow biopsy led to the diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma with lung plasmacytoma. Given the rarity of this localization, the purpose of this study was to increase knowledge of this disease among pulmonologists, in order to provide more timely diagnosis.","misc","wim"

However, little is known about depressive symptoms in the population with low back pain in China. Our study evaluated the prevalence of depressive symptoms and analyzed the factors associated with this condition in the Chinese population with low back pain. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2018 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. We collected low back pain information for each participant and identified depressive symptoms using the brief version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. A wide range of sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of the subjects were extracted. We measured the prevalence of depressive symptoms comorbid with low back pain and analyzed the associated factors by multiple logistic regression. A total of 5,779 respondents aged 45 and over with low back pain formed the sample, 41.8% of whom reported depressive symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated greater vulnerability to depressive symptoms among females (OR = 1.41, 95% CI, 1.16-1.73), relatively younger persons (60-74 years: OR = 0.72, 95% CI, 0.63-0.83; ≥ 75 years: OR = 0.62, 95% CI, 0.49-0.79, reference: 45-59 years), those from the central and western regions (central: OR = 1.39, 95% CI, 1.18-1.64; western: OR = 1.56, 95% CI, 1.33-1.83), participants with extremely short sleep duration (OR = 2.74, 95% CI, 2.33-3.23), those with poor self-perceived health status (OR = 2.91, 95% CI, 2.34-3.63,), multisite pain (OR = 1.54, 95% CI, 1.20-1.98) and disability in activities of daily living (Basic: OR = 1.70, 95% CI, 1.47-1.98; Instrumental: OR = 1.95, 95% CI, 1.70-2.24).

The effect of melatonin application on enhancing plant stress tolerance has been widely reported, but the ameliorative effect of exogenous melatonin treatment on plants exposed to ionization stress is still unknown. This study investigated the ameliorative effects of two types of melatonin treatment, pre-sowing priming (prMel) and application during growth (ptMel), in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings exposed to different radiation doses (100, 200, 300 and 400 Gy) of radioactive cobalt (60Co) gamma rays as dry seeds. The growth parameters, photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll fluorescence, osmotic potential with soluble sugars, fructans and proline contents were then examined. The results indicated that high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) led to decreases in plant growth, pigment contents, chlorophyll fluorescence ratios and osmotic potential. However, soluble sugar, fructan and proline contents increased under IR stress conditions. Both melatonin applications, but particularly prMel, enhanced the morphological parameters, preserved the photosynthetic machinery and regulated the osmotic adjustment of IR-stressed wheat seedlings. Taken together, the findings show that exogenously applied melatonin, particularly prMel, play a significant role in alleviating IR stress in wheat seedlings.","misc","wim"

In this work, the authors present the results of the experimentally conducted thermal characterization of a prototype installation of the bearing. A novel method of temperature identification, based on integrated thermocouples readings, has been employed to determine the thermal properties of the specialized sensing top foil mounted in the tested bearing. Two measurement campaigns have been subsequently completed, applying freely-suspended and two-node support configurations, to gather complementary knowledge regarding the bearing's operation. Apart from the rotational speed and temperature field measurements, the authors have also studied the friction torque and the shaft's journal trajectories based on its radial displacements. The temporal courses for the above-mentioned quantities have enabled inference on the effects present during run-up, run-out and stable state operation at a constant speed. As confirmed, the applied distribution of the integrated sensors allows for temperature readings on the entire outer surface of the foil, and therefore, provides useful data for the bearing characterization. The work is concluded with presentation of the recommended directions regarding future improvements of the proposed measurement technique and more comprehensive study of the bearing's characteristics.","misc","wim"

Early detection of these conditions is essential to maintaining a patient's quality of life. The fundus photography technique is non-invasive, safe, and rapid way of assessing the function of the retina. It is widely used as a diagnostic tool for patients who suffer from fundus-related diseases. Using fundus images to analyze these two diseases is a challenging exercise, since there are rarely obvious features in the images during the incipient stages of the disease. In order to deal with these issues, we have proposed a deep learning method called FunSwin. The Swin Transformer constitutes the main framework for this method. Additionally, due to the characteristics of medical images, such as their small number and relatively fixed structure, transfer learning strategy that are able to increase the low-level characteristics of the model as well as data enhancement strategy to balance the data are integrated. Experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in both binary and multiclass classification tasks on the benchmark dataset.","misc","wim"

However, little research analyzing these variables focuses on the preschool education stage. Thus, the objective of this research is to study the relationship between PA, fatness and fitness in 3-6 years old boys and girls. This cross-sectional study includes 150 boys and girls at age between 3 and 6 years. Fatness and fitness were assessed using a PREFIT (FITness testing in PREschool children) battery as well as the sit and reach test. PA levels were measured using accelerometers for 7 days. Higher PA levels were related to better fitness values. In addition, differences were found in the PA levels between boys and girls. However, PA subcomponents were not related to fatness. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in fitness tests between underweight, normal-weight and over-weight children, except in handgrip strength. The few studies that have analyzed the relationship between fatness, fitness and PA in preschool have revealed controversial results. However, our study is in accordance with the majority of studies which prove that PA is associated with better fitness performances in preschool children. Since fitness is an important indicator of health, schools and parents should encourage children to practice more daily PA, especially girls, who are less active than boys. However, the discrepancy about the relationship between PA and fatness between the results of the different research highlights the necessity of carrying out further studies that analyze the relationship between these 3 variables separately in each age group (3, 4, 5 and 6 years). This is due to the fact that associations were stronger in older children rather than in younger children.","misc","wim"
"1553",35959106,"LncRNA-84277 is involved in chronic pain-related depressive behaviors through miR-128-3p/SIRT1 axis in central amygdala.","Long-term chronic pain can lead to depression. However, the mechanism underlying chronic pain-related depression remains unclear. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC). Our previous studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is involved in the development of chronic pain-related depression. In addition, increasing studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a vital role in the pathogenesis of pain or depression. However, whether lncRNAs are involved in SIRT1-mediated chronic pain-related depression remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified that a novel lncRNA-84277 in CeA was the upstream molecule to regulate SIRT1 expression. Functionally, lncRNA-84277 overexpression in CeA significantly alleviated the depression-like behaviors in spared nerve injury (SNI)-induced chronic pain rats, whereas lncRNA-84277 knockdown in CeA induced the depression-like behaviors in naïve rats. Mechanically, lncRNA-84277 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to upregulate SIRT1 expression by competitively sponging miR-128-3p, and therefore improved chronic pain-related depression-like behaviors. Our findings reveal the critical role of lncRNA-84277 in CeA specifically in guarding against chronic pain-related depression via a ceRNA mechanism and provide a potential therapeutic target for chronic pain-related depression.","misc","wim"

While the demographic factors that are associated with OA diagnosis are well established, the factors that are associated with joint supplement use are not as well studied. Using data collected from the Dog Aging Project, we analyzed owner survey responses regarding joint supplement administration and OA diagnosis for 26,951 adult dogs. In this cross-sectional analysis, logistic regression models and odds-ratios (OR) were employed to determine demographic factors of dogs and their owners that were associated with joint supplement administration. Forty percent of adult dogs in our population were given some type of joint supplement. Perhaps not surprisingly, dogs of older age, larger size, and those that were ever overweight were more likely to receive a joint supplement. Younger owner age, urban living, owner education, and feeding commercial dry food were associated with a reduced likelihood of administration of joint supplements to dogs. Interestingly, mixed breed dogs were also less likely to be administered a joint supplement (OR: 0.73). Dogs with a clinical diagnosis of OA were more likely to receive a joint supplement than those without a reported OA diagnosis (OR: 3.82). Neutered dogs were more likely to have a diagnosis of OA, even after controlling for other demographic factors, yet their prevalence of joint supplement administration was the same as intact dogs. Overall, joint supplement use appears to be high in our large population of dogs in the United States. Prospective studies are needed to determine if joint supplements are more commonly administered as a preventative for OA or after an OA clinical diagnosis.","misc","wim"

The second half-day workshop was held a year after the first workshop to review how faculty members have modified their syllabus to integrate climate change information with varying degrees of success. A case study is presented regarding an asynchronous fully online course Introduction to Global Health, which is open to enrollment by students from all campuses of the University of California. The outcomes revealed preferential adoption of models of curriculum integration which minimized disruption of the sequence of topics in pre-existing courses. These include, for example, the use of longitudinal climate datasets for quantitative analysis of disease outcomes, and description of episodic events involving extreme weather conditions to explore differences in social determinants of vulnerability to climate change impacts in different populations. Integration of climate change as a distinct topic seems easier in elective courses in comparison with required courses designed to cover pre-established professional knowledge, competencies, and skills.

Despite a widespread distribution on the Italian territory, a large presence of health personnel and a long-standing experience in vaccinations, addiction clinics have yet to be involved in the vaccination campaign against COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the beliefs of drug users attending some Italian addiction clinics, in order to envisage any vaccine administration strategies involving the services themselves. A questionnaire used for the Italian general population to investigate the relative importance of some factors in influencing the propensity to vaccinate against COVID-19, was administrated to drug users in a multicenter survey. The majority of respondents expressed general confidence in vaccines and a good willingness to undergo vaccination. Given strong peer networks, high coverage of treatment and harm reduction interventions, Italian public addiction clinics could play a strategic role in administering the vaccine in this hard-to-reach population, usefully aiding the global campaign against the virus.","misc","wim"

Necroptosis is a programmed cell death mode mediated by three major mediators, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, and has been shown to play a role in various cancers. To date, the effect of necroptosis on NSCLC remains unclear. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, we downloaded transcriptomes of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and their corresponding clinicopathological parameters. We performed multi-omics analysis using consensus clustering based on the expression levels of 40 necroptosis-related genes. We constructed prognostic risk models and used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, nomograms, and survival analysis to evaluate prognostic models. With the use of consensus clustering analysis, two distinct subtypes of necroptosis were identified based on different mRNA expression levels, and cluster B was found to have a better survival advantage. Correlation results showed that necroptosis was significantly linked with clinical features, overall survival (OS) rate, and immune infiltration. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis confirmed that these differential genes were valuable in various cellular and biological functions and were significantly enriched in various pathways such as the P53 signaling pathway and cell cycle. We further identified three genomic subtypes and found that gene cluster B patients had better prognostic value. Multivariate Cox analysis identified the 14 best prognostic genes for constructing prognostic risk models. The high-risk group was found to have a poor prognosis. The construction of nomograms and ROC curves showed stable validity in prognostic prediction. There were also significant differences in tumor immune microenvironment, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and drug sensitivity between the two risk groups. The results demonstrate that the 14 genes constructed in this prognostic risk model were used as tumor prognostic biomarkers to guide immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Finally, we used qRT-PCR to validate the genes involved in the signature. This study promotes our new understanding of necroptosis in the tumor microenvironment of NSCLC, mines prognostic biomarkers, and provides a potential value for guiding immunotherapy and chemotherapy.","misc","wim"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of some miRNAs in visceral and subcutaneous AT in patients undergoing adrenalectomy for aldosterone-secreting adrenal adenoma (APA) compared to the samples of AT obtained in patients undergoing adrenalectomy for non-functioning adrenal mass (NFA). The quantitative expression of selected miRNA using real-time PCR was analyzed in surrounding adrenal neoplasia, peri-renal, and subcutaneous AT samples of 16 patients with adrenalectomy (11 patients with APA and 5 patients with NFA). Real-time PCR cycles for miRNA-132, miRNA-143, and miRNA-221 in fat surrounding adrenal neoplasia and in peri-adrenal AT were significantly higher in APA than in patients with NFA. Unlike patients with NFA, miRNA-132, miRNA-143, miRNA-221, and miRNA-26b were less expressed in surrounding adrenal neoplasia AT compared to subcutaneous AT in patients with APA. This study, conducted on tissue expression of miRNAs, highlights the possible pathophysiological role of some miRNAs in determining the metabolic alterations in patients with PA.","misc","wim"

The cave system was chosen as the sampling site due to its touristic use and the presence of high-impact illuminations. The biofilms and the mats of the illuminated walls were sampled. Samples were investigated by 16S rRNA gene analysis and culturable cyanobacteria isolation. The isolated strains were then screened for the production of PHAs under typical culturing and nutritional starvation. Cultures were checked for PHA accumulation, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) presence (infrared spectroscopy), and pigment production. The 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. Highlighted a considerable extent of the pressure exerted by anthropogenic activities. However, the isolation yielded eleven cyanobacteria isolates with good PHA (mainly PHB)-producing abilities and interesting pigment production rates (chlorophyll a and carotenoids). Under normal conditions (BG110), the accumulation abilities ranged from 266 to 1,152 ng mg dry biomass-1. The optimization of bioprocesses through nutritional starvation resulted in a 2.5-fold increase. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies established the occurrence of PHB within PHAs extracted by cyanobacteria isolates. The comparison of results with standard strains underlined good production rates. For C2 and C8 strains, PHA accumulation rates under starvation were higher than Azospirillum brasilense and similar to Synechocystis cf. salina 192. This study broadened the knowledge of the microbial communities of mats and biofilms on the lightened walls of the caves.

The assays including CCK-8, transwell, and flow cytometry were performed to reveal the functions of miR-762 in GC. The target genes of miR-762 were searched by online databases, and then were verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Western blot was performed to investigate the activation of PI3K/AKT and Hippo pathways in GC. MiR-762 was aberrantly upregulated in the tumor tissues and cell lines, and miR-762 silencing could effectively reduce the viability and promote apoptosis of GC cell lines. The study identified LZTS1 as a target gene of miR-762. It was also found that the effects of miR-762 on GC cells could be reversed by LZTS1, and miR-762 could upregulate the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway but inhibit the Hippo pathway by targeting LZTS1.

Quantitative radiomic features from the intratumoral and peritumoral regions were extracted for model training. The performance of the model was evaluated using data (n = 50) from the third clinical center. When combining the intratumoral and peritumoral features, the Adaboost model achieved the best area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 and accuracy of 76.9% in the test cohort. Based on the optimal features and classifier, the model in the binary classification diagnosis achieves AUC of 0.98 (glioblastoma and lymphoma), 0.86 (lymphoma and metastases), and 0.70 (glioblastoma and metastases) in the test cohort, respectively.

We used harmonised data from >26,000 pregnant women enrolled in the ALSPAC, EDEN, Generation R, Lifeways, REPRO_PL, ROLO and SWS cohorts, as part of the ALPHABET consortium. Maternal dietary quality and inflammatory potential were assessed using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and the energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII). We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis to investigate the maternal sociodemographic, health and behavioural predictors of maternal diet before and during pregnancy.

"2149",35957061,"The 3D Printing Behavior of Photocurable Ceramic/Polymer Composite Slurries Prepared with Different Particle Sizes.","Ceramic polymer composite slurries were prepared using nano- and micro-sized Al2O3 in order to analyze rheological properties, sedimentation, and curing behavior. Slurries with different Al2O3 particle sizes were prepared with varying concentrations of photoinitiator, and subjected to different exposure times to prepare a printing object. All slurries exhibit shear-thinning behavior, and the viscosity increases with decreasing Al2O3 particle size. The 100 nm Al2O3 slurry is confirmed to be more sol-like, while the 500 nm and 2 μm Al2O3 slurries have a gel-like structure. As the Al2O3 particle size increases, a thick sedimentation layer forms due to rapid settling, but as the distance between particles increases, the UV light scattering reduces, and the curing rate increases. The exposure time range viable for printing, and the dimension conformity of the printed specimen with the design file, is improved by increasing the Al2O3 particle size. In the case of 500 nm and 2 μm Al2O3 slurries, the maximum heat flow, curing enthalpy, and conversion rate are high with respect to photoinitiator concentration, in the order of 1.0 &gt; 0.1 &gt; 3.0 wt.%. When the photoinitiator concentration exceeds 1 wt.%, it appears to affect the reactivity of the slurry.","misc","wim"
"1261",35957989,"Biochemical, biophysical, and functional characterisation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C regulator CDC20 from Arabidopsis thaliana.","The Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C), a large cullin-RING E3-type ubiquitin ligase, constitutes the ultimate target of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC), an intricate regulatory circuit that ensures the high fidelity of chromosome segregation in eukaryotic organisms by delaying the onset of anaphase until each chromosome is properly bi-oriented on the mitotic spindle. Cell-division cycle protein 20 homologue (CDC20) is a key regulator of APC/C function in mitosis. The formation of the APC/CCDC20 complex is required for the ubiquitination and degradation of select substrates, which is necessary to maintain the mitotic state. In contrast to the roles of CDC20 in animal species, little is known about CDC20 roles in the regulation of chromosome segregation in plants. Here we address this gap in knowledge and report the expression in insect cells; the biochemical and biophysical characterisation of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCDC20) WD40 domain; and the nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of full-length AtCDC20 when transiently expressed in tobacco plants. We also show that most AtCDC20 degrons share a high sequence similarity to other eukaryotes, arguing in favour of conserved degron functions in AtCDC20. However, important exceptions were noted such as the lack of a canonical MAD1 binding motif; a fully conserved RRY-box in all six AtCDC20 isoforms instead of a CRY-box motif, and low conservation of key residues known to be phosphorylated by BUB1 and PLK1 in other species to ensure a robust SAC response. Taken together, our studies provide insights into AtCDC20 structure and function and the evolution of SAC signalling in plants.","misc","wim"

Examination revealed bilateral conjunctival injection, mildly purulent discharge, and the presence of large follicle-like lesions involving the bilateral superior and inferior palpebral conjunctiva. Conjunctival cultures grew Corynebacterium species. The patient was treated with topical antibiotics and steroids which improved the conjunctival injection and discharge, but the follicle-like lesions persisted. A conjunctival biopsy was performed and was consistent with the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Fundoscopic exam did not demonstrate posterior uveal or retinal involvement. She was referred to her oncologist for further evaluation and management. Marked clinical improvement was noted after starting treatment with ibrutinib. This case demonstrates a rare ocular manifestation of the most common form of leukemia.

The goal of the current analysis was to examine associations between meal duration, rate of eating, and body mass index (BMI) and to assess the variance of meal duration and eating rate across different meals during the day. Using an observational cross-sectional study design, non-smoking participants aged 18-45 years (N = 29) consumed all meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) on a single day in a pseudo free-living environment. Participants were allowed to choose any food and beverages from a University food court and consume their desired amount with no time restrictions. Weighed food records and a log of meal start and end times, to calculate duration, were obtained by a trained research assistant. Spearman's correlations and multiple linear regressions examined associations between BMI and meal duration and rate of eating. Participants were 65% male and 48% white. A shorter meal duration was associated with a higher BMI at breakfast but not lunch or dinner, after adjusting for age and sex (p = 0.03). Faster rate of eating was associated with higher BMI across all meals (p = 0.04) and higher energy intake for all meals (p < 0.001). Intra-individual rates of eating were not significantly different across breakfast, lunch, and dinner (p = 0.96). Shorter beakfast and a faster rate of eating across all meals were associated with higher BMI in a pseudo free-living environment. An individual's rate of eating is constant over all meals in a day. These data support weight reduction interventions focusing on the rate of eating at all meals throughout the day and provide evidence for specifically directing attention to breakfast eating behaviors.","misc","wim"

A total of 1309 patients with adrenal lesions were treated in the affiliated hospital of Guizhou Medical University for 15 years, of which only 8 cases were diagnosed as AS, accounting for 0.61%. Among the eight patients with AS, there were five females and three males, with an average age of 48.63 ± 12.05 years, and the average maximum diameter of the tumor was 6.96 ± 1.83 cm. All patients underwent adrenalectomy and were pathologically diagnosed as AS after the operation. The average follow-up time of eight patients with AS was 60.13 ± 22.33 months, and there was no recurrence or metastasis. The retroperitoneum is an uncommon site for schwannoma tumors, and among adrenal incidentalomas, the schwannoma is rare. The disease lacks specific clinical and imaging features, but correct diagnosis before the pathological examination is very important for clinical management and surgical decision. When imaging examination indicates a slow-growing retroperitoneal mass, schwannoma should be considered. Surgical resection is the main treatment. Pathology is the gold standard for diagnosis. Most of the tumors are benign and have a good prognosis. There is a risk of recurrence after the operation, and it should be monitored actively.","misc","wim"
"1820",35958667,"Transition between individually different and common features in skilled drumming movements.","Why do professional athletes and musicians exhibit individually different motion patterns? For example, baseball pitchers generate various pitching forms, e.g., variable wind-up, cocking, and follow-through forms. However, they commonly rotate their wrists and fingers at increasingly high speeds via shoulder and trunk motions. Despite the universality of common and individually different motion patterns in skilled movements, the abovementioned question remains unanswered. Here, we focus on a motion required to hit a snare drum, including the indirect phase of task achievement (i.e., the early movement and mid-flight phases) and the direct phase of task achievement (i.e., the hit phase). We apply tensor decomposition to collected kinematic data for the drum-hitting motion, enabling us to decompose high-dimensional and time-varying motion data into individually different and common movement patterns. As a result, individually different motion patterns emerge during the indirect phase of task achievement, and common motion patterns are evident in the direct phase of task achievement. Athletes and musicians are thus possibly allowed to perform individually different motion patterns during the indirect phase of task achievement. Additionally, they are required to exhibit common patterns during the direct phase of task achievement.","misc","wim"

While conventional in vitro cell cultures under-represent the complexity and dynamic crosstalk of the tumor microenvironment, animal models do not allow deciphering the anti-tumor activity of the human immune system. Therefore, the development of reliable and predictive preclinical models has become crucial for the screening of immune-therapeutic approaches. We here present an organ-on-chip organ on chips (OOC)-based approach for recapitulating the immune cell Natural Killer (NK) migration under physiological fluid flow, infiltration within a 3D tumor matrix, and activation against neuroblastoma cancer cells in a humanized, fluid-dynamic environment. Circulating NK cells actively initiate a spontaneous extravasation process toward the physically separated tumor niche, retaining their ability to interact with matrix-embedded tumor cells, and to display a cytotoxic effect (tumor cell apoptosis). Since NK cells infiltration and phenotype is correlated with prognosis and response to immunotherapy, their phenotype is also investigated: most importantly, a clear decrease in CD16-positive NK cells within the migrated and infiltrated population is observed. The proposed immune-tumor OOC-based model represents a promising approach for faithfully recapitulating the human pathology and efficiently employing the immunotherapies testing, eventually in a personalized perspective.

However, in experiments, decays of these correlators suffer from fake positive signals from various sources, e.g., decoherence due to inevitable couplings to the environment, or errors that cause mismatches between the purported forward and backward evolutions. In this Letter, we provide a simple and robust approach to single out the effect of genuine scrambling. This allows us to benchmark the scrambling process by quantifying the degree of the scrambling from the noisy backgrounds.

Leading public health agencies, including the World Health Organization, have recognized the strong association between SB and poor health outcomes, particularly cardiovascular disease. However, while public health agencies have begun to advocate for reductions in SB, the current US guidelines are typically vague and non-specific. There is good reasoning behind this non-committal advocacy-there is limited mechanistic and clinical evidence to support policy development. To guide SB policy development, it is important to first consider the origins and evolution of SB, including the following: 1) is SB really a novel/contemporary behavior? i.e., how has this behavior evolved? 2) how did our ancestors sit and in what contexts? 3) how does SB interact with 24-hour activity behaviors, including physical activity and sleep? 4) what other historical and contemporary facets of life interact with SB? and 5) in what context do these behaviors occur and how might they provide different evolutionarily novel stressors? This perspective article will synthesize the available evidence that addresses these questions and stimulate discussion pertaining to the lessons that we can learn from an historical and evolutionary perspective. Last, it will outline the gaps in current SB interruption literature that are hindering development of feasible SB reduction policy.","misc","wim"

CPP is often used as a surrogate measure for cerebral blood flow (CBF); however, this view fails to account for changes in cerebral vascular resistance (CVR). Changes in CVR occur due to cerebral autoregulation, which has classically been taught on a sigma shaped curve with a decline and increase at either end of a plateau. Historically, the conceptualized regulation maintains careful homeostatic levels despite external or internal dynamic changes; however, moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been postulated to bring about cerebral autoregulation dysfunction. We review the current application of CPP is limited by the dynamic changes in cerebral autoregulation after TBI.

A retrospective cohort study of 11,549 pregnant women attending a district specialized hospital and who had serum folate (SF) and serum vitamin B12 (SVB12) levels measured at delivery was performed. The levels of SF, SVB12, and SFVB12R were defined as high (>95th percentile), normal (5-95th percentile), and low (<5th percentile). Information on pregnancy outcomes was retrieved from medical records. Linear regression was performed to examine the association of abnormal SF, SVB12, and SFVB12R levels with fetal growth indicators. Logistic regression was applied to estimate the association between abnormal SF, SVB12, and SFVB12R levels and pregnancy outcomes. Lower SF levels were associated with higher risks of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP, OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.15-2.17), pre-eclampsia (PE, OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.28-2.81), and a lower risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM, OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.23-0.70), whereas higher SVB12 levels were associated with a higher risk of ICP (OR 2.22; 95% CI 1.67-2.96), PE (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.04-2.74), and GDM (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.24-2.11).

In this study, it was aimed to compare the broth microdilution method which is the reference method with the colistin broth disc elution and rapid resapolymyxin NP tests for the determination of the susceptibility of colistin in Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Enterobacterales species which are common healthcare-associated infection agents.Colistin susceptibility of a total of 157 isolates isolated from patients hospitalized in Ankara City Hospital [Klebsiella pneumoniae (n= 74), Acinetobacter spp. (n= 33), Escherichia coli (n= 26), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 24)] were tested by broth microdilution, colistin broth disc elution and rapid resapolymixin NP methods. The categorical and basic agreement was evaluated by comparing the broth microdilution results with the rapid resapolymyxin NP results and the colistin broth disc elution. When compared with broth microdilution, the categorical agreement of colistin broth disc elution test for Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas species was found to be 93%, 48%, 100%, respectively. When the essential agreement was evaluated the values of 95%, 45%, 100% were found, respectively. Very major error rates were found to be 10%, 70% and 0%, respectively. The categorical agreement of the rapid resapolymyxin test for Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas species was 85%, 36%, 100%, while very major error rates were found to be 10%, 88% and 0%, respectively. When compared with the reference method, both tests showed high categorical and essential agreements for P.aeruginosa. Accepted level of categorical and essential agreement was found in colistin broth disc elution method for Enterobacterales species, and low categorical agreement was found in rapid resapolymyxin NP test. For Acinetobacter species, both tests detected low categorical agreement and high rate of very major error.

In this retrospective observational study, the relationship between viral clearance duration in Rt-PCR and gender, age, CT results, comorbidities and laboratory results in nasopharyngeal swab samples was investigated and it was determined that the duration of VC was significantly prolonged in case of female gender, being over 50 years old and having a comorbid disease. The results obtained may contribute to predict the isolation times of the patients and to reveal the factors that may affect viral shedding.","misc","wim"

The relations between structure, dynamics and hydrogen bonds of interfacial water can be investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Contact angles at the alumina (0001) and (112‾0) surfaces are studied using both classical molecular dynamics simulations and experiments. To test the superhydrophilicity, the free energy cost of removing waters near the interfaces are calculated using the density fluctuations method. The strength of hydrogen bonds is determined by their lifetime and geometry. Both surfaces are superhydrophilic and the (0001) surface is more hydrophilic. Interactions between surfaces and interfacial waters promote a templating effect whereby the latter are aligned in a pattern that follows the underlying lattice of the surfaces. Translational and rotational dynamics of interfacial water molecules are slower than in bulk water. Hydrogen bonds between water and both surfaces are asymmetric, water-to-aluminol ones are stronger than aluminol-to-water ones. Molecular dynamics simulations eliminate the impacts of surface contamination when measuring contact angles and the results reveal the microscopic origin of the macroscopic superhydrophilicity of alumina surfaces: strong water-to-aluminol hydrogen bonds.","misc","wim"
"2176",35957229,"PLC-Based Integrated Refractive Index Sensor Probe with Partially Exposed Waveguide.","This paper proposes a simple, high-efficiency refractive index (RI) sensor, with a structure based on the planar lightwave circuit (PLC) probe type. The optical sensor has a 1 × 2 splitter structure with reference and sensing channels, each consisting of a U-shaped waveguide structure that is configured by connecting C bends. This design allows for the sensor device to have a probe structure wherein the surface interconnected with activity devices (i.e., an optical source and optical detector) is placed on one side. The reference channel is bent with a minimum optical loss, and the sensing channel has a bent structure, involving a C-bend waveguide with a maximum loss. The C-bend waveguide with a maximum loss is conformally aligned to have a trench structure with the same bending radius, designed to selectively expose the sidewall of the core layer. The local index contrast varies depending on the material in contact with the trench, resulting in a change in the optical output power of the waveguide. The sensitivity of the proposed sensor was 0 and 2070 μW/refractive index unit (RIU) for the reference and sensing channels, respectively, as the RI changed from 1.385 to 1.445 at a 1550 nm wavelength. These results suggest that the proposed structure enables efficient RI measurement through the use of a simple dip-type method.","misc","wim"

In solid-state materials, fractional quantum Hall phases continue to attract attention as hosts of emergent geometrical excitations analogous to gravitons, resulting from the nonperturbative interactions between the electrons. However, the direct observation of such excitations remains a challenge. Here, we identify a quasi-one-dimensional model that captures the geometric properties and graviton dynamics of fractional quantum Hall states. We then simulate geometric quench and the subsequent graviton dynamics on the IBM quantum computer using an optimally compiled Trotter circuit with bespoke error mitigation. Moreover, we develop an efficient, optimal-control-based variational quantum algorithm that can efficiently simulate graviton dynamics in larger systems. Our results open a new avenue for studying the emergence of gravitons in a new class of tractable models on the existing quantum hardware.","misc","wim"

A series of empirical literatures have also examined a significant positive correlation between the two. But these results only demonstrate the relationship between the input of 'diversity' and the output of 'firm performance'. Such research is more of a black box because board diversity must act on certain strategies or decisions to affect firm performance. Some scholars try theoretical analysis with the purpose of opening the black box. In order to verify the relevant theoretical analysis results, this study uses the mediating effect analysis model in the field of psychology, through multiple regression, impulse analysis, variance decomposition and other methods, to thus empirically test the mediating effect of technological innovation in the process of board diversification promoting corporate performance. We found that board diversity can improve firm performance by enhancing the level of technological innovation. Among them, technological innovation has played a complete mediating role in the diversity of board members' functional and occupational background, and played a partial mediating role in the diversification of directors' part-time jobs. Technological innovation is a key indicator bridging board diversity and firm performance. This study can explore and explain the inner workings of the significant relationship between board diversity and firm performance, and link research findings on similar phenomena. The research results may make the existing board governance theories more systematic, expand the extension of theoretical research, and provide some empirical research references for academics and practitioners.","misc","wim"

However, through the reform and opening up and the development of informatization in Chinese society, the traditional indoctrination teaching mode has become more and more inefficient and inactive show. In fact, the education of ideals and beliefs can only emit dazzling sparks when it collides with the experience world of learners. At present, the ideological and political education in colleges and universities should be fully connected with the reality of personal and social development. As far as ideological and political theory education is concerned, the central government has also issued relevant documents, mainly to strengthen the ideological and political education of college students. For this reason, it is necessary to further explore the deficiencies in the ideological and political theory education in colleges and universities, and make comprehensive improvements.

The archive materials of the Kaluga Regional Psychiatric Hospital for the period of 2017-2018 were studied. The allocated 435 cases of hospitalizations with suicidal behavior are allocated to admissions with suicidal ideation and hospitalizations with suicidal attempt and self-harm with specified suicidal intentions. The data obtained was processed using the Microsoft Excel software applying the Yule's coefficient of association and Pearson's contingency coefficient, Pearson's χ2 test and Student's t-test. The results of study established no differences in suicidal manifestations adjusted for gender, but allow to distinguish risk age intervals. Thus, mean age in the group of admission with suicidal ideation was in the range of 29.8-35.2 years and 36.0-41.4 years in the group of suicidal attempt. In the age cohort of 5-19 years, probability of admission with suicidal ideation was higher than with suicidal attempt and self-harm. On the contrary, in the age range of 25-44 years, admission with suicidal attempt and self-harm prevailed.

Within our configurations, each 2 × 2 supercell of this two-dimensional material can accommodate four Al atoms, and there exist chemical bonding and partial charge transfer between pyridinic nitrogen (N) and Al atoms. The doped Al atom loses electrons and tends to be electronically positive; moreover, a local electronic field can be formed around itself, inducing the adsorbed H2 molecules to be polarized. The polarized H2 molecules were found to be adsorbed by both the N and Al atoms, giving rise to the electrostatic attractions between the H2 molecules and the Al-doped g-CN surface. We found that each 2 × 2 supercell can adsorb at most, 24 H2 molecules, and the corresponding adsorption energies ranged from -0.11 to -0.31 eV. The highest hydrogen-storage capacity of the Al-doped g-CN can reach up to 6.15 wt%, surpassing the goal of 5.50 wt% proposed by the U.S. Department of Energy. Additionally, effective adsorption sites can be easily differentiated by the electronic potential distribution map of the optimized configurations. Such a composite material has been proven to possess a high potential for hydrogen storage, and we have good reasons to expect that in the future, more advanced materials can be developed based on this unit.","misc","wim"

However, the clinical outcome after STN-DBS is variable. The aim of this study was to explore the coherence of antagonistic muscles measured with electromyography (EMG) as novel biomarker of STN-DBS efficacy in PD. EMG of bilateral wrist and upper arm antagonistic muscles of 21 PD patients was recorded during three standardized motor tasks. Patients were measured one day prior to DBS surgery (pre-DBS) and 6 months afterwards (post-DBS). Coherence analyses were performed on the antagonistic muscle pairs. Pearson correlations between intermuscular coherence and clinical performance were calculated. Intermuscular coherence during each of the different co-contraction tasks significantly correlated to UPDRS-III bradykinesia scores (p < 0.01). In other words, higher intermuscular coherence is associated with more severe PD symptoms. Moreover, coherence changes (pre-DBS - post-DBS coherence) correlated to clinical score changes after DBS (p < 0.01) and pre-DBS coherence correlated to this clinical score change as well (p < 0.01). Higher pre-DBS coherence of antagonistic arm muscles is correlated to worsening of clinical PD state and higher intermuscular coherence predicts enhanced clinical improvement. We propose that pre-DBS intermuscular coherence could be developed into a predictor of STN-DBS clinical outcome. It could aid patient selection and adaptive stimulation algorithms for DBS.","misc","wim"

The viral strain isolated from diseased hybrid red tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) shared high levels of morphological and genomic similarity (95.49-99.52%) with other TiLV isolates in the GenBank database. TiLV segment 9 (Tis9) and segment 10 (Tis10) DNA vaccines (pcDNA-Tis9 and pcDNA-Tis10) and recombinant protein vaccines (Tis9 and Tis10) were prepared and tested for their efficacy in juvenile hybrid red tilapia. Fish were immunized with either single vaccines (pcDNA-Tis9, pcDNA-Tis10, Tis9 and Tis10) or combined vaccines (pcDNA-Tis9 + pcDNA-Tis10 and Tis9 + Tis10) by intramuscular injection and intraperitoneal injection for DNA and protein vaccines, respectively. Negative controls were injected with PBS or a naked pcDNA3.1 vector in the same manner. An experimental challenge with TiLV was carried out at 4 weeks post-vaccination (wpv) by intraperitoneal injection with a dose of 1 × 105 TCID50 per fish. Relative percent survival (RPS) ranged from 16.67 ± 00.00 to 61.11 ± 9.62%. The Tis10 and pcDNA-Tis10 vaccines conferred better protection compared to Tis9 and pcDNA-Tis9.

Almost 75% of FDA-approved drugs are mainly nitrogen- and sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds, implying the importance of such compounds in drug discovery. Among heterocycles, thiazole-based heterocyclic compounds have demonstrated a broad range of pharmacological activities. In the present study, a novel set of 1,3-thiazole derivatives was designed and synthesized based on the coupling of acetophenone derivatives, and phenacyl bromide was substituted as a key reaction step. The activity of synthesized compounds was screened against the proliferation of two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). Almost all compounds exhibited a considerable antiproliferative activity toward the breast cancer cells as compared to staurosporine, with no significant cytotoxicity toward the epithelial cells. Among the synthesized compounds, compound 4 exhibited the most potent antiproliferative activity, with an IC50 of 5.73 and 12.15 µM toward MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, compared to staurosporine (IC50 = 6.77 and 7.03 µM, respectively). Exploring the mechanistic insights responsible for the antiproliferative activity of compound 4 revealed that compound 4 possesses a significant inhibitory activity toward the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) with (IC50 = 0.093 µM) compared to Sorafenib (IC50 = 0.059 µM). Further, compound 4 showed the ability to induce programmed cell death by triggering apoptosis and necrosis in MCF-7 cells and to induce cell cycle arrest on MCF-7 cells at the G1 stage while decreasing the cellular population in the G2/M phase. Finally, detailed in silico molecular docking studies affirmed that this class of compounds possesses a considerable binding affinity toward VEGFR2 proteins. Overall, these results indicate that compound 4 could be a promising lead compound for developing potent anti-breast cancer compounds.","misc","wim"
"468",35959132,"Prediction of acute kidney injury in patients with femoral neck fracture utilizing machine learning.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication associated with significant morbidity and mortality in high-energy trauma patients. Given the poor efficacy of interventions after AKI development, it is important to predict AKI before its diagnosis. Therefore, this study aimed to develop models using machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of AKI in patients with femoral neck fractures. We developed machine-learning models using the Medical Information Mart from Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. AKI was predicted using 10 predictive models in three-time windows, 24, 48, and 72 h. Three optimal models were selected according to the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and the hyperparameters were adjusted using a random search algorithm. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis was used to determine the impact and importance of each feature on the prediction. Compact models were developed using important features chosen based on their SHAP values and clinical availability. Finally, we evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, AUROC, recall, F1 scores, and kappa values on the test set after hyperparameter tuning. A total of 1,596 patients in MIMIC-IV were included in the final cohort, and 402 (25%) patients developed AKI after surgery. The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) model showed the best overall performance for predicting AKI before 24, 48, and 72 h. AUROCs were 0.929, 0.862, and 0.904. The SHAP value was used to interpret the prediction models. Renal function markers and perioperative blood transfusions are the most critical features for predicting AKI. In compact models, LightGBM still performs the best. AUROCs were 0.930, 0.859, and 0.901. In our analysis, we discovered that LightGBM had the best metrics among all algorithms used. Our study identified the LightGBM as a solid first-choice algorithm for early AKI prediction in patients after femoral neck fracture surgery.","misc","wim"

Then, the Cobb angle, respiratory muscle strength (MIP and MEP), and pulmonary function (FVC, FEV1.0, and FEV1.0/FVC%) were measured before and after core stabilization training. After 12 weeks of core stabilization training, compared with the pretest, the Cobb angle showed a significant decrease, FVC, FEV1, MIP, and MEP a significant increase (P < 0.01 respectively), and there was no statistical difference in FEV1/FVC in the CST group; there was no significant difference (P > 0.05 respectively) before and after an experiment in the control group except MEP decreased significantly (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). After 12 weeks of core stabilization training, compared with the control group, the Cobb angle significantly decreased (P < 0.01), FVC, FEV1, MIP, and MEP significantly increased (P < 0.05 respectively) in the CST group, but there was no significant difference (P > 0.05, respectively) in FEV1/FVC between the control group and CST group. Core stabilization exercise can be considered to have a positive effect on the normal physiological curvature of the spine in AIS patients, as it decreases the Cobb angle and strengthens respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function.","misc","wim"

"2067",35958316,"Resting behavior of broilers reared with or without artificial brooders.","Rest and sleep are important for the welfare of mammals and birds. A large part of the daily time budget of broiler chickens is taken up by resting behavior and the quality of resting is important. However, in intensive broiler production systems, disruptions of resting behaviors are common. These disruptions of resting behavior could be negative for the health and growth of the birds. This study investigated if artificial brooders that provide a delimited and darker resting place, away from active birds, reduce disruptions of resting behavior compared to a control situation without artificial brooders. Six pens of each treatment were used in the same building, keeping 60 chickens (Ross 308) per pen. The artificial brooders were removed at 21 days of age. Data on disturbances and duration of resting bouts and activity between resting bouts were collected on 20 and 34 days of age. Also, as an indicator of the quality of rest, the animals' cognitive performance was evaluated in a spatial learning test that was performed at 11 days of age. The results showed that birds housed in pens with access to brooders have longer resting bouts (260.7 ± 5.2 vs. 132.8 ± 5.3s, p < 0.001) and are less likely to be disturbed during resting by other individuals (0.15 vs. 0.48, p < 0.001). The effect of the artificial brooders on both the duration of resting bouts and the proportion of disturbances remained after the removal of the brooders at 21 days of age. The duration of activity between resting bouts was shorter if the resting bout was ended by a disturbance (9.98 ± 1.0 vs. 61.0 ± 2.4s, p < 0.001). Birds reared with brooders were more likely to solve the spatial learning task (0.5 vs. 0.27, p < 0.01), but those succeeding were not faster at solving it. Broilers may be exposed to disrupted rest due to the lack of a dedicated resting place separated from areas with high activity. Using artificial brooders reduces disturbances but does not eliminate them. Therefore, additional changes to the housing conditions or management will be needed to prevent disturbances.","misc","wim"

The potential mechanism through regulation of the calcineurin A (CnA)/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c2 pathway was investigated in the rat cardiomyoblast cell line H9c2. H9c2 cells were treated with ISO to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy to simulate CH in vitro. The cell surface area was assessed by phalloidin staining. The expression of miR-194, CnA mRNA, and CnA protein were assessed. Furthermore, the cellular localization of the NFATc2 protein after induction of CH was detected. The relationship between miR-194 and the CnA mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR) was verified by dual luciferase report assays. By constructing cardiomyocyte cell models with low expression of miR-194 and/or CnA, the effects of miR-194 and CnA on the localization of the NFATc2 protein and cell hypertrophy was investigated. Rescue experiments were conducted to analyze whether overexpression of miR-194 could alleviate the cell hypertrophy induced by ISO. The results demonstrated that induction with ISO significantly increased the surface area of H9c2 cells. After induction, the expression of miR-194 decreased, while both CnA mRNA and protein expression increased. Furthermore, the nuclear translocation of NFATc2 was obvious. MiR-194 bound to the 3'-UTR of CnA mRNA and inhibited CnA protein expression. Inhibition of miR-194 expression activated NFATc2 protein expression and increased the H9c2 cell surface area. After CnA expression was disturbed, hypertrophy induced by miR-194 down-regulation was blocked. In addition, overexpression of miR-194 significantly alleviated cell hypertrophy and activation of the CnA/NFATc2 pathway caused by ISO. In conclusion, increasing the expression of miR-194 can alleviate CH by targeting can and inhibiting the CnA/NFATc2 pathway.","misc","wim"

A recent study identified its direct molecular target, PEN2 (PSENEN). PSENEN is the minimal subunit of the multiprotein complex γ-secretase, which promotes the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into astrocytes in the central nervous system. This study was mainly based on gene expression data and clinical data from the TCGA and CGGA databases. Analysis of differential expression of PSENEN between tissues from 31 cancers and paracancerous tissues revealed that it had high expression levels in most cancers except 2 cancers. Using univariate Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, a high expression level of PSENEN was shown to be a risk factor in low-grade gliomas (LGG). Gene ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analyses indicated that PSENEN is widely involved in immune-related signaling pathways in LGG. PSENEN expression level was significantly associated with TMB, MSI, tumor stemness index, and the expression levels of immunomodulatory genes in LGG. Finally, immune infiltration analysis revealed that PSENEN level was associated with the presence of various immune infiltrating cells, among which PSENEN was strongly associated with the presence of M2 macrophages and played a synergistic pro-cancer role.

Our aim was to determine the prevalence of antibodies against EV and their association with T1D in different age groups (n = 62), including young adults, and to compare these data with results from HLA-matched control participants (n = 62). IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies against EV were detected. IgA EV antibodies were present in 46.8% of participants with T1D (median level 10.9 EIU) and in 11.3% of controls (median level 3.4 EIU). IgA EV positivity and higher level of IgA EV antibodies were both significant risk factors for T1D (odds ratio (OR) 8.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.52-27.6; p = 0.0005 and OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.06; p = 0.0105, respectively). Importantly, the prevalence of IgA EV antibodies in the subgroups of both children and young adults was also significantly different between participants with T1D and their matched controls (p = 0.0089 and p = 0.0055, respectively). Such differences were not seen for IgG and IgM EV antibodies. However, IgG EV antibodies were associated with 65 kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, but not with zinc transporter 8 and protein tyrosine phosphatase IA2 antibodies. The genotype frequency of PTPN22 (rs2476601) and IFIH1 (rs1990760) was not associated with EV positivity. This study showed that EV infections may be an important disease-promoting factor of T1D not only in childhood-onset but also in adult-onset T1D. However, to further confirm this association, direct virological studies are needed in the latter T1D group.","misc","wim"
"1137",35956846,"Chemical Composition, Antioxidant, Antibacterial, and Antibiofilm Activities of Backhousia citriodora Essential Oil.","The essential oil of Backhousia citriodora, commonly known as lemon myrtle oil, possesses various beneficial properties due to its richness in bioactive compounds. This study aimed to characterize the chemical profile of the essential oil isolated from leaves of Backhousia citriodora (BCEO) and its biological properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, and antibiofilm activities. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 21 compounds were identified in BCEO, representing 98.50% of the total oil content. The isomers of citral, geranial (52.13%), and neral (37.65%) were detected as the main constituents. The evaluation of DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power showed that BCEO exhibited strong antioxidant activity at IC50 of 42.57 μg/mL and EC50 of 20.03 μg/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity results showed that BCEO exhibited stronger antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) than against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). For the agar disk diffusion method, S. epidermidis was the most sensitive to BCEO with an inhibition zone diameter of 50.17 mm, followed by S. aureus (31.13 mm), E. coli (20.33 mm), and K. pneumoniae (12.67 mm). The results from the microdilution method showed that BCEO exhibited the highest activity against S. epidermidis and S. aureus, with the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 6.25 μL/mL. BCEO acts as a potent antibiofilm agent with dual actions, inhibiting (85.10% to 96.44%) and eradicating (70.92% to 90.73%) of the biofilms formed by the four tested bacteria strains, compared with streptomycin (biofilm inhibition, 67.65% to 94.29% and biofilm eradication, 49.97% to 89.73%). This study highlights that BCEO can potentially be a natural antioxidant agent, antibacterial agent, and antibiofilm agent that could be applied in the pharmaceutical and food industries. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report, on the antibiofilm activity of BCEO against four common nosocomial pathogens.","misc","wim"

In the present study, these modular tools of sustainability are pointed toward the production of versatile and daily employed compounds such as surfactants. Toward this aim, glycolipids, a class of nonionic surfactants composed of ubiquitous and primary metabolites such as sugar and fatty acid moieties, represent a promising alternative to petroleum-derived surface-active agents. Therefore, the combination of biocatalysis with mechanochemistry aiming at glycolipid synthesis seemed a logical step that was taken in this study for the first time. The monoacylated model compound glucose-6-O-decanoate was synthesized with the help of a bead mill apparatus using two different unconventional dissolved reaction systems, namely, menthol-based hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents and 2-methyl-2-butanol, thus reaching up to 12% yield in the latter based on the conversion of vinyl decanoate, after only 90 min of reaction. In addition, a neat reaction system using an excess of vinylated fatty ester as an adjuvant allowed a 27 mM/h space-time yield. The overall significant increase in productivities, up to 6 times, compared to standard heating and shaking methods, shows the tremendous potential of mechanoenzymatic synthesis.","misc","wim"

This study investigated whether PET/CT could replace bone marrow biopsy (BMB) in treatment-naive ENKTL patients. Newly diagnosed ENKTL patients (n = 356) who received BMB and PET/CT to evaluate BMI at the time of diagnosis were retrospectively reviewed at West China Hospital between August 2008 and January 2020. The BMI diagnosis was confirmed using BM histology. Clinical characteristics, survival outcomes, and prognostic indicators were summarized and analyzed. The cohort included 356 cases, of whom 261 were diagnosed with early-stage and 95 with advanced-stage ENKTL by PET/CT before initial treatment. No early-stage patients were identified with BMI by either BMB or PET/CT. Among the advanced-stage patients, 26 were BMB positive, and 12 of 22 patients (54.5%) with positive PET/BM results were also BMB positive. The sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT to detect BMI were 46% and 97%, respectively. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of PET/BM-negative patients were markedly longer (p = 0.010 and p = 0.001 for PFS and OS, respectively), which was consistent with the results of the BMB (p = 0.000 for both PFS and OS). Although 18F-FDG PET/CT showed the potential to replace BMB in the initial staging of early-stage ENKTL patients, baseline PET/CT cannot provide an accurate BMI evaluation for advanced-stage patients. A prospective study is required to confirm the diagnostic performance of BMI identification by PET/CT, along with targeted BMB and MRI for advanced-stage patients.","misc","wim"

Various patterns of increased and decreased muscle activation with inclined surfaces have been observed in normal muscles, with more focus on the proximal lower limb musculature. The aim of this study was to assess the differences in electromyographic activation of gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis anterior at various inclined surfaces during gait. Fourteen healthy male participants aged between 17-30 years walked at a self-selected speed at motor driven treadmill on 0, 2 and 4 degrees of inclination. EMG activity of the muscles was recorded using the Delsys Trigno surface EMG system. Results showed that muscular activation of tibialis anterior significantly decreased with increase in the level of inclination (p< 0.05). However, soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis showed no significant differences (p> 0.05) in their muscular activation, and no noticeable trends were found. Furthermore, no significant difference was found between all the muscles at ground level and inclined level 2 and 4. These differences in activation patterns found in distal extremity can be useful for designing rehabilitation protocols in sports training and for patients with neurological and musculoskeletal pathologies.","misc","wim"

In carefully selected elderly patients, surgery can improve long-term survival. To identify candidates who would benefit from surgery, we performed this study and built a predictive model. Data from NSCLC patients over 80 years old were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. A 1:1 propensity score matching was performed to balance the clinicopathological features between the surgery and non-surgery groups. Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank tests were used to assess the significance of surgery to outcome, and Cox proportional-hazards regression and competing risk model were conducted to determine the independent prognostic factors for these patients. A nomogram was built using multivariable logistic analyses to predict candidates for surgery based on preoperative factors. The final study population of 31,462 patients were divided into surgery and non-surgery groups. The median cancer-specific survival time respectively was 53 vs. 13 months. The patients' age, sex, race, Tumor, Node, Metastasis score, stage, chemotherapy use, tumor histology and nuclear grade were independent prognostic factors. Apart from race and chemotherapy, other variates were included in the predictive model to distinguish the optimal surgical octogenarian candidates with NSCLC. Internal and external validation confirmed the efficacy of this model. Surgery improved the survival time of octogenarian NSCLC patients. A novel nomogram was built to help clinicians make the decision to perform surgery on elderly patients with NSCLC.","misc","wim"
"1335",35964453,"Adaptation of stimulation duration to enhance auditory response in fNIRS block design.","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular method in hearing research. However, few studies have considered efficient stimulation parameters for the auditory experimental design of fNIRS. The objectives of our study are (1) to identify the most effective paradigm for the stimulation blocks with increasing duration (8s, 10s, 15s, 20s) in terms of response amplitude, i.e., the most-efficient stimulation duration; (2) to assess the linearity/nonlinearity of the hemodynamic responses with respect to increasing block durations; and (3) to generalize results to more ecological environmental stimuli. We found that cortical activity is augmented following the increments in stimulation durations and reaches a plateau after about 15s of stimulation. The linearity analysis showed that this augmentation due to stimulation duration is not linear in the auditory cortex, non-linearity being more pronounced for shorter durations (15s and 20s). The 15s block duration that we propose as the most suitable precludes signal saturation and is associated with a high response amplitude and a relatively short total experimental duration. Moreover, the distribution of stimuli among the 15s blocks, which is the most effective for white noise stimulation, also provides a comparably strong response for environmental sounds. The sum of these findings suggests that 15s stimulation duration used in the appropriate experimental setup allows researchers to acquire optimal fNIRS signal quality.","misc","wim"
"1441",35958418,"Mechanism of histone deacetylases in cardiac hypertrophy and its therapeutic inhibitors.","Cardiac hypertrophy is a key process in cardiac remodeling development, leading to ventricle enlargement and heart failure. Recently, studies show the complicated relation between cardiac hypertrophy and epigenetic modification. Post-translational modification of histone is an essential part of epigenetic modification, which is relevant to multiple cardiac diseases, especially in cardiac hypertrophy. There is a group of enzymes related in the balance of histone acetylation/deacetylation, which is defined as histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). In this review, we introduce an important enzyme family HDAC, a key regulator in histone deacetylation. In cardiac hypertrophy HDAC I downregulates the anti-hypertrophy gene expression, including Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and inositol-5 phosphatase f (Inpp5f), and promote the development of cardiac hypertrophy. On the contrary, HDAC II binds to myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), inhibit the assemble ability to HAT and protect against cardiac hypertrophy. Under adverse stimuli such as pressure overload and calcineurin stimulation, the HDAC II transfer to cytoplasm, and MEF2 can bind to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) or GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), mediating inappropriate gene expression. HDAC III, also known as SIRTs, can interact not only to transcription factors, but also exist interaction mechanisms to other HDACs, such as HDAC IIa. We also present the latest progress of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), as a potential treatment target in cardiac hypertrophy.","misc","wim"

Recently, the presence of tumor-infiltrating T cells has been associated with significant survival advantages in a variety of disease sites. The present study will determine if the inclusion of T cell specific markers (CD3, CD4 and CD8) would enhance the prognostic value of EGFR in OSCCs. Tissue microarrays containing 146 OSCC cases were analyzed for EGFR, CD3, CD4 and CD8 expression using immunohistochemical staining. EGFR and T cell expression scores were correlated with clinicopathological parameters and survival outcomes. Results showed that EGFR expression had no impact on overall survival (OS), but EGFR-positive (EGFR+) OSCC patients demonstrated significantly worse progression free survival (PFS) compared to EGFR-negative (EGFR-) patients. Patients with CD3, CD4 and CD8-positive tumors had significantly better OS compared to CD3, CD4 and CD8-negative patients respectively, but no impact on PFS. Combined EGFR+/CD3+ expression was associated with cases with no nodal involvement and significantly more favorable OS compared to EGFR+/CD3- expression. CD3 expression had no impact on OS or PFS in EGFR- patients. Combinations of EGFR/CD8 and EGFR/CD4 expression showed no significant differences in OS or PFS among the expression groups. Altogether these results suggest that the expression of CD3+ tumor-infiltrating T cells can enhance the prognostic value of EGFR expression and warrants further investigation as prognostic biomarkers for OSCC.","misc","wim"

The patients were assigned to a research group (n=47) or a control group (n=47) according to which nursing method they received. The control group received routine nursing, while the research group also received FTS-based high-quality nursing. Perioperative situation, quality of life score (SF-36) before and after operation, incidence of complications, pain score (VAS) at different time periods after operation, and nursing satisfaction were compared between the two groups. There was no significant difference in operation time or blood loss between groups (P>0.05). The time to getting out of bed for the first time, time to drainage tube removal, and length of hospital stay in the research group were shorter than those in the control group (P<0.001). Repeated measurement analysis of variance revealed that the VAS score of the research group was lower than that of the control group at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h after operation (P<0.05). Intra-group comparison manifested that the VAS scores of both groups decreased at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h after operation (P<0.05). Comparison at different time points revealed that the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The incidence of complications in the research group (4.26%) was lower than that in the control group (17.02%; P<0.05). The satisfaction rate of nursing in the research group (93.62%) was higher than that in the control group (78.72%; P<0.05). After intervention, the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in both groups decreased with a lesser decrease in the research group. The contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in groups after intervention were higher than those before intervention with a milder increase in the research group. FTS mode can shorten the recovery time, reduce the degree of pain and the reduce the time of analgesia. It also promotes the recovery and shortens the hospital stay of patients, and improves their quality of life, with high satisfaction. This may be related to an expeditedd surgical process and reduced oxidative stress response of patients undergoing surgery under the rapid recovery surgical model.","misc","wim"

MMPs have different targets in different phases of wound healing through which they are capable of promoting timely healing in the body. This review discusses all the possible role of MMPs and their inhibitors that are involved during every step of the wound healing process. This review highlights the latest advances in the respective field about the regulation and mediation of MMPs in human skin and how these studies can be applied to other branches of medical sciences as well. Published papers were searched via MEDLINE, PubMed and MDPI from the available peer reviewed journals. Research done in the past suggests that active MMPs are involved in the healing progression of the wounds or they have a positive effect towards healing of wounds. Present studies in the relative field will further enhance the knowledge about enzymes working along with their inhibitors.

In this case-control study 164 children with sECC and 147 children without dental caries were included. MALDI-TOF MS and multiplex qPCR were used to identify Candida spp. and selected bacteria in dental plaque samples, respectively. A questionnaire on oral hygiene, diet, and children's health was filled in by the parents. The constructed multivariable logistic regression model showed an independent influence of the microbial and behavioral factors in sECC etiopathogenesis. The occurrence of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis was associated with higher odds of sECC development (odds ratio, OR: 9.62 and 16.93, respectively), together with breastfeeding of 6 months or less (OR: 2.71), exposure to sweet beverages (OR: 3.77), and starting to brush child's teeth after the 12th month of age (OR: 4.10), all statistically significant (p < 0.01). Considering the high occurrence of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis in dental plaque in children with sECC, we propose them as keystone pathogens and risk factors for sECC.

NSCs were treated with 388 and stem cell differentiation was determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. The role of MeCP2 in 388-mediated embryonic NSCs differentiation was examined. The results showed that in the presence of mitogen when NSCs proliferated and maintained their multipotency, treatment with 388 did not affect the viability of NSCs. Following mitogen withdrawal to initiate NSC differentiation, treatment with 388 at the doses of 10 and 50 μg/mL significantly increased neural differentiation in both cortex and spinal cord-derived culture. 388 also significantly up-regulated MeCP2 expression. The expression of the neuronal and oligodendrocytic markers was enhanced after addition of 388 in the differentiation culture. However, knockdown of MeCP2 results in inhibition of NSC differentiation, and the pro-differentiation effect of 388 was mostly abolished. This study confirmed that 388 stimulates differentiation of NSCs and identifies its mechanism of action by upregulating MeCP2.","misc","wim"

Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to analyze the function of core targets of METTL3. Eighteen methylation core molecules were identified in GC patients by combining transcriptome and methylome sequencing. GC patients can be separated into two subtypes based on the expression of 18 methylation core molecules. Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed that patients with different subtypes had a different OS, PFS, stage, grade, and TMB. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that immune-related pathways were enriched among subtype A. The ESTIMATE analysis suggested that the extent of infiltration of immune cells was different in two subtypes of GC patients. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) and The Cancer Immunome Atlas (TCIA) database also showed that there were significant differences in the efficacy of immunotherapy among different types of GC patients.

The S-Five was translated in a forward-backward method to Mandarin to establish a satisfactory translation. The translation was also independently back translated to English, with no significant differences when compared to the original S-Five. Through exploratory factor analysis, using responses from 256 Chinese individuals, the five dimensions (internalising appraisals, externalising appraisals, perceived threat and avoidance behaviour, outbursts, and impact on functioning) were replicated, indicating the cross-cultural uniformity of the experience of misophonia as captured by the S-Five. That is, current results point to the stability of the manifestation of misophonia across cultures, seen here for the first time in the literature. By design, the S-Five items were developed to reflect sound sensitivities in a manner that is not specific or matching to individuals of a certain age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, socio-economic status, and educational level. Testimonial to this fact is not only the replication of the five factors, but also the replication of the evidence towards satisfactory psychometric properties (reliability and validity) of the scale.

A recursive decision-tree with one-year cycles was used to model the life-long natural HPV history. Markov cohort simulations were used to assess the expected outcomes from the model. The outcomes of three strategies were compared with the absence of screening: HPV-testing on self-collected vaginal samples (Self-HPV) followed by colposcopy (Self-HPV/colpo), Self-HPV and triage with cytology (Self-HPV/PAP), cytology and triage with HPV (PAP/HPV). All screening strategies resulted in reductions in cancer cases and deaths. Self-HPV strategies were associated with a lower cancer incidence and mortality life-long, not only when performed every 3 years but also when Self-HPV was performed every 5 years vs cytology every 3 years. The gain in life expectancy obtained was 82 days with Self-HPV/colpo, 81 days with Self-HPV/PAP and 75 days with PAP/HPV compared to no screening. The number of lifetime total visits was greater with PAP/HPV compared with the Self-HPV strategies (13.13 vs < 3). The number of conizations remained relatively stable with the change of screening frequency and strategy. Self-HPV may represent a reasonable balance of harms and benefits when performed every 5 years compared to cytology every 3 years. Self-HPV/PAP yielded the most efficient harm to benefit ratio when using colposcopy as a proxy for harms.","misc","wim"

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is reportedly useful in differentiating decidualized ovarian endometriomas from malignancies. However, to our knowledge, serial MRI of decidualized ovarian endometrioma before and after rupture has not been reported. Herein, we report the case of a 39-year-old woman with a ruptured decidualized ovarian endometrioma in which serial MRI was useful for adequate management. She had a history of right ovarian endometrioma. Transvaginal ultrasonography at 20 weeks of gestation showed the known right ovarian endometrioma with mural nodules that were not evident before pregnancy. MRI for further evaluation showed ovarian endometrioma with mural nodules with signals similar to those of the placenta. Based on the MRI findings, we diagnosed a decidualized ovarian endometrioma. At 27 weeks of gestation, she complained of sudden abdominal pain, for which MRI was performed. MRI showed disappearance of the ovarian endometrioma and bloody ascites, based on which we diagnosed a ruptured ovarian endometrioma. The abdominal pain subsided immediately, and a conservative observational treatment approach was taken. At 37 weeks of gestation, right ovarian cystectomy was performed simultaneously with an elective cesarean section, which revealed a ruptured decidualized ovarian endometrioma.

We examined this question in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing specifically on an immune system gene regulation profile known as the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), which is characterized by up-regulation of proinflammatory genes and down-regulation of genes linked to innate antiviral responses and antibody production. We analyzed CTRA RNA profiles in blood samples from 142 healthy young adults (69% female, 87% white) during the social distancing period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mixed effect linear models quantified the relation of CTRA gene expression to measures of in-person social connection (number of friends, social eudaimonia, loneliness) and online psychosocial connection (online loneliness, perceived social value in online leisure and educational contexts, and internet use) while controlling for demographic and health factors. Multiple indicators of in-person and generalized social connection were associated with lower CTRA gene expression, whereas no measure of online social connection showed any significant association with CTRA gene expression. Experiences of in-person social connection are associated with reduced CTRA gene expression during a period of restricted social interaction. In contrast, online social relationships show no such association. Digitally mediated social relations do not appear to substantially offset the absence of in-person/offline social connection in the context of immune cell gene regulation.","misc","wim"
"628",35963074,"Imaging Findings in Neonatal and Pediatric Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) Differ From Adults.","Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is classically a reversible clinical radiographic syndrome associated with predominantly posterior leukoencephalopathy on neuroimaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in adults demonstrates almost universally reversible parietal-occipital disease. We aimed to demonstrate in a cohort of children that atypical distribution is expected, acutely and on follow-up. A retrospective review of children diagnosed with PRES from 2010 to 2018 at our children's hospital was performed. All had MRI at diagnoses, with over half having follow-up MRIs. Images were reviewed by a neuroradiology-trained pediatric radiologist for confirmation of findings consistent with PRES/identification of involved regions. Nineteen patients (aged zero to 18 years, 53% female) were included. Notably, two were infants. Nearly all had seizures; all had altered mental status and hypertension. Fifteen (84%) had MRI described as atypical. Distribution of MRI findings was anatomically widespread, including nine with frontal findings. Twelve (63%) had follow-up imaging, of which approximately half remained abnormal. Pediatric PRES MRI findings were more often atypical at time of diagnosis. Vasogenic edema related to the acute phases of PRES typically resolved; however, follow-up imaging identified new volume loss in the areas affected. Two of our subjects were younger than 13 months, younger than typically described. Our series demonstrates that imaging distribution in children with PRES does not mirror the classical posterior, reversible distribution described in adults and continues the recent trend of identifying PRES in infants.","misc","wim"

This study aimed to assess the presence of anterior loop of mandibular canal and its approximation to the alveolar crest using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). CBCT scans of the patients scheduled for implant therapy in the region of mental foramen were retrospectively analyzed for the presence of anterior loop of mandibular canal. Findings were compared based upon gender and side of the mandible. Distance between the most prominent part of anterior loop of mandibular canal and the alveolar crest was measured. Anterior loop of the mandibular canal was identified 66.8% of hemimandibles analyzed with the highest prevalence in the fourth decade of life. Males and females exhibited predilection toward the right and left side, respectively. The presence of anterior loop of mandibular canal is associated with reduced distance between the neurovascular bundle and alveolar crest jeopardizing the placement of standard length dental implant. The current study emphasizes an increased need for precise identification and preservation of anterior loop of mandibular canal in the third and fourth decades of life, especially in females.","misc","wim"

Furthermore, the recent changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a drastic increase in importance and ubiquity of online education. Among the major advantages of e-learning is not only improving students' learning experience and widening their educational prospects, but also an opportunity to gain insights into students' learning processes with learning analytics. This study contributes to the topic of improving and understanding e-learning processes in the following ways. First, we demonstrate that accurate predictive models can be built based on sequential patterns derived from students' behavioral data, which are able to identify underperforming students early in the course. Second, we investigate the specificity-generalizability trade-off in building such predictive models by investigating whether predictive models should be built for every course individually based on course-specific sequential patterns, or across several courses based on more general behavioral patterns. Finally, we present a methodology for capturing temporal aspects in behavioral data and analyze its influence on the predictive performance of the models. The results of our improved sequence classification technique are capable to predict student performance with high levels of accuracy, reaching 90% for course-specific models.","misc","wim"

Strong light absorption in the graphene monolayer is achieved due to the formation of embedded optical quasi-bound states in the continuum in the subwavelength dielectric grating. The physical origin of the absorption with high quality factor is examined by investigating the electromagnetic field distributions. Interestingly, we found that the proposed absorber possesses high spatial directivity and performs similar to an antenna, which can also be utilized as a thermal emitter. Besides, the spectral position of the absorption peak can not only be adjusted by changing the geometrical parameters of dielectric grating, but it is also tunable by a small change in the Fermi level of the graphene sheet. This novel scheme to tune the absorption of graphene may find potential applications for the realization of ultrasensitive biosensors, photodetectors, and narrow-band filters.","misc","wim"
"153",35959077,"Logometro®: The psychometric properties of a norm-referenced digital battery for language assessment of Greek-speaking 4-7 years old children.","In educational and clinical settings, few norm-referenced tests have been utilized until now usually focusing on a single or a few language subcomponents, along with very few language rating scales for parents and educators. The need for a comprehensive language assessment tool for preschool and early school years children which could form the basis for valid and reliable screening and diagnostic decisions, led to the development of a new norm-referenced digital tool called Logometro®. The aim of the present study is to describe Logometro® as well as its psychometric characteristics. Logometro® evaluates an array of oral language skills across the different language domains such as phonological awareness, listening comprehension, vocabulary knowledge (receptive and expressive), narrative speech, morphological awareness, pragmatics, as well emergent literacy skills (letter sound knowledge and invented writing) in Greek-speaking 4-7 years old children. More specifically, Logometro® has been designed in order to: (a) map individual language development paths as well as difficulties, (b) provide a descriptive profile of children's oral language and emergent literacy skills, and (c) assist in the identification of children who are at risk for Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) or Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD). The sample consisted of 926 children aged from 4 to 7 years, which were recruited from diverse geographical provinces and represented a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds in Greece. Eight hundred participants were typically developing children (N boys = 384 and N girls = 416), 126 children (N SLI = 44 and N SLD = 82) represented children with Special Educational Needs, and 126 children were typically developing peers matched for gender and age with the clinical groups. The administration lasted 90 min, depending on the participant's age and competence. Validity (construct, criterion, convergent, discriminant, and predictive) as well as internal consistency and test-retest reliability were assessed. Results indicated that Logometro® is characterized by good psychometric properties and can constitute a norm-referenced battery of oral language and emergent literacy skills. It could be used to inform the professionals as well as the researchers about a child's language strengths and weaknesses and form the basis on which they can design an appropriate individualized intervention if needed.","misc","wim"
"643",35957845,"Effectiveness of a lifestyle modification programme in the treatment of depression symptoms in primary care.","Depression symptoms are prevalent in the general population, and their onset and continuation may be related to biological and psychosocial factors, many of which are related to lifestyle aspects. Health promotion and lifestyle modification programmes (LMPs) may be effective on reducing the symptoms. The objective of this study was to analyse the clinical effectiveness of a LMP and a LMP plus Information and Communication Technologies, when compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU) over 6 months. The interventions were offered as an adjuvant treatment delivered in Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCs) for people with depression symptoms. We conducted an open-label, multicentre, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial. Participants were recruited from several PHCs. Those participants visiting general practitioner for any reason, who also met the inclusion criteria (scoring 10 to 30 points on the Beck II Self-Applied Depression Inventory) were invited to take part in the study. TAU+LMP consisted of six weekly 90-min group sessions focused on improving lifestyle. TAU+LMP + ICTs replicated the TAU+LMP format, plus the addition of a wearable smartwatch to measure daily minutes walked and sleep patterns. A total of 188 participants consented to participate in the study and were randomized. We used linear mixed models, with a random intercept and an unstructured covariance to evaluate the impact of the interventions compared to TAU. Both interventions showed a statistically significant reduction on depressive symptoms compared to TAU (TAU+LMP vs. TAU slope difference, b = -3.38, 95% CI= [-5.286, -1.474] p = 0.001 and TAU+LMP+ICTs vs. TAU slope difference, b = -4.05, 95% CI = [-5.919, -2.197], p < 0.001). These reductions imply a moderate effect size. In the TAU+LMP+ICTs there was a significant increase regarding minutes walking per week (b = 99.77) and adherence to Mediterranean diet (b = 0.702). In the TAU+LMP there was a significant decrease regarding bad sleep quality (b = -1.24). TAU+LMPs administered in PHCs to people experiencing depression symptoms were effective on reducing these symptoms compared to TAU. They also have a positive impact on changing several lifestyle factors. These findings indicate that these interventions can be promising strategies for PHCs.","misc","wim"

We analyzed the immunological infiltration of TME cells in normal and malignant tissues using 469 CM and 556 normal skin samples. We used a single sample gene set enrichment assay (ssGSEA) to quantify the relative abundance of 28 cells, then used the LASSO COX regression model to develop a riskScore prognostic model, followed by a small molecule drug screening and molecular docking validation, which was then validated using qRT-PCR and IHC. We developed a prognosis model around seven essential protective genes for the first time, dramatically elevated in tumor tissues, as did immune cell infiltration. Multivariate Cox regression results indicated that riskScore is an independent and robust prognostic indicator, and its predictive value in immunotherapy was verified. Additionally, we identified Gabapentin as a possible small molecule therapeutic for CM. A riskScore model was developed in this work to analyze patient prognosis, TME cell infiltration features, and treatment responsiveness. The development of this model not only aids in predicting patient response to immunotherapy but also has significant implications for the development of novel immunotherapeutic agents and the promotion of tailored treatment regimens.","misc","wim"
"63",35958532,"Twenty-five years' experience with root remodeling and bicuspid aortic valve repair.","Bicuspid aortic valves may be associated with ascending aortic aneurysm, or develop severe aortic regurgitation with variable aortic dilatation. If aortic dilatation involves the root, valve-preserving root replacement is a treatment option, and we prefer root remodeling for this purpose. The objective of this study is to review our experience encompassing 25 years. Between November 1995 and August 2021, 472 patients (429 male; age 9-80 years; mean 48±13 years) were treated by bicuspid aortic valve repair and root remodeling. Aortic regurgitation was present in 322 cases. The primary indication for surgery was aortic regurgitation (n=317), aortic aneurysm (n=143) or acute type A aortic dissection (n=12). In 271 instances, a suture annuloplasty was added. Cusp calcification was present beyond the raphe in 80 cases, and a pericardial patch was used for partial cusp replacement in 44 cases. Follow-up was 92.8% complete with a mean of 71±68 months (median 61 months). Hospital mortality was 0.4% and survival at 20 years was 76.9%. Reoperation was necessary for recurrent aortic regurgitation in 26 patients; nine patients underwent reoperation for stenosis. The overall freedom of reoperation was 90.5% after ten years and 76.6% after 20 years. Annuloplasty was associated with a higher proportion of competent aortic valves at discharge (P=0.001), and had no effect on ten-year freedom from reoperation. The use of a pericardial patch for cusp repair was a predictor for reoperation (P=0.003). The presence of cusp calcification was a predictor for the development of aortic stenosis and reoperation (P=0.032). Bicuspid aortic valve repair combined with root remodeling leads to excellent ten- and 20-year results. Cusp calcification and partial cusp replacement are associated with an increased probability of valve failure requiring reoperation.","misc","wim"

"1385",35957298,"Effect of Behavioral Precaution on Braking Operation of Elderly Drivers under Cognitive Workloads.","The number of accidents by elderly drivers caused by the erroneous tread of a brake pedal or accelerator pedal has increased. A recent study reported that the number of accidents could be reduced by preparing for braking mistakes due to driving behavior by using a simulator. However, related studies have pointed out that driving behavior in simulators does not always reflect driving behavior in the real world. This paper focuses on the posture of the left foot as a behavioral precaution and provides insights into braking mistakes by comparing behavioral precautions taken on simulators and on public roads. In the experimental results, cognitive and action errors increased with age, but elderly drivers are less likely to have an accident when they are exposed to the risk of collision in situations with a mental workload by making space for the right foot to step on the brake pedal. Elderly drivers with coping skills had their left foot perpendicular to the ground and their body was unstable. This result was different from the driving behavior in the simulator, but it was not possible to identify that this difference was the cause of the collision accidents. Coping skills were predicted with 70% accuracy from the left foot posture of an elderly driver near the intersection. We expanded the system's range of use and enhanced its usefulness by predicting coping skills derived from natural driving behavior in the real world. The contributions of this study are as follows. We clarify the effect of behavioral precautions on the braking operation of elderly drivers when under a cognitive workload. We provide new insights into the use of behavioral precautions in older drivers' braking operations in the real world. We predicted coping skills from natural driving behavior near intersections in the real world.","misc","wim"
"114",35966083,"Modulation of Autophagy in Adrenal Tumors.","Adrenal masses are one of the most common tumors in humans. The majority are benign and non-functioning and therefore do not require immediate treatment. In contrast, the rare adrenal malignant tumors are often highly aggressive and with poor prognosis. Besides usually being detected in advanced stages, often already with metastases, one of the reasons of the unfavorable outcome of the patients with adrenal cancer is the absence of effective treatments. Autophagy is one of the intracellular pathways targeted by several classes of chemotherapeutics. Mitotane, the most commonly used drug for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma, was recently shown to also modulate autophagy. Autophagy is a continuous programmed cellular process which culminates with the degradation of cellular organelles and proteins. However, being a dynamic mechanism, understanding the autophagic flux can be highly complex. The role of autophagy in cancer has been described paradoxically: initially described as a tumor pro-survival mechanism, different studies have been showing that it may result in other outcomes, namely in tumor cell death. In adrenal tumors, this dual role of autophagy has also been addressed in recent years. Studies reported both induction and inhibition of autophagy as a treatment strategy of adrenal malignancies. Importantly, most of these studies were performed using cell lines. Consequently clinical studies are still required. In this review, we describe what is known about the role of autophagy modulation in treatment of adrenal tumors. We will also highlight the aspects that need further evaluation to understand the paradoxical role of autophagy in adrenal tumors.","misc","wim"
"706",35957188,"Driving Mode Selection through SSVEP-Based BCI and Energy Consumption Analysis.","The brain-computer interface (BCI) is a highly cross-discipline technology and its successful application in various domains has received increasing attention. However, the BCI-enabled automobile industry is has been comparatively less investigated. In particular, there are currently no studies focusing on brain-controlled driving mode selection. Specifically, different driving modes indicate different driving styles which can be selected according to the road condition or the preference of individual drivers. In this paper, a steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP)-based driving mode selection system is proposed. Upon this system, drivers can select the intended driving modes by only gazing at the corresponding SSVEP stimuli. A novel EEG processing algorithm named inter-trial distance minimization analysis (ITDMA) is proposed to enhance SSVEP detection. Both offline and real-time experiments were carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The results show that a high selection accuracy of up to 92.3% can be realized, although this depends on the specific choice of flickering duration, the number of EEG channels, and the number of training signals. Additionally, energy consumption is investigated in terms of which the proposed brain-controlled system considerably differs from a traditional driving mode selection system, and the main reason is shown to be the existence of a detection error.","misc","wim"

This study was aimed to evaluate the immune infiltration pattern of esophageal cancer through a gene co-expression network, and to provide biomarkers for immunotherapy of esophageal cancer. We downloaded RNA-seq data of ESCC samples from GSE53625 and GSE66258 datasets, then assessed the immune score and tumor purity through ESTIMATE algorithm. Next, a co-expression network was constructed by the weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and the key co-expressed immune related genes were identified on the basis of existing human immune related genes. Afterwards, we utilized bioinformatics algorithms including GSVA, CIBERSORT and ssGSEA to clarify the relationship between hub genes and immune infiltration pattern. Finally, these hub genes were used to evaluate the sensitivity to immunotherapy by the subclass mapping algorithm, which were further validated by digital pathology through the Hover-Net algorithm. Sixteen immune-related genes with robust expression characteristics were identified and used to build gene signature. The expression of gene signature was significantly related to the immune infiltration pattern and immunotherapy sensitivity prediction in patients with esophageal cancer. Consistent with previous studies, genetic changes at the level of somatic mutations such as NFE2L2 were revealed. . A total of 16 immune-related genes with the total expression gene signature can be used as biomarkers for immunotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

However, apart from a few Codonopsis species, no detailed knowledge is available on the metabolite composition and respective transcriptome signatures. We performed a combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis of the tuber, stem, and leaf of C. convolvulacea and found 1,144 metabolites and 231,840 unigenes in three experimental groups. The analysis revealed considerable variations in the three tissues. Tubers were rich in amino acids and derivatives, flavonoids, and organic acids, whereas the stems and leaves were rich in alkaloids and flavonoids, respectively. Transcriptome sequencing revealed candidate genes being involved in flavonoid, tryptophan, and alkaloid biosyntheses. In particular, we indicated that the variation in the isoflavone content is linked to the expressions of CHI, CYP73A, C3'H, F3H, CYP75B1, anthocyanidin synthase, and FLS. In a similar way, the levels of indole, L-tyrosine, and tryptamine were also consistent with the expressions of TDC/DDCs in the respective tissues. In addition, the expression levels of ASP5, ARO8, GOT, and AOC3 indicated that L-tryptophan is being converted to downstream metabolites. Overall, our datasets present a useful resource for future research on the uses of this medicinal plant and put forward many research questions.","misc","wim"
"900",35958619,"Bioinformatics analysis of potential common pathogenic mechanisms for COVID-19 infection and primary Sjogren's syndrome.","Accumulating evidence has revealed that the prevalence of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was significantly higher in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) compared to the general population. However, the mechanism remains incompletely elucidated. This study aimed to further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of this complication. The gene expression profiles of COVID-19 (GSE157103) and pSS (GSE40611) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for pSS and COVID-19, functional annotation, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, module construction and hub gene identification were performed. Finally, we constructed transcription factor (TF)-gene regulatory network and TF-miRNA regulatory network for hub genes. A total of 40 common DEGs were selected for subsequent analyses. Functional analyses showed that cellular components and metabolic pathways collectively participated in the development and progression of pSS and COVID-19. Finally, 12 significant hub genes were identified using the cytoHubba plugin, including CMPK2, TYMS, RRM2, HERC5, IFI44L, IFI44, IFIT2, IFIT1, IFIT3, MX1, CDCA2 and TOP2A, which had preferable values as diagnostic markers for COVID-19 and pSS. Our study reveals common pathogenesis of pSS and COVID-19. These common pathways and pivotal genes may provide new ideas for further mechanistic studies.","misc","wim"

Clinical data of a total of 240 singleton pregnant women and their neonates who delivered in the Obstetrics Department of our hospital from January 2021 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The pregnant women and their newborns were divided into an acute group (acute fetal distress), a chronic group (chronic fetal distress) and a control group (no fetus distress), with 80 cases in each. The umbilical artery blood gas analysis values including power of hydrogen (PH), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), bicarbonate radical (HCO3 -), buffer excess (BE) and the Apgar score, as well as the neonatal asphyxia outcome after birth were recorded. There were statistically significant differences in fetal condition, PH and BE between newborns with asphyxia and normal newborns (P<0.05). The incidence of neonatal distress was 1.25% in the control group and 19.38% in the fetal distress group (including acute and chronic groups). Logistic regression analysis found that fetal distress was a risk factor for neonatal asphyxia (Odds Ratio (OR)=11.064, P=0.012). The specificity and sensitivity of neonatal cord blood gas analysis in diagnosing neonatal asphyxia were 95.69% and 80.65%, respectively. The specificity of Apgar score in the diagnosis of neonatal asphyxia was 94.74%, and the sensitivity was 70.97%. The rate of neonatal asphyxia in the chronic fetal distress group (26.25%) was higher than that in the acute fetal distress group (12.5%). The proportion of neonatal severe asphyxia in the chronic fetal distress group (66.67%) was higher than that in the acute group (20%). The PH and BE levels in the chronic fetal distress group were lower than those in the control group and acute fetal distress group (P<0.05). Cord blood gas analysis can help to improve the accuracy of fetal distress diagnosis. Cord blood gas is closely related to neonatal prognosis. Compared with acute fetal distress, chronic fetal distress is more likely to lead to neonatal acidosis and asphyxia.","misc","wim"

The expression level of PDSS1 was analyzed using the TCGA and GEO databases. The relationships between PDSS1 and patient clinicopathological characteristics were verified based on TCGA clinical data. Additionally, the co-expressed genes of PDSS1were investigated and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was conducted using LinkedOmics. Next, the association between PDSS1 and immune infiltration was determined using version 1.34.0 of the GSVA package. EdU assay, colony-formation assay, transwell assay, wound-healing assay, and flow cytometry analysis were used to assess the effect of PDSS1 on the cell phenotype. PDSS1 was upregulated in HCC compared with adjacent tissues. High PDSS1 in HCC was associated with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progress-free interval. Results suggested that PDSS1 may activate multiple oncogenic pathways in HCC, especially those involved in the cell cycle. The expression of PDSS1 was significantly related to Th2 cells, TFH, T helper cells, NK CD56bright cells, cytotoxic cells, DC, CD8 T cells, and neutrophils. PDSS1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasion. Furthermore, PDSS1 acted as an oncogene through the STAT3 signaling pathway. Our study reveals that a high level of PDSS1 is significantly correlated with poor patient prognosis and immune cell infiltration in HCC. PDSS1 may be a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for HCC.","misc","wim"

The proposed models are fitted to experimental data obtained from eight different fruit types using a meta-heuristic optimization method (the Water Cycle Algorithm (WCA)). Impedance measurements are obtained using a Biologic SP150 electrochemical station, and the percentage error between the actual impedance and the fitted models' impedance are reported. It is found that a circuit model consisting of a combination of two second-order power-law low-pass filters shows the least fitting error.","misc","wim"

A clinically convenient, non-invasive approach for monitoring the development of DKD would benefit the overall life quality of patients with DM and contribute to lower medical burdens through promoting preventive interventions. We utilized 5hmC-Seal to profile genome-wide 5-hydroxymethylcytosines in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Candidate genes were identified by intersecting the differentially hydroxymethylated genes and differentially expressed genes from the GSE30528 and GSE30529. Then, a protein interaction network was constructed for the candidate genes, and the hub genes were identified by the MCODE and cytoHubba algorithm. The correlation analysis between the hydroxymethylation level of the hub genes and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was carried out. Finally, we demonstrated differences in expression levels of the protein was verified by constructing a mouse model of DKD. In addition, we constructed a network of interactions between drugs and hub genes using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. This study found that there were significant differences in the overall distribution of 5hmC in plasma of patients with DKD, and an alteration of hydroxymethylation levels in genomic regions involved in inflammatory pathways which participate in the immune response. The final 5 hub genes, including (CTNNB1, MYD88, CD28, VCAM1, CD44) were confirmed. Further analysis indicated that this 5-gene signature showed a good capacity to distinguish between DKD and DM, and was found that protein levels were increased in renal tissue of DKD mice. Correlation analysis indicated that the hydroxymethylation level of 5 hub genes were nagatively correlated with eGFR. Toxicogenomics analysis showed that a variety of drugs for the treatment of DKD can reduce the expression levels of 4 hub genes (CD44, MYD88, VCAM1, CTNNB1). The 5hmC-Seal assay was successfully applied to the plasma cfDNA samples from a cohort of DM patients with or without DKD. Altered 5hmC signatures indicate that 5hmC-Seal has the potential to be a non-invasive epigenetic tool for monitoring the development of DKD and it provides new insight for the future molecularly targeted anti-inflammation therapeutic strategies of DKD.","misc","wim"

Nevertheless, the correlation between SUA level and clinical outcomes of the postoperative patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) treated by chemotherapy is unclear. This study aimed at exploring the relationship between baseline SUA level and progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), and safety in postoperative CRC patients receiving chemotherapy. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the relationship between baseline SUA level and PFS, DCR, and incidence of serious adverse events of 736 postoperative CRC patients treated with FOLFOX, FOLFIRI or XELOX at our center. Data from our center suggested that high baseline SUA level is linked to poor PFS in non-metastatic CRC patients using FOLFOX (HR=2.59, 95%CI: 1.29-11.31, p=0.018) and in male patients using FOLFIRI (HR=3.77, 95%CI: 1.57-39.49, p=0.012). In patients treated by FOLFIRI, a high SUA is also linked to a low DCR (p=0.035). In patients using FOLFOX, high baseline SUA level is also linked to a high incidence of neutropenia (p=0.0037). For patients using XELOX, there is no significant correlation between SUA level and PFS, effectiveness, or safety. These findings imply that a high SUA level is a promising biomarker associated with poor PFS, DCR and safety of postoperative CRC patients when treated with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI.","misc","wim"

However, the fabrication of multifunctional biochar materials with a well-developed hierarchical porous structure as well as self-doped functionalities via a facile strategy remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a heteroatom-doped porous biochar, prepared by a hydrothermal pretreatment followed by a molten salt activation route. With the creation of a high specific surface area (1501.9 m2/g), a hierarchical porous structure, and the incorporation of oxygen-/nitrogen-functional groups, the as-prepared biochar (BC-24) exhibits great potential for supercapacitor application and organic pollutant elimination. The assembled biochar electrode delivers a specific capacitance of 378 F/g at 0.2 A/g with a good rate capability of 198 F/g at 10 A/g, and excellent cycling stability with 94.5% capacitance retention after 10,000 recycles. Moreover, BC-24 also exhibits superior catalytic activity for phenol degradation through peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation. The phenol (0.2 mM) can be effectively absorbed and then completely degraded within only 25 min over a wide pH range with low catalyst and PDS dosages. More importantly, TOC analysis indicates 81.7% of the phenol is mineralized within 60 min, confirming the effectiveness of the BC-24/PDS system. Quenching experiments and EPR measurements reveal that SO4·- and ·OH as well as 1O2 are involved in the phenol degradation, while the non-radical pathway plays the dominant role. This study provides valuable insights into the preparation of cost-effective carbon materials for supercapacitor application and organic contaminant remediation.","misc","wim"
"1940",35957228,"Millimeter-Wave Radar Localization Using Indoor Multipath Effect.","The positioning of indoor electronic devices is an essential part of human-computer interaction, and the accuracy of positioning affects the level of user experience. Most existing methods for RF-based device localization choose to ignore or remove the impact of multipath effects. However, exploiting the multipath effect caused by the complex indoor environment helps to improve the model's localization accuracy. In response to this question, this paper proposes a multipath-assisted localization (MAL) model based on millimeter-wave radar to achieve the localization of indoor electronic devices. The model fully considers the help of the multipath effect when describing the characteristics of the reflected signal and precisely locates the target position by using the MAL area formed by the reflected signal. At the same time, for the situation where the radar in the traditional Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) mode cannot obtain the 3D spatial position information of the target, the advantage of the MAL model is that the 3D information of the target can be obtained after the mining process of the multipath effect. Furthermore, based on the original hardware, it can achieve a breakthrough in angular resolution. Experiments show that our proposed MAL model enables the millimeter-wave multipath positioning model to achieve a 3D positioning error within 15 cm.","misc","wim"

The experimental treatments were comprised of Ck: without Pb and GABA (control), GABA: 1 mM GABA is applied under normal conditions (without Pb), Pb + GABA: 1 mM GABA is applied under Pb toxicity (800 mg kg-1 of soil), and Pb= only Pb (800 mg kg-1 of soil) is applied (no GABA). The required concentrations of GABA were applied as a foliar spray. Results revealed that Pb stress induced oxidative damage in terms of enhanced malondialdehyde (MDA), electrolyte leakage (EL), and H2O2 contents, while exogenous GABA application improved leaf chlorophyll, proline, protein and GABA contents, photosynthesis and gas exchange, and antioxidant defense under Pb toxicity in both rice cultivars. Moreover, glutamine synthetase (GS) and nitrate reductase (NR) activities were variably affected due to GABA application under Pb stress. The yield and related traits, that is, productive tillers/pot, grains/panicle, filled grain %, 1,000-grain weight, and grain yield were 13.64 and 10.29, 0.37% and 2.26%, 3.89 and 19.06%, 7.35 and 12.84%, and 17.92 and 40.56 lower under Pb treatment than Pb + GABA for GXZ and NX-18, respectively. Furthermore, exogenous GABA application in rice reduced Pb contents in shoot, leaves, panicle, and grains compared with Pb-exposed plants without GABA.

A key demographic which needs to be supported are children with disabilities, such as autism. With an estimated prevalence of one percent, there are over five million young children who need services to support their needs. However, the paucity of specialist care makes access to interventions difficult. In this context a public health research not-for-profit is evaluating the effectiveness of the task-sharing approach to support the delivery of an evidenced social communication intervention for young children with autism. This paper describes the process of engaging and training the non-specialist frontline Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), who are embedded within the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare under the Delhi State Health Mission, to deliver a complex intervention for autism to inform the future scalability of services for neurodevelopmental disorders. The present study describes the process which included (i) engagement meetings, (ii) recruitment, (iii) training, (iv) internship, and (v) competency evaluation. The shortlisted ASHAs received a 7-day classroom training followed by an internship period with practice cases. Finally, competency assessments, comprising of a test of knowledge and skills through role-plays, was administered. Twenty three Primary Urban Health Centers across seven districts of Delhi were approached and 408 ASHAs were engaged in initial meetings. Telephonic screening with 127 ASHAs resulted in 72 ASHAs being selected for in-person interviews. Of the 45 ASHAs who attended, 33 were shortlisted for training and 18 completed it. Fifteen ASHAs entered the internship of which 7 ASHAs achieved competency. There was significant attrition along the pathway to having a competent non-specialist worker deliver a complex autism intervention. The lessons learnt from this process can inform the possibility of developing a cadre of disability specific frontline health workers who can deliver evidence-based interventions for neurodevelopmental disorders under supervision.","misc","wim"

Surgical resection is the only potential curative treatment, and radiation therapy and chemotherapy for leiomyosarcoma are not definite. There is few literature reporting the leiomyosarcoma of the IVC. A previously healthy 64-year-old female was admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University with the complaint of right lower quadrant abdominal pain for almost three years and worsening with a radiating ache in the waist recently. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography(CT) scans revealed a large (7.8 cm*5.5 cm*5.0 cm) irregular hypodense retroperitoneal mass with heterogeneous enhancement and invasion of the IVC, and the right ureter was compressed with proximal ureteral dilatation and hydrops. Three-dimensional CT of the IVC revealed that the IVC was encircled by the tumor with moderate invasion. During the operation, the tumor was resected en bloc with the IVC (from the suprarenal to infrarenal segment), the right kidney with ureter, and the duodenum seromuscular layer. As the left renal vein was involved, it was also partly resected. IVC reconstruction was performed with the interposition of a 20 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) prosthesis, and the right renal vein was anastomosed between the left renal vein and the reconstructed IVC to guarantee the left renal vein reflux. The patient had an uneventful recovery process with normal renal function after the operation. However, follow-up CT indicated that the left renal vein was blocked two weeks after the surgery. The patient was discharged two weeks after the operation. She continues well and has no evidence of disease fourteen months after the surgery. Wide excision of the tumor en bloc with the IVC is the main treatment for leiomyosarcoma of the IVC. IVC reconstruction with prosthetic PTFE grafts is recommended. When the left renal vein is partly resected due to involvement of the tumor, reconstruction of left renal vein should also be performed to avoid renal impairment. If the right renal vein does not show tumor involvement, the resected right renal vein can be used to reconstruct the left renal vein.","misc","wim"

The measure is widely used by researchers to explore the relationship between feeding style and child weight status but has not been evaluated comprehensively in a review or meta-analysis. The aims of this study were to 1) compare established median cutoffs for responsiveness and demandingness in parent feeding (k = 5; see Hughes et al., 2012) to current median splits along these two dimensions for a larger sample of articles (k = 19) and 2) evaluate the relation between children's BMI, demandingness and responsiveness, and parent feeding style categories. Results indicated that the cutoffs for responsiveness and demandingness initially established based on five studies of low-income families did not differ significantly with the addition of 19 studies. Child BMI z-scores (k = 8) were above average for all four parent feeding style categories and highest for indulgent parents, which was consistent with the literature outlining low-income children at higher risk for obesity and children of indulgent parents being particularly at risk. While heterogeneity of samples should be considered, study results suggested that the CFSQ distribution for responsiveness and demandingness was relatively generalizable across low-income samples, though heterogeneity was higher among caregiver's feeding style categories. Furthermore, the study confirmed that parent feeding styles were related to child weight status in a meaningful way, but all children in these low-income samples, on average, were heavier than their same-aged peers across all parent feeding styles.","misc","wim"

They also show promise for targets where previous efforts to identify noncovalent small molecule inhibitors have failed. However, our limited knowledge of covalent binding sites has hindered the discovery of novel ligands. Therefore, developing in silico methods to identify covalent binding sites is highly desirable. Here, we propose DeepCoSI, the first structure-based deep graph learning model to identify ligandable covalent sites in the protein. By integrating the characterization of the binding pocket and the interactions between each cysteine and the surrounding environment, DeepCoSI achieves state-of-the-art predictive performances. The validation on two external test sets which mimic the real application scenarios shows that DeepCoSI has strong ability to distinguish ligandable sites from the others. Finally, we profiled the entire set of protein structures in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) with DeepCoSI to evaluate the ligandability of each cysteine for covalent ligand design, and made the predicted data publicly available on website.","misc","wim"

However, information on the effect of autotoxins on root secretion characteristics and regulation of the composition of rhizosphere microorganisms by altered root exudates is limited. In this study, autotoxin ρ-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) was added to the soil of potted grapevine seedlings, CO2 pulse-labeling, and DNA stable isotope probing were used to track the rhizosphere microbiome that assimilates root exudates. Bacterial and fungal microbiomes that assimilated plant-derived carbon were identified by high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that 4-HBA treatment altered bacterial and fungal communities in 13C-labeled organisms, with a lower abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Gemmatimonas, Streptomyces, and Bacillus) and a higher abundance of potential pathogen fungi (e.g., Fusarium, Neocosmospora, Gibberella, and Fusicolla) by changing the composition of root exudates. The exogenous addition of upregulated compound mixtures of root exudates reduced the abundance of beneficial bacterial Bacillus and increased the abundance of potential pathogen fungi Gibberella. These results suggest that 4-HBA can alter root secretion properties and altered root exudates may enrich certain potential pathogens and reduce certain beneficial bacteria, thereby unbalancing the structure of the rhizosphere microbial community.","misc","wim"

In soybean, a typical short-day plant, 11 FT homologues are found in its genome, of which several homologues are functionally diversified in flowering pathways and the others including GmFT3a are yet unknown. In the current study, we characterized GmFT3a, which is located on the same chromosome as the flowering promoters GmFT2a and GmFT5a. Overexpression of GmFT3a significantly promoted flowering of Arabidopsis under the inductive long-day (LD) photoperiod. GmFT3a over-expressed soybean also flowered earlier than the control under LD, but they were not significantly different under inductive short-day (SD) conditions, indicating that GmFT3a acts as a flowering promoter in the non-inductive photoperiod in soybean. Compared with other GmFT homologues, GmFT3a exhibited a slighter effect in flowering promotion than GmFT2a, GmFT5a and GmFT2b under LD conditions. GmFT3a promoted flowering by regulating the expression of downstream flowering-related genes and also affected the expression of other GmFTs. According to the re-sequencing data, the regional distributions of two major haplotypes in 176 soybean varieties were analyzed. The varieties with GmFT3a-Hap2 haplotype matured relatively early, and relative higher expression of GmFT3a was detected in early maturing varieties, implying that Hap2 variation may contribute to the adaptation of soybean to higher latitude regions by increasing expression level of genes in metabolism and signaling pathways. The early flowering germplasm generated by overexpression of GmFT3a has potential to be planted at higher latitudes where non-inductive long day is dominant in the growing season, and GmFT3a can be used to fine-tune soybean flowering and maturity time and improve the geographical adaptation.","misc","wim"

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were used to characterize the prepared powders. The XRD results show that the composites prepared with 2 and 5 wt% MNa and sintered at 900 °C, show the formation of hydroxyapatite (HAP) structure, whereas that prepared with 10 wt% MNa leads to the formation of β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) structure. The HAP structure decomposes at 1000 °C and leads to the formation of biocomposite containing HAP, β and α-TCP. However, β-TCP composites show thermal stability. FTIR and structural refinement results show the incorporation of clay ions into the apatitic structure causing changes in the crystal structure of the formed calcium phosphate phases.

The indirect effect of impulsiveness mediated by depression and the moderating effect of impulsiveness on suicidal ideation was significant. Multiple comparisons showed that the indirect effects under different conditions of impulsiveness had statistical differences. The higher the impulsiveness was, the stronger the predictive effect of depression on suicidal ideation was. The present study confirms that people who have impulsive traits are riskier to generate suicidal thoughts because they are more likely to suffer from depression and that people who are depressive have even higher risk to develop suicidal thoughts when they simultaneously have impulsive traits. In clinical and health care work, when considering depression to prevent suicidal ideation, impulsiveness needs to be monitored throughout the process of premorbid and onset stages of depression.","misc","wim"
"1065",35963052,"Estimating bloodstain formation time by quantitative analysis of mtDNA degradation.","The estimation of bloodstain formation time is still an unsolved problem in forensic science and lacks accurate quantitative methods. Whether DNA can be adopted to estimate bloodstain formation time is still controversial, and there is no study to confirm the potential of mtDNA markers. To address these issues, a triple quantification method based on the ratio of mtDNA fragments of different lengths of COⅠ (mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase Ⅰ) for estimating bloodstain formation time was established. A total of 152 samples (140 old samples, 12 fresh samples) were collected and tested, and the absolute copies of different-sized fragments of COⅠ (304 bp, 120 bp, 41 bp) in all samples were quantified by SYBR Green real-time qPCR. The natural logarithms of two copy number ratios (304 bp/41 bp, 120 bp/41 bp) of COⅠ in old samples were calculated, which were used as degradation indexes to evaluate the degradation degree of mtDNA. The 140 old human blood samples from 1 to 14 years of storage were accumulated from casework of forensic practice to establish the method of estimating bloodstain formation time and used to analyze the impact of gender factors on the two degradation indexes, and 10 animal samples and 2 fresh human samples were collected to verify the human specificity of the method. There was a high correlation between degradation indexes and bloodstain formation time (the absolute values of correlation coefficients of these two degradation indexes were 0.901 and 0.758 respectively). A method with triple quantification and dual indexes estimating bloodstain formation timewas successfully established, which was highly human-specific. There was no statistically significant difference in degradation indexes between different gender samples (P > 0.05). This study confirmed that mtDNA can be utilized to estimate bloodstain formation time, which provides a new solution to the forensic problem of estimating the time of bloodstain formation.","misc","wim"

In this study, we discuss the role of miR-505-5p in acute rejection after liver transplantation and its putative regulating mechanism. We construct an allogeneic rat liver transplantation model, observe the morphological and pathological changes in liver tissue, detect the expression levels of Myd88, miR-505-5p, IL-10 and TNF-α, and confirm that Myd88 is one of the direct targets of miR-505. The effects of miR-505-5p on the Myd88/TRAF6/NF-κB and MAPK pathways are detected both in vitro and in vivo, and the standard markers of Kupffer cell M1/M2 polarization are also detected. The results of qRT-PCR experiments show that miR-505-5p has a downward trend in rats with acute rejection. Western blot analysis reveals that over-expression of miR-505-5p induces the reduction of NF-κB and MAPK pathways both in vitro and in vivo. The role of miR-505-5p in alleviating acute rejection after transplantation may be accomplished by inducing M2-type polarization of Kupffer cells. In conclusion, we find that miR-505-5p alleviates acute rejection of liver transplantation by inducing M2 polarization of macrophages via the Myd88/TRAF6 axis, which suggests a potential strategy based on miRNAs in the follow-up treatment of liver transplantation.","misc","wim"

"1770",35966484,"War, immigration and COVID-19: The experience of Afghan immigrants to Iran Amid the pandemic.","Afghanistan's domestic upheaval following the Taliban's invasion leads to massive displacement of its population. The number of Afghan refugees in Iran has dramatically increased since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021. Multiple pre-and post-migratory traumatic experiences affect immigrants' physical, psychological, social, and economic wellbeing. The coronavirus outbreak, considered a traumatic experience in human life in the 21st century, added to their problems in Iran and exposed them to new challenges. This qualitative study aimed to investigate their experiences early before, during, and after immigration and the pandemic's challenges to their lives in Iran. In the present qualitative study, ten Afghan residents living in Iran who immigrated to Iran legally or illegally since the summer of 2021 and the last year after the second Taliban invasion were selected via purposive sampling. A semi-structured interview was applied to gather the data, and the data were analyzed through Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis method. Ten male participants with a mean age of 26 y/o were interviewed. Their residence in Iran was between 20 days and 8 months. Four main themes were extracted. The first theme, the Tsunami of suffering, represents a disruption of the normal flow of life. Six subthemes, including loss, being near death, insecurity, sudden hopelessness, leaving the country involuntarily, and reluctance to explore underlying emotions, are included in this category. The second one, Lost in space, describes the participant's attempt to leave Afghanistan following the extensive losses and violent death threats. Their experiences are categorized into four subthemes: the miserable trip, encountering death, life-threatening experiences, and being physically and verbally abused. The third theme, with its five subthemes, try to demonstrate the participants' experiences after getting to their destination in Iran. The last one, Challenges of the COVID-19 explained the experience of Taliban return, war trauma, running away, and living as a refugee or immigrant coincided with the COVID pandemic. Our interviewees explained multiple and successive traumatic experiences of war, migration, and the pandemic. The central clinical features of survivors are fears of losing control, being overwhelmed, and inability to cope. They felt abandoned because not only lost their family support in their homeland but could not also receive support in Iran due to the pandemic-related social distancing and isolation. They were dissociated and emotionally numb when describing their experience, which is a hallmark of experiencing severe, unprocessed traumas. Gaining a better understanding of Afghan refugees lived experiences may help provide them with better social and health care support. Proper mental and physical healthcare support and de-stigmatization programs may reduce the impact of multiple traumas on their wellbeing.","misc","wim"

This study categorized the long-term LDL-C trajectory and determined its association with the incidence of atherosclerotic CVD in patients with CKD according to diabetes status and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The risk of atherosclerotic CVD was estimated in 137,127 Taiwanese patients with CKD using six LDL-C trajectory classes determined by the latent class mixed model as optimal, near optimal, above optimal, borderline, sustained high, and declined high over 5 years. The risk of CVD was higher in the sustained high LDL-C [>160 mg/dL over time; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.45-1.94], declined high LDL-C (>160 to <100 mg/dL; aHR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.11-1.38), and borderline LDL-C (approximately 140 mg/dL over time; aHR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.07-1.26) groups than in the optimal LDL-C group (<100 mg/dL over time). There was no such association in patients with an eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2. Persistent diabetes was associated with a 1.15-2.47-fold increase in CVD in patients with high LDL-C (>120 mg/dL). The LDL-C trajectory pattern was associated with the phenotype of CVD risk. The degree of risk varied according to eGFR and diabetes status. A stable low LDL-C over time was potentially beneficial for prevention of CVD. Intensive lipid management and periodic assessment of LDL-C is essential to reduce the risk of CVD in patients with CKD and diabetes.","misc","wim"

A total of 65 patients with non-obstructive HCM and normal left ventricular ejection fraction were enrolled and 60 healthy subjects were selected as controls. The automated function imaging (AFI)-two-dimensional ultrasonic speckle-tracking technology was used to obtain the values for peak global longitudinal strain (GLS), longitudinal strain peak time dispersion (PSD), 18-segment systolic longitudinal peak strain (LPS), 18-segment longitudinal strain peak time (TTPLS), global waste work (GWW), global constructive work (GCW), global work index (GWI), global work efficiency (GWE), and exercise metabolic equivalents (METS). (1) Values for LV-GLS (-17.77 ± 0.20 vs. -21.66 ± 0.42%) were lower and PSD (95.10 ± 8.15 vs. 28.97 ± 1.50 ms) was prolonged in patients with HCM (p < 0.01). (2) An increasing trend was shown in the basal segment < intermediate segment < apical segment for both patients with HCM and controls, although each segment had lower values in the HCM group. (3) TTPLS was prolonged in the HCM group (p < 0.01). (4) GWE, GWI, and GCW were all lower (p < 0.01) and GWW was higher in patients with HCM (p < 0.01). (5) Values of GWE were less than 92.5%, GWI less than 1,200 mmHg, GCW less than 1,399 mmHg, these abnormal values are helpful for the diagnosis of impaired exercise tolerance and poor prognosis (6) The METS and LV-GLS of HCM in the asymmetric group were significantly lower than that in AHCM group, but the PSD was significantly greater than that in the AHCM group.

The results showed that the flavor of HGM decreased significantly after freezing. With the increase of freezing rate, the contents of aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, acids, esters, others, free amino acids and 5'-nucleotides were higher, and the content of specific substances was also generally increased. All samples from unfrozen and frozen HGM could be divided into four groups using an electronic nose based on different flavor characteristics. Seven common key aroma components were determined by relative odor activity value (ROAV), including hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, (E)-oct-2-enal, (2E,4E)-deca-2,4-dienal and oct-1-en-3-ol. The higher the freezing rate, the greater the ROAVs. Taste activity values calculated by all taste substances were far <1, and the direct contribution of the substances to the taste of HGM was not significant. The equivalent umami concentration of HGM frozen at -80°C was the highest. These findings indicated that higher freezing rate was more conducive to the retention of flavor substances in HGM, and the flavor fidelity effect of freezing at -80°C was particularly remarkable.","misc","wim"
"84",35958669,"Heart rhythm assessment in elite endurance athletes: A better method?","Arrhythmias also occur among elite endurance athletes. Conventional diagnostic tools for assessment of arrhythmias suffer from limited availability and usability challenges, particularly under the demanding training conditions of an elite athlete. Among endurance athletes, there is a need for out-of-hospital monitoring to enhance detection of arrhythmias under conditions that are relevant and potentially provocative of underlying pathology. The Norwegian patch ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor has been developed to simplify the assessment of heart rhythm disorders. The current study aimed to evaluate the ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor function and usability in an elite athlete environment. A total of 13 professional cyclists from the UNO-X Pro Cycling Team were examined with the ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor during training camp in Spain, December 2021. All ECG data were analyzed by cardiologists at Sorlandet Hospital Arendal, Norway. The athletes also completed a brief questionnaire registering their training (from on-bike monitoring units) and provided self-assessment of usability parameters after the test. In 8 of 13 athletes (69% male, age 23 ± 4 years), two test periods were performed with different ECG patches, resulting in a total of 21 tests with continuous ECG monitoring. Average total ECG test duration per athlete was 144 ± 47 h (89 ± 24 h/patch). Athletes performed an average of 15 ± 5 training h during each test. The ECG quality from all tests was considered satisfactory for rhythm analysis-also during exercise. The reported usability of the ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor was high, and no athletes reported trouble sleeping or training with the sensor. The automatic arrhythmia algorithm reported episodes of possible arrhythmias in 5 (24%) tests; 2 atrial flutter, 2 supraventricular tachycardia and 1 bradycardia (heart rate <30/min). Manual assessment by physicians verified the episode of bradycardia but revealed normal sinus rhythm in all other tests. No false negative events were identified in over 1,800 h of ECG collection. The ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor allowed for high quality ECG monitoring with high usability during intensive exercise in athletes.","misc","wim"
"582",35966516,"Crosstalk between dendritic cells and T lymphocytes during atherogenesis: Focus on antigen presentation and break of tolerance.","Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease resulting from an impaired lipid and immune homeostasis, where the interaction between innate and adaptive immune cells leads to the promotion of atherosclerosis-associated immune-inflammatory response. Emerging evidence has suggested that this response presents similarities to the reactivity of effector immune cells toward self-epitopes, often as a consequence of a break of tolerance. In this context, dendritic cells, a heterogeneous population of antigen presenting cells, play a key role in instructing effector T cells to react against foreign antigens and T regulatory cells to maintain tolerance against self-antigens and/or to patrol for self-reactive effector T cells. Alterations in this delicate balance appears to contribute to atherogenesis. The aim of this review is to discuss different DC subsets, and their role in atherosclerosis as well as in T cell polarization. Moreover, we will discuss how loss of T cell tolerogenic phenotype participates to the immune-inflammatory response associated to atherosclerosis and how a better understanding of these mechanisms might result in designing immunomodulatory therapies targeting DC-T cell crosstalk for the treatment of atherosclerosis-related inflammation.","misc","wim"

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of two types of copper salts (CuSO4 and Cu(NO3)2), added in two different amounts in soil (150 mg/kg, respectively 300 mg/kg), on assimilating pigments, total polyphenols, antioxidant activity and the elemental composition of wheat. The obtained results were compared with those from control plants grown in the same conditions but without copper salts. The amount of assimilating pigments, total polyphenols, and antioxidant activity respectively increases or decreases in the plants treated with copper salts compared to the control depending on the stage of development of the plant. No significant damage induced in the leaves of the wheat plants treated with the selected salts was observed following the TEM analysis. In six-week-old plants it was observed by EDX analysis that the salts are transformed into nanoparticles. The bioactive compounds, elemental composition and their interaction is influenced by concentration of metal's salt, type of salt and exposure period.","misc","wim"

Biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are diverse chemical substances emitted by Trichoderma spp. The potential role of VOCs in biological control and plant growth promotion has recently been recognized. Here, the Trichoderma-VOCs' performance for plant growth promotion and suppression of plant pathogens are evaluated. We further investigated VOC emission profiles of T. harzianum using GC-MS. The Trichoderma-VOCs exhibited significant (p < 0.05) antifungal properties against all tested pathogenic fungi. T. atroviride-VOCs showed a decisive inhibition of Alternaria panax, Botrytis cinerea, Cylindrocarpon destructans, and Sclerotinia nivalis. The germinating seeds demonstrated growth enhancement in the presence of Trichoderma-VOCs emitted by different strains. Low levels of cyclopentasiloxane, decamethyl, cyclotetrasiloxane, and octamethyl were found in T. harzianum KNU1 strain whereas cyclopentasiloxane, decamethyl, cyclotetrasiloxane, and octamethyl showed higher emission levels as Si-containing compounds. The results reveal the potentiality of VOCs as a biocontrol resource against deleterious rhizosphere microorganisms and underline the importance of Trichoderma-VOCs emissions in regulating plant growth and development.","misc","wim"

Although blistering in hereditary epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is pathogenetically linked to genetic deficiency of distinct proteins of the epidermis or the dermal-epidermal junction, circulating autoantibodies against these proteins have also been identified in EB patients. So far, autoantibodies have been considered bystanders in EB and active pathogenicity of them in EB has not been disclosed. In sera of a cohort of 258 EB patients, we found by ELISA in 22% of the patients autoantibodies against the bullous pemphigoid antigen BP180. The titers correlated negatively with collagen VII skin expression and positively with disease severity. Among those patients, we identified six (2.33%) with clinical features of an autoimmune bullous disorder (AIBD) and positive indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) staining. In literature, we found four more cases of EB patients developing disease-aggravating AIBD. Co-existence of these two rare skin disorders suggests that EB patients have a predisposition for the development of AIBD. Our work highlights that EB patients with increased itch or blister formation should be evaluated for additional AIBD and repeated screening for changes in autoantibody titers and skin-binding specificities is advised.","misc","wim"

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) compounded with recombinant human collagen type I scaffolds (CellSaics) have a higher potential for cell survival and engraftment compared with solo-MSCs, and we investigated the validity of intracerebral transplantation of CellSaic in a chronic ICH model. Rat CellSaics (rCellSaics) were produced by rat bone marrow-derived MSC (rBMSCs). The secretion potential of neurotrophic factors and the cell proliferation rate were compared under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. rCellSaics, rBMSCs, or saline were transplanted into the hollow cavity of a rat chronic ICH model. Functional and histological analyses were evaluated, and single-photon emission computed tomography for benzodiazepine receptors was performed to monitor sequential changes in neuronal integrity. Furthermore, human CellSaics (hCellSaics) were transplanted into a chronic ICH model in immunodeficient rats. Antibodies neutralizing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were used to elucidate its mode of action. rCellSaics demonstrated a higher secretion potential of trophic factors and showed better cell proliferation in the OGD condition. Animals receiving rCellSaics displayed better neurological recovery, higher intracerebral BDNF, and better cell engraftment; they also showed a tendency for less brain atrophy and higher benzodiazepine receptor preservation. hCellSaics also promoted significant functional recovery, which was reversed by BDNF neutralization. Intracerebral transplantation of CellSaics enabled neurological recovery in a chronic ICH model and may be a good option for clinical application.","misc","wim"

However, the modulation of PEDV infection upon the activation of the host's innate immune response has not been fully characterized. In this study, we observed that various IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were upregulated significantly in a time- and dose-dependent manner in LLC-PK1 cells infected with the PEDV G2 strain FJzz1. The transcriptions of IRF9 and STAT1 were increased markedly in the late stage of FJzz1 infection and the promotion of the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1, implicating the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway during FJzz1 infection. In addition, abundant type I/III IFNs were produced after FJzz1 infection. However, type I/III IFNs and ISGs decreased greatly in FJzz1-infected LLC-PK1 cells following the silencing of the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), including RIG-I and MDA5, and the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) adaptors, MyD88 and TRIF. Altogether, FJzz1 infection induces the production of type-I/III IFNs in LLC-PK1 cells, in which RLRs and TLRs signaling pathways are involved, followed by the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, triggering the production of numerous ISGs to exert antiviral effects of innate immunity.","misc","wim"

Herein, a g-C3N4 nanoball/BiOCl nanotube heterojunction prepared by a simple one-step acetonitrile solvothermal method is reported. The XRD results prove that the g-C3N4/BiOCl composites can be prepared in one step. SEM results revealed that the g-C3N4 was spherical and the BiOCl was tubular. The HRTEM results indicate that g-C3N4 has an amorphous structure and that the (100) crystal plane of BiOCl borders the g-C3N4. Spherical g-C3N4 has a narrow band gap (approximately 1.94 eV), and the band gap of g-C3N4/BiOCl after modification was also narrow. When the BiOCl accounted for 30% of the g-C3N4/BiOCl by mass, the quasi-primary reaction rate constant of RhB degradation was 45 times that of g-C3N4. This successful preparation method for optimizing g-C3N4 involving simple one-step template-free synthesis may be adopted for the preparation of diverse-shapes and high-performance nanomaterials in the future.","misc","wim"

Although SINE ncRNAs are generally transcriptionally repressed, they can be induced in response to viral infections and can stimulate immune signaling pathways. Indeed, mutations in RNA Pol III have been associated with poor antiviral interferon response following infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV). In this study, we probed the role of Pol III transcripts in the detection and initial immune response to VZV by characterizing the transcriptional response following VZV infection of wild type A549 lung epithelial cells as well as A549 cells lacking specific RNA sensors MAVS and TLR3, or interferon-stimulated genes RNase L and PKR in presence or absence of functional RNA Pol III. Multiple components of the antiviral sensing and interferon signaling pathways were involved in restricting VZV replication in lung epithelial cells thus suggesting an innate defense system with built-in redundancy. In addition, RNA Pol III silencing altered the antiviral transcriptional program indicating that it plays an essential role in the sensing of VZV infection.","misc","wim"

However, the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have limited social contact to protect vulnerable groups in care homes, and even if technology use has increased in other areas, there is little known about the potential uptake of communication technology and changes in social interaction in the care context during a lasting crisis. This paper explores changes in communication technology use triggered by the pandemic at two care homes, using a qualitative diary study, online interviews and observations, and in-situ interviews within the care home with residents and workers. Our findings point to increasing use of tablets and video conference software triggered by COVID-related experiences, with implications for living and working in care homes. We also characterise the isolation experience of the residents, the workers' concerns about the residents and changes in social interaction. We observed new areas of technology usage, associated changing work practices, technical affinity issues and context-specific attitudes towards future technologies. While the pandemic has triggered the use of communication technology in care homes on a small scale, this has also caused increasing workload and in particular articulation work, which requires support structures and the re-definition of work roles.","misc","wim"

Despite this established knowledge, research has primarily focused on the general population and among health workers. Therefore, understanding stress related experiences in the context of professional sport would help design appropriate stress management interventions for effective coping. The overarching aim of this research was to assess occupational stress related experiences among players and coaches in the Ghana premier league. The study sought to assess: (1) the prevalence and sources of stressors among players and coaches, and (2) how age and years of experience influenced the stressors they experienced. Using a census survey, 44 premier league coaches and 424 players who were officially registered by 17 premier league clubs completed the intensity dimension of the Organizational Stressor Indicator for Sport Performers which has 5 subscales namely: Goals and Development, Logistics and Operations, Team and Culture, Coaching and Selection. Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviation) and multivariate analysis of variance were used to analyze the data. The results revealed that stressors were prevalent among football players and coaches, with these being significantly more dominant among coaches, p < 0.001. Selection was identified as the most predominant stressor for coaches (i.e., selecting players to play) and players (i.e., being selected). Age and experience were found not to be significant predictors of stressors for players and coaches in Ghana.

"965",35959373,"ABCD3 is a prognostic biomarker for glioma and associated with immune infiltration: A study based on oncolysis of gliomas.","Gliomas are the most lethal primary brain tumors and are still a major therapeutic challenge. Oncolytic virus therapy is a novel and effective means for glioma. However, little is known about gene expression changes during this process and their biological functions on glioma clinical characteristics and immunity. The RNA-seq data after oncolytic virus EV-A71 infection on glioma cells were analyzed to screen significantly downregulated genes. Once ABCD3 was selected, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) data were used to analyze the relationship between ABCD3 expression and clinical characteristics in glioma. We also evaluated the influence of ABCD3 on the survival of glioma patients. CIBERSORT and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) were also used to investigate the correlation between ABCD3 and cancer immune infiltrates. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to functionally annotate the potential functions or signaling pathways related to ABCD3 expression. ABCD3 was among the top 5 downregulated genes in glioma cells after oncolytic virus EV-A71 infection and was significantly enriched in several GO categories. Both the mRNA and protein expression levels of ABCD3 were upregulated in glioma samples and associated with the prognosis and grades of glioma patients. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve analysis revealed that patients with high ABCD3 expression had shorter disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) than those with low ABCD3 expression. Moreover, ABCD3 expression could affect the immune infiltration levels and diverse immune marker sets in glioma. A positive correlation was found between ABCD3 and macrophages and active dendritic cells in the microenvironment of both the GBM and LGG. Gene sets including the plk1 pathway, tyrobp causal network, ir-damage and cellular response, and interleukin-10 signaling showed significant differential enrichment in the high ABCD3 expression phenotype. Our results suggested that ABCD3 could be a potential biomarker for glioma prognosis and immunotherapy response and also further enriched the theoretical and molecular mechanisms of oncolytic virus treatment for malignant gliomas.","misc","wim"
"552",35966650,"Chemical fertilizer reduction combined with bio-organic fertilizers increases cauliflower yield via regulation of soil biochemical properties and bacterial communities in Northwest China.","The continuous application of chemical fertilizers in vegetable cropping has led to deterioration of the soil environment and reduced yield and quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of combining chemical and bio-organic fertilizers on cauliflower yield, soil biochemical properties, and the bacterial community. Six treatments were established: no fertilizer (CK, control), chemical fertilizers (CF, conventional dosage for this region), balanced fertilization (BF, 30% reduction of chemical fertilizers), and balanced fertilization plus 3,000, 6,000, or 12,000 kg.ha-1 bio-organic fertilizer (Lvneng Ruiqi Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Gansu, China) (BF + OF1, BF + OF2, BF + OF3, respectively). A two-season field experiment with cauliflower was conducted under the different fertilizer treatments in irrigation districts along the Yellow River, Northwest China. The results indicate that the yield, soil organic matter, total potassium content, and enzyme activity under the bio-organic treatments were generally higher than those under the CF treatment. Compared with the CF treatment, the BF treatment increased soil organic matter content, enzyme activity and soil bacterial relative abundance. Moreover, the bacterial alpha-diversity were higher than those of conventional fertilization. The predominant phyla, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Chloroflexi, were the main contributors to the microbiome shift, as demonstrated by their remarkable enrichment in the soil under BF + OF2 and BF + OF3 treatments. Furthermore, Pearson correlation analyses show significant correlations among the soil organic matter, available P and K, electrical conductivity, and relative abundance of potentially beneficial microbial groups, such as the genera Massilia, Bacillus, Lysobacter, and Nitrosospira. Overall, this study suggests that balanced fertilization and the application of bio-organic fertilizers are essential to ensure soil fertility and long-term sustainable green productivity.","misc","wim"

Health follow-up management services can encourage patients with hypertension to improve their health behavior and outcomes. However, a lack of studies on the relationship between specific factors of follow-up management and both subjective and objective health outcome among hypertensive patients exists. The current study investigated the relationship between service content, frequency, mode, and institutions of follow-up management and health outcomes among Chinese hypertensives. Data were obtained from the sixth National Health Service Survey (NHSS) of Jiangsu Province, which was conducted in 2018. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the sample characteristics and the utilization of follow-up management services. Both multiple linear regression and logistic regression were used to estimate the association of follow-up management service and other factors with hypertensives' subjective and objective health outcomes. Some respondents (19.30%) reported hypertension, and 75.36% of these patients obtained follow-up management services. Hypertensive patients' subjective health outcome self-reported health status and objective health outcome blood pressure (BP) control were found to be significantly associated with follow-up management services. The outcomes were both significantly improved by a high frequency of management services, a high level of follow-up providers, the mode of visiting healthcare facilities and/or calling, and receiving instructions on medication use. However, inquiring about patients' symptoms was negatively associated with self-reported health status and BP control. In addition, BP measurement was significantly and positively associated with hypertensive patients' self-reported health status; the patients receiving lifestyle guidance were more likely to have their BP levels under control. Hypertension management strategies should further focus on the frequency of healthcare follow-up management via categorization of the follow-up services and appropriate adjustment of service delivery modes to optimize health follow-up management for hypertensives further improve their outcomes. Meanwhile, complementary policies are also needed to address other socioeconomic factors that can promote good health conditions for hypertension patients.","misc","wim"

Nowadays, digital pathology is an innovative tool for pathologists in diagnosis and acquiring new learning. However, a recurring problem in health services is the excessive workload in all medical services. For this reason, it is required to develop computational tools that assist histological evaluation. This work proposes a methodology for the quantitative analysis of BC tissue that follows NGS. The proposed methodology is based on digital image processing techniques through which the BC tissue can be characterized automatically. Moreover, the proposed nuclei characterization was helpful for grade differentiation in carcinoma images of the BC tissue reaching an 0.84 accuracy. In addition, a metric was proposed to assess the likelihood of a structure in the tissue corresponding to a tubule by considering spatial and geometrical characteristics between lumina and its surrounding nuclei, reaching an accuracy of 0.83. Tests were performed from different databases and under various magnification and staining contrast conditions, showing that the methodology is reliable for histological breast tissue analysis.","misc","wim"

Despite the promising results of immunotherapies, ICI-related pneumonitis (ICIP) is a potentially fatal adverse event. Therefore, early detection of patients at risk for developing ICIP before the initiation of immunotherapy is critical for alleviating future complications with early interventions and improving treatment outcomes. In this study, we present the first reported work that explores the potential of deep learning to predict patients who are at risk for developing ICIP. To this end, we collected the pretreatment baseline CT images and clinical information of 24 patients who developed ICIP after immunotherapy and 24 control patients who did not. A multimodal deep learning model was constructed based on 3D CT images and clinical data. To enhance performance, we employed two-stage transfer learning by pre-training the model sequentially on a large natural image dataset and a large CT image dataset, as well as transfer learning. Extensive experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the key components used in our method. Using five-fold cross-validation, our method accurately distinguished ICIP patients from non-ICIP patients, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.918 and accuracy of 0.920. This study demonstrates the promising potential of deep learning to identify patients at risk for developing ICIP. The proposed deep learning model enables efficient risk stratification, close monitoring, and prompt management of ICIP, ultimately leading to better treatment outcomes.","misc","wim"

Taking the area within the Sixth Ring Road of Beijing as an example, based on Landsat remote sensing images, meteorological stations, and questionnaires, this study established a relational model between temperature and hostility and then analyzed the changes in the emotional health risk (hostility) in the study area and the mechanism of how outdoor activity duration influences hostility. Results show that: (1) the area within the Sixth Ring Road of Beijing had a higher and higher temperature from 1991 to 2020. Low-temperature areas gradually shrank, and medium- and high-temperature areas extended outwards from the center. (2) The threat of high temperature to residents' hostility gradually intensified-the sphere of influence expanded, low-risk areas quickly turned into medium-high-risk areas, and the level of hostility risk increased. Level 1 risk areas of hostility had the most obvious reduction-a 74.33% reduction in area proportion; meanwhile, Level 3 risk areas had the most significant growth-a 50.41% increase in area proportion. (3) In the first 120 min of outdoor activities under high temperature, residents' hostility was negatively correlated with outdoor activity duration; after more than 120 min, hostility became positively correlated with duration. Therefore, figuring out how temperature changes influence human emotions is of great significance to improving the living environment and health level of residents. This study attempts to (1) explore the impact of temperature changes and outdoor activity duration on hostility, (2) evaluate residents' emotional health risk levels affected by high temperature, and (3) provide a theoretical basis for the early warning mechanism of emotional health risk and the planning of healthy cities.","misc","wim"

However, the extent of such phenotypic changes remains unclear. We investigated the influence of trematode infection on the shell morphology of Bulinus tropicus, a common host of medically important trematodes. We focused on a snail population from crater lake Kasenda (Uganda). We sampled a single homogeneous littoral habitat to minimize the influence of environmental variation on shell phenotype, and barcoded snails to document snail genotypic variation. Among the 257 adult snails analysed, 99 tested positive for trematode infection using rapid-diagnostic PCRs. Subsequently we used high-throughput amplicon sequencing to identify the trematode (co-)infections. For 86 out of the 99 positive samples trematode species delineation could discriminate among combinations of (co-)infection by 11 trematode species. To avoid confounding effects, we focused on four prevalent trematode species. We performed landmark-based geometric morphometrics to characterize shell phenotype and used regressions to examine whether shell size and shape were affected by trematode infection and the developmental stage of infection (as inferred from read counts). Snails infected by Petasiger sp. 5, Echinoparyphium sp. or Austrodiplostomum sp. 2 had larger shells than uninfected snails or than those infected by Plagiorchiida sp. Moreover, the shell shape of snails infected solely by Petasiger sp. 5 differed significantly from that of uninfected snails and snails infected with other trematodes, except from Austrodiplostomum sp. 2. Shape changes included a more protuberant apex, an inward-folded outer apertural lip and a more adapically positioned umbilicus. Size differences were more pronounced in snails with 'late' infections (>25 days) compared to earlier-stage infections. No phenotypic differences were found between snails infected by a single trematode species and those harbouring co-infections. Further work is required to assess the complex causal links between trematode infections and shell morphological alterations of snail hosts.","misc","wim"

Three individual Pseudomonas sp. strains showed different capabilities of growing and producing PHAs in the presence of a synthetic mixture of SMCFAs. Pseudomonas sp. GL06 exhibited the highest SMCFA tolerance and produced PHAs with the highest productivity (2.7 mg/L h). Based on these observations, this strain was selected for further investigations on PHA production in a fed-batch bioreactor with a SMCFA-rich stream extracted from the effluent. The results showed that PHA productivity reached up to 4.5 mg/L h at 24 h of fermentation together with the ammonium exhaustion in the growth medium. Moreover, the PHA monomeric composition varied with the bacterial strain and the type of the growth medium used. Furthermore, a differential scanning calorimetric and thermogravimetric analysis showed that a short- and medium-chain-length PHA copolymer made of 3-hydroxybutyric, -hexanoic, -octanoic, -decanoic, and -dodecanoic has promising properties. The ability of Pseudomonas sp. to produce tailored PHA copolymers together with the range of possible applications opens new perspectives in the development of PHA bioproduction as a part of an integrated valorization process of SMCFAs derived from waste streams.","misc","wim"

Additionally, we examined the relative importance of sexual and asexual reproduction in the studied populations and their genetic diversity. A total of 541 individuals from 20 localities were sampled and analysed with 19 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Of the genotyped individuals, 482 (89%) had unique multilocus genotypes. Clonality percentages of the populations varied from 0% (in eight populations) to nearly 69% (in one population from Crete). A heterozygosity deficit and a high degree of inbreeding was the general trend in our data set. Population differentiation in C. caespitosa was characterised by significant pairwise F ST values with lower ones observed at an intraregional scale and higher ones, between populations from different biogeographic regions. Genetic structure analyses showed that the populations are divided according to the three main sub-basins of the Mediterranean Sea: the Western (Balearic, Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas), the Central (Adriatic and Ionian seas) and the Eastern (Levantine and Aegean seas), coinciding with previously described gene flow barriers. However, the three easternmost populations were also clearly separated from one another, and a substructure was observed for the other studied areas. An isolation-by-distance pattern was found among, but not within, the three main population groups. This substructure is mediated mainly by dispersal along the coastline and some resistance to larval movement through the open sea. Despite the low dispersal ability and high self-recruitment rate of C. caespitosa, casual dispersive events between regions seem to be enough to maintain the species' considerable genetic diversity. Understanding the population connectivity and structure of this endangered scleractinian coral allows for more informed conservation decision making.","misc","wim"

This study aims to uncover the essential role and the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of the m6A reader YTHDC1 in promoting triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) metastasis. In vitro and in vivo models were employed to determine the pathological function of YTHDC1 in TNBC metastasis. To identify bona fide YTHDC1 target RNAs, we conducted RNA-seq, m6A-seq, and RIP-seq, followed by integrative data analysis and validation assays. By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, we found that elevated expression of YTHDC1 is positively correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Using a mammary fat pad mouse model of TNBC, YTHDC1 significantly promoted lung metastasis of TNBC cells. Through multiple transcriptome-wide sequencing and integrative data analysis, we revealed dysregulation of metastasis-related pathways following YTHDC1 depletion and identified SMAD3 as a bona fide YTHDC1 target RNA. Depletion of YTHDC1 caused nuclear retention of SMAD3 mRNA, leading to lower SMAD3 protein levels. Loss of YTHDC1 led to impaired TGF-β-induced gene expression, leading to inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppressed TNBC cell migration and invasion. SMAD3 overexpression was able to restore the response to TGF-β in YTHDC1 depleted TNBC cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the oncogenic role of YTHDC1 is mediated through its recognition of m6A as m6A-binding defective mutants of YTHDC1 were unable to rescue the impaired cell migration and invasion of YTHDC1 knockout TNBC cells. We show that YTHDC1 plays a critical oncogenic role in TNBC metastasis through promoting the nuclear export and expression of SMAD3 to augment the TGF-β signaling cascade. Overall, our study demonstrates that YTHDC1 is vital for TNBC progression by enhancing TNBC cell survival and TGF-β-mediated EMT via SMAD3 to enable the formation of distant metastasis and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting the YTHDC1/m6A/SMAD3 axis for TNBC treatment.","misc","wim"

However, several variables, including improper mechanization, limited arable land, and the presence of several biotic and abiotic pressures, continually impact agricultural productivity. Drought is a notable destructive abiotic stress and may be the most serious challenge confronting sustainable agriculture, resulting in a significant crop output deficiency. Numerous morphological and physiological changes occur in plants as a result of drought stress. Hence, there is a need to create mitigation techniques since these changes might permanently harm the plant. Current methods used to reduce the effects of drought stress include the use of film farming, super-absorbent hydrogels, nanoparticles, biochar, and drought-resistant plant cultivars. However, most of these activities are money and labor-intensive, which offer limited plant improvement. The use of plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) has proven to be a preferred method that offers several indirect and direct advantages in drought mitigation. PGPB are critical biological elements which have favorable impacts on plants' biochemical and physiological features, leading to improved sugar production, relative water content, leaf number, ascorbic acid levels, and photosynthetic pigment quantities. This present review revisited the impacts of PGPB in ameliorating the detrimental effects of drought stress on plants, explored the mechanism of action employed, as well as the major challenges encountered in their application for plant growth and development.","misc","wim"

The hybridization of cDNA and aptamer drew TAMRA close to repeated G bases, then the fluorescence of TAMRA was quenched by G bases due to the photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Upon introducing the pesticide target, the aptamer bound to pesticide instead of cDNA because of the competition between pesticide and cDNA. Thus, the TAMRA departed from G bases, resulting in fluorescence recovery of TAMRA.

"1205",35966462,"Tourettic OCD: Current understanding and treatment challenges of a unique endophenotype.","Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and chronic tic disorders (CTD) including Tourette Syndrome (TS) are often comorbid conditions. While some patients present with distinct symptoms of CTD and/or OCD, a subset of patients demonstrate a unique overlap of symptoms, known as Tourettic OCD (TOCD), in which tics, compulsions, and their preceding premonitory urges are overlapping and tightly intertwined. The specific behaviors seen in TOCD are typically complex tic-like behaviors although with a compulsive and partially anxious nature reminiscent of OCD. TOCD is not classified within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-5) as an independent diagnostic entity, but mounting evidence suggests that TOCD is an intermediate neuropsychiatric disorder distinct from either TS or OCD alone and as such represents a unique phenomenology. In this review of TOCD we discuss clinical, genetic, environmental, neurodevelopmental, and neurocircuit-based research to better characterize our current understanding of this disorder. TOCD is characterized by earlier age of onset, male predominance, and specific symptom clusters such as lower tendency toward compulsions related to checking, cleaning, and reassurance seeking and higher tendency toward compulsions such as rubbing, tapping, or touching associated with symmetry concerns or thoughts of exactness. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) imaging suggests that TOCD symptoms may arise from involvement of an intermediate neurocircuitry distinct from classic OCD or classic CTD. Small cumulative contributions from multiple genetic loci have been implicated, as have environmental factors such as infection and perinatal trauma. In addition, this review addresses the treatment of TOCD which is especially complex and often treatment resistant and requires pharmacology and behavioral therapy in multiple modalities. Given the distressing impact of TOCD on patients' functioning, the goal of this review is to raise awareness of this distinct entity toward the goal of improving standards of care.","misc","wim"

IrOx samples in particular show high performances toward HER while the Pd samples show better performance toward ORR. In both reactions, electrocatalysts can compete with the high performance of Pt/C. Exemplary cyclic voltammetry durability tests with 1000 cycles and subsequent TEM analyses show good long-term stability of the materials. The results demonstrate the promising synergistic effects of NP-decorated CTF materials, resulting in a high electrocatalytic activity and stability.","misc","wim"

Fragile settings both exacerbate the risk of NCDs and undermine systems capacity. Lebanon is a setting where strategies to address rising NCDs burden have faced particularly acute contextual challenges. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with patients accessing non-communicable disease across 11 primary care centers within the Greater Beirut and Beqaa areas. Response were received from 1,700 patients. We generated a Clinical Management Index Score as a measure of quality of care, and scores related to a range of socio-demographic characteristics and other context specific variables. Significantly higher clinical management index scores (better quality of care) were associated with patients living in the semi-urban/rural context of Beqaa (compared to Greater Beirut), having health insurance coverage, aged above 60, having high levels of educational attainment, and making partial or full payment for their treatment. Relatively lower index scores (poorer quality of care) were associated with Syrian nationality (compared to Lebanese) and with patients suffering from diabetes or hypertension (compared to comorbid patients). The study identified a wide margin for improving quality of NCDs care in fragile contexts with particular gaps identified in referral to ophthalmology, accessing all prescribed medication and receiving counseling for smoking cessation. Additionally, findings indicate a number of predictors of comparatively poor quality of care that warrant attention, notably with regard to Syrian nationality/legal status, lack of health coverage, seeking free health provision and lower educational attachment. Although these are all relevant risk factors, the findings call on donor agencies, NGOs and provider institutions to design targeted programs and activities that especially ensure equitable delivery of services to diabetic and hypertensive patients with compounded vulnerability as a result of a number of these factors.","misc","wim"

To achieve this goal is possible by continuous improvement of health care system, search of new solutions to assigned tasks, development of medical care of population. Over the past 20 years, health care system of the Russian Federation underwent a number of significant changes. In the Strategy of Development of Health Care of the Russian Federation for the Long-Term Period 2015-2030 it is noted that to achieve highest possible level of development of health care with coordinated application of all national resources it is necessary to form health care system that integrates all medical services and organizations, regardless of their form of ownership and affiliation. This system is to function within single regulatory and legal framework (uniform requirements for quality and availability of medical care, qualifications of medical personnel, etc.), as well as uniform state, expert and public control. In this regard the study of prospects of using in health care of various organizational and legal forms of noncommercial organizations that contribute to formation of competitive environment in the industry, is of particular relevance, which should also affect quality of medical care provided. The article considers prospects for development of those organizational and legal forms of noncommercial organizations that are already functioning in health care system: state budgetary health care institutions, state autonomous health care institutions, autonomous noncommercial organizations, private institutions. According to the Federal Foundation of Mandatory Medical Insurance Register of medical organizations, on June 2021 about half of medical organizations in the Russian Federation are registered as budgetary organizations. Accordingly, predominant organizational and legal form is budgetary institution, which makes up to 55% of all medical organizations of various organizational and legal forms involved into mandatory medical insurance system. The percentage of state autonomous institutions comes to 8%, private healthcare institutions - 2%. The percentage of autonomous noncommercial organizations comes to 0.4%. The perspectives of development of each of these organizational and legal forms in health care system are analyzed in the article.","misc","wim"

Its role in transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia major yet needs to be clearly established. This study has been carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea as adjuvant therapy in pediatric cases of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia major disease. Materials and methods This quasi-experimental study was carried out at District Headquarter Hospital (DHQ), Zhob, from February 2021 to January 2022. One hundred ten cases fulfilling the inclusion-exclusion criteria were selected and divided into groups of 55 each. Group A cases received hydroxyurea (10-20 mg/kg/day) in addition to blood transfusion and chelation therapy. Group B received a blood transfusion and chelation therapy only. Both groups were compared in terms of blood transfusion requirement, mean hemoglobin, and mean serum ferritin levels. All the data were analyzed with SPSS 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Of Group A cases, three were dropped because of side effects of hydroxyurea, and two were lost to follow-up. Similarly, three cases of Group B lost to follow-up, one patient withdrew consent, and one child died at home; thus both groups were left with 50 cases each. The mean age of participants was 11.98 + 3.74 years. There were 51 males and 49 females. Both the groups were comparable in terms of age and gender. Similarly, mean hemoglobin levels and serum ferritin levels were comparable at the start of the study. After one year, there was a significant improvement in mean hemoglobin level (p<0.001) and a significant reduction in serum ferritin levels (p=0.014) in the group taking adjuvant hydroxyurea. The requirement of packed red blood cells (RBCs) significantly decreased in cases taking hydroxyurea (p<0.001). Conclusion Hydroxyurea is a safe and effective treatment that significantly decreases the packed RBC transfusion requirement in transfusion-dependent thalassemia children, improves hemoglobin levels, and reduces serum ferritin levels compared to the children on blood transfusions alone.","misc","wim"

However, MET fusions in NSCLC have rarely been revealed. In this report, a 63-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma (LADC), harboring EGFR exon 18 G719D and exon 21 L861Q mutations, received first-generation, EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) icotinib therapy. Next generation sequencing (NGS) results only displayed an EGFR T790M point mutation following icotinib resistance. Thus, the patient was treated with osimertinib and achieved a stable disease (SD). However, disease progressed after 15 months and a novel MET fusion (CUX1 exon14-MET exon15) in addition to EGFR G719D/L861Q mutations were simultaneously detected in a tissue biopsy sample. After more than nine months, the patient subsequently achieved a PR with the combination of icotinib and crizotinib. To our knowledge, this is the first case of LADC patient displaying the presence of EGFR double uncommon mutations and an acquired novel CUX1-MET fusion that has benefited from icotinib plus crizotinib treatment. Following nine months of PR with icotinib plus crizotinib, the patient, until the time of publication, is exhibiting stable disease. The results suggest that the CUX1-MET fusion may be sensitive to crizotinib, although previous reports indicated that some MET fusion cases did not respond to crizotinib. Given this disparity, distinguishing MET fusion partners when crizotinib is used in LADC treatment is also very important.","misc","wim"

To investigate the causal relationship between vitamin D and psoriasis. Cox proportional hazard model was used to investigate the association between vitamin D status and psoriasis in a prospective cohort study from UK Biobank. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are strongly associated with circulating 25OHD were constructed as instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization (MR) to determine the causality between vitamin D and psoriasis. During a median follow-up of 10.99 years, we identified 2,856 participants with incident psoriasis. The prospective cohort study demonstrated individuals with 25OHD deficiency (< 25 nmol/L) at baseline were associated with approximately 20% increased risk of incident psoriasis in different categories of sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) after adjusting for covariates. The largest effect size was observed in the obese group (BMI > 30 kg/m2), as 25OHD deficiency presented with 30% additional risk of incident psoriasis compared to those with 25OHD > 50 nmol/L (HR = 0.701; 95% CI: 0.583-0.843; p < 0.001). Additionally, 69 independent SNPs associated with circulating 25OHD level were selected for the MR analysis, and the result suggested that genetically predicted one standard deviation (SD) increment in log-transformed 25OHD was associated with 24% decreased risk of psoriasis (OR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60-0.98, p = 0.020). The association of 25OHD and severity of psoriasis could not be estimated in the current study. The combined prospective and MR analysis additionally provided evidence that the epidemiologically and genetically determined level of 25OHD conferred an increased risk of psoriasis.","misc","wim"
"2495",35957839,"A Big Role for microRNAs in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.","Maternal diabetes is associated with pregnancy complications and poses a serious health risk to both mother and child. Growing evidence suggests that pregnancy complications are more frequent and severe in pregnant women with pregestational type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the different types of maternal diabetes may lead to targeted strategies to prevent or reduce pregnancy complications. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs), one of the most common epigenetic mechanisms, have emerged as key players in the pathophysiology of pregnancy-related disorders including diabetes. This review aims to provide an update on the status of miRNA profiling in pregnancies complicated by maternal diabetes. Four databases, Pubmed, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and Scopus were searched to identify studies that profiled miRNAs during maternal diabetes. A total of 1800 articles were identified, of which 53 are included in this review. All studies profiled miRNAs during GDM, with no studies on miRNA profiling during pregestational T1DM and T2DM identified. Studies on GDM were mainly focused on the potential of miRNAs to serve as predictive or diagnostic biomarkers. This review highlights the lack of miRNA profiling in pregnancies complicated by T1DM and T2DM and identifies the need for miRNA profiling in all types of maternal diabetes. Such studies could contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that link maternal diabetes type with pregnancy complications.","misc","wim"

The present study aimed to compare the gene and protein expression of selected virally induced pathogen recognition receptors and interferon stimulated genes in islets from these newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (DiViD) subjects vs age-matched non-diabetic (ND) controls. RNA was extracted from laser-captured islets and Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST arrays used to obtain gene expression profiles. Lists of differentially expressed genes were subjected to a data-mining pipeline searching for enrichment of canonical pathways, KEGG pathways, Gene Ontologies, transcription factor binding sites and other upstream regulators. In addition, the presence and localisation of specific viral response proteins (PKR, MxA and MDA5) were examined by combined immunofluorescent labelling in sections of pancreatic tissue. The data analysis and data mining process revealed a significant enrichment of gene ontologies covering viral reproduction and infectious cycles; peptide translation, elongation and initiation, as well as oxidoreductase activity. Enrichment was identified in the KEGG pathways for oxidative phosphorylation; ribosomal and metabolic activity; antigen processing and presentation and in canonical pathways for mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation and EIF2 signaling. Protein Kinase R (PKR) expression did not differ between newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and ND islets at the level of total RNA, but a small subset of β-cells displayed markedly increased PKR protein levels. These PKR+ β-cells correspond to those previously shown to contain the viral protein, VP1. RNA encoding MDA5 was increased significantly in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes islets, and immunostaining of MDA5 protein was seen in α- and certain β-cells in both newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and ND islets, but the expression was increased in β-cells in type 1 diabetes. In addition, an uncharacterised subset of synaptophysin positive, but islet hormone negative, cells expressed intense MDA5 staining and these were more prevalent in DiViD cases. MxA RNA was upregulated in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes vs ND islets and MxA protein was detected exclusively in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes β-cells. The gene expression signatures reveal that pathways associated with cellular stress and increased immunological activity are enhanced in islets from newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients compared to controls. The increases in viral response proteins seen in β-cells in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes provide clear evidence for the activation of IFN signalling pathways. As such, these data strengthen the hypothesis that an enteroviral infection of islet β-cells contributes to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.","misc","wim"
"375",35958326,"Peripheral blood leukocyte mitochondrial DNA content and risk of lung cancer.","Previous studies of peripheral blood leukocyte mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and risk of lung cancer have yielded inconsistent results, and no studies have evaluated the association between mtDNA content and post-resection lung cancer outcomes. Using a case-control study design, we evaluated the association between mtDNA content and risk of lung cancer in 465 cases and 378 controls. We also evaluated the association between mtDNA content and survival in 189 cases with surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Relative mtDNA content was measured using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in peripheral blood genomic DNA. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, race, and smoking history. mtDNA content was lower in cases compared to controls, with medians of 1.26 [interquartile range (IQR), 0.98-1.70)] and 1.79 (IQR, 1.34-2.10; P<0.001), respectively. Compared to the quartile of subjects with the highest mtDNA content, there was significantly higher likelihood of lung cancer in the second lowest quartile (OR 3.44; 95% CI: 2.06-5.75) and the lowest quartile (OR 6.36; 95% CI: 3.86-10.47). In patients with resected NSCLC, there was no association between lower mtDNA content and recurrence-free survival (RFS) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.89; 95% CI: 0.47-1.66] or overall survival (OS) (HR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.35-1.46). Thus, our results counter previous studies and find that lower mtDNA content is associated with lung cancer risk. Our results suggest that mtDNA content could potentially serve as a risk biomarker, but is not associated with survival outcomes in NSCLC.","misc","wim"

The state of surface water requires special consideration in light of the water crisis caused by nitrogen pollution. In this study, the natural abundance of the nitrogen stable isotope (δ 15N) is measured and sampled in sediments and compared with the total dissolved nitrogen (DN) in four main Chinese tributaries of Hun River upper reach, including the Dasuhe, Beisanjia, Beikouqian, and Nanzamu tributaries. Results show that for the Dasuhe and Nankouqian tributaries, the δ 15N values of sediment samples in 2016 are all significantly higher than previous values in 2011. In the Dasuhe tributary, this change is attributed to the promotion of organic agricultural production under which chemical fertilizers are replaced by organic fertilizers. For the δ 15N values of the sediment in the Nankouqian tributary, the construction of the municipal sewer system and wastewater treatment facilities are the causes of this rising trend. The δ 15N values of nitrate released by facilities could be raised by microbial denitrification that is employed in the tertiary treatment process. Most of the δ 15N values of the sediments are distributed between soil and manure, indicating that nitrogen in the river water mainly comes from agriculture. All the surveyed tributaries except Dasuhe show a significant increase in DN. In addition, a significant positive correlation between the change ratio of the farmland area and DN in river water is observed, suggesting that the increase in nitrogen in river water from 2011 to 2016 is due to agriculture. Based on the abovementioned data, this study provides a basis for local governments to formulate management measures.","misc","wim"

Menstrual cycle length is potentially a good indicator of ovarian reserve and can predict ovarian response. Ovarian stimulation and the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle are both processes of follicular development. There is no published research to predict the duration of ovarian stimulation based on the length of the menstrual cycle. Our retrospective cohort study included 6110 women with regular menstrual cycles who underwent their first IVF treatment between January 2015 and October 2020. Cycles were classified according to quartiles of the ratio of ovarian stimulation duration to original follicular phase length (OS/FP). Multivariate generalized linear models were applied to assess the association between OS/FP and IVF outcomes. The odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) was estimated for each quartile with the lowest quartile as the comparison group. OS/FP of 0.67 to 0.77 had more retrieved and mature oocytes (adjusted RR 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.15, p for trend = 0.001; adjusted RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.09-1.19, p for trend = 0.001). OS/FP of 0.67 to 0.77 showed the highest rate of fertilization (adjusted OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.17, p for trend = 0.001). OS/FP > 0.77 had the lowest rate of high-quality blastocyst formation (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71-0.93, p for trend = 0.01). No apparent association was noted between OS/FP and clinical pregnancy, live birth, or early miscarriage rate. In conclusion, OS/FP has a significant effect on the number of oocytes, fertilization rate, and high-quality blastocyst formation rate. MCL could be used to predict the duration of ovarian stimulation with an OS/FP of 0.67 to 0.77, which provides a new indicator for the individualized clinical optimization of the trigger time.","misc","wim"

To investigate the expression profiles and the potential role of mRNA and long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) in squab BFs, transcriptome analysis was performed by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) over three developmental stages (1-day, 13 and 26 days old). We identified 13,072 mRNAs and 19,129 lncRNAs, of which 2,752 mRNAs and 1,515 lncRNAs were differential expressed (DE) in pigeon BFs over three developmental stages. Cluster analysis presented different expression patterns in DE mRNAs and lncRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that DE lncRNAs and mRNAs with distinct expression patterns might play crucial roles in the immune system process and tissue morphogenesis. In particular, some DE genes and lncRNAs with higher expression levels in 13D or 26D are related to lymphocyte activation and differentiation, adaptive immune response, positive regulation of immune response, leukocyte migration, etc. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) analysis sreened six significant modules containing 37 genes from immune-related DE gene cluster, which is closely linked in B cell activation, lymphocyte differentiation, B cell receptor signaling pathway, etc. Our study characterizes mRNA and lncRNA transcriptomic variability in pigeon BFs over different developmental stages and enhances understanding of the mechanisms underlying physiological functions of pigeon BF.","misc","wim"

Pathogenic microorganisms were found in 136 samples, predominantly in the sputum (n=120 samples; 88.2%). We detected 107 strains of Gram-negative bacteria (78.7%), including 30 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (22.1%) and 27 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.9%); 18 strains of Gram-positive bacteria (13.2%), including 11 strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus (8.1%) and 2 strains of Enterococcus faecium (1.5%); and 11 strains (8.1%) were infected by fungi. There were 87 strains of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The main multidrug-resistant bacteria included 28 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (32.2%) and 25 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.7%). Multivariate analysis showed that ventilator use over 3 days was an independent risk factor for postoperative infection [odds ratio (OR): 4.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31 to 18.66, P=0.019]. The infection rate after lung transplantation in our hospital is similar to that of other lung transplantation studies, but higher than that following transplantation of other organs. The pathogens of postoperative infection were similar to those identified in other lung transplantation studies. Using a ventilator for more than 3 days is a risk factor for postoperative infection, suggesting that preventive measures for postoperative infection should be taken in such patients, and early postoperative discontinuation of the ventilator may reduce postoperative infection.","misc","wim"

One hundred and nineteen consecutive patients with 123 histopathologically diagnosed focal thyroid nodules were included in the cohort. The factors associated with malignancy were taller-than-wide shape [odds ratio (OR) =15.165; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.157-72.854], irregular margins (OR =11.492; 95% CI: 1.747-75.573), microcalcifications (OR =5.107; 95% CI: 1.455-17.927) and skewness (OR =25.800; 95% CI: 1.034-76.422). The skewness of malignant thyroid nodules is higher than that of benign thyroid nodules and has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.776 in the diagnosis. For thyroid nodules suspicious on US but not on cytology, skewness, together with taller-than-wide shape, irregular margins and microcalcifications might be a promising marker for clinicians to perform repetitive FNACs.","misc","wim"
"432",35965866,"Analyzing international medical graduate research productivity for application to US neurosurgery residency and beyond: A survey of applicants, program directors, and institutional experience.","The authors investigated perceived discrepancies between the neurosurgical research productivity of international medical graduates (IMGs) and US medical graduates (USMGs) through the perspective of program directors (PDs) and successfully matched IMGs. Responses to 2 separate surveys on neurosurgical applicant research productivity in 115 neurosurgical programs and their PDs were analyzed. Neurosurgical research participation was analyzed using an IMG survey of residents who matched into neurosurgical residency within the previous 8 years. Productivity of IMGs conducting dedicated research at the study institution was also analyzed. Thirty-two of 115 (28%) PDs responded to the first research productivity survey and 43 (37%) to the second IMG research survey. PDs expected neurosurgery residency applicants to spend a median of 12-24 months on research (Q1-Q3: 0-12 to 12-24; minimum time: 0-24; maximum time: 0-48) and publish a median of 5 articles (Q1-Q3: 2-5 to 5-10; minimum number: 0-10; maximum number: 4-20). Among 43 PDs, 34 (79%) ranked research institution or associated personnel as the most important factor when evaluating IMGs' research. Forty-two of 79 (53%) IMGs responding to the IMG-directed survey reported a median of 30 months (Q1-Q3: 18-48; range: 4-72) of neurosurgical research and 12 published articles (Q1-Q3: 6-24; range: 1-80) before beginning neurosurgical residency. Twenty-two PDs (69%) believed IMGs complete more research than USMGs before residency. Of 20 IMGs conducting dedicated neuroscience/neurosurgery research at the study institution, 16 of 18 who applied matched or entered a US neurosurgical training program; 2 applied and entered a US neurosurgical clinical fellowship. The research work of IMGs compared to USMGs who apply to neurosurgery residency exceeds PDs' expectations regarding scientific output and research time. Many PDs perceive IMG research productivity before residency application as superior to USMGs. Although IMGs comprise a small percentage of trainees, they are responsible for a significant amount of US-published neurosurgical literature. Preresidency IMG research periods may be improved with dedicated mentoring and advising beginning before the research period, during the period, and within a neurosurgery research department, providing a formal structure such as a research fellowship or graduate program for IMGs aspiring to train in the US.","misc","wim"

In previous studies, their performance was limited by a large offset. This paper reports on a novel CMOS seven-contact VHS (7CVHS), which is formed by adding two additional contacts to a traditional five-contact VHS (5CVHS) to alleviate the offset. The offset voltage and offset magnetic field of the 7CVHS are reduced by 90.20% and 88.31% of those of the 5CVHS, respectively, with a 16.16% current-related sensitivity loss. Moreover, the size and positions of the contacts are optimized in standard GLOBALFOUNDRIES 0.18 μm BCDliteTM technology by scanning parameters using FEM simulations. The simulation data are analyzed in groups to study the influence of the size and contact positions on the current-related sensitivity, offset voltage, and offset magnetic field.","misc","wim"

Solute carriers (SLCs) have been involved in the tumor progression of various cancer types. This study aimed to evaluate the role of these SLC-related glutamine transporters in the prognosis of BC patients by bioinformatics analysis. This study examined the transcription and prognostic data for glutamine-related transporters in BC from Oncomine Database, which is currently the largest oncogene microarray database platform in the world. As well as Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Kaplan-Meier (K-M), and cBioPortal online resources. The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) and GEPIA were also used to examine the relationship between SLCs and immune cell infiltration. The expression levels of SLC1A5, SLC3A2, SLC7A5, SLC7A8, and SLC38A1 were higher in BC tissues than normal breast tissues, but the expression level of SLC6A14 was lower. The expression levels of SLC7A5, SLC7A8, SLC6A14, and SLC38A2 were related to a later clinical tumor stage. In the K-M analyses, The K-M curves revealed that patients with high SLC1A5 expression had a poor prognosis (OS HR =1.28, 95% CI: 1.06-1.54; P=0.01). The high expression of SLC3A2 was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis (DMFS HR =1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.39; P=0.027). Increased SLC7A5 mRNA levels and decreased SLC7A8 mRNA levels were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in terms of OS, RFS, DMFS and PPS. The high expression of SLC6A14 was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis (PPS HR =1.35, 95% CI: 1.07-1.7; P=0.011). The high expression of SLC38A1 was correlated with a better prognosis than low expression of SLC38A1 (RFS HR =0.84, 95% CI: 0.76-0.93; P=0.00077; DMFS HR =0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.91; P=0.0013). The infiltration of immune cells and their marker genes were associated with SLC1A5, SLC3A2, SLC7A5, SLC7A8, SLC6A14, SLC38A1, and SLC38A2 expression. SLC7A5, SLC7A8, SLC38A1, and SLC38A2 have the potential to regulate polarization in tumor-associated macrophages. SLC7A5, SLC7A8, SLC38A1, and SLC38A2 may regulate the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). SLC1A5, SLC3A2, SLC7A5, and SLC6A14 may be promising biomarkers for the BC diagnosis and may represent potential therapeutic targets for these patients.","misc","wim"

"800",35966481,"Gamblers' use of measures to prevent gambling problems and reduce harm.","In this study, the use of measures to control gambling were investigated. Data from gamblers (N = 5,878) participating in a cross-sectional survey in 2019 based on random sampling from the Norwegian Population Registry, were analysed. The survey included questions about use of eight measures, which comprised the dependent variables. Questions about sociodemographics, gambling behaviour, gambling problems, self-reported impact from gambling advertisement and beliefs in measures to control gambling comprised the predictor variables. Logistic regression analyses were employed to identify significant predictors. Use of measures varied, ranging from 0.8% (contacting help services) to 23.2% (pre-commitment to affordable loss limits). All predictors had at least one significant association with the actual use of measures. Being a moderate risk or problem gambler was the most consistent predictor and was associated with the use of all eight measures. Being born outside Norway in a western or non-western country was associated with use of seven of the eight measures, whereas gambled online and participated in low-risk game only (inversely) were associated with use of six measures. Gender, age, game spending and beliefs in the usefulness of measures were associated with use of four measures. Participation in random games only was inversely associated with use of three measures. Self-reported impact from gambling advertisement was only (inversely) associated with self-testing for gambling problems. Several mechanisms responsible for the associations between predictors and the dependent variables are suggested, e.g., younger gamblers and moderate risk or problem gamblers may use these measures as they may acknowledge personal susceptibilities for developing gambling problems, such as impaired impulse control. Online gambling on the other hand was associated with use of various measures as the latter more often are integrated in online than offline gambling. Notably, the beliefs in measures as helpful was a significant predictor of use of four of the measures, which illustrates that positive views on the use of measures are not consistently associated with actual use of all the measures. Characteristics of the gamblers (e.g., place of birth, moderate risk or problem gambler), the game itself and the online distribution seem to be the most consistent predictors.","misc","wim"

This pilot examined the virtual delivery of an evidence-based, school-based CSA prevention program, Safe Touches, designed to teach CSA-related knowledge and concepts. Using mixed methods, the pilot sought to determine the feasibility of the virtually delivered CSA prevention program. One school district that had previously received Safe Touches in-person participated. A total of 176 second grade students participated in the virtual workshop. Post-workshop survey responses from virtual (N = 37) and in-person workshops (N = 60) were compared descriptively. Mean item scores and response patterns from students who received the virtual workshop were nominally comparable to the student scores from the in-person workshop. Following the virtual workshop, one teacher notified the research team of a disclosure of CSA. Qualitative input from the facilitator and school staff was positive, indicating high student engagement. Results suggest the viability and feasibility of virtual school-based CSA preventive programs. Investment in virtual modes of delivery would ensure all students have access to CSA prevention programming in the future.","misc","wim"

However, whether SES across the life course impacts smoking cessation in late-life is not known. Assess how life course SES impacts smoking cessation among older smokers. We identified 5,124 smokers, 50 years and older, from the 1998 to 2018 waves of the Health and Retirement Study. The outcome was self-reported smoking cessation. The main exposure was life course SES, defined as: low child and low adult SES (persistent low); low child, high adult SES (upward mobility); high child, low adult SES (downward mobility); and high child, high adult SES (persistent high). A multilevel mixed-effect logistic model was used to examine how life course SES predicts smoking cessation at age 65 and over time, adjusted for covariates. Compared to those with persistent high SES, those with persistent low SES, upward and downward SES were more likely to be Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black. The adjusted results showed that at age 65, compared to those with persistent high SES, those with persistent low SES (OR= 0.69, 95 % CI = [0.51-0.92]), upward SES (OR= 0.49, [0.32-0.75]), and downward SES (OR= 0.55, [0.40-0.76]) were less likely to quit. However, as age increased, only those with downward or persistent low SES were significantly less likely to quit compared to those with persistent high SES. Social mobility of SES from childhood to adulthood significantly impacts smoking cessation. Both stages of the life course should be considered to understand smoking behaviors.","misc","wim"
"849",35959113,"A novel prognostic model based on three clinic-related miRNAs for prostate cancer.","Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common malignant tumor in men worldwide. MiRNAs have been reported to play significant roles in prognosis prediction for patients with malignant tumors. The survival-related miRNAs (sDMIRs) were identified by Cox regression analysis. A risk score model (RSM) was established based on three sDMIRs. The expression levels of sDMIRs in cell lines and clinical samples were detected via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The correlations between sDMIRs and clinicopathological characteristics of PCa patients were evaluated using the chi-square test and Fisher's exact probability method. Four sDMIRs were remarkably related to the prognosis of PCa patients based on univariate Cox analysis, of which miR-10a-5p, miR-20a-5p, and miR-508-3p were used to establish the RSM. The OS in the low-risk group was better than that in the high-risk group. In the verification of various prostate cell lines and clinical samples from 162 PCa patients, the prominently higher expression of miR-10a-5p and miR-20a-5p and lower expression of miR-508-3p were detected in PCa cell lines and tumor tissues, especially the more advanced T-stage. Besides, the higher expression of miR-20a-5p and miR-10a-5p was significantly correlated to the higher level of PSA, Gleason score, more advanced T-stage, and distant metastasis status. We identify and validate the clinical significance of three sDMIRs and establish a verified RSM to evaluate the prognosis for PCa patients. The findings not only provide a reliable tool for clinical decision-makers to evaluate patients' prognosis but also offer a novel perspective into the field of biomarker identification.","misc","wim"
"798",35958106,"Helper T Cell (CD4+) Targeted Tacrolimus Delivery Mediates Precise Suppression of Allogeneic Humoral Immunity.","Antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) is a major cause of dysfunction and loss of transplanted kidney. The current treatments for ABMR involve nonspecific inhibition and clearance of T/B cells or plasma cells. However, the prognosis of patients following current treatment is poor. T follicular helper cells (Tfh) play an important role in allograft-specific antibodies secreting plasma cell (PC) development. Tfh cells are therefore considered to be important therapeutic targets for the treatment of antibody hypersecretion disorders, such as transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases. Tacrolimus (Tac), the primary immunosuppressant, prevents rejection by reducing T cell activation. However, its administration should be closely monitored to avoid serious side effects. In this study, we investigated whether Tac delivery to helper T (CD4+) cells using functionalized mesoporous nanoparticles can block Tfh cell differentiation after alloantigen exposure. Results showed that Tac delivery ameliorated humoral rejection injury in rodent kidney graft by suppressing Tfh cell development, PC, and donor-specific antibody (DSA) generation without causing severe side effects compared with delivery through the drug administration pathway. This study provides a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing humoral rejection in solid organ transplantation. The specific and controllable drug delivery avoids multiple disorder risks and side effects observed in currently used clinical approaches.","misc","wim"

We conduct exploratory analyses of social patterns that uphold vaccination success for COVID-19 and measles. We use publicly available data on COVID vaccination rates and other country-level indicators from Our World in Data, Human Development Report, Corruption Perception Index, and the World Bank to devise bivariate correlations and multiple regression models. About 70% of the variability in COVID-19 vaccination rates in February 2022 can be explained by differences in the Human Development Index (HDI) and, specifically, in life expectancy at birth. Trust in doctors and nurses adds predictive value beyond HDI, clarifying controversial discrepancies between vaccination rates in countries with similar levels of HDI and vaccine availability. Cardiovascular disease deaths, an indicator of general health system effectiveness, and infant measles immunization coverage, an indicator of country-level immunization effectiveness, are also significant, though weaker, predictors of COVID-19 vaccination success. Measles vaccination in 2019 is similarly predicted by HDI and trust in doctors and nurses. The remaining variability in COVID-19 vaccination success that cannot be pinned down through these sets of metrics points to a considerable scope for collective and individual agency in a time of crisis. The mobilization and coordination in the vaccination campaigns of citizens, medical professionals, scientists, journalists, and politicians, among others, account for at least some of this variability in overcoming vaccine hesitancy and inequity.","misc","wim"

Transdiagnostic factors such as personality functioning are thought to be involved in determining mental health outcomes. The present study focused on two constructs of personality functioning, Criterion A of the Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD, DSM-5) and mentalization, as predictors of depressive symptoms and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. A second focus of the study was to examine whether this relationship was mediated by resilience. Linear regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between personality functioning measured by Criterion A (AMPD, DSM-5) and mentalizing abilities as predictors, and depression and life satisfaction as mental health outcomes. To assess the hypothesis that this relationship is mediated by resilience a structural equation modeling approach was conducted. Data from N = 316 individuals from the general population were collected. Linear regression models revealed highly significant associations between Criterion A/mentalization and both outcome measures. Structural equation models showed a significant partial mediation by resilience of these relationships. Our results support the hypothesis that mentalizing serves as a protective function by promoting resilience to the impact of stress and threats. Criterion A and mentalization performed similarly as predictors of mental health outcomes, providing empirically overlapping operationalizations of personality functioning. This finding emphasizes the importance of personality functioning in positive and negative mental health outcomes. Furthermore, our results are consistent with a mediating role of resilience.","misc","wim"

This study was a retrospective, single-center, case series study. 33 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with clinical stage of T3~4N0~2M0 treated in Yunnan Cancer Hospital from June 2019 to June 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. Among them, 32 patients were dMMR or MSI-H or both dMMR and MSI-H, and one patient was both dMMR and microsatellite stability (MSS) (excluded in the final analysis). All 32 patients received neoadjuvant immunotherapy (nIT) with single-agent PD⁃1 inhibitor. Among the 32 patients, 8 (25%) were locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and 24 (75%) were locally advanced colon cancer (LACC); 4 (12.55%) were stage II and 28 (87.5%) were stage III. The median number of cycles of 32 patients with dMMR/MSI-H LACRC receiving nIT with single-agent PD-1 blockade was 6 (4~10), and the median number of cycles to achieve partial response (PR) was 3 (2~4). Among them, three LARC patients achieved clinical complete response (cCR) and adopted the watch-and-wait (W&W) strategy. The objective response rate (ORR) of the other 29 patients with radical surgery was 100% (29/29), the pathological response rate was 100% (29/29), the rate of major pathological response (MPR) was 86.2% (25/29), and the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) was 75.9% (22/29). The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in 32 patients during nIT was 37.5% (12/32), while the incidence of irAEs in 22 patients with operation during adjuvant immunotherapy was 27.3% (6/22), all of which were grade 1~2. No grade 3 or above irAEs were occured. The median time from the last nIT to surgery was 27 (16~42) days. There were no delayed radical resection due to irAEs in these patients. All 29 patients achieved R0 resection. The incidence of surgical-related adverse events (srAEs) in perioperative period was 10.3% (3/29). Neoadjuvant monoimmunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitor has favorable ORR and pCR rate, and relatively low incidences of irAEs and srAEs for patients with dMMR/MSI-H LACRC, suggesting that this nIT regimen of single-agent PD-1 inhibitor is significantly effective and sufficiently safe.","misc","wim"

The study was also aimed to determine the biofilm eradication effect of vancomycin in order to guide for the treatment. For the detection of biofilm formation, a total of 154 CoNS clinical isolates of which 30 being causative agents of catheter related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) (isolated from both the catheter tip and blood cultures of 15 patients), 89 being isolated from peripheral blood cultures of patients without a central venous catheter (CVC) (13 of them were bloodstream infection agents, 76 of them were contaminant), and 35 being isolated as catheter colonizer, were screened by tissue culture plate (TCP), Congo red agar (CRA) method and polymerase chain reaction (icaA, icaD and IS256). Vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradicating concentration (MBEC) values were determined. The pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method was used to show the clonal relationship between CoNS isolated from the catheter tips and peripheral blood of patients with CRBSI. Of the 154 CoNS isolates included in the study, 38.9% were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n= 60), 34.4% were Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n= 53), 20.7% were Staphylococcus hominis (n= 32), and 3.8% were detected as Staphylococcus capitis (n= 6). In our study, biofilm formation was shown in 31.8% with the CRA method and in 68.1% with the TCP method. By TCP method, 22% (n= 34) were determined as weak, 31.2% (n= 48) medium and 14.9% (n= 23) strong biofilm producers. While the sensitivity of the CRA method was found to be low for isolates that were determined as weak positive in the microplate method, the high sensitivity of the CRA method for isolates with medium and strong positivity was found remarkable. The positivity rates of icaA, icaD and IS256 genes in a total of 154 CoNS isolates were found to be 40 (25.9%), 57 (37%) and 77 (50%), respectively. In total, at least one gene positivity was detected in 107 (69.5%) isolates. Single gene positivity was detected in 55 (35.7%), two gene positivity in 35 (22.7%) and three gene positivity was detected in 17 (11%) of the included CoNS. Biofilm formation (four weak, four medium, two strong) was detected by microplate method in 10 of 47 CoNS isolates (five S.epidermidis, three S.hominis, one S.haemolyticus and one S.capitis) in which no genes were detected. Vancomycin MBEC/ MIC values were found to be high and it was observed that as the biofilm forming power of the isolates increased, the MBEC/MIC ratio also increased. The CoNS isolated from the catheter samples and blood of patients diagnosed with CRBSI had a 100% similar profile with PFGE except for one unevaluable isolate. The tissue culture plate (TCP) method was found to be most sensitive, accurate and reproducible screening method for detection of biofilm formation by staphylococci and has the advantage of being a quantitative model to study the adherence of staphylococci. The presence of the icaAD and IS256 gene is not always associated with in vitro biofilm formation. For this reason, it is more appropriate to use more than one method together for the evaluation of biofilm formation. It was thought that the use of reliable methods to specifically detect biofilms could be helpful in diseases that are difficult to treat. Considering the high rates of biofilm and antimicrobial resistance of biofilm-forming isolates in biomedical device associated infections, it was determined that it would not be sufficient to evaluate only the MIC results for susceptibility results.","misc","wim"

The RAW264.7 macrophage-derived foam cell model was successfully induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) (80 μg/ml). It showed that TAN, HxMF, and HpMF alleviated ox-LDL-induced NO release while also inhibiting the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in RAW264.7 cells. Uptake of excess ox-LDL was inhibited by TAN, HxMF, and HpMF, resulting in the reduction of its foam cell formation. Moreover, TAN, HxMF, and HpMF promoted HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. Western blot experiment showed that TAN, HxMF, and HpMF inhibited the expression of scavenger receptor class A type I (SRA1) and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), while upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), liver X receptor α (LXRα), phospholipid ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), and scavenger receptor class B type I (SRB1) expression. Together, our findings suggested that PMFs inhibited foam cell formation might inhibit lipid uptake via downregulating SRA1/CD36 expression and promote cholesterol efflux from foam cells via upregulating PPARγ/LXRα/ABCG1/SRB1 expression. This antiatherosclerotic activity is expected to provide new insights into the development of healthcare uses for PMFs.","misc","wim"

"1527",35956795,"Fit-for-Purpose Assessment of QuEChERS LC-MS/MS Methods for Environmental Monitoring of Organotin Compounds in the Bottom Sediments of the Odra River Estuary.","Organotin compounds (OTCs) are among the most hazardous substances found in the marine environment and can be determined by either the ISO 23161 method based on extraction with non-polar organic solvents and gas chromatography analysis or by the recently developed QuEChERS method coupled to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). To date, the QuEChERS LC/MS and ISO 23161 methods have not been compared in terms of their fit-for-purpose and reliability in the determination of OTCs in bottom sediments. In the case of ISO 23161, due to a large number of interferences gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was not suitable for the determination of OTCs contrary to more selective determination by gas chromatography with an atomic emission detector. Moreover, it has been found that the derivatization of OTCs to volatile compounds, which required prior gas chromatography determination, was strongly affected by the sediments' matrices. As a result, a large amount of reagent was needed for the complete derivatization of the compounds. Contrary to ISO 23161, the QuEChERS LC-MS/MS method did not require the derivatization of OTC and is less prone to interferences. Highly volatile and toxic solvents were not used in the QuEChERS LC-MS/MS method. This makes the method more environmentally friendly according to the principles of green analytical chemistry. QuEChERS LC-MS/MS is suitable for fast and reliable environmental monitoring of OTCs in bottom sediments from the Odra River estuary. However, determination of di- and monobutyltin by the QuEChERS LC-MS/MS method was not possible due to the constraints of the chromatographic system. Hence, further development of this method is needed for monitoring di- and monobutyltin in bottom sediments.","misc","wim"

Our study aims to describe the clinical and pathological characteristics of primary breast sarcoma (PBS) and secondary breast sarcoma (SBS) along with determining prognostic factors and developing nomograms for predicting survival. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, female patients diagnosed with breast sarcoma between 1975 and 2016 were identified. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between survival and clinical features. Out of 1334 included patients, 816 had PBS and 518 had SBS. PBS had a significantly better overall survival than SBS with median survival months of 107 for PBS and 45 for SBS. The primary tumor site did not have a significant impact on the survival of SBS. Cox regression showed worse survival of PBS patients who were > 60 years (HR 3.04, 95% CI 2.46-3.74) and had tumor size > 50 mm (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.61-2.51). Being not married was associated with worse survival of PBS (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06-1.56) and SBS (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.19-1.90). Surgery was associated with better survival of PBS (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42-0.85) and SBS (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31-0.68). The C-indexes of created nomograms were 0.73 for PBS and 0.69 for SBS.

However, human intrinsic brain activity is time-varying and dynamic. There is a lack of knowledge about the brain dynamical pattern in bipolar disorder across different mood states. This study used the dynamical degree centrality (dDC) to investigate the resting-state whole-brain dynamical pattern voxel-wise in a total of 62 bipolar disorder [28 bipolar depression (BD), 13 bipolar mania (BM), 21 bipolar euthymia (BE)], and 30 healthy controls (HCs). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to explore the omnibus differences of the dDC pattern across all groups, and Pearson's correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the dDC variability in detected regions with clinical symptom severity. One-way ANOVA analysis showed the omnibus differences in the left inferior parietal lobule/middle occipital gyrus (IPL/MOG) and right precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCUN/PCC) across all groups. The post hoc analysis revealed that BD showed decreased dDC in the IPL/MOG compared with all other groups, and both BD and BM exhibited decreased dDC in the PCUN/PCC compared with BE and HCs. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that the dDC variability of the IPL/MOG and PCUN/PCC negatively correlated with the depression symptom levels in all patients with bipolar disorder. This study demonstrated the distinct and shared brain dynamical pattern of the depressive, manic, and euthymia states. Our findings provide new insights into the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder across different mood states from the dynamical brain network pattern perspective.","misc","wim"

A total of 1017 Inpatients with new-onset diabetes of five hospitals in Eastern China were included in the study. Clustering analysis was used to cluster the data into five subgroups according to six basic variables. The differences in clinical characteristics, treatments, and the prevalence of diabetes-related diseases among the five subgroups were analyzed by multiple groups comparisons and pairwise comparisons. The risk of diabetes-related diseases in the five subgroups was compared by calculating odd ratio (OR). P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Five subgroups were obtained by clustering analysis with the highest proportion of patients with severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD) 451 (44.35%), followed by patients with mild age-related diabetes (MARD) 236 (23.21%), patients with mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD) 207 (20.35%), patients with severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD) 81 (7.96%), and patients with severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID) 42 (4.13%). Five subtypes had their own unique characteristics and treatments. The prevalence and risk of diabetes-related complications and comorbidities were also significantly different among the five subtypes. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) was the most common in SIRD group. Patients in SIDD, SIRD, and MARD groups were more likely to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or stroke, diabetic peripheral vascular disease (DPVD), and diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN). The prevalence and risk of metabolic syndrome (MS) were the highest in MOD and SIRD groups. Patients in SAID group had the highest prevalence and risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Patients with MOD were more likely to develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The inpatients with new-onset diabetes in Eastern China had the unique clustering distribution. The clinical characteristics, treatments, and diabetes-related complications and comorbidities of the five subgroups were different, which may provide the basis for precise treatments of diabetes.","misc","wim"
"754",35960585,"Toward a Photonic Demonstration of Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution.","The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) usually relies on that the users' devices are well characterized according to the security models made in the security proofs. In contrast, device-independent QKD-an entanglement-based protocol-permits the security even without any knowledge of the underlying quantum devices. Despite its beauty in theory, device-independent QKD is elusive to realize with current technologies. Especially in photonic implementations, the requirements for detection efficiency are far beyond the performance of any reported device-independent experiments. In this Letter, we report a proof-of-principle experiment of device-independent QKD based on a photonic setup in the asymptotic limit. On the theoretical side, we enhance the loss tolerance for real device imperfections by combining different approaches, namely, random postselection, noisy preprocessing, and developed numerical methods to estimate the key rate via the von Neumann entropy. On the experimental side, we develop a high-quality polarization-entangled photon source achieving a state-of-the-art (heralded) detection efficiency about 87.5%. Although our experiment does not include random basis switching, the achieved efficiency outperforms previous photonic experiments involving loophole-free Bell tests. Together, we show that the measured quantum correlations are strong enough to ensure a positive key rate under the fiber length up to 220 m. Our photonic platform can generate entangled photons at a high rate and in the telecom wavelength, which is desirable for high-speed generation over long distances. The results present an important step toward a full demonstration of photonic device-independent QKD.","misc","wim"
"2238",35956801,"Actions of Novel Angiotensin Receptor Blocking Drugs, Bisartans, Relevant for COVID-19 Therapy: Biased Agonism at Angiotensin Receptors and the Beneficial Effects of Neprilysin in the Renin Angiotensin System.","Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) used in the treatment of hypertension and potentially in SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit inverse agonist effects at angiotensin AR1 receptors, suggesting the receptor may have evolved to accommodate naturally occurring angiotensin 'antipeptides'. Screening of the human genome has identified a peptide (EGVYVHPV) encoded by mRNA, complementary to that encoding ANG II itself, which is an inverse agonist. Thus, opposite strands of DNA encode peptides with opposite effects at AR1 receptors. Agonism and inverse agonism at AR1 receptors can be explained by a receptor 'switching' between an activated state invoking receptor dimerization/G protein coupling and an inverse agonist state mediated by an alternative/second messenger that is slow to reverse. Both receptor states appear to be driven by the formation of the ANG II charge-relay system involving TyrOH-His/imidazole-Carboxylate (analogous to serine proteases). In this system, tyrosinate species formed are essential for activating AT1 and AT2 receptors. ANGII is also known to bind to the zinc-coordinated metalloprotease angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) used by the COVID-19 virus to enter cells. Here we report in silico results demonstrating the binding of a new class of anionic biphenyl-tetrazole sartans ('Bisartans') to the active site zinc atom of the endopeptidase Neprilysin (NEP) involved in regulating hypertension, by modulating humoral levels of beneficial vasoactive peptides in the RAS such as vasodilator angiotensin (1-7). In vivo and modeling evidence further suggest Bisartans can inhibit ANG II-induced pulmonary edema and may be useful in combatting SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting ACE2-mediated viral entry to cells.","misc","wim"

The presented review focuses on modern alternatives for the production of wood-based panels; i.e., substitutes for formaldehyde in the production of amino and phenolic resins, as well as novel hardeners for formaldehyde-free wood adhesives. Solutions in which formaldehyde in completely replaced are presented in this review. Recent advances indicate that it is possible to develop new formaldehyde-free systems of resins with compatible hardeners. The formaldehyde substitutes that have primarily been tested are glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and dimethoxyethanal. The use of such substitutes eliminates the problem of free formaldehyde emission originating from the resin used in the production of wood-based panels. However, these alternatives are mostly characterized by worse reactivity, and, as a result, the use of formaldehyde-free resins may affect the mechanical and strength properties of wood-based panels. Nonetheless, there are still many substantial challenges for the complete replacement of formaldehyde and further research is needed, especially in the field of transferring the technology to industrial practice.","misc","wim"

Face-to-face meetings are so rich because many ways of communicating (spoken language and nonverbal cues) are available to support mutual understanding. With the progress of digitization and driven by the need to reduce personal contact during the global pandemic, many face-to-face work meetings have been shifted to videoconferences. With webcams turned on, video calls come closest to the richness of face-to-face meetings. However, webcam use often remains voluntary, and some participants choose not to turn their cameras on. In order to find ways to support webcam use-when desired-we analyzed how social norms in groups affect the decision to activate a webcam in a specific meeting. Based on an online survey with N = 333 participants, we found that social norms are related to an individual's decision to turn on the webcam, even when controlling for group size. If the number of participants with activated webcams in a university meeting increased by 25%, it was 5.92 times more likely that an individual decided to turn their webcam on, too. Furthermore, 81.84% of respondents indicated they would turn on their webcam if participants in a meeting were explicitly asked to do so. The results demonstrate a strong relation between social norms and the decision to activate a webcam in online meetings. They build a basis for enhancing webcam use and enable a greater richness of communication in online meetings.","misc","wim"

Here, with the integration of microfluidic droplet printing and wettability-induced drawing photolithography, we present an innovative spatiotemporal serial multistep dip-printing strategy to generate novel independent microneedle motors (IMNMs) for orally delivering macromolecular drugs. As the strategy combines the advantages of the hydrophilic wettability, extension effects, and capillary effects, the IMNMs with an oblate basement and a needle-shaped head or a core-shell structured multicomponent head can be created by simply printing pregel droplets layer by layer, following with simultaneous wiredrawing and solidification. Owing to the polarized magnetic particles in the bottom basement and the rapidly dissolvable polymers as the middle basement, the resultant IMNMs can respond to magnetic fields, move to desired places under a magnet, penetrate tissue-like substrates, induce head-basement separation, and leave only the needles for cargo release. Based on these features, we have demonstrated that these IMNMs can deliver insulin via intestinal tracts to realize effective blood glucose control of diabetic rabbit models. These results indicate the practical values and bright future of the dip-printing stratagem and these IMNMs in clinical applications.","misc","wim"

The method uses thermal desorption from a PM on a filter sample as means of sample introduction to a column and obviates the need for complex extraction procedures, which are time-consuming and require environmentally unfriendly solvents. Moreover, the possibility of systematic errors is minimized and a significantly smaller amount of sample is required compared to traditional techniques requiring a pre-extraction step (approx. 10-times). Thirteen PAHs and three nitro-PAHs were used during method development. Although Tenax cartridges are typically used to capture volatile pollutants from the air, we found that glass-wool liner is the most suitable trap for the examined analytes after desorption from a quartz filter. Among the various instrument parameters which were tested and optimized, TD desorption flow and hold time, and temperature of the cooled injection system (CIS) proved to be most critical. We also found out that the matrix effect is especially pronounced in the case of high PM loadings, which should be kept in mind when planning the analysis. After the optimization, standard reference materials (ERM-CZ100 and NIST 1648a) were used for partial method validation and finally, real PM10 and PM2.5 samples from two Slovenian cities were successfully analyzed.","misc","wim"

The study's goal is to analyse the clinico-radiological outcome of the newer biplane double-supported screw fixation (BDSF) technique in the Indian cohort. Patients with isolated FNFs underwent osteo-synthesis by BDSF technique. Radiological outcome was evaluated by time to union and fracture healing on plain radiographs. Clinical outcome was measured using the Harris hip score (HHS) at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The pain reduction was measured using the VAS score. Twenty-seven patients with a mean age of 37.33 ± 9.84 years (24-55 years) were followed up for at least 12 months (12-31 months). The mean HHS at 12 months was 94.81 ± 8.18 (range: 68-100). Twenty-five patients were able to achieve radiological union within a mean time of 14.60 ± 4.69 weeks (range: 8-28). The overall complication rate was found to be 18.51% (5 out of 27 patients). Individual complications were non-union (2 patients; 7.4%), AVN (3 patients; 11.11%), and screw back out with femoral neck shortening (4 patients; 14.81%). Screw configuration using the BDSF technique provides a good union rate with minimum complications. The majority of patients resulted in a good (HHS >80) to excellent functional outcome.

In contrast to the requirements associated with the Interoperability principle, the requirements associated with the Accessibility principle are often assumed to be relatively straightforward to implement. Indeed, a variety of different tools assessing FAIR rely on the data being deposited in a trustworthy digital repository. In this paper we note that there is an implicit assumption that access to a repository is independent of where the user is geographically located. Using a virtual personal network (VPN) service we find that access to a set of web sites that underpin Open Science is variable from a set of 14 countries; either through connectivity issues (i.e., connections to download HTML being dropped) or through direct blocking (i.e., web servers sending 403 error codes). Many of the countries included in this study are already marginalized from Open Science discussions due to political issues or infrastructural challenges. This study clearly indicates that access to FAIR data resources is influenced by a range of geo-political factors. Given the volatile nature of politics and the slow pace of infrastructural investment, this is likely to continue to be an issue and indeed may grow. We propose that it is essential for discussions and implementations of FAIR to include awareness of these issues of accessibility. Without this awareness, the expansion of FAIR data may unintentionally reinforce current access inequities and research inequalities around the globe.","misc","wim"

It was reported that online public searching was associated with their offline thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the online search for suicide pre-, during, and post-COVID-19 in China. The keywords on suicide, COVID-19, unemployment, and depression were collected in 2019 and 2020 using the Baidu Search Index (BSI). A time-series analysis examined the dynamic correlations between BSI-COVID-19 and BSI-suicide. A generalized estimating equation model was used to calculate the coefficients of variables associated with the BSI-suicide. The BSI-suicide showed a significant increase (15.6%, p = 0.006) from the 5th to 9th week, which was also the point of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. A time-series analysis between BSI-suicide and BSI-COVID-19 showed that the strongest correlation occurred at lag 1+ and lag 2+ week. In the pre-COVID-19 model, only BSI-depression was highly associated with BSI-suicide (β = 1.38, p = 0.008). During the COVID-19 model, BSI-depression (β = 1.77, p = 0.040) and BSI-COVID-19 (β = 0.03, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with BSI-suicide. In the post-COVID-19 model, BSI depression (β = 1.55, p = 0.010) was still highly associated with BSI-suicide. Meanwhile, BSI-unemployment (β = 1.67, p = 0.007) appeared to be linked to BSI-suicide for the first time. There was a surge in suicide-related online searching during the early stage of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Online suicide search volume peaked 1-2 weeks after the COVID-19 peak.

Age and gender were stratified to identify subgroups at risk. A symmetrical case-control analysis was designed to determine the relationship between present periodontitis and history of osteoarthritis. Patients with periodontitis had higher risk of osteoarthritis (hazard ratio, HR =1.15, 95% CI =1.12-1.17, p < 0.001) and severe osteoarthritis that led to total knee replacement or total hip replacement (TKR/THR) (HR =1.12, 95% CI =1.03-1.21, p < 0.01) than controls, which was time-dependent (log-rank test p < 0.01). The effect of periodontitis on osteoarthritis was significant in both genders and age subgroups over 30 years-old (all p < 0.001). Among them, females (HR=1.27, 95% CI = 1.13-1.42, p < 0.001) and patients aged over 51 (HR= 1.21, 95% CI =1.10-1.33, p < 0.001) with periodontitis were predisposed to severe osteoarthritis. In addition, periodontitis patients were more likely to have a history of osteoarthritis (odds ratio = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06 - 1.17, p < 0.001). These findings suggest an association between periodontitis and a higher risk of osteoarthritis, including severe osteoarthritis that led to TKR/THR.

However, the effect of FH on the prognosis of ACS remains unclear. In this prospective cohort study, 223 patients with ACS having LDL-C ≥ 135.3 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) were enrolled and screened for FH using a multiple-gene FH panel. The diagnosis of FH was defined according to the ACMG/AMP criteria as carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. The clinical features of FH and the relationship of FH to the average 16.6-month risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) were assessed. The prevalence of molecularly defined FH in enrolled patients was 26.9%, and coronary artery lesions were more severe in patients with FH than in those without (Gensini score 66.0 vs. 28.0, respectively; P < 0.001). After lipid lowering, patients with FH still had significantly higher LDL-C levels at their last visit (73.5 ± 25.9 mg/dL vs. 84.7 ± 37.1 mg/dL; P = 0.013) compared with those without. FH increased the incidence of CVEs in patients with ACS [hazard ratio (HR): 3.058; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.585-5.900; log-rank P < 0.001]. FH is associated with an increased risk of CVEs in ACS and is an independent risk factor for ACS.

A total of nine hundred and ninety-eight subjects (the total) aged≥40 years in General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of People's Liberation Army from March 2015 to January 2018 were enrolled in a cross-sectional studyPatients were divided into two groups as at least osteopenia group (including osteopenia, osteoporosis, and severe osteoporosis) and normal group according to the diagnosis standard of OP. The above indicators were analyzed and compared between the two groups. Binary multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to explore the association between BRT parameters and risk of bone loss in the subjects Mediation Effect was conducted to test endocrine variables as mediators in the correlation of BRT parameters with the bone loss for the possible mechanisms. There were 669 cases in the at least osteopenia group and 329 in the normal group. RBC, Hb, HCT and MCHC were all positively correlated with BMD of lumbar spine(L1-4), left femoral neck and left femur, along with lymph positively correlated with BMD of left femoral neck and left femur, respectively. Eosinophils(Eo) was positively correlated with BMD of L1-L4 and RDW-SD together with RDW-CV were both negatively correlated with BMD of left femoral neck and left femur. By binary multivariate logistic regression, only Hb was associated with bone loss and the OR value was 0.478 as protective factor for BMD. Estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) had partial mediating effect on the association of BRT parameters with the risk of bone loss. The mediating effect of E2 on the relationship between WBC and bone loss accounted for 46.35% of the total effect, and that of T on the relationship between RBC, Hb, HCT, MCHC and bone loss accounted for 27%, 18.3%, 31.1% and 26.8%, respectively. Bone loss in the middle-aged and elderly population is accompanied with the change of BRT parameters and the erythrocyte indices tend to be more obvious especially the Hb, which indicates anemia had a potential connection with bone loss.

Sintilimab, a monoclonal antiprogrammed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody, was used to treat patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we report a case of therapeutic heterogeneity in relapsed HCC with lung metastases. A 57-year-old female patient was diagnosed with HCC and underwent radical hepatectomy. One and a half years later, imaging scans found multiple metastatic tumors in the lung, which were accompanied by an increased α-fetoprotein (AFP) level. The patient then started to receive sintilimab. In the first 6 months after sintilimab treatment, all the metastatic nodules regressed gradually and ultimately disappeared, except for one nodule, which remained stable in the following 3 months. Finally, the patient underwent pulmonary lobectomy to remove the remaining nodule. Thereafter, follow-up visits showed the AFP level decreased to normal and imaging scans showed no signs of recurrence, confirming that the patient exhibited a clinically complete response. Pathological assessments showed that in the primary tumor site, the tumor comprised moderately differentiated HCC with a few infiltrated cytotoxic T cells and negative PD-L1 expression. While in the metastatic site, the nodule was composed of poorly differentiated HCC with cytotoxic T-cell infiltration with few cells inside the tumor and expressed PD-L1 in some areas of the tumor. There were dynamic alterations of PD-L1 expression and cytotoxic T-cell infiltration in the primary and relapsed HCC lesions after anti-PD-1 treatment. This case presented the heterogeneities of both the tumor microenvironment and the following antitumor response among the metastatic nodules in the same patient and revealed the importance of comprehensive therapy in cancer treatment.","misc","wim"

Here we present a case of a 4-year-old boy who came to our hospital for medical help because of abdominal distension for 1 day. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a huge retroperitoneal soft tissue mass with unclear boundaries with kidneys and adrenal glands, and low-density cystic necrosis areas were seen in the tumor. Contrast-enhanced scan showed that the mass showed mild heterogeneous enhancement. Based on these findings in the patient, he was initially considered to have Wilms tumor, but was finally pathologically confirmed as renal NB. The purpose of this article is to provide the clinicopathological features and CT manifestations of renal NB, and to discuss its differential diagnosis with other renal tumors, in order to better provide clinicians with a better understanding of the rare solid tumor. The renal NB is usually a large lobulated soft tissue mass with unclear boundary and incomplete capsule, which is prone to hemorrhage, necrosis, cystic degeneration and calcification. On CT, the mass is usually isodensity or slightly hypodense, and the cystic degeneration and necrosis area is hypodense, and on contrast-enhanced scan, it can be mildly to significantly enhanced, but the cystic degeneration and necrosis area have no enhancement. The CT findings of our case were atypical and overlapped with those of Wilms, so our case suggests that renal NB should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of Wilms, the most common malignancy of the kidney in children.","misc","wim"

The isolated nanobody Nb11-59 binds to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor-binding domain (RBD) with high affinity to neutralize the virus and block the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2- (ACE2-) RBD interaction. Here, we introduce a novel nanobody-based radiotracer named 68Ga-Nb1159. The radiotracer retained high affinity for the RBD and showed reliable radiochemical characteristics both in vitro and in vivo. Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) studies of 68Ga-Nb1159 in mice revealed its rapid clearance from circulation and robust uptake into the renal and urinary systems. Fortunately, 68Ga-Nb1159 could specifically reveal the distribution of the RBD in mice. This study also helped to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of the neutralizing nanobody. Moreover, 68Ga-Nb1159 may be a promising tool to explore the distribution of the RBD and improve the understanding of the virus. In particular, this study identified a novel molecular radioagent and established a reliable evaluation method for specifically investigating the RBD through noninvasive and visual PET technology.","misc","wim"

Depleted uranium (DU) is widely used in military munitions, including penetrators. Our previous studies showed that in arid landscapes, water-soluble U released from corroded DU penetrators that were buried underground were co-transported upwards with water by evaporation-driven capillary action and eventually precipitated on the ground surface. The first objective of this study was to develop a visualization system to simulate this complex U upward transport mechanism involving cyclic capillary wetting-drying cycles. Multiple visual components such as visual elements, canvases, and animations were created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS programming languages and coordinated to visualize this biogeochemical process in arid ecosystem landscapes. The second objective was to develop an interactive visualization exercise to allow users to study the effect of the type of capillarity solutions on the speed of the U upward transport.

Current AD treatments primarily operate at a symptomatic level to treat a cholinergic deficiency and can cause side effects. Hence, there is an unmet need for healthier lifestyles to reduce the likelihood of AD as well as improved treatments with fewer adverse reactions. Diets rich in phytochemicals may reduce neurodegenerative risk and limit disease progression. The native South American palm acai berry (Euterpe oleraceae) is a potential source of dietary phytochemicals beneficial to health. This study aimed to screen the nutraceutical potential of the acai berry, in the form of aqueous and ethanolic extracts, for the ability to inhibit acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase (ChE) enzymes and scavenge free radicals via 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) or 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assays. In addition, this study aimed to quantify the acai berry's antioxidant potential via hydrogen peroxide or hydroxyl scavenging, nitric oxide scavenging, lipid peroxidation inhibition, and the ability to reduce ferric ions. Total polyphenol and flavonoid contents were also determined. Acai aqueous extract displayed a concentration-dependent inhibition of acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase enzymes. Both acai extracts displayed useful concentration-dependent free radical scavenging and antioxidant abilities, with the acai ethanolic extract being the most potent antioxidant and displaying the highest phenolic and flavonoid contents. In summary, extracts of the acai berry contain nutraceutical components with anti-cholinesterase and antioxidant capabilities and may therefore provide a beneficial dietary component that limits the pathological deficits evidenced in AD.","misc","wim"

A simulation analysis under the conditions of flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation was performed to compare range of motion (ROM), intradiscal pressure, the facet joint force, the maximum Von Mises stress and the peak facet contact forces, between Coflex and X-STOP devices. Compared to the mild degenerated lumbar segment model at surgical level L4-L5, Coflex and X-STOP could reduce ROM in extension by 98.34% and 95.86%, respectively, decrease peak stress of intervertebral discs in extension by 59.4% and 66.17%, respectively, and release peak force of facet joint in extension by 97.09% and 95.42%, respectively.

As a result, the image matching may no longer be represented by a low-dimensional homographic warping, thus complicating an application of the commonly used Image of Warped Events (IWE). We introduce a new solution to this problem by performing contrast maximization in 3D. The 3D location of the rays cast for each event is smoothly varied as a function of a continuous-time motion parametrization, and the optimal parameters are found by maximizing the contrast in a volumetric ray density field. Our method thus performs joint optimization over motion and structure. The practical validity of our approach is supported by an application to AGV motion estimation and 3D reconstruction with a single vehicle-mounted event camera. The method approaches the performance obtained with regular cameras and eventually outperforms in challenging visual conditions.","misc","wim"

Mounting evidence has shown that pathogenic autoantibody targeting of the GluN1 subunit of NMDARs, as in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, leads to altered NMDAR trafficking and synaptic localization. However, the underlying signaling pathways affected by antibodies targeting the NMDAR remain to be fully delineated. It remains unclear whether patient antibodies influence synaptic transmission via direct effects on NMDAR channel function. Here, we show using short-term incubation that GluN1 antibodies derived from patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis label synapses in mature hippocampal primary neuron culture. Miniature spontaneous calcium transients (mSCaTs) mediated via NMDARs at synaptic spines are not altered in pathogenic GluN1 antibody exposed conditions. Unexpectedly, spine-based and cell-based analyses yielded distinct results. In addition, we show that calcium does not accumulate in neuronal spines following brief exposure to pathogenic GluN1 antibodies. Together, these findings show that pathogenic antibodies targeting NMDARs, under these specific conditions, do not alter synaptic calcium influx following neurotransmitter release. This represents a novel investigation of the molecular effects of anti-NMDAR antibodies associated with autoimmune encephalitis.","misc","wim"

What this diversity reflects is unclear, and appears counter-productive in generating selective somatic responses to specific stimuli. One possibility is that this diversity reflects the propagation of information from one neural population to another. To test this possibility, we bridge population coding theory with measurements of synaptic inputs recorded in vivo with two-photon calcium imaging. We construct a probabilistic decoder to estimate the stimulus orientation from the responses of a realistic, hypothetical input population of neurons to compare with synaptic inputs onto individual neurons of ferret primary visual cortex (V1) recorded with two-photon calcium imaging in vivo. We find that optimal decoding requires diverse input weights and provides a straightforward mapping from the decoder weights to excitatory synapses. Analytically derived weights for biologically realistic input populations closely matched the functional heterogeneity of dendritic spines imaged in vivo with two-photon calcium imaging. Our results indicate that synaptic diversity is a necessary component of information transmission and reframes studies of connectivity through the lens of probabilistic population codes. These results suggest that the mapping from synaptic inputs to somatic selectivity may not be directly interpretable without considering input covariance and highlights the importance of population codes in pursuit of the cortical connectome.","misc","wim"

The as-prepared CeO2-MnO2 catalysts show high NOx reduction efficiency in the temperature range of 150-300 °C, with a complete NOx conversion at 200 °C for the optimal sample. The excellent NH3-SCR performance could be ascribed to high surface area, intimate contact, and strong synergistic interaction between CeO2 nanoparticles and MnO2 nanoflowers of the well-designed composite catalyst. The in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTs) characterizations evidence that the SCR reaction on the surface of the CeO2-MnO2 nanocomposites mainly follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism.

Chemotherapy-induced upregulation of stem cell markers imparts invasiveness and metastatic property to the resident tumor. The efficacy of Kaempferol in attenuating epithelial to mesenchymal transition has earlier been established in the breast cancer cell. In our study population, progression-free survival was observed to be statistically more significant in post-NACT low-grade tumors than the high-grade tumors. Further, in post-NACT TNBCs, high-grade tumors showed a preponderance of strong nuclear p53 expression and very low expression of Caspase 3, indicating that, altered p53 expression predisposes these tumors to apoptosis escape and up-regulation of stemness markers. Herein, we report the robust efficacy of Kaempferol on ex-vivo grown breast tumors, derived from post-NACT TNBC patients, through downregulation of nuclear p53, CD44, ALDH1, NANOG, MDR1, Ki67, BCL2 and upregulation of Caspase 3. Such tumors also showed concurrent deregulated RNA and protein expression of CD44, NANOG, ALDH1 and MDR1 with upregulation of Caspase 3 and cleaved Caspase 3, upon Kaempferol treatment. Validation of efficacy of the treatment dosage of Kaempferol through immunophenotyping on MDA-MB-231, suggested that Kaempferol at its IC-50 dosage was effective against CD44 and CD326 positive breast cancer through deregulating their expression. Protein-protein interaction network through STRING pathway analysis and co-expression study of candidate proteins showed the highest degree of co-expression of p53 and KI-67, CD44, NF- kappaB, ALDH1, NANOG, MDR1, and BCL2.

Compared with wild-type seeds, the yel-sdj mutant seeds exhibited significantly reduced grain size, grain weight, and embryo weight, and a remarkably lower rate of embryo retention in kernels subjected to milling. However, the volume of air space between embryo and endosperm, density of embryo, and total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity of mature grains were significantly higher in the yel-sdj mutant than in the wild type. Genetic analysis and mapping revealed that the yel-sdj mutant was non-allelic to the oscop1 null mutants yel-hc, yel-cc, and yel-sk, and its phenotype was controlled by a single recessive gene, LOC_Os01g01484, an ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana DE-ETIOLATED 1 (DET1). The yel-sdj mutant carried a 7 bp deletion in the second exon of OsDET1. Seeds of the osdet1 knockout mutant, generated via CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing, displayed the yel mutant phenotype. Consistent with the fact that OsDET1 interacts with CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 10 (OsCOP10) and UV-DAMAGED DNA BINDING PROTEIN 1 (OsDDB1) to form the COP10-DET1-DDB1 (CDD), seeds of oscop10 and osddb1 knockout mutants also showed the yel phenotype.

For the analysis of the chemical-composition distribution (CCD) gradient liquid chromatography may be used. The CCD obtained using this method is often convoluted with an underlying molecular-weight distribution (MWD). In this paper we demonstrate that the influence of the MWD can be reduced using very steep gradients and that such gradients are best realized utilizing recycling gradient liquid chromatography (LC↻LC). This method allows for a more-accurate determination of the CCD and the assessment of (approximate) critical conditions (if these exist), even when high-molecular-weight standards of narrow dispersity are not readily available. The performance and usefulness of the approach is demonstrated for several polystyrene standards, and for the separation of statistical copolymers consisting of styrene/methyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate/butyl methacrylate. For the latter case, approximate critical compositions of the copolymers were calculated from the critical compositions of two homopolymers and one copolymer of known chemical composition, allowing for a determination of the CCD of unknown samples. Using this approach it is shown that the copolymers elute significantly closer to the predicted critical compositions after recycling of the gradient.

The non-uniform evaporation rate across the colloidal droplet hampers the formation of a uniform and homogeneous film in printed electronics, rechargeable batteries, etc., and often causes device failures. This review aims to highlight the diverse range of techniques used to alleviate the coffee-ring effect, from classic methods such as adding chemical additives, applying external sources, and manipulating geometrical configurations to recently developed advancements, specifically using bubbles, humidity, confined systems, etc., which do not involve modification of surface, particle or liquid properties. Each of these methodologies mitigates the edge deposition via multi-body interactions, for example, particle-liquid, particle-particle, particle-solid interfaces and particle-flow interactions. The mechanisms behind each of these approaches help to find methods to inhibit the non-uniform film formation, and the corresponding applications have been discussed together with a critical comparison in detail. This review could pave the way for developing inks and processes to apply in functional coatings and printed electronic devices with improved efficiency and device yield.","misc","wim"
"1351",35966673,"Human bocavirus 1 is a genuine pathogen for acute respiratory tract infection in pediatric patients determined by nucleic acid, antigen, and serology tests.","Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), first discovered in 2005, was positive in symptomatic and healthy children and co-detected with other respiratory viruses. It is a long journey to decisively demonstrate the unique viral pathogenic function of acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in pediatric patients. Respiratory specimens collected from pediatric patients with ARTI from January 2017 to December 2021 were screened by a capillary electrophoresis-based multiplex PCR (CEMP) assay, then genotyped by PCR and sequencing for HBoV1. For the antigen test, a part of HBoV1 DNA positive nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) was used as an antigen, while a rabbit anti-HBoV1 DR2 specific to HBoV1 was used as an antibody in the indirect-immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Finally, the levels of IgG specific to HBoV1 in acute and convalescent sera selected retrospectively from only HBoV1 DNA-positive patients were evaluated by IFA. Among 9,899 specimens, 681 were positive for HBoV1 DNA (6.88%, 681/9899), which included 336 positives only for HBoV1 (49.34%, 336/681) and 345 (50.66%, 345/681) positives also for other pathogens. In the antigen test, there were 37 among 47 NPAs determined as HBoV1 antigen-positive (78.72%, 37/47), including 18 (48.65%, 18/37) positives solely for HBoV1 DNA. Among 4 pediatric patients with both acute and convalescent sera, there was one positive for HBoV1 antigen (D8873) and 2 lack the antigen results (D1474 and D10792), which showed seroconversion with a ≥ 4-fold increase in IgG levels. The combination results of nucleic acid, antigen, and serology tests answered that HBoV1 is a genuine pathogen for ARTI in pediatric patients.","misc","wim"
"131",35959010,"Figure-Disembedding Is Inferior in Non-autistic Compared to Autistic Individuals but Can Be Improved by Training.","Figure-disembedding is one of the most discussed visuo-cognitive functions, in which individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have been reported to outperform non-autistic individuals. A local processing bias has been assumed to underlie such superior performance patterns. The aim of the current study is to investigate whether processing preferences can be modified by procedural priming. The current study used a procedural priming task (Navon figures) to induce more local or global processing in 25 autistic and 21 typically developing (TD) control participants, using hierarchical figures preceding the figure-disembedding task. Participants with ASD outperformed non-autistic individuals in the unprimed baseline task version. The performance was not modulated by priming in either direction (toward a local or global processing style) in both groups. However, the performance of TD control participants was improved by training to the same level as that observed in the ASD group. Figure-disembedding performance in ASD is superior to that in TD control participants and robust against procedural priming or training. In contrast, performance in the TD control group can be improved up to the level of the ASD group. Any studies reporting superiority in individuals with ASD in figure-disembedding should consider training effects when evaluating group differences.","misc","wim"

It is assumed that when a biofilm is dispersed it will subsequently cause a more severe infection. The clinical significance of S. epidermidis isolated from sterile body fluid (BF) remains unclear, and might be related to dispersal from catheter-associated biofilm infection. To evaluate this relationship, we evaluated S. epidermidis isolates from catheters (CA) or BF in hospitalized patients. Sequence type 2 (ST2) is the most prevalent type isolated from infection sites. Although the specific STs were also observed in isolates from different sites, we observed that the main sequence type was ST2, followed by ST59, among all the 114 isolates from different infection sites. Interestingly, ST2 strains isolated from BF exhibited significantly thicker biofilm than those from CA. The thicker biofilm was due to the higher expression of accumulation-associated protein (aap) but not intercellular adhesion (ica) operon. Moreover, the transcription of PSMδ and PSMε were significantly increased in ST2 strains isolated from BF. Although the bacterial loads on catheters were similar infected by CA- or BF-originated strains in mouse biofilm-associated infection model, we observed a higher CFU in peri-catheter tissues infected by ST2 clones isolated from BF, suggesting that S. epidermidis with thicker biofilm formation might be able to disperse. Taken together, our data suggested that S. epidermidis originated from diverse infection sites exhibited different biofilm forming capacity. The major ST2 clone isolated from BF exhibited thicker biofilm by increasing the expression of Aap. The higher expression of PSM of these strains may contribute to bacteria dispersal from biofilm and the following bacterial spread.","misc","wim"
"2466",35958638,"Digital phenotype of mood disorders: A conceptual and critical review.","Mood disorders are commonly diagnosed and staged using clinical features that rely merely on subjective data. The concept of digital phenotyping is based on the idea that collecting real-time markers of human behavior allows us to determine the digital signature of a pathology. This strategy assumes that behaviors are quantifiable from data extracted and analyzed through digital sensors, wearable devices, or smartphones. That concept could bring a shift in the diagnosis of mood disorders, introducing for the first time additional examinations on psychiatric routine care. The main objective of this review was to propose a conceptual and critical review of the literature regarding the theoretical and technical principles of the digital phenotypes applied to mood disorders. We conducted a review of the literature by updating a previous article and querying the PubMed database between February 2017 and November 2021 on titles with relevant keywords regarding digital phenotyping, mood disorders and artificial intelligence. Out of 884 articles included for evaluation, 45 articles were taken into account and classified by data source (multimodal, actigraphy, ECG, smartphone use, voice analysis, or body temperature). For depressive episodes, the main finding is a decrease in terms of functional and biological parameters [decrease in activities and walking, decrease in the number of calls and SMS messages, decrease in temperature and heart rate variability (HRV)], while the manic phase produces the reverse phenomenon (increase in activities, number of calls and HRV). The various studies presented support the potential interest in digital phenotyping to computerize the clinical characteristics of mood disorders.","misc","wim"
"2042",35958222,"Elicitation of the in vitro Cultures of Selected Varieties of Vigna radiata L. With Zinc Oxide and Copper Oxide Nanoparticles for Enhanced Phytochemicals Production.","This study was conducted to develop a protocol for in vitro shoot multiplication and callus induction of various mung bean varieties to obtain enhanced phytochemical content with the help of elicitors. For shoot multiplication, two types of explants (shoot tips and nodal tips) of three varieties of mung bean (Mung NCM-13, MgAT-7, and MgAT-4) were used. Both types of explants from in vitro and in vivo sources were cultured on the MS medium supplemented with different concentrations (0.25-3.0 mg/L, increment of 0.5 mg/L) and combinations of BAP and IBA as independent treatments. For callus induction, leaf explants (in vitro source) were cultured on MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D (1-3 mg/L) alone or in combination with BAP or NAA (0.5 and 1.0 mg/L). For the enhanced production of phenolics and glycosides, calli were cultured on MS media supplemented with zinc oxide (0.5 mg/L) and copper oxide nanoparticles (0.5 mg/L) as nano-elicitors. Results showed that in vitro explants responded better in terms of shoot length, number of shoots, and number of leaves per explant when compared to in vivo explants. Moreover, shoot tips were better than nodal explants to in vitro culturing parameters. All three varieties showed the optimized results in the MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/L BAP, while roots were produced only in cultures fortified with 1 mg/L IBA. The leaf explants of in vitro and soil-grown plantlets showed a maximum callogenic response of 90 and 80%, respectively, on MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D (3 mg/ml). Maximum phenolic content (101.4 μg of gallic acid equivalent/g) and glycoside content (34 mg of amygdalin equivalent/g of plant material) was observed in the calli cultured on MS medium supplemented with 3 mg/L of 2,4-D. Furthermore, the addition of zinc oxide (0.5 mg/L) and copper oxide (0.5 mg/L) nanoparticles to the callus culture medium significantly enhanced the phenolic content of Mung NCM-13 (26%), MgAT-7 (25.6%), and MgAT-4 (22.7%). Glycosidic content was also found to be increased in Mung NCM-13 (50%), MgAT-7 (37.5%), and MgAT-4 (25%) varieties when compared to the control. It is suggested that elicitation of in vitro cultures of mung beans with nanoparticles could be an effective strategy for the enhanced production of secondary metabolites.","misc","wim"

The current threat of resurgence in countries with low vaccine coverage and circulating vaccinederived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks due to oral polio vaccine warrants a strategy review. To review the performance of the GPEI from a context based in Pakistan, identifying threats to success and suggesting strategy modifications to help achieve eradication. This was a desk review of the effectiveness of GPEI that was launched in 1988 to eradicate polio by 2000. Subsequent failure to eradicate led to multiple iterations in strategy and planning documents. These documents were reviewed alongside relevant literature to explore the reasons for failure and emergence of cVDPV. GPEI has been effective in reducing the global polio disease burden by > 99%, but it remains endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan. cVDPV has caused multiple outbreaks since 2000, and caused 7 times more cases than wild poliovirus (WPV) globally in 2020. The Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018 aimed to eradicate WPV and cVDPV simultaneously. In 2019, Pakistan saw an upsurge in WPV amid an outbreak of cVDPV infection that continued throughout 2020. Wild polio eradication was not realized and the country was unable to transition to inactivated polio vaccine as predicted in the strategic plan. Over 20 countries now report cVDPV outbreaks and many others are at risk. A country-specific modified strategy is required to eradicate WPV and cVDPV simultaneously, more so in endemic countries. التحديات الناشئة أمام تحقيق استئصال شلل الأطفال عالميًّا وحلولها. محمد سلطان. وعدت «المبادرة العالمية لاستئصال شلل الأطفال» باستئصاله بحلول عام 2000، ومع ذلك ما يزال المرض متوطنًا في بلدين. ويستدعي التهديد الحالي بعودة ظهور الفيروس في البلدان ذات التغطية المنخفضة باللقاحات وفاشيات فيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات بسبب اللقاح الفموي لشلل الأطفال استعراضًا للمبادرة. هدفت هذه الدراسة الىى استعراض أداء المبادرة العالمية لاستئصال شلل الأطفال في سياق باكستان، وتحديد التهديدات التي تواجه النجاح، واقتراح تعديلات على الاستراتيجية للمساعدة على تحقيق الاستئصال. كان هذا استعراضًا مكتبيًّا لفعالية «المبادرة العالمية لاستئصال شلل الأطفال» التي أُطلقت في عام 1988، لاستئصاله بحلول عام 2000. وقد أدى الفشل اللاحق في القضاء على المرض إلى تكرارات متعددة في وثائق الاستراتيجية والتخطيط. وكذلك روجعت هذه الوثائق إلى جانب المؤلفات ذات الصلة لاستكشاف أسباب الفشل وظهور فيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات. كانت «المبادرة العالمية لاستئصال شلل الأطفال» فعالة في خفض العبء العالمي للمرض بنسبة تزيد على 99٪، لكنه ما يزال متوطنًا في باكستان وأفغانستان. وقد تسببت فيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات في فاشيات متعددة منذ عام 2000، وتسببت في حالات إصابة أكثر 7 مرات من الحالات بسبب فيروس شلل الأطفال البري على الصعيد العالمي في عام 2020. واستهدفت «الخطة الاستراتيجية لاستئصال شلل الأطفال» والشوط الأخير من استئصاله 2013–2018 استئصال فيروس شلل الأطفال البََرِّي وفيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات في الوقت نفسه. وفي عام 2019، شهدت باكستان ارتفاعًا مفاجئًا في فيروس شلل الأطفال البري وسط فاشية لعدوى فيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات استمرت طوال عام 2020. ولم يتحقق استئصال شلل الأطفال البري، ولم يتمكن البلد من التحول إلى لقاح شلل الأطفال المعطَّل على النحو المتوقع في الخطة الاستراتيجية. أبلغ الآن أكثر من 20 بلدًا عن فاشيات فيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات، أيضًا هناك بلدان كثيرة أخرى معرضة للخطر. ويلزم وضع استراتيجية مُعدَّلة خاصة بكل بلد لاستئصال فيروس شلل الأطفال البََرِّي وفيروسات شلل الأطفال الدائرة المشتقة من اللقاحات في الوقت نفسه، وينطبق ذلك أكثر على البلدان التي يتوطن بها هذا المرض. Nouveaux obstacles à l'éradication mondiale de la poliomyélite et solutions pour y remédier. L'Initiative mondiale pour l'éradication de la poliomyélite (IMEP) s'est engagée à éradiquer la maladie à l'horizon 2000, mais celle-ci reste endémique dans deux pays. La menace actuelle de résurgence dans les pays ayant une faible couverture vaccinale et des flambées épidémiques de poliovirus circulants dérivés d'une souche vaccinale (PVDVc) imputables au vaccin antipoliomyélitique oral justifie un examen de la stratégie. Examiner les performances de l'IMEP dans le contexte pakistanais, en identifiant les obstacles à la réussite et en suggérant des modifications de la stratégie pour parvenir à l'éradication. Le présent article constitue un examen documentaire de l'efficacité de l'IMEP, qui a été lancée en 1988 pour éradiquer la poliomyélite à l'horizon 2000. Par la suite, l'échec de l'éradication de la maladie a conduit à plusieurs itérations dans la stratégie et la planification. Ces documents de stratégie et de planification ont été examinés parallèlement à la littérature pertinente afin d'explorer les raisons de l'échec et de l'émergence de PVDVc. L'IMEP a réussi à réduire la charge mondiale de morbidité due à la poliomyélite de plus de 99 %, mais la maladie reste endémique en Afghanistan et au Pakistan. De multiples flambées de PVDVc ont eu lieu depuis 2000 et le nombre de cas enregistrés de PVDVc dans le monde en 2020 était sept fois supérieur à celui des cas de poliovirus sauvages (PVS). Le Plan stratégique pour l'éradication de la poliomyélite et la phase finale 2013-2018 visait à éradiquer simultanément le PVS et le PVDVc. En 2019, le Pakistan a connu une recrudescence du poliovirus sauvage dans un contexte de flambée de PVDVc qui s'est poursuivie tout au long de 2020. L'éradication du poliovirus sauvage n'a pas été réalisée et le pays n'a pas été en mesure de mener la transition vers le vaccin antipoliomyélitique inactivé comme le prévoyait le Plan stratégique. Aujourd'hui, plus de 20 pays signalent des flambées épidémiques dues à des PVDVc et de nombreux autres sont à risque. Une stratégie modifiée spécifique au pays est nécessaire pour éradiquer simultanément le PVS et le PVDVc, en particulier dans les pays d'endémie.","misc","wim"

Firstly, BA was converted into methyl betulonate (BoOMe), which was used as intermediate in the developed methodologies. 1,2-Oxazine-fused BoOMe compounds were obtained in 12-25% global yields through a Michael addition of nitromethane to methyl (E)-2-benzylidenebetulonate derivatives, followed by nitro group reduction and intramolecular cyclization. Remarkably, the triterpene acts as a diastereoselective inducer in the conjugate addition of nitromethane, originating only one diastereomer out of four possible ones. Furthermore, other oxygen and nitrogen-containing heterocycles were installed at the A-ring of BoOMe, affording 2-amino-3-cyano-4H-pyran-fused BoOMe, diarylpyridine-fused BoOMe and 1,2,3-triazole-BoOMe compounds, using simple and straightforward synthetic methodologies. Finally, BA was revealed to be a versatile starting material, allowing the creation of a molecular diversification of compounds containing a triterpenic scaffold and O- and N-heterocycles.","misc","wim"

The cell viability of each treatment group was measured by MTT. The effects of miR-222 on cell metastasis and apoptosis were measured by transwell and flow cytometry. The targeting relationship between miR-222 and CDKN1B was verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and Western blot. Cell derived xenograft was further constructed to verify the effect of miR-222 on tumor growth by observing tumor weight and volume. The proliferation of tumor tissue was determined by hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining. Compared with those in adjacent tissues and normal cells, the levels of miR-222 in OSCC tissues and cells were significantly increased (P<0.05). The miR-222 mimic group promoted tumor cell proliferation, migration and cell cycle and inhibited cell apoptosis significantly (P<0.05). The up-regulation of CDKN1B expression inhibited cell viability, migration and invasiveness and promoted the apoptosis of OSCC (P<0.05). The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay found that miR-222 was targeted to CDKN1B and could inhibit fluorescence activity (P<0.05). In vivo assays showed that miR-222 could promote tumor growth through CDKN1B (P<0.05). MiR-222 was significantly upregulated in OSCC tissues and cells and regulated tumor progression by targeting CDKN1B.","misc","wim"

In addition to Pseudomonas, the other six genera of bacteria were first reported to have the degradation ability of CPs. Bacterial categories, carbon-chain lengths and chlorination degrees were three crucial factors affecting the degradation efficiencies of CPs, with their influential ability of chlorinated degrees > bacterial categories > carbon-chain lengths. CP degradation can be performed by producing chlorinated alcohols, chlorinated olefins, dechlorinated alcohols and lower chlorinated CPs. This study will provide valuable information on CP biotransformation and targeted bacterial resources for studying the transformation processes of specific CPs in marine environments.","misc","wim"
"956",35958812,"Health Information Prediction System of Infant Sports Based on Deep Learning Network.","The sensed data from infant sports and training programs are useful in analyzing their health conditions and forecasting any disorders or abnormalities. The sensed information is processed for providing errorless predictions for infant diseases/disorders, coupled with artificial intelligence and sophisticated healthcare technologies. The problem of noncongruent sensed data impacting the forecast occurs due to errors between consecutive training iterations. This problem is addressed using the deep learning (PEST-DL) proposed perceptible error segregation technique. The training process is halted between two consecutive iterations generating errors until a similarity verification based on infant history is performed. The similarity output determines the errors due to mismatching data observations, and therefore, the data augmentation is performed. The first perceptible error is mitigated by training the learning paradigm with all possible infant history data in the learning process. This prevents prediction lag and data omissions due to discrete availability. The learning is trained from the identified error with the precise detected disorder/abnormality data previously detected. Therefore, the first and consecutive training data segregate error instances from the actual training iterations. This improves the prediction accuracy and precision with controlled error and time complexity.","misc","wim"

Currently, a resurgence of interest on studying teachers' perceptions of the moral education curriculum has observed. This is because moral education curriculum of each country plays a unique role in the overall design of the country's education curriculum. However, studies on teachers' perceptions of the moral education curriculum are scarce, and no framework has been developed to guide the teaching and learning of teachers for the moral education curriculum for schools. The moral education curriculum serves as one of the main vehicles for value education, with teachers as direct executors. It can influence the overall development of the school system and long-term development of a country. Thus, in this paper, we reviewed current literature related to teachers' perceptions of the moral education curriculum and developed future trends considering teachers' perceptions of the moral education curriculum in improving existing moral education programs in a country. We identified a list of keywords related to moral education curriculum and teacher perceptions and relevant to the scope of this study. These keywords were used to search the articles from the Scopus and WoS studies. Overall, 32 papers meeting the search criteria were retrieved. Further, we conducted thematic studies, and four themes were successfully identified: the model of teacher perceptions of moral and national education, the dimensions of the teacher ethics model (framework), teaching strategies, and the role of teachers. The results of this study suggested a new framework for research trends in teachers' perception models, particularly toward the moral education curriculum. This study contributed to the knowledge regarding teaching and learning approaches of moral education considering teachers' perceptions of the moral education curriculum. The findings of study would benefit future studies and would improve the implementation of a country's moral education program.","misc","wim"

The persistent presence of the disease includes findings of how the symptoms affected the participants and how they handled its limitations and the adaptions and medication management required. Struggling against ignorance illustrates contacts with both healthcare professionals and strangers. The participants described being forced to be experts on SM due to a general lack of knowledge. An illness or wellness perspective encompasses the participants' feelings of vulnerability and alienation, but also how various strategies were used to gain emotional control. The disease has considerable impact on everyday life, with constant efforts required to manage symptoms and medication side effects. The complexity and rarity of the disease complicated relationships with healthcare professionals and contributed to feelings of marginalisation and alienation. The participants described feeling vulnerable, but used a multitude of strategies in their striving for resilience.

Other literature has reported associations between childhood lead exposure and antisocial and criminal behavior. Little is known about the relationships among childhood maltreatment, adult lead exposure, and crime and violence. As part of a prospective longitudinal study of the long-term consequences of childhood maltreatment, children with documented histories of abuse and neglect and demographically matched control children (ages 0-11 years) were followed into adulthood and interviewed. Participants included 556 individuals who had valid blood lead level (BLL) measures at a mean age of 41.2 years. Participants had a mean age of 50.5 (SD = 3.53) years at the time of the last criminal history check used to determine the number of arrests. Childhood maltreatment predicted a higher number of arrests for any crime and any violence after the blood was collected but not higher BLLs in adulthood. There were significant paths from adult BLLs to arrests after the blood was collected, despite controlling for age, sex, race, and IQ and the inclusion of individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status, and paths from neighborhood socioeconomic status to higher BLLs in models predicting any arrest and any violent arrest after the blood was collected. These findings demonstrate how environmental toxins such as lead can affect outcomes in adulthood, including crime, and provide evidence that links neighborhood disadvantage to higher BLLs in adulthood.","misc","wim"

In a conventional dFNC pipeline, a clustering stage to summarize the connectivity patterns that are transiently but reliably realized over the course of a scanning session. However, identifying the right number of clusters (or states) through a conventional clustering criterion computed by running the algorithm repeatedly over a large range of cluster numbers is time-consuming and requires substantial computational power even for typical dFNC datasets, and the computational demands become prohibitive as datasets become larger and scans longer. Here we developed a new dFNC pipeline based on a two-step clustering approach to analyze large dFNC data without having access to huge computational power. In the proposed dFNC pipeline, we implement two-step clustering. In the first step, we randomly use a sub-sample dFNC data and identify several sets of states at different model orders. In the second step, we aggregate all dFNC states estimated from all iterations in the first step and use this to identify the optimum number of clusters using the elbow criteria. Additionally, we use this new reduced dataset and estimate a final set of states by performing a second kmeans clustering on the aggregated dFNC states from the first k-means clustering. To validate the reproducibility of results in the new pipeline, we analyzed four dFNC datasets from the human connectome project (HCP). We found that both conventional and proposed dFNC pipelines generate similar brain dFNC states across all four sessions with more than 99% similarity. We found that the conventional dFNC pipeline evaluates the clustering order and finds the final dFNC state in 275 min, while this process takes only 11 min for the proposed dFNC pipeline. In other words, the new pipeline is 25 times faster than the traditional method in finding the optimum number of clusters and finding the final dFNC states. We also found that the new method results in better clustering quality than the conventional approach (p < 0.001). We show that the results are replicated across four different datasets from HCP. We developed a new analytic pipeline that facilitates the analysis of large dFNC datasets without having access to a huge computational power source. We validated the reproducibility of the result across multiple datasets.","misc","wim"

Methods: From July 2017 to August 2019, 11 patients (5 males and 6 females, aged 13-70 years, mean 42.3 years) with acetabular tumors diagnosed by needle biopsy in our hospital were enrolled in this retrospective study. Preoperative CT and MRI enhancement examination were performed routinely, and the DICOM data were collected and imported into Medraw Print software. According to the specific anatomical morphology of acetabula, this study adopted the reverse calculation and direct design to print the individualized puncture guide plate using 3D printing technology. The puncture point and sampling approaches were determined by the guide plate morphology and the double guide-hole and slideable groove design. First, we evaluated the fitness of the 3D guide plate to the local anatomical structure, its assisted-puncture accuracy was estimated by imaging examinations, and postoperative complications were recorded. The accuracy of the needle biopsy pathological result was estimated with reference to that of the tumor resection. Results: Our results showed that the 3D printing individualized guide plate matched the patients' pelvic skin well, the puncture approach was consistent with the preoperative design, and no significant anatomical injuries including vascular and neural complications occurred after surgery. Nine patients' (90%) biopsy results were consistent with their postoperative pathological results, and one patient gave up the tumor resection. Conclusion: Based on digital image processing and 3D printing technology, the individualized guide plate can be used to guide the needle biopsy of acetabular tumors which makes the operation simpler and more precise.","misc","wim"

This study aimed at identifying predictors of mortality among patients with candidemia, with a focus on early interventions that can improve prognosis. This was a single-center retrospective study including all adult patients with at least 1 positive blood culture for Candida species from 2014 to 2021. A total of 222 episodes of candidemia were included. Most candidemias were of unknown origin (36%) or vascular catheter related (29%). Septic shock developed in 29% episodes. Overall, 14-day mortality rate was 23%. In univariate analyses, septic shock was associated with higher 14-day mortality, whereas catheter-related candidemia and early (<72 hours) interventions, such as appropriate antifungal therapy, source control, and infectious diseases consultation, were associated with improved survival. In a Cox multivariate regression model, septic shock (odds ratio [OR], 3.62 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.05-6.38]) was associated with higher mortality. While the impact of early antifungal therapy did not reach statistical significance, early (<72 hours) infectious diseases consultation (OR, 0.46 [95% CI, .23-.91]) and early source control (OR, 0.15 [95% CI, .08-.31]) were associated with better survival. Subanalyses showed that the benefits of early source control, specifically catheter removal, were significant among patients with sepsis or septic shock, but not among those without sepsis. These associations remained significant after exclusion of patients who died prematurely or were in palliative care. Early source control, in particular catheter removal, was a key determinant of outcome among candidemic patients with sepsis or septic shock.","misc","wim"

It constitutes a major health problem in many tropical areas in Africa. This study assessed the prevalence of intestinal and blood protozoans' parasitic load and their risk factors among pregnant women visiting antenatal care at Tafo Hospital, Ghana from November 2016 to January 2017. A pilot cross-sectional study was conducted among consented pregnant women who visited antenatal care at Tafo Government Hospital, Kumasi Ghana. Structured questionnaires were administered to obtain socio-demographic data, knowledge on protozoan infections, and their risk factors among study participants. A stool sample was obtained from each participant for the microscopic examination of the intestinal protozoa. Venous blood was taken from participants for the detection of Plasmodium and Toxoplasma gondii infections. Wet mount and the faecal protozoan concentrated method were done for the identification of intestinal parasites. Blood films and serological examination for malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) were done for identification of Plasmodium parasites while an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for detecting the antibodies of T. gondii among participants. Data were analyzed using statistical packages for the social sciences (SPSS). The mean age of the study participants was 27.83, and ranges from 18 to 40 years. The majority of the participants (82.2%) had never experienced stillbirth nor spontaneous abortion. Intestinal parasites were found in 36.7% of participants. Giardia lamblia (28.1%), Cryptosporidium parvum (5.3%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (3.3%) were among the intestinal protozoans detected. T. gondii antibodies were detected by high levels of immunoglobulins, resulting in IgG (48.0%) and IgM (11.3%) being found among participants, with 7.3% testing positive for both IgM and IgG. The prevalence of malaria infection among the study participants was 2.7%. The consumption of raw or cooked vegetables had significant influence on their intestinal and blood protozoan infections status (p = 0.004) (OR = 0.32, CI = 0.12-0.86). There was a significant association between Hb levels and malaria (p = 0.014) and that of intestinal protozoans (p = 0.035). The prevalence of intestinal protozoans and blood protozoans such as T. gondii were high and therefore effective measures should be put in place to reduce the infectivity. Environmental hygiene should be improved and education by relevant agencies should be intensified on the possible transmission of intestinal and blood parasite infections given the possible role of these infections in adverse pregnancy outcomes.","misc","wim"

The goal of this treatment was to boost up the fiber-polymer interfacial linkage. The action was conducted in a superheated steam oven at various times (30-120 min) and temperatures (170-220 °C). The biocomposites were assessed in terms of mechanical characteristics, dimensional stability and morphological properties. Compared to different treatment temperatures, the results showed that treatment at 210 °C for 60 min offered the best tensile characteristics. Because of the presence of SHS-Jute, the tensile, impact, bending and dimensional stability of the bio-composites have been improved. The FTIR and SEM study revealed progress in the interfacial linkage between SHS-Jute and PLA. This interfacial link improves the bending strength of SHS-Jute-PLA biocomposites by about 15.64%. X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigation also showed an elevation in the crystalline structure with the incorporation of SHS-Jute. The degradation tests of the biocomposite were carried out in deionized water. SHS treatment reduces hemicellulose contents in jute fiber which causes water uptake% reduction is 54% in SHS-Jute-PLA. The SHS-Jute-PLA biocomposite appeared with promising characteristics for utilization as a green and ecological substitute particle board material.","misc","wim"

One hundred and eight patients with severe IUA admitted to our hospital from May 2019 to October 2021 were selected for the study. Patients were divided according to their treatment regimen into group A (n = 54) treated with hysteroscopic cold broad sword play + drospirenone and ethinylestradiol tablets and group B (n = 54) treated with hysteroscopic cold broad sword play + estrogen and progestin sequential therapy. The two groups were compared in terms of perioperative indicators, recovery of uterine cavity status, inflammatory factor (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8)] levels), World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Scale (WHOQOL-BREF) score, and clinical outcome at 3 months postoperatively. After surgery, the duration of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding was shorter in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). After surgery, the time of menstruation return was shorter in group A than in group B, and the menstrual flow score was higher than in group B (P < 0.05). At 3 months after the surgery, the uterine blood flow index, endometrial thickness, and uterine cavity volume were higher in group A than in group B, and the number of uterine readhesion was lower than in group B (P < 0.05). 3 months after the surgery, the CRP, IL-6, and IL-8 levels decreased in both groups and were lower in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). At 3 months after the surgery, the WHOQOL-BREF scores for each indicator were higher in both groups than before surgery and were higher in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). At 3 months after the surgery, the overall valid rate of group A was 94.44% better than that of group B at 79.63% (P < 0.05). The combination of hysteroscopic cold broad sword play with drospirenone and ethinylestradiol tablets has been shown to be more effective than combined estrogen and progestin sequential therapy in the treatment of patients with severe IUA, which significantly improves the post-operative menstrual status and uterine cavity morphology, significantly reduces the level of inflammatory factors in the patient's body, and significantly improves the quality of life, which is of value.","misc","wim"

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of maternal age on mortality and major morbidity among very preterm infants admitted to Chinese neonatal intensive care units. Data from a retrospective multi-center cohort of all complete care very preterm infants admitted to 57 neonatal intensive care units that participated in the Chinese Neonatal Network from January 1st to December 31st, 2019 were analyzed. Neonatal outcomes including mortality or any major morbidity, defined as necrotizing enterocolitis stage 2 or 3, moderate & severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, severe retinopathy of prematurity, or sepsis. A multiple logistic regression model was constructed to analyze the independent association between maternal age and neonatal outcome. Among 7,698 eligible newborns, 80.5% of very preterm infants were born to mothers between the ages of 21 and 35 years, with 18.0% born to mothers >35 years and 1.5% born to mothers <21 years. Higher rates of maternal hypertension, maternal diabetes, cesarean deliveries, antenatal steroid usage were noted as maternal age increased. The proportion of prenatal care, cesarean section, antenatal steroid usage and inborn for very preterm infants born to mothers <21 years was lower than those of mothers of other ages. Compared to the ages of 21-35 years group, the odds of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (adjusted odd ratio: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.08-3.71) was significantly higher in the ages of 15-20 years group. Increasing maternal age was associated with higher rates of small for gestational age and lower birth weight of very preterm infants, but no correlation between advanced maternal age and very preterm infants mortality or major morbidity. Among very preterm infants, increasing maternal age was associated with higher rates of small for gestational age but not neonatal mortality or major morbidity.

These differences are observed in the sensory, motor, parietal, and frontal cortex. Children with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) experience deficits in auditory, motor, and executive function domains. Therefore, we hypothesized that short-term music training in children with an FASD due to prenatal alcohol exposure may improve brain function. Children (N = 20) with an FASD were randomized to participate in either five weeks of piano training or to a control group. Selective attention was evaluated approximately seven weeks apart (pre-/post-music training or control intervention), examining longitudinal effects using the Attention Networks Test (ANT), a well-established paradigm designed to evaluate attention and inhibitory control, while recording EEG. There was a significant group by pre-/post-intervention interaction for the P250 ms peak of the event-related potential and for theta (4-7 Hz) power in the 100-300 ms time window in response to the congruent condition when the flanking stimuli were oriented congruently with the central target stimulus in fronto-central midline channels from Cz to Fz. A trend for improved reaction time at the second assessment was observed for the music trained group only. These results support the hypothesis that music training changes the neural indices of attention as assessed by the ANT in children with an FASD. This study should be extended to evaluate the effects of music training relative to a more closely matched active control and determine whether additional improvements emerge with longer term music training.","misc","wim"

Our findings indicate that despite challenges of ?being in foster care?, youth found ways to pursue their goals and make their voices heard through developing stable relationships with supportive adults (including judges, caseworkers, or lawyers) and demanding that child welfare professionals ?speak to me not at me.? Youth indicated that their needs, capabilities, and goals changed as they matured and as their circumstances changed. Such changes helped them find their voices but also created tensions within their child welfare system interactions. This led us to develop the theory of adaptive responsivity, according to which child welfare stakeholders should respond appropriately to developmental and circumstantial changes to help child-welfare involved youth face difficult circumstances and thrive.

A small number of recurrent variants (detected in three or more individuals) in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 and ATM represented the majority of the P/LP variants described in this cohort. In this cohort, the prevalence of L/PL was high, particularly involving the BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2 and ATM genes and, to a lesser extent than expected, the TP53 gene. A high frequency of recurrent variants was also observed, for which further and larger analyses should clarify the presence of any possible founder effect.

Moreover, chiral isomerism may lead to sensing errors. In this paper, a six-hole helical microstructured optical fiber (HMSF) with a thin-gold-film-coat based on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect was designed. The twist sensing characteristics of this fiber were further analyzed. Numerical calculation and analysis show that the combination of helical effect and SPR effect can design an HMSF-based sensor that is very sensitive to distortion. In the torsion range of ±300°, the distortion sensitivity can reach 2470.7 pm/(rad/m), and the linear correlation coefficient is 0.99996. Based on the special sensing mechanism, it has a good linear coefficient over a large range. Additionally, the direction of the twist can be easily discerned. The HMSF in this work not only has high sensitivity, high linearity, high fault tolerance rate, and a wide range of measurement, but is also easy to manufacture. Therefore, it is promising in the field of twist sensing and has a good application prospect.","misc","wim"

Emerging research findings suggest that misophonia may have a unique neural signature. Specifically, when examining responses to misophonic trigger sounds, differences emerge at a physiological and neural level from potentially overlapping psychopathologies. While these findings are preliminary and in need of replication, they support the hypothesis that misophonia is a unique disorder. In this theoretical paper, we begin by reviewing the candidate networks that may be at play in this complex disorder (e.g., regulatory, sensory, and auditory). We then summarize current neuroimaging findings in misophonia and present areas of overlap and divergence from other mental health disorders that are hypothesized to co-occur with misophonia (e.g., obsessive compulsive disorder). Future studies needed to further our understanding of the neuroscience of misophonia will also be discussed. Next, we introduce the potential of neurostimulation as a tool to treat neural dysfunction in misophonia. We describe how neurostimulation research has led to novel interventions in psychiatric disorders, targeting regions that may also be relevant to misophonia. The paper is concluded by presenting several options for how neurostimulation interventions for misophonia could be crafted.","misc","wim"

A generic synthetic route has been explored to apply the current investigation to the majority of the market available synthetic routes for the carvedilol process. Five significant GTIs were identified, and their toxicity was examined using in-silico model. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the impurities were compared with the drug molecule to evince the associated risk of impurities during therapeutic action. Furthermore, a quantitative comparison has been made for each impurity with the drug molecule for their ADMET properties, and the potential nature of the impurities has been thoroughly assessed. The developed method encompasses simple derivatization cum extraction-oriented GC-MS method for the reported GTIs, which was also validated as per current ICH guidelines. The obtained LOD and LOQ for the method were between 0.06 ~ 0.61 µg/g and 0.17 ~ 1.8 µg/g, respectively, and the r2 values (0.994 ~ 0.997) show that the method is very sensitive and linear over a wide range (LOQ to 120 % of the target concentration). The percentage recoveries and relative standard deviation obtained were between 85.3 and 109.5 and 0.1-4.7, respectively, showing fit for purpose. Moreover, method precision, intermediate precision, and robustness of the method have also been successfully demonstrated. Thus, this method could be directly engaged as the quality forecasting tool for the marketed drug samples aimed at the estimation of the reported GTIs at trace level.","misc","wim"

S. mutans membrane vesicles (MVs) contain virulence proteins, which play roles in biofilm formation and disease progression. Our previous research found that S. mutans MVs harboring glucosyltransferases augment C. albicans biofilm formation by increasing exopolysaccharide production, but the specific impact of S. mutans MVs on C. albicans virulence and pathogenicity is still unknown. In the present study, we developed C. albicans biofilms on the surface of cover glass, hydroxyapatite discs and bovine dentin specimens. The results showed that C. albicans can better adhere to the tooth surface with the effect of S. mutans MVs. Meanwhile, we employed C. albicans biofilm-bovine dentin model to evaluate the influence of S. mutans MVs on C. albicans biofilm cariogenicity. In the S. mutans MV-treated group, the bovine dentin surface hardness loss was significantly increased and the surface morphology showed more dentin tubule exposure and broken dentin tubules. Subsequently, integrative proteomic and metabolomic approaches were used to identify the differentially expressed proteins and metabolites of C. albicans when cocultured with S. mutans MVs. The combination of proteomics and metabolomics analysis indicated that significantly regulated proteins and metabolites were involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. In summary, the results of the present study proved that S. mutans MVs increase bovine dentin demineralization provoked by C. albicans biofilms and enhance the protein and metabolite expression of C. albicans related to carbohydrate metabolism.","misc","wim"

"1646",35961166,"Dynamic longitudinal relations among solitary drinking, coping motives, & alcohol problems during emerging adulthood.","Solitary drinking (i.e., drinking alone) and coping drinking motives are risk factors for alcohol problems. Theoretical models suggest that solitary drinking and coping motives are highly related. However, the direction of effects between solitary drinking and coping motives is unclear. It also remains unclear if relations are present solely at the between-person level, or if there are also dynamic, within-person relations. Therefore, the current study tested dynamic, reciprocal relations among solitary drinking, coping motives, and alcohol problems using Random Intercept Cross Lagged Panel Modeling (RI-CLPM). Data came from a large alcohol administration study with longitudinal follow-ups over 2 years (N = 448). Participants completed a baseline session and then were followed up 6, 12, 18, and 24 months later. Participants reported their solitary drinking frequency, coping motives, drinking behavior, and alcohol problems at all assessments. Person-level solitary drinking was related to person-level coping motives and alcohol problems, and person-level coping motives were related to person-level alcohol problems. There were also contemporaneous within-person effects, such that a within-person increase in solitary drinking was associated with a concurrent within-person increase in coping motives, and a within-person increase in coping motives was associated with a concurrent within-person increase in alcohol problems. There were no within-person prospective relations among any variables. Findings suggest strong between-person associations among solitary drinking, coping motives, and alcohol problems. Within-person associations were concurrent but not prospective. Targeting solitary and coping-motivated drinkers, as well within-person increases in both, may be effective at reducing risk for alcohol problems.","misc","wim"

Appropriate biofilm models are important to develop and improve to make progress in future biofilm research. Here, we investigated the ability of PF hydrogel material to facilitate the development and study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in vitro and in vivo. Wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 bacteria were embedded in PF hydrogel situated in vitro or in vivo, and the following aspects were investigated: 1) biofilm development; 2) host immune response and its effect on the bacteria; and 3) efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Microscopy demonstrated that P. aeruginosa developed typical biofilms inside the PF hydrogels in vitro and in mouse peritoneal cavities where the PF hydrogels were infiltrated excessively by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). The bacteria remained at a level of ~106 colony-forming unit (CFU)/hydrogel for 7 days, indicating that the PMNs could not eradicate the biofilm bacteria. β-Lactam or aminoglycoside mono treatment at 64× minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) killed all bacteria in day 0 in vitro biofilms, but not in day 1 and older biofilms, even at a concentration of 256× MIC. Combination treatment with the antibiotics at 256× MIC completely killed the bacteria in day 1 in vitro biofilms, and combination treatment in most of the cases showed significantly better bactericidal effects than monotherapies. However, in the case of the established in vivo biofilms, the mono and combination antibiotic treatments did not efficiently kill the bacteria. Our results indicate that the bacteria formed typical biofilms in PF hydrogel in vitro and in vivo and that the biofilm bacteria were tolerant against antibiotics and host immunity. The PF hydrogel biofilm model is simple and easy to fabricate and highly reproducible with various application possibilities. We conclude that the PF hydrogel biofilm model is a new platform that will facilitate progress in future biofilm investigations, as well as studies of the efficacy of new potential medicine against biofilm infections.","misc","wim"

This study investigated the feasibility of combining radionuclides with photothermal agents in the diagnosis and treatment of ATC. 131I was labeled on human serum albumin (HSA) by the standard chloramine T method. 131I-HSA and indocyanine green (ICG) were non-covalently bound by a simple stirring to obtain 131I-HSA-ICG nanoparticles. Characterizations were performed in vitro. The cytotoxicity and imaging ability were investigated by cell/in vivo experiments. The radio-photothermal therapy efficacy of the nanoparticles was evaluated at the cellular and in vivo levels. The synthesized nanoparticles had a suitable size (25-45 nm) and objective biosafety. Under the irradiation of near-IR light, the photothermal conversion efficiency of the nanoparticles could reach 24.25%. In vivo fluorescence imaging and single-photon emission CT (SPECT)/CT imaging in small animals confirmed that I-HSA-ICG/131I-HSA-ICG nanoparticles could stay in tumor tissues for 4-6 days. Compared with other control groups, 131I-HSA-ICG nanoparticles had the most significant ablation effect on tumor cells under the irradiation of an 808-nm laser. In summary, 131I-HSA-ICG nanoparticles could successfully perform dual-modality imaging and treatment of ATC, which provides a new direction for the future treatment of iodine-refractory thyroid cancer.","misc","wim"

Here, we present a facile solution-mixing process to fabricate a multiwalled carbon nanotube/graphite powder (MWCNT@Gp) film, which has high sensitivity and great linearity and is more oriented to flexible piezoresistive sensors. The sensor consists of two parts: a spinosum microstructure shaped by a sandpaper template and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the top substrate and interdigital electrodes as the bottom substrate. The experiments we have conducted show that these two parts provide good protection to the MWCNTs@Gp film and improve sensor sensitivity. Additionally, the sensitivity of the optimal ratio of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and graphite powder is analyzed. The 5%MWCNT@5%Gp composites were found to have relatively good conductivity, which is convenient for the fabrication of conductive films of piezoresistive sensors. Finally, we conducted application experiments and found that the flexible piezoresistive sensor can detect minute signals of human motion and different pressure points. This indicates the feasibility of portable sensors in electronic skin and smart devices.","misc","wim"

This study was a large scale school-based cross-sectional study among children and adolescents aged 5-20 years old. Participants were selected by the school-based registration system in 2020. All the subjects underwent spherical equivalent (SE) error with non-cycloplegic autorefraction measurement. Myopia was defined as an SE refraction of ≤-0.75 diopters (D) and graded into low myopia (-0.75 to -3.00 D), moderate myopia (-3.01 to -5.99 D), and high myopia (≤-6.00 D). A total of 1,059,838 participants were eligible for this survey and 1,013,206 (95.6% participation rate) were selected through data quality control, which comprised 17 districts/counties and 1,254 schools, including 861 elementary schools, 313 middle schools, and 80 high schools. The mean age of participants was 11.57 ± 3.36 years (5-20 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 1.11. The whole city-level prevalence of total myopia was 75.35%. The prevalence of total myopia among the students in the Hanting District was 45.47%, but ≈82.37% of students living in Changyi have myopia. The overall prevalence of low myopia in elementary, middle, and high school students was 48.56, 47.30, and 31.62%, respectively, while high myopia (SE ≤ -6.00 D) prevalence was 1.12, 8.89, and 20.12%, respectively. The overall prevalence of myopia increased fastest in children aged 7-9 years old. The prevalence of high myopia was 7.59% for girls and 6.43% for boys, respectively (p < 0.001).

"1255",35964359,"Role of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in anxiety disorder with thyroid lesions.","Patients with anxiety disorder (AD) often have structural and functional abnormalities of the thyroid gland, but their specific causes remain unclear. N-methyl- d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play an important role in many psychosomatic diseases and tumorigenesis, but there are few reports on the role of NMDARs in AD with thyroid lesions, especially thyroid nodules (TNs). A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients admitted to the hospital with AD (n = 71) as the main diagnosis from April to October 2021. Meanwhile, patients with TNs with no AD (NAD-TN group, n = 20) and healthy subjects (HS group, n = 37) with matched age, sex, and education were randomly collected as controls. Patients with AD were sub-grouped into the AD with TNs (AD-TN group, n = 41) and the AD with no TNs (AD-NTN group, n = 30). The thyroid ultrasound reports, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores, and the expression of NMDARs and their subunits (NR1, NR2A, and NR2B) and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis-related hormones were analyzed in all subjects. Some patients with TNs underwent surgery and postoperative pathological examination. Patients with AD showed a lower level of free triiodothyronine (FT3) and higher levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and NMDARs and their subunits compared to the healthy controls. The expression of the NR2A subunit was higher in the AD-TN group than that in other three groups (AD-NTN, NAD-TN, and HS groups, F = 13.650, p < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the level of NMDARs was positively correlated with the HAMA scores (B = 1.622, p = 0.029) and the maximum diameter of TNs (B = 3.836, p = 0.005). Immunohistochemical results showed that the NR2A subunit was widely expressed in multinodular goiter (MNG) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tissues, while the expression of the NR2B subunit was lower in PTC adjacent and MNG tissues and almost absent in PTC tissues. In a sample of mostly women hospitalized with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or panic disorder, abnormal expression of NMDARs is closely related to AD with thyroid lesions, NMDAR subunits may have various activities and exert diverse effects in TNs, and the NR2A subunit may be an important regulator in AD with TNs.","misc","wim"
"2173",35966206,"Homeostatic regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activity and axonal Kv7.3 expression by prolonged blockade of hippocampal neuronal activity.","Homeostatic plasticity encompasses the mechanisms by which neurons stabilize their synaptic strength and excitability in response to prolonged and destabilizing changes in their network activity. Prolonged activity blockade leads to homeostatic scaling of action potential (AP) firing rate in hippocampal neurons in part by decreased activity of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptors and subsequent transcriptional down-regulation of potassium channel genes including KCNQ3 which encodes Kv7.3. Neuronal Kv7 channels are mostly heterotetramers of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits and are highly enriched at the axon initial segment (AIS) where their current potently inhibits repetitive and burst firing of APs. However, whether a decrease in Kv7.3 expression occurs at the AIS during homeostatic scaling of intrinsic excitability and what signaling pathway reduces KCNQ3 transcript upon prolonged activity blockade remain unknown. Here, we report that prolonged activity blockade in cultured hippocampal neurons reduces the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) followed by a decrease in the activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor, Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). Furthermore, both prolonged activity blockade and prolonged pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 decrease KCNQ3 and BDNF transcripts as well as the density of Kv7.3 and ankyrin-G at the AIS. Collectively, our findings suggest that a reduction in the ERK1/2 activity and subsequent transcriptional down-regulation may serve as a potential signaling pathway that links prolonged activity blockade to homeostatic control of BDNF-TrkB signaling and Kv7.3 density at the AIS during homeostatic scaling of AP firing rate.","misc","wim"

A major challenge is however to create selective growth conditions that are favourable to PHA-storers. Our study thus investigates to what extent the influent COD to phosphorus (COD:P) ratio can be used as a tool for the robust selection of PHA-storers in a single continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR). Therefore, we operated five CSTRs in parallel, fed with synthetic wastewater (50% acetate - 50% propionate) with different COD:P ratios (200-1000 gCOD gP-1), and performed a detailed analysis of the microbial communities over long-term (30-70 solid retention times). Our study demonstrates that efficient and robust selection of PHA-storers can be achieved in a single CSTR at high influent COD:P ratios. The selective advantage for PHA-storers increases with the influent COD:P ratio, but only if growth conditions remain limited by both C-substrate and P. In contrast, selection performance deteriorates when COD:P ratios are too high and growth conditions are limited by P only. At an optimal COD:P ratio of 800 gCOD gP-1, a stable microbial community consisting of >90% PHA-storers and dominated by Pannonibacter sp. was selected in the long-term. Finally, our results suggest that high COD:P ratios provide a selective advantage to microorganisms with low cellular P requirements, explaining why different PHA-storers (i.e., Xanthobacter sp. vs. Pannonibacter sp.) were selected depending on the influent COD:P ratio (i.e., 200 vs. 800 gCOD gP-1). Overall, our results provide relevant insights for the development of a new approach for selecting PHA-storers, based on the use of a single CSTR and control of the influent COD:P ratio.","misc","wim"

However, a certain number of micro/nano-scale particles are inevitably present in the fresh or aged biochar, which may facilitate the downward transport of contaminants along the soil profile, posing a detrimental impact on the groundwater. Herein, the effects of biochar colloids derived from wood chip and wheat straw at two temperatures (350 °C and 500 °C) on the transport and transformation of Cr(VI) in soil were investigated. All biochar colloids facilitated the transport of Cr(VI) in a loam clay Ultisol, which was attributed to the competition between biochar colloids and Cr(VI) for the available sorption sites on the soil surface. Wheat straw biochar colloids caused more transport of Cr(VI) than wood chip ones due to the more negative charge and higher polarity, which resulted in stronger electrostatic repulsion and competition with Cr(VI). It is soluble Cr(VI) that dominated the transport of Cr in the effluent solution, however, the particulate Cr(VI) could be reduced into Cr(III) before being carried by biochar colloids for co-transport. The 350 °C biochar colloids had higher electron donating capacities than 500 °C ones, resulting in more reduction of Cr(VI) and more co-transport as biochar colloids-associated Cr(III) in the effluent. Moreover, the more negatively charged 350 °C biochar colloids could also attach more soil Fe oxides, further facilitating the cotransport of Cr via the formation of a binary or ternary complex. Modeling showed the experimental-consistently results that biochar colloids caused 0.5-7.0 times faster transport of Cr(VI) than no biochar colloids in the long-term period. Our findings demonstrate that biochar colloids can enhance transport and transformation of Cr(VI) in soils, which arouse migration risk concern about in-situ remediation of Cr(VI)-contaminated soils by biochar.","misc","wim"

Here, a unique and industrially scalable synthesis of platinum-based electrocatalysts on graphene derivative (GD) supports is presented. With an innovative approach, highly homogeneous as well as high metal loaded platinum-alloy (up to 60 wt %) intermetallic catalysts on GDs are achieved. Accelerated degradation tests show enhanced durability when compared to the CB-supported analogues including the commercial benchmark. Additionally, in combination with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Auger characterization and Raman spectroscopy, a clear connection between the sp 2 content and structural defects in carbon materials with the catalyst durability is observed. Advanced gas diffusion electrode results show that the GD-supported catalysts exhibit excellent mass activities and possess the properties necessary to reach high currents if utilized correctly.

Residents who were assessed during and prior to the lockdown were compared to residents of the same wards with 2 assessments prior to the lockdown. We used mixed models and generalized estimating equation analyses to explore differences in changes in mood, withdrawal and aggressive behavior, loneliness and conflict, and cognition and delirium. We also explored whether the effect of the lockdown differed for different subgroups. In 2 online focus groups, LTCF care professionals, ranging from care staff to physicians, reflected on their experiences of the effect of the lockdown and the cohort study results. The lockdown group of 298 residents was compared to the control group of 625 residents. Self-reported mood symptoms showed a slightly greater increase during the lockdown. During the first half of the lockdown, the level of conflict with other residents decreased whereas it increased in the control group. The subgroup with moderate-severe cognitive impairment showed a decrease in withdrawal during the lockdown, whereas the group with no-mild cognitive impairment showed a statistically nonsignificant relative increase. Professionals described great individual variation in the effects of the lockdown on residents. Facilities attempted to preserve the experienced positive effects, for example, by promoting tranquility in shared rooms and continuing to organize individualized ward-based activities. We did not find clinically relevant negative effects of the lockdown on mood, behavior, and social and cognitive functioning in older residents of LTCFs at the group level. Possibly, staff mitigated the negative effects at the group level. Meanwhile, they learned lessons that they continue to apply to enhance resident well-being.","misc","wim"
"75",35958611,"Three Chinese pedigrees of A20 haploinsufficiency: clinical, cytokine and molecular characterization.","Haploinsufficiency of A20 (HA20) is a newly described rare autoinflammatory disease caused by TNFAIP3 gene mutations. HA20 has seldom been documented in the Chinese population. Herein, we report eight patients with HA20 from three unrelated families in China. Eight Chinese Han patients were diagnosed with HA20 in our department from 2018 to 2021. Their clinical data and genotypes were carefully documented and studied. The newly identified variants were functionally verified. We also conducted a systematic literature review of HA20, and the clinical characteristics and genotype of HA20 between the Chinese population and other populations were compared. Eight HA20 patients from three families comprised six adults and two children. There was one man and seven women. The clinical characteristics included recurrent oral ulcers (8/8, 100%), fever (4/8, 50%), perianal ulcer (3/8, 38%), skin lesions (2/8, 25%), arthritis (1/8, 13%), and uveitis (1/8, 13%). Three TNFAIP3 variants, A547T, c.1906+2T>G, and R271X, were identified. Two novel variants, A547T and c.1906+2T>G, were validated to be pathogenic in our study. In a literature review a total of 126 patients with HA20 reported by 35 articles were included. The clinical phenotype of Chinese HA20 patients was similar to that of patients from other populations except for a lower frequency of genital ulcers (16.7% vs. 54.4%, p < 0.01). Autoantibodies were detectable in approximately one-third of the 126 patients, among which ANA and anti-thyroid antibodies were commonly seen. The rarity and diversity of phenotypes make the diagnosis of HA20 a huge challenge to physicians. HA20 should be considered in child-onset patients with manifestations that resemble Behçet's syndrome, especially those whose family members have similar symptoms. Gene testing is critically helpful for the diagnosis of HA20. Two novel TNFAIP3 variants, A547T and c.1906+2T>G, were identified in this study.","misc","wim"

Previous studies have shown that nicotine has a potential inhibitory effect on the toxicity of NNK. However, due to the lack of CYP2A13 activity in conventional lung cell lines, there had been no systematic in vitro investigation for the key target organ, the lung. Here, BEAS-2B cells stably expressing CYP2A13 (B-2A13 cells) were constructed to investigate the effects of nicotine on the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of NNK. The results showed more sensitivity for NNK-induced cytotoxicity in B-2A13 cells than in BEAS-2B and B-vector cells. NNK significantly induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and chromosomal damage in B-2A13 cells, but had no significant effect on BEAS-2B cells and the vector control cells. The combination of different concentration gradient of nicotine without cytotoxic effects and a single concentration of NNK reduced or even counteracted the cytotoxicity and multi-dimensional genotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, CYP2A13 caused the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of NNK in BEAS-2B cells, and the addition of nicotine could inhibit the toxicity of NNK.","misc","wim"

In this study, the effects of different denaturants on the properties of a hot-pressed peanut meal (HPM)-based adhesive before and after crosslinking were studied. Papain, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), urea and crosslinker-polyamide epichlorohydrin (PAE) were used to prepare HPM-based adhesives. The functional groups, bonding strength, thermal behaviors, mass loss, moisture uptake value, viscosity and fracture surface of adhesive samples were analyzed. As a result, (1) papain was used to break HPM protein (HPMP) into polypeptide chains and to reduce the water resistance. (2) SDS and urea unfold the HPMP molecule and expose internal hydrophobic groups to improve the water resistance of the adhesive. (3) A denser network structure was formed by PAE and HPMP molecules, which significantly improved the bonding strength and water resistance of adhesives. In particular, after SDS denaturation and PAE crosslinking, compared with pure HPM adhesive, the wet shear strength increased by 96.4%, the mass loss and moisture uptake value reduced by 41.4% and 69.4%, and viscosity increased by 30.4%.

Thus, a field experiment was conducted for two consecutive seasons (2018-2019 and 2019-2020) to study the effect of phosphorus dynamics and biostimulant application on the agro-morphological traits, essential oil (EO) yield, and chemical constituents of German chamomile in the mid hills of the western Himalayan region. The experiment consisted of 12 treatments, four phosphorus fertilizer levels (0, 30, 60 and 90 kg ha-1) and three biostimulants levels (control, amino acid at 5 mL L-1, and humic acid at 10 mL L-1). The experiment was replicated three times in a factorial complete randomized block design (FRBD). Agro-morphological and yield characteristics were significantly higher in phosphorus at 90 kg ha-1 and humic acid application compared to the control. Dry flower and EO yield was 17.87 and 26.76% higher with the 90 kg ha-1 phosphorus application while 2.45 and 5.79% higher in humic acid at 10 mL L-1 compared to the control. The EO constituents viz., chamazulene was 12.04 and 8.85% higher in phosphorus at 90 kg ha-1 and humic acid at 10 mL L-1 application compared to the control. On the other hand, α-bisabolol oxide B and α-bisabolol oxide A were decreased with increase in phosphorus application. This study presents novel facts, elucidation, and explanation for farmers and industrialists to produce German chamomile in acidic soils by integrating biostimulants with phosphorus fertilization and getting maximum yield and quality EO.","misc","wim"

HMGA2 overexpression is common in variants of hydropic, intravenous and lipo-LM. Cellular or highly cellular LM (CLM) is a LM variant with a less well-defined molecular nature. In this study, we identified and examined 52 hypercellular LM with sclerotic collagen, herein defined as cellular leiomyoma with sclerosis (CLM-S). CLM-S shows large tumour size (average 12.2 cm) and characteristic histology of tumour cells, arranged in cellular fascicles, sheets and trabeculae with abundant dense, pink sclerotic extracellular matrix in bands and nodules and increased vascularity. Tumour cells are uniform with small, round-oval nuclei and scant, pale-eosinophilic to vacuolated cytoplasm reminiscent of pericytes. The differential diagnosis of CLM-S includes conventional CLM, endometrial stromal tumours and perivascular epithelioid cell tumour. Immunohistochemical profile [HMGA2, fumarate hydratase, smooth muscle markers, Melan A and HMB-45] and molecular alterations [by HMGA2 mRNA reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), HMGA2 fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and MED12 sequencing] were analysed in comparison to matched myometrium and CLM controls. Remarkably, 96% (50 of 52) of CLM-S demonstrated diffuse positive immunoreactivity for HMGA2 and up to an 80-fold increase in HMGA2 mRNA, determined by RT-PCR. FISH analysis with break-part probes at intron 3 and the 5' UTR detected HMGA2 rearrangements in 47% (18 of 38) of CLM-S. All CLM-S retained expression of fumarate hydratase. No MED12 mutations were found in any CLM-S. Our findings show that CLM-S has unique and characteristic histomorphology probably driven by HMGA2 overexpression.","misc","wim"

This method allowed us to analyze the interaction of a mixture of medicinal herbal ingredients with a mixture of membrane proteins to identify the two interacting ingredients. As it does not require specialized equipment (e.g., a two-dimensional liquid chromatography system), this SEC-MS method enables the analysis of interactions between LMW compounds and relatively high-expressed membrane proteins without immobilization or derivatization of the molecules.","misc","wim"

At present, the commonly used filling material is bone cement, which can only provide physical support without bone regeneration effect. The long-term stress at the interface may cause the loosening of bone cement. The ideal filling material should provide not only strong mechanical support but also promote bone regeneration. We introduce a 3D printing frame-filling structure in this study. The structure was printed with polylactic acid/bioactive glass as the frame, and bone cement as the filler. In this system, bone cement was used to provide immediate fixation, and the frame provided long-term fixation by promoting osteogenic induction and conduction between the interface. The results showed that the degradation of bioactive glass in the frame promoted osteogenic metabolism, induced M2 polarization of macrophages, and inhibited local inflammatory response. The in vivo study revealed that implantation of the frame-filling structure significantly promoted bone regeneration in the femoral bone defect area of New Zealand white rabbits. For a bone defect in a weight-bearing area, long-term stability could be obtained by bone integration through this frame-filling structure.","misc","wim"

The rising demand of AAT poses a defined need for new processes of AAT manufacturing from recombinant sources. Commercial affinity adsorbents for AAT purification present the intrinsic limitations of protein ligands - chiefly, the high cost and the lability towards the proteases in the feedstocks and the cleaning-in-place utilized in biomanufacturing - which limit their application despite their high capacity and selectivity. This work presents the development of small peptide affinity ligands for the purification of AAT from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture harvests. An ensemble of ligand candidates identified via library screening were conjugated on Toyopearl resin and evaluated via experimental and in silico AAT-binding studies. Initial ranking based on equilibrium binding capacity indicated WHAKKSKFG- (12.9 mg of AAT per mL of resin), WHAKKSHFG- (16.3 mg/mL), and KWKHSHKWG- (15.8 mg/mL) Toyopearl resins as top performing adsorbents. Notably, the fitting of adsorption data to Langmuir isotherms concurred with molecular docking and dynamics in returning values of dissociation constant (KD) between 1 - 10 µM. These peptide-based adsorbents were thus selected for AAT purification from CHO fluids, affording values of AAT binding capacity up to 13 gram per liter of resin, and product yield and purity up to 77% and 97%. WHAKKSHFG-Toyopearl resin maintained its purification activity upon 20 consecutive uses, demonstrating its potential for AAT manufacturing from recombinant sources.","misc","wim"

The effects of Cs-SeNPs on cell growth were evaluated in monolayer and 3D-tumor spheroid culture. Cell migration and cell invasion were determined using a trans-well assay. The effect of Cs-SeNPs on chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitivity of glioma cells was determined in tumor spheroids. An in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model was established to test the permeability of Cs-SeNPs. SeNPs and Cs-SeNPs can reduce the cell viability of glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with SeNPs, Cs-SeNPs more strongly inhibited 3D-tumor spheroid growth. Cs-SeNPs exhibited stronger effects in inhibiting cell migration and cell invasion than SeNPs. Improved 5-FU sensitivity was observed in Cs-SeNP-treated cells. Cellular uptake in glioma cells indicated a higher uptake rate of coumarin-6-labeled Cs-SeNPs than SeNPs. The capability of coumarin-6 associated Cs-SeNPs to pass through the BBB was confirmed. Taken together, Cs-SeNPs provide exceptional performance and are a potential alternative therapeutic strategy for future glioma treatment.","misc","wim"

Heterogeneity in terms of molecules and immune cell infiltration drives NAFLD from one stage to the next. However, a precise molecular classification of NAFLD is still lacking, and the effects of complex clinical phenotypes on the efficacy of drugs are usually ignored. We introduced multiple omics data to differentiate NAFLD subtypes via consensus clustering, and a weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify eight co-expression modules. Further, eigengenes of eight modules were analyzed with regard to Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Furthermore, the infiltration rates of 22 immune cell types were calculated with CIBERSORT and the ESTIMATE algorithm. In total, 111 NAFLD patients from three independent GEO datasets were divided into four molecular subtypes, and the corresponding clinical features and immune cell infiltration traits were determined. Based on high gene expression correlations, four molecular subtypes were further divided into eight co-expression modules. We also demonstrated a significant correlation between gene modules and clinical phenotypes. Moreover, we integrated phenotypic, immunologic, and genetic data to assess the potential for progression of different molecular subtypes. Furthermore, the efficacy of drugs against various NAFLD molecular subtypes was discussed to aid in individualized therapy. Overall, this study could provide new insights into the underlying pathogenesis of and drug targets for NAFLD.","misc","wim"

In addition, the application prospect in China was also evaluated. In the experiment, five treatments with three replications and a randomized complete block design were followed. The treatments were: furrow application of fluopimomide (25% suspension concentrate, SC) at the dosage of 375, 750, and 1,500 g ha-1, which was recommended, double recommended, and quadruple recommended dosages, respectively. Besides, common control fungicide fluopicolide (5% SC) furrow was applied at recommended application dosages of 750 mL ha-1, and a non-treated control was also undertaken. Results indicated that fluopimomide exhibited no effects on the amount of soil bacteria and actinomycetes, and its inhibition effect on fungi amount could be recovered at 60 days after treatment (DAT). With the recommended application dosage, fluopimomide could efficiently reduce the number of plant pathogens in soil by 79.56-85.80%, significantly reduce the disease incidences in tomato plants by 80.00-88.24%, and improve plant height by 13.25-24.05% and marketable yield by 16.88%. Furthermore, soil enzymes exhibited a complex response to fluopimomide, and AOB and nifH gene copy numbers were increased by the double and quadruple recommended dosage of fluopimomide.

Studies have demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment plays a key role in regulating osteosarcoma progression. Recent studies have also shown that scRNA-seq plays an essential role in understanding the tumor heterogeneity and distinct subpopulations of tumors. In order to further understand the scRNA-seq data of osteosarcoma tissues, the present study further analyzed the scRNA-seq dataset (GSE152048) and explored the potential role of nuclear receptor-related genes in the pathophysiology of osteosarcoma. In our analysis, we identified 11 cell types in all the osteosarcoma tissues and nuclear receptors (NRs) were distributed in all types of cells. Further stratification analysis showed that NRs were mainly detected in TIL and Osteoblastic of the metastasis osteosarcoma, in TIL, Myoblast, Endothelial, and Myeloid of the primary osteosarcoma, and in Chondroblastic, Osteoblast, and Pericyte of the recurrent osteosarcoma. The NRs were also differentially expressed in different cell types among the metastasis, primary, and recurrent osteosarcoma. Furthermore, several NRs such as NR4A2, NR4A1, and NR3C1 have been found to be differentially expressed in most types of DEGs among metastasis, primary, and recurrent osteosarcoma. A high expression of NR4A1 in the osteosarcoma tissues was significantly correlated with a shorter 5-year overall survival of patients with osteosarcoma. On the other hand, there was no significant association between NR4A2 expression and the 5-year overall survival of patients with osteosarcoma. The expression of NR4A1 was significantly higher in the metastasis osteosarcoma tissues than in the primary osteosarcoma tissues as validated from GSE32981 and GSE154540. The expression of NR4A1 was significantly higher in osteosarcoma tissues from patients with poor chemosensitivity than that from patients with good chemosensitivity as validated from GSE154540. Further analysis of the scRNA-seq data revealed that the percentage of osteoblasts with a high NR4A1 expression was higher in the recurrent osteosarcoma tissues than that with a low NR4A1 expression. In conclusion, the present study may suggest that NR4A1 may be an important prognostic biomarker for osteosarcoma progression.

To overcome eradication by the innate immune system during infection, A. baumannii developed a number of immune evasion strategies. Previously, we identified CipA as a plasminogen-binding and complement-inhibitory protein. Here we show that CipA inhibits all three complement activation pathways and interacts with key complement components C3, C3b, C4b, C5, Factor B, Factor D, and in particular Factor I. CipA also targets function of the C5 convertase as cleavage of C5 was impaired. Systematic screening of CipA variants identified two separate binding sites for C3b and a Factor I-interacting domain located at the C-terminus. Structure predictions using AlphaFold2 and binding analyses employing CipA variants lacking Factor I-binding capability confirmed that the orientation of the C-terminal domain is essential for the interaction with Factor I. Hence, our analyses point to a novel Factor I-dependent mechanisms of complement inactivation mediated by CipA of A. baumannii. Recruitment of Factor I by CipA initiates the assembly of a quadripartite complex following binding of either Factor H or C4b-binding protein to degrade C3b and C4b, respectively. Loss of Factor I binding in a CipA-deficient strain, or a strain producing a CipA variant lacking Factor I-binding capability, correlated with a higher susceptibility to human serum, indicating that recruitment of Factor I enables A. baumannii to resist complement-mediated killing.","misc","wim"

OSNs are generated from basal cells, which show the characteristics of progenitor/stem cells. In the mammalian OE, persistent neurogenesis occurs during lifetime, providing a unique model to study the tissue turnover and fate determination of stem cells. Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis and RNAscope in situ hybridization indicated the localization of leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) in the intact and injured OE. Lineage tracing was conducted to analyze the dynamic role of Lgr5+ cells in the OE homeostasis and regeneration. We also used DTR-driven genetic depletion of Lgr5+ cells and lentivirus-mediated Lgr5 downregulation to demonstrate the essential role of Lgr5+ cells in the OE regeneration. Results: We show that Lgr5 marks horizontal basal cells (HBCs) in the OE of adults but not newborns. We revisit the role of Lgr5+ cells in the OE homeostasis and regeneration, and find that Lgr5+ cells participate in the OE homeostasis from neonatal to one-month-old age, as well as in the OE regeneration post injury. During the OE regeneration, Lgr5 is transiently expressed in apical supporting cells, immature neurons, and mature sensory neurons. The Lgr5+ cells become or generate HBCs in the regenerated OE. DTR-driven cell depletion shows that Lgr5+ cells are not necessary in the adult OE homeostasis, but required in the recovery of OE from injury. Lgr5 down-regulation by lentiviral infection also demonstrates the essential role of Lgr5 expression in the OE regeneration. Conclusion: Our study elucidates the role of Lgr5+ cells in the OE homeostasis and regeneration, potentially providing a candidate to cell-based therapy against olfactory dysfunction.","misc","wim"

Spread of 16S rRNA methylases which can cause high-level resistance to AG antibiotics, limits this treatment choice. Although there are some studies showing that errors in determining AG susceptibility in automated systems may be related to the armA gene, one of the 16S rRNA methylase genes, the exact reason for these errors is not yet known. In our study, we aimed to investigate the relevance of 16S rRNA methylases to the discrepancies between VITEK 2.0 and disc diffusion test results for amikacin (AK) and gentamicin (GEN) susceptibility of Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. All K.pneumoniae and A.baumannii isolates from 1st January-10th February 2018 were collected prospectively and included in the study. Additionally, two initial isolates from July 2017 (one K.pneumoniae and one A.baumannii isolate) for which first discrepant susceptibility results were determined, were also included. Amikacin and gentamicin susceptibility results of 37 isolates [A. baumannii (n= 20) and K.pneumoniae (n= 17)] were evaluated together with VITEK 2.0 system, disc diffusion and gold standard broth microdilution methods and minor error (mE), major error (ME) and very major error (VME) rates were calculated. The rmtB, rmtC and armA genes in isolates were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the relationship between the presence of 16S rRNA methylases and false susceptibility results were examined. In addition, disc diffusion test results were evaluated at the end of four, six, eight hours and one night incubation periods to examine the effect of the double zone phenotype observed in 13 of the study isolates on rapid susceptibility tests. All disc diffusion test results were found to be compatible with broth microdilution test results. When the VITEK 2.0 system and the broth microdilution test were compared, 10.3% and 12.1% VME and 8.1% and 5.4% mE were detected for AK and GEN susceptibility results, respectively. While rmtB and rmtC genes were not detected in the study isolates, armA gene was positive in eight (47.1%) of 17 K.pneumoniae isolates and in 15 (75%) of 20 A.baumannii isolates. All three VMEs in A.baumannii isolates were detected in AK susceptibility results. Two of those were armA gene positive and one was armA gene negative isolates. All four VMEs in K. pneumoniae isolates were detected in GEN susceptibility results only, and all of these isolates were armA gene positive. No direct correlation was found between the errors detected in the VITEK 2.0 system susceptibility results and the double zone phenotype. When the isolates were evaluated in the 4-16 hours incubation time interval, it was observed that resistant colonies could be detected after a minimum of six hours of incubation period in the inhibition zone surrounding the aminoglycoside discs. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of armA producing A.baumannii from Turkey. The high rate of armA gene positivity detected in our isolates suggested that the prevalence of armA gene increased in our country or at least in our region, in recent years. In the AG susceptibility results of the VITEK 2.0 system, the rate of VME above the acceptance criterion has shown that the errors occurred were not directly related to armA gene positivity or double zone phenotype. Finally, our study results indicated that AG susceptibility results should be evaluated minimum six hours later of incubation while implementing rapid susceptibility tests.","misc","wim"

The red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit are indexes to be evaluated in blood routine tests. The purpose of this study was to clarify their predictive value for temporary postoperative complications in patients that had undergone CBT surgery. This retrospective trial included data from 169 patients received surgical treatment for CBT from October 2008 to September 2018 in this retrospective study. Postoperative follow-up was conducted under the guidance of both vascular surgeon and neurologist. The symptoms existed less than 2 years postoperatively were regarded as temporary injuries. The red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were obtained from the complete blood count results of the participants. Analyses of multilevel multivariable regression and descriptive statistics were conducted. The baseline data showed no significant difference. Patients were predominantly women (53.8%), with a mean age of 42.6 years. The total incidence of temporary postoperative complications was 22 (13.0%), including transient ischemic attack (8, 4.7%), tongue bias (7, 4.1%), dysphagia (2, 1.2%), hoarseness (4, 1.8%), and eyelid ptosis (1, 2.4%). The univariate and multivariate regression analysis results revealed that the occurrence of temporary postoperative complications was increased with age [odd ratio (OR, 0.09; 95% CI (CI), 0.9-1.0; P = 0.014], length of operation time (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.0-1.0; P = 0.005), Shamblin type II vs. I (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-0.5; P = 0.008), red blood cell count postoperative (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.8; P = 0.026), hemoglobin (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.9-1.0; P = 0.011), and hematocrit (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-1.0; P = 0.025). The smooth curve fitting showed that the trend of complications occurrence rate was reduced with the increase of patients' postoperative red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Gender, weight, length of operation, Shamblin type, postoperative red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were included in the risk model with AUC = 0.86. These patients with CBT who received surgical resection with low postoperative red blood cell, hemoglobin, or hematocrit had a high risk of temporary postoperative complications. The risk prediction model established for predicting temporary postoperative complications showed satisfactory prediction effects.","misc","wim"

This is particularly relevant in the Iranian population where male infertility is relatively high. Objective: This study was designed to investigate the relationship between different SNPs of these genes and male infertility among the Iranian population. Materials and Methods: The present project was a population-based, case-control study conducted on 120 idiopathic azoospermia or severe oligospermia infertile cases alongside 120 age-matched subjects enrolled as controls. Overall, 3 variants from the AR gene and 2 variants from ER- α were genotyped - ARrs137852568, ARrs137852599 and AR rs137852563, and ER- α rs796065354 and ER- α rs104893956- using amplification refractory mutation system methods. Results: The obtained results indicated a significant association between AR rs1378525568 TT genotype as well as AR rs137852599 C allele with odds of male infertility (OR: 0.433, CI: 0.197-0.951 and OR: 0.545, CI: 0.304-0.978, respectively). Other variants of AR were not related to male infertility. A significant association was noted between predisposition polymorphism ER- α rs796065354 genotypes with male infertility. This significant association was not seen between ER- α rs104893956 and the risk of idiopathic azoospermia or severe oligospermia. Heterozygote overdominance was also observed in ESR rs796065354 but not in the other variants studied. Conclusion: Pieces of evidence were found on the association of novel polymorphisms of AR and ER- α with male infertility among the Iranian population.

"2226",35958988,"Temporal Cortex Microarray Analysis Revealed Impaired Ribosomal Biogenesis and Hyperactivity of the Glutamatergic System: An Early Signature of Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease.","Pathogenic aging is regarded as asymptomatic AD when there is no cognitive deficit except for neuropathology consistent with Alzheimer's disease. These individuals are highly susceptible to developing AD. Braak and Braak's theory specific to tau pathology illustrates that the brain's temporal cortex region is an initiation site for early AD progression. So, the hub gene analysis of this region may reveal early altered biological cascades that may be helpful to alleviate AD in an early stage. Meanwhile, cognitive processing also drags its attention because cognitive impairment is the ultimate result of AD. Therefore, this study aimed to explore changes in gene expression of aged control, asymptomatic AD (AsymAD), and symptomatic AD (symAD) in the temporal cortex region. We used microarray data sets to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the help of the R programming interface. Further, we constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by performing the STRING plugin in Cytoscape and determined the hub genes via the CytoHubba plugin. Furthermore, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis via Bioconductor's cluster profile package. Resultant, the AsymAD transcriptome revealed the early-stage changes of glutamatergic hyperexcitability. Whereas the connectivity of major hub genes in this network indicates a shift from initially reduced rRNA biosynthesis in the AsymAD group to impaired protein synthesis in the symAD group. Both share the phenomenon of breaking tight junctions and others. In conclusion, this study offers new understandings of the early biological vicissitudes that occur in the brain before the manifestation of symAD and gives new promising therapeutic targets for early AD intervention.","misc","wim"

As a secondary metabolic product, enzymatic biosynthesis as the early stage of β-ocimene is a factor that needs to be known. Thus, this study was done to identify the mechanism of the two well-known terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, namely Mevalonate Acid (MVA) and 1-Deoxy-D-Xylulose 5-Phosphate (DXP) pathways, in the biosynthesis of β-ocimene in salam leaves. The activity of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR)-MVA pathway-determining enzyme and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS)-DXP pathway-determining enzyme in the crude enzyme and their derivative products of salam leaves were analysed for their changes by differences of substrate ratios and enzyme inhibitors. The results showed that the activity of the HMGR enzyme was lower significantly than the DXS enzyme based on the addition of variations to the substrate ratio. These results were also supported by the enzyme and substrate reaction products, MVA and Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) intermediates from the MVA pathway, which were significantly lower when compared to DXP and IPP intermediates from the DXP pathway. As the end product of the reaction, β-ocimene gave a significantly higher value of the DXP pathway than the MVA pathway. Therefore, it can conclude that the mechanism of the biosynthetic pathway of β-ocimene in salam leaves was synthesised via the DXP pathway. The production of β-ocimene could have crosstalk-pathway through the MVA pathway, especially when the DXP pathway was blocked.","misc","wim"

To quantify population access to community pharmacies across the United States. We obtained addresses for pharmacy locations in the United States from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs and geocoded each. For a 1% sample of a U.S. synthetic population, we calculated the driving distance to the closest pharmacy using ArcGIS. We estimated the proportion of population living within 1, 2, 5, and 10 miles of a community pharmacy. We quantified the role of chain vs regional franchises or independently owned pharmacies in providing access across degrees of urbanicity. We identified 61,715 pharmacies, including 37,954 (61.5%) chains, 23,521 (38.1%) regional franchises or independently owned pharmacies, and 240 (0.4%) government pharmacies. In large metropolitan areas, 62.8% of the pharmacies were chains; however, in rural areas, 76.5% of pharmacies were franchises or independent pharmacies. Across the overall U.S. population, 48.1% lived within 1 mile of any pharmacy, 73.1% within 2 miles, 88.9% within 5 miles, and 96.5% within 10 miles. Across the United States, 8.3% of counties had at least 50% of residents with a distance greater than 10 miles. These low-access counties were concentrated in Alaska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana. Community pharmacies may serve as accessible locations for patient-centered, medication management services that enhance the health and wellness of communities. Although chain pharmacies represent the majority of pharmacy locations across the country, access to community pharmacies in rural areas predominantly relies on regional franchises and independently owned pharmacies.","misc","wim"
"1490",35957881,"RET signaling pathway and RET inhibitors in human cancer.","Rearranged during transfection (RET) receptor tyrosine kinase was first identified over thirty years ago as a novel transforming gene. Since its discovery and subsequent pathway characterization, RET alterations have been identified in numerous cancer types and are most prevalent in thyroid carcinomas and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In other tumor types such as breast cancer and salivary gland carcinomas, RET alterations can be found at lower frequencies. Aberrant RET activity is associated with poor prognosis of thyroid and lung carcinoma patients, and is strongly correlated with increased risk of distant metastases. RET aberrations encompass a variety of genomic or proteomic alterations, most of which confer constitutive activation of RET. Activating RET alterations, such as point mutations or gene fusions, enhance activity of signaling pathways downstream of RET, namely PI3K/AKT, RAS/RAF, MAPK, and PLCγ pathways, to promote cell proliferation, growth, and survival. Given the important role that mutant RET plays in metastatic cancers, significant efforts have been made in developing inhibitors against RET kinase activity. These efforts have led to FDA approval of Selpercatinib and Pralsetinib for NSCLC, as well as, additional selective RET inhibitors in preclinical and clinical testing. This review covers the current biological understanding of RET signaling, the impact of RET hyperactivity on tumor progression in multiple tumor types, and RET inhibitors with promising preclinical and clinical efficacy.","misc","wim"

There is an unsatisfactory result for refractory CVO by sharp recanalization alone. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of blunt impingement followed by sharp recanalization for the treatment of CVO in hemodialysis patients. This study retrospectively examined hemodialysis patients with CVO who failed to recanalize using standard guidewire and catheter techniques in our department. In the first instance, all CVOs were recanalized using blunt impingement techniques, including a 6-Fr long sheath (Cook Incorporated, Bloomington, IN USA) and an 8-Fr sheath of Rosch-Uchida Transjugular Liver Access Set (RUPS-100; Cook Incorporated, Bloomington, IN, USA). If this was not successful, sharp recanalization devices were applied, including the stiff tip of a guidewire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), the RUPS-100, and the percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD) needle (Cook Incorporated, USA). All patients were followed up at least 4 months postoperatively. The technical success rate, arteriovenous access patency rates, and operation-related complications were analyzed. The procedural success rate was 100.0% (30 of 30). Thirty patients with CVO underwent blunt impingement with a technique success rate of 70.0% (21 of 30), and 9 patients received sharp recanalization after failed blunt impingement, with a technique success rate of 100.0% (9 of 9). The primary patency rates at 6 and 12 months postoperatively were 86.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The primary assisted patency rates were 93.3% and 63.3%, and the secondary patency rates were 93.3% and 70.0% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. One major procedure-related complication was detected, namely, a small injury of the superior vena cava (SVC) wall in a patient receiving recanalization via the stiff end of a guidewire, but this did not require further treatment. It is potentially effective and safe for interventionalists to use blunt impingement followed by sharp recanalization techniques to treat chronic CVO that is refractory to traversal using traditional catheter and guidewire techniques.","misc","wim"
"1211",35959350,"Research on Optimization Scheme for Blocking Artifacts after Patch-Based Medical Image Reconstruction.","Due to limitations of computer resources, when utilizing a neural network to process an image with a high resolution, the typical processing approach is to slice the original image. However, because of the influence of zero-padding in the edge component during the convolution process, the central part of the patch often has more accurate feature information than the edge part, resulting in image blocking artifacts after patch stitching. We studied this problem in this paper and proposed a fusion method that assigns a weight to each pixel in a patch using a truncated Gaussian function as the weighting function. In this method, we used the weighting function to transform the Euclidean-distance between a point in the overlapping part and the central point of the patch where the point was located into a weight coefficient. With increasing distance, the value of the weight coefficient decreased. Finally, the reconstructed image was obtained by weighting. We employed the bias correction model to evaluate our method on the simulated database BrainWeb and the real dataset HCP (Human Connectome Project). The results show that the proposed method is capable of effectively removing blocking artifacts and obtaining a smoother bias field. To verify the effectiveness of our algorithm, we employed a denoising model to test it on the IXI-Guys human dataset. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of both models show that the fusion method proposed in this paper can effectively remove blocking artifacts and demonstrates superior performance compared to five commonly available and state-of-the-art fusion methods.","misc","wim"

Clinical characteristics were investigated in 3840 elderly T2DM patients according to their different durations of diabetes (< 1 year, 1~5 years, 5~10 years, and ≥ 10 years). Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests were used to assess the differences among groups for continuous variables. The chi-square and post hoc tests were carried out for dichotomous variables. The logistic regression was adopted to investigate the relationships between various durations of diabetes and the control rates of achieving the control targets for T2DM as well as diabetic vascular complications. There were 972, 896, 875 and 1097 patients with a duration of diabetes of <1, 1~5, 5~10 and ≥10 years, respectively. In logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, BMI, smoking and family history of diabetes, elderly T2DM patients with a duration of diabetes of ≥10 years were more likely to reach the comprehensive control targets for TC (ORTC = 1.36, 95% CI =1.14-1.63), LDL-C (ORLDL-C = 1.39, 95% CI =1.17-1.66), TG (ORTG = 1.76, 95% CI =1.46-2.12) and BMI (ORBMI = 1.82, 95% CI =1.52-2.18).

Among other benefits, EEG-fMRI can contribute to a better understanding of brain connectivity and networks. This review lays its focus on the methodologies applied in performing EEG-fMRI studies, namely techniques used for the recording of EEG inside the scanner, artifact removal, and statistical analysis of the fMRI signal. We will investigate simultaneous resting-state and task-based EEG-fMRI studies and discuss their clinical and technological perspectives. Moreover, it is established that the brain regions affected by a task-based neural activity might not be limited to the regions in which they have been initiated.

As an actionable biomarker, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) alterations have been revealed as a vital biomarker and associated with favorable outcomes in BC. However, the comprehensive relationship between the FGFR3 alteration associated gene expression profile and the prognosis of BC remains ambiguous. Genomic alteration profile, gene expression data, and related clinical information of BC patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genomics database (TCGA), as a training cohort. Subsequently, the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to identify the hub modules correlated with FGFR3 alteration. The univariate, multivariate, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analyses were used to obtain an FGFR3 alteration-related gene (FARG) prognostic signature and FARG-based nomogram. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used for evaluation of the ability of prognosis prediction. The FARG signature was validated in four independent datasets, namely, GSE13507, GSE31684, GSE32548, and GSE48075, from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Then, clinical feature association analysis, functional enrichment, genomic alteration enrichment, and tumor environment analysis were conducted to reveal differential clinical and molecular characterizations in different risk groups. Lastly, the treatment response was evaluated in the immunotherapy-related dataset of the IMvigor210 cohort and the frontline chemotherapy dataset of GSE48276, and the chemo-drug sensitivity was estimated via Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC). There were a total of eleven genes (CERCAM, TPST1, OSBPL10, EMP1, CYTH3, NCRNA00201, PCDH10, GAP43, COLQ, DGKB, and SETBP1) identified in the FARG signature, which divided BC patients from the TCGA cohort into high- and low-risk groups. The Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated that BC patients in the low-risk group have superior overall survival (OS) than those in the high-risk group (median OS: 27.06 months vs. 104.65 months, p < 0.0001). Moreover, the FARG signature not only showed a good performance in prognosis prediction, but also could distinguish patients with different neoplasm disease stages, notably whether patients presented with muscle invasive phenotype. Compared to clinicopathological features, the FARG signature was found to be the only independent prognostic factor, and subsequently, a FARG-based prognostic nomogram was constructed with better ability of prognosis prediction, indicated by area under ROC curve (AUC) values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS of 0.69, 0.71, and 0.79, respectively. Underlying the FARG signature, multiple kinds of metabolism- and immune-related signaling pathways were enriched. Genomic alteration enrichment further identified that FGFR3 alterations, especially c.746C>G (p.Ser249Cys), were more prevalent in the low-risk group. Additionally, FARG score was positively correlated with ESTIMATE and TIDE scores, and the low-risk group had abundant enrichment of plasma B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ naive T cells, and helper follicular T cells, implying that patients in the low-risk group were likely to make significant responses to immunotherapy, which was further supported by the analysis in the IMvigor210 cohort as there was a significantly higher response rate among patients with lower FARG scores. The analysis of the GDSC database finally demonstrated that low-risk samples were more sensitive to methotrexate and tipifarnib, whereas those in the high-risk group had higher sensitivities in cisplatin, docetaxel, and paclitaxel, instead. The novel established FARG signature based on a comprehensive FGFR3 alteration-related transcriptomic profile performed well in prognosis prediction and was also correlated with immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatment responses, which had great potential in future clinical applications.","misc","wim"

This report aimed to describe a patient with a sparsely granulated corticotroph tumor (SGCT) presenting with apoplexy and remission of hypercortisolism. A 33-year-old male patient presented via ambulance with sudden onset of severe headache and nausea/vomiting. Physical examination revealed bitemporal hemianopsia, diplopia from right-sided third cranial nerve palsy, abdominal striae, facial plethora, and dorsal and supraclavicular fat pads. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a 3.2-cm mass arising from the sella turcica with hemorrhage compressing the optic chiasm, extension into the sphenoid sinus and cavernous sinus. Initial investigations revealed a plasma cortisol level of 64.08 (reference range [RR], 2.36-17.05) mcg/dL. He underwent emergent transsphenoidal surgery. Pathology was diagnostic of SGCT. Postoperatively, the following laboratory findings were found: (1) cortisol level, <1.8 ug/dL (RR, 2.4-17); (2) adrenocorticotropic hormone level, 36 pg/mL (RR, 0-81); (3) thyroid-stimulating hormone level, 0.07 uIU/mL (RR, 0.36-3.74); (4) free thyroxine level, 1 ng/dL (RR, 0.8-1.5); (5) luteinizing hormone level, <1 mIU/mL (RR, 1-12); (6) follicle-stimulating hormone level, 1 mIU/mL (RR, 1-12); and (7) testosterone level, 28.8 ng/dL (RR, 219.2-905.6), with ongoing requirement for hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, testosterone replacement, and continued follow-up.

Task results revealed (1) less aversive Pavlovian inhibition in ADHD patients with clinically relevant hyperactivity/impulsivity than in those without; and (2) enhanced Pavlovian inhibition across all ADHD patients after TAU+MBCT compared with TAU. These findings offer new insights in the neurocognitive mechanisms of hyperactivity/impulsivity in ADHD and its treatment: We reveal a role for Pavlovian inhibitory mechanisms in understanding hyperactive/impulsive behaviors in ADHD and point toward MBCT as an intervention that might influence these mechanisms.","misc","wim"
"802",35965249,"Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between lipid accumulation product and hyperuricemia.","Lipid accumulation product (LAP) is a novel, sex-specific, index-describing lipid over accumulation. Previous studies used baseline LAP for predicting hyperuricaemia; however, the relationship between them is unclear. We aimed to investigate the relationship between LAP and the risk of hyperuricaemia in the Central Chinese population. This large-scale observational study comprised a cross-sectional population sample and a prospective cohort of 44,294 healthy subjects. This study examined the association between LAP and the risk of hyperuricaemia in the total sample and subgroups using multiple logistic regression analysis and multivariate cox proportional hazards model analysis. As a result, there was a dose-response relationship between LAP and the risk of hyperuricaemia. The prevalence of hyperuricaemia was 13.4% in the cross-sectional study. During 9 years of follow-up, hyperuricaemia occurred in 928 (19.8%) participants. The corresponding hazard ratios after multiple adjustments of hyperuricaemia in the second, third and fourth quartile were 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.72), 2.01 (95% CI, 1.54-2.63), and 2.44 (95% CI, 1.80-3.30)-fold higher vs. the first quartile, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the association between LAP and the risk of hyperuricaemia was more pronounced in females, individuals≤49 years old and subjects with eGFR ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2. LAP was positively related to the risk of hyperuricaemia in the Central Chinese population, particularly in women, individuals≤49 years old and adults with relatively normal renal function. These findings suggested the potential of LAP as an independent risk indicator in preventing hyperuricaemia.","misc","wim"

The contamination of freshwater leads to various issues for microorganisms and humans. This paper proposes a novel method to remove excess copper from the water. The nanotubes are used as a powder in membrane form to remove the copper from the water. The multiwalled carbon nanotube is widely used as a membrane for filtration. It contains many graphene layers of nm size that easily adsorbs the copper when the water permeates through it. Activated carbon is the earliest and most economical method that also adsorbs copper to a certain extent. This paper proposes the methods of involving the activated carbon in the multiwalled carbon nanotube to improve the adsorption capability of the copper. Here, activated carbon is impregnated on the multiwalled carbon nanotube's defect and imperfect surface areas. It makes more adsorption sites on the surface, increasing the adsorption amount. The same method is applied to Hydroxyl functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Both the methods showed better results and increased the copper removal. The functionalized method removed 93.82% copper, whereas the nonfunctionalized method removed 80.62% copper from the water.","misc","wim"

The Starbase database and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay were used to analyze the interaction between lncRNA WT1 antisense RNA (lncRNA WT1-AS) and microRNA-186-5p (miR-186-5p). Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis was performed to determine lncRNA WT1-AS and miR-186-5p levels. An oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury model was established. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and flow cytometric assays, respectively. Caspase 3 activity was evaluated using a caspase 3 activity detection kit. The results showed that miR-186-5p is a direct target of the lncRNA WT1-AS. In addition, lncRNA WT1-AS levels were downregulated and miR-186-5p levels were upregulated in the blood samples of patients with ischemic stroke and OGD-induced SH-SY5Y cells. WT1-AS overexpression promoted OGD-induced cell viability and reduced the cell apoptosis and caspase 3 activity. However, these effects were reversed by miR-186-5p overexpression. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) was directly targeted by miR-186-5p. Similarly, transfection with the miR-186-5p inhibitor reduced OGD-induced neuronal damage by upregulating XIAP expression. In conclusion, lncRNA WT1-AS attenuates hypoxia/ischemia-induced neuronal injury in cerebral ischemic stroke through the miR-186-5p/XIAP axis.","misc","wim"

Because of the relatively high recurrence rate of OC, it is crucial to understand the associated mechanisms of drug resistance and to discover potential target for rational targeted therapy. Cell death is a genetically determined process. Active and orderly cell death is prevalent during the development of living organisms and plays a critical role in regulating life homeostasis. Ferroptosis, a novel type of cell death discovered in recent years, is distinct from apoptosis and necrosis and is mainly caused by the imbalance between the production and degradation of intracellular lipid reactive oxygen species triggered by increased iron content. Necroptosis is a regulated non-cysteine protease-dependent programmed cell necrosis, morphologically exhibiting the same features as necrosis and occurring via a unique mechanism of programmed cell death different from the apoptotic signaling pathway. Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is characterized by the formation of membrane pores and subsequent cell lysis as well as release of pro-inflammatory cell contents mediated by the abscisin family. Studies have shown that ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis are involved in the development and progression of a variety of diseases, including tumors. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in the occurrence, development, and therapeutic potential of OC.","misc","wim"

In this study, biochars were prepared by the co-pyrolysis of cotton stalk with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in the proportions of 1:0, 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1 (w/w) at 400 °C, 450 °C, and 500 °C and maintaining them for 1 h. The effects of the co-pyrolysis of cotton stalk with LDPE on the properties of biochars (e.g., pH, yield, elemental analysis, specific surface area, etc.) and the Pb(II) removal capacity were analyzed. Co-pyrolysis cotton stalks with LDPE could delay the decomposition of LDPE but could promote the decomposition of cotton stalk. At 400 °C and 450 °C, the addition of LDPE decreased the H/C ratio, while no significant difference was found between the pristine biochar and the blended biochar pyrolyzed at 500 °C. An FTIR analysis indicated that the surface functional groups of biochar were not affected by the addition of LDPE, except for CH3 and CH2. The results of the SEM showed that LDPE could cover the surface of biochar when pyrolyzed at 400 °C, while many macropores were found in the blended biochar that was pyrolyzed at 450 °C and 500 °C, thus increasing its surface area. The blended biochar that was pyrolyzed at 500 °C was more effective in the removal of Pb(II) than the cotton-stalk-derived biochar, which was dominated by monolayer adsorption with a maximum adsorption capacity of approximately 200 mg·g-1. These results suggested that the co-pyrolysis of cotton stalks and LDPE may be used to produce biochar, which is a cost-effective adsorbent for heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions.","misc","wim"

The four-core fiber (FCF) between the fan-in and fan-out couplers was tapered and the diameter became smaller, so that the distance between the four cores arranged in a square became gradually smaller to produce supermodes. The two ends of the TFCF were respectively connected to the fan-in and fan-out couplers so that the individual cores in the FCF could link to the separate single-mode fibers. A broadband light source (superluminescent diodes (SLD)) spanning 1250-1650 nm was injected into any one of the four cores, and the orientation was thus determined. In the tapering process, the remaining three cores gradually approached the excitation core in space to excite several supermodes based on the tri-core structure first, and then transited to the quadruple-core structure. The field distributions of the excited supermodes were asymmetric due to the corner-core excitation scheme, and the interference thus resulted in a higher measurement sensitivity. When the diameter of the TFCF was 7.5 μm and the tapered length was 2.21 mm, the sensitivity of the bending sensor could reach 16.12 nm/m-1.","misc","wim"

In order to apply controlling rules to the WT blade, a state-of-the-art semi-analytical solution is developed to obtain WT blade lateral displacement under external loadings. The proposed method maps the WT blade to a Euler-Bernoulli beam under the same conditions to find the blade's vibration and dynamic responses by solving analytical vibration solutions of the Euler-Bernoulli beam. The governing equations of the beam with PZT patches are derived by integrating the PZT transducer vibration equations into the vibration equations of the Euler-Bernoulli beam structure. A finite element model of the WT blade with PZT patches is developed. Next, a unique transfer function matrix is derived by exciting the structures and achieving responses. The beam structure is projected to the blade using the transfer function matrix. The results obtained from the mapping method are compared with the counter of the blade's finite element model. A satisfying agreement is observed between the results. The results showed that the method's accuracy decreased as the sensors' distance from the base of the wind turbine increased. In the designing process of the LQR controller, various weighting factors are used to tune control actions of the AVC system. LQR optimal control gain is obtained by using the state-feedback control law. The PZT actuators are located at the same distance from each other an this effort to prevent neutralizing their actuating effects. The LQR shows significant performance by diminishing the weights on the control input in the cost function. The obtained results indicate that the proposed smart control system efficiently suppresses the vibration peaks along the WT blade and the maximum flap-wise displacement belonging to the tip of the structure is successfully controlled.","misc","wim"
"1590",35958095,"Method for CaOx crystals isolation from plant leaves.","Although calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals are present in many plants they are poorly studied. A possible limitation is the lack of methods for CaOx crystals isolation at high concentration and high purity, which is required for the analysis of their associated biomolecules such as proteins. To our knowledge, there are only four works that have isolated proteins from CaOx crystals. Those methods basically consist of grinding the plant material, filtration steps, enzymatic digestions, and density-based separation. However, they lack of steps to evaluate the quality and purity of the isolated crystals. Likewise, those works do not evaluate whether the crystals obtained carry contaminating proteins. In the present work a detailed method for CaOx crystals isolation from amaranth leaves is described, which can be used to isolate crystals from other plant leaves. The present method is based on previous works with the addition of cleaning steps to removal contaminating protein, separation of crystals by size, and microscopic monitoring to validate the purification efficiency. Main steps for CaOx crystals isolation:•Plant leaves are ground and several washing steps, including enzymatic digestions and centrifugation, are carried out to remove cellular debris and contaminating proteins.•CaOx crystals are enriched by centrifugation in sodium polytungstate.•The different forms of crystals are separated by filtration.","misc","wim"

PBA symptoms vary according to the volume, location, and the metastasis of the tumor. The most common symptoms include suprapubic pain, hematuria, dysuria, and bladder irritation. In the initial stage, the diagnosis of PBA is possibly delayed due to the lack of obvious symptoms. When diagnosed, up to 40% of patients are reported to have metastatic disease. PBA can occur anywhere in the bladder, especially the bottom, neck, and roof. However, the mass at the bladder outlet and urethra is a rare presentation of PBA. Through this rare case, when clinicians encounter similar patients, they can have richer ideas for diagnosis and treatment, which is helpful for the timely diagnosis and effective treatment. A 62-year-old female was referred to an outpatient urology surgery service due to a 1-year history of narrowing of the urinary route and difficulties in urination. No significant abnormalities were found in other surgical examinations, and the patient denied having a genetic history or similar history in her family. Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic mass of 6.5 cm × 3.8 cm × 4.4 cm at the bladder outlet and urethra. Computed tomography (CT) plain scan and enhancing scan displayed that the wall of bladder was thickened, and soft tissue density was seen at the bladder outlet and urethra with slight enhancement and an unclear partial boundary. The mass was confirmed to be PBA. Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of bladder usually detected in the posterior wall and trigone, but at the bladder outlet and urethra was rare. In this report, Imaging examination showed that the mass was located at the bladder outlet and urethra, and was finally confirmed by surgery. Due to the location of the growth, our patient's only symptoms were dysuria and urinary tract thinning, without hematuria, suprapubic pain, or bladder irritation.

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate preliminary outcomes of MWA + ITC for large NSCLC. From November 2015 to April 2020, a total of 44 NSCLC patients with a mean lesion diameter of 6.1 ± 1.5 cm were enrolled and underwent synchronous MWA + ITC procedures. The primary endpoint was local progression-free survival (LPFS); secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), complications, overall survival (OS), and associated prognostic factors. The median follow-up time was 19.0 months. At the 1-month CT scan, complete tumor ablation was observed in 47.7% of cases. Median LPFS was 12.1 months; 1-, 2-, and 3-year LPFS rates were 51.2%, 27.9%, and 13.6%, respectively. A shorter LPFS was significantly associated with large lesions (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.02-1.49; p = 0.032). Median PFS was 8.1 months; 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS rates were 29.5%, 18.2%, and 9.1%, respectively. LPFS was significantly superior to PFS (p = 0.046). Median OS was 18.8 months. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 65.9%, 43.2%, 26.4%, and 10.0%, respectively. In univariate comparisons, high performance status (PS) score, smoking, and larger lesions were significantly correlated with poor survival. In multivariate analysis, advanced age, higher PS score, higher stage, larger lesion, and prior systematic treatment were independent prognostic factors for shorter OS. Adverse events were well tolerated and all patients recovered after appropriate intervention. MWA + ITC is a safe and effective new modality of local treatment for large NSCLC and can significantly prolong LPFS.","misc","wim"

In this study, we aimed to explore the capability of DLR for the prediction of 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using pretreatment PET/CT images. A total of 257 patients (170/87 patients in internal/external cohorts) with advanced NPC (TNM stage III or IVa) were enrolled. We developed an end-to-end multi-modality DLR model, in which a 3D convolutional neural network was optimized to extract deep features from pretreatment PET/CT images and predict the probability of 5-year PFS. The TNM stage, as a high-level clinical feature, could be integrated into our DLR model to further improve the prognostic performance. For a comparison between conventional radiomics and DLR, 1,456 handcrafted features were extracted, and optimal conventional radiomics methods were selected from 54 cross-combinations of six feature selection methods and nine classification methods. In addition, risk group stratification was performed with clinical signature, conventional radiomics signature, and DLR signature. Our multi-modality DLR model using both PET and CT achieved higher prognostic performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.842 ± 0.034 and 0.823 ± 0.012 for the internal and external cohorts) than the optimal conventional radiomics method (AUC = 0.796 ± 0.033 and 0.782 ± 0.012). Furthermore, the multi-modality DLR model outperformed single-modality DLR models using only PET (AUC = 0.818 ± 0.029 and 0.796 ± 0.009) or only CT (AUC = 0.657 ± 0.055 and 0.645 ± 0.021). For risk group stratification, the conventional radiomics signature and DLR signature enabled significant difference between the high- and low-risk patient groups in both the internal and external cohorts (p < 0.001), while the clinical signature failed in the external cohort (p = 0.177). Our study identified potential prognostic tools for survival prediction in advanced NPC, which suggests that DLR could provide complementary values to the current TNM staging.","misc","wim"

Due to their decreased life expectancy, the number of adult patients is low. However, their bone health is rarely checked in developing countries like India. There is no data available in the literature on the bone mineral density (BMD) of adult (aged ≥18 years) thalassemia major patients in eastern India. In this study, we aimed to measure the BMD and serum calcium and vitamin D levels in adult thalassemia major patients and to compare them with healthy controls. Materials and methods We conducted this cross-sectional observational study at a tertiary care hospital in eastern India. We recruited adult thalassemia major patients who were not on calcium or vitamin D supplements. Their BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) on the lumbar spine (L1-L4). Venous blood was tested for serum calcium and vitamin D levels. We compared the parameters between the cases and controls by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results A total of 31 (male = 19, female = 12) patients with a median age of 28 years comprised the case group. Age- and sex-matched controls showed similar height but higher weight and BMI. The serum calcium level was similar (p = 0.43) in the case and control groups but T-score (p = 0.0003) and vitamin D levels (p: <0.0001) were significantly lower in thalassemia major patients. Conclusion Based on our findings, adult thalassemia major patients have lower BMD and vitamin D levels. Although the serum calcium may be normal in these patients, they should still be screened both for BMD and vitamin D for prompt and early detection of risks and complications so that a proper management strategy can be implemented.","misc","wim"

This study aimed to explore the value of PORT and determine which patients could benefit from PORT. Stage IIIa-N2 NSCLC patients treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) databases from 2004 to 2015. Eligible patients were divided into the following two groups: PORT group and non-PORT group. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, and differences in survival were evaluated with log-rank test. Long-term cause-specific mortality consisted of lung cancer-related mortality and non-lung cancer-related mortality was investigated through competing risk analysis. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify variables that significantly affected OS. We identified 2,347 eligible patients, after propensity score matching (PSM), 877 pairs were selected. Overall, there was no significant difference in OS between two groups, but the patients who received PORT had a lower lung cancer-related mortality rate. Subgroup analysis showed that PORT was associated with a significantly better OS and lower lung cancer-related mortality rate in patients with T2, grade I-II and positive/resected lymph node ratio (LNR) ≥0.31. The non-lung cancer-related mortality of PORT group was higher in the patients with squamous cell carcinoma, although the difference was not significant. The independent prognostic factors for OS were age, sex, grade, histology, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) T stage and LNR. Our results revealed that PORT appears to be the optimal treatment strategy in patients with AJCC T2, grade I-II and LNR ≥0.31.

This novel approach is motivated by several facts. First, the UAVs, acting as relay nodes, represent an easy-to-deploy and adaptive network that can provide line-of-sight between the base stations and the gateways connected to the core network. Second, FSO communications offer high data rates between the UAVs and the network nodes, while avoiding any potential interference with the 5G radio access networks. Third, energy harvesting in the optical domain has the potential to extend the UAVs' battery life. Nevertheless, the presence of atmospheric turbulence, atmospheric attenuation, and pointing errors in the FSO links severely degrades their performance. For this reason an accurate yet tractable modelling framework is required to fully understand whether an UAV-FSO backhaul/fronthaul network with energy harvesting can be applied. To this end, we consider a composite channel attenuation model that includes the effect of turbulence fading, pointing errors, and atmospheric attenuation. Using this model, we derive analytical closed-form expressions of the average harvested energy as a function of the FSO link parameters. These expressions can be used to improve energy harvesting efficiency in FSO link design. We have applied our proposed expressions to evaluate the energy harvested in vertical FSO links for a variety of real scenarios under a modified on-off keying (OOK) scheme optimized for energy harvesting. From the simulations carried out in this paper, we demonstrate that significant values of harvested energy can be obtained. Such performance enhancement can complement the existing deployment charging stations.","misc","wim"

The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and clinical information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD datasets and microarray data from three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were obtained. We identified differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between lung tumor and normal tissues through integrated analysis of the three GEO datasets. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to select survival-associated DEGs and to establish a prognostic gene signature which was associated with overall survival (OS). The expression of gene proteins was assessed in 180 LUAD tissue microarrays (TMAs) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We verified its predictive performance with a Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and validated it in external GEO databases. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify the significant prognostic indicators in LUAD. Furthermore, we established a prognostic nomogram based on TCGA-LUAD dataset. A three-gene signature was constructed to predict the OS of LUAD patients. The KM analysis, ROC curve, and C-index present a good predictive ability of the gene signature in TCGA dataset [P<0.0001; C-index 0.6375; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5632-0.7118; area under the ROC curve (AUC) 0.674] and the external GEO datasets (P=0.05, 0.004, and 0.04, respectively). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses also verified that LUAD patients with low-risk scores had a decreased risk of death compared to those with a high-risk score in TCGA database [hazard ratio (HR) =0.3898; 95% CI: 0.1938-0.7842; P<0.05]. Finally, we constructed a nomogram integrating the gene signature and clinicopathological parameters (P<0.0001; C-index 0.762; 95% CI: 0.714-0.845; AUC 0.8136). Compared with conventional staging, a nomogram can effectively improve prognosis prediction. The nomogram is closely associated to the OS of LUAD patients. This consequence may be beneficial to individualized treatment and clinical decision-making.","misc","wim"

A growing body of evidence suggests that immune cell infiltration and some abnormally expressed genes are associated with ALF development. However, in ALF, they have yet to be thoroughly investigated. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to obtain microarray datasets such as GSE74000, GSE120652, GSE38941, and GSE14668, which were then examined via GEO2R to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with ALF. Metascape was employed to annotate the underlined genes using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. The mechanism of IGF1 in 2 different kinds of ALF including acetaminophen-induced ALF and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced ALF was studied using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Next, immune cell infiltration was investigated and differentiated in ALF using CIBERSORT. Six genes (HAO2, IGF1, PLA2G7, SC5D, GNE, SLC1A1) were found to be abnormally expressed in the 2 distinct types of ALF i.e., acetaminophen-induced ALF and HBV-induced ALF. IGF1 was identified as a hub gene in ALF and was found to be associated with several developmental cascades including immune responses, inflammatory responses, and intracellular calcium homeostasis. Additionally, the number of CD4 naive T cells, CD8 T cells, and follicular helper T cells was increased in acetaminophen-induced ALF, whereas the number of activated NK cells, resting NK cells, and plasma cells was increased in HBV-induced ALF. The present study determined a potential molecular target, namely IGF1, in acetaminophen-induced ALF and HBV-induced ALF, which may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology and management of ALF.

We quantified 39 plasma inflammatory mediators using multiplex ELISA. Spearman rank correlation and Mann-Whitney U test were used to identify mechanistically coupled inflammatory mediators and compare disease severity. Compared to healthy controls, patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of interleukins 1α, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 15, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1), IFN-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10, CXCL10), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1α, CCL3), eotaxin-3 (CCL26), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), placental growth factor (PlGF), and fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1). Patients with severe COVID-19 had higher IL-10 and lower macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC, CCL22) compared to the mild or moderate group (P<0.05). In the receiver operating characteristic curve, SAA, IL-6 and CRP showed strong sensitivity and specificity in predicting the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Greater age and higher CRP had a significant association with disease severity (P<0.05). Our findings reveal that CRP, SAA, VCAM-1, CXCL10, CCL22 and IL-10 levels are promising biomarkers for COVID-19 disease severity, suggesting that plasma inflammatory mediators could be used as warning indicators of COVID-19 severity, aid in COVID-19 prognosis and treatment.","misc","wim"

Vestibular migraine patients (n = 20, mean age 45.4 years) who were resistant to conventional prophylactic therapies had BTX-A injection and rs-fMRI before and 2 months after the injection. We also measured the changes in the frequency of vertigo and migraine attacks, symptomatic functional disability scores, and neuropsychiatric inventories. After BTX-A injection, the mean monthly frequencies of migraine and vertigo episodes decreased significantly compared with the baseline (p < 0.01, paired t-test). The Headache Impact Test-6 score and the Migraine Disability Assessment, and the vertigo parameters, measured by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and the Vertigo Symptom Scale, showed an improvement, as did the anxiety and depression scores 2 months after BTX-A treatment. The low-frequency fluctuation analysis of the rs-fMRI data found significant changes in the functional connectivity of the right superior temporal gyrus. Adoption of this cluster as the seed region increased the functional connectivity with the left post-central gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus after BTX-A treatment. This prospective study suggests that BTX-A treatment is effective at ameliorating migraine and vertigo symptoms in VM patients who were resistant to conventional therapies. Along with symptomatic improvements, changes in the functional connectivity within the multisensory vestibular and pain networks suggest a dysmodulation of multimodal sensory integration and abnormal cortical processing of the vestibular and pain signals in VM patients.","misc","wim"

Combining internal and external positive resources can effectively prevent and alleviate depression. This study explores the moderating role of psychological capital (PsyCap) in the relationship between interpersonal sensitivity and depression, as well as the moderating effect of familial support on the conditional influence of PsyCap among Chinese college freshmen. A cross-sectional mental health survey was performed and the anonymous self-reported questionnaires, including the Patient Health Questionnaire, interpersonal sensitivity subscale of Symptom Checklist-90, Psychological Capital Questionnaire 24, and Perceived Social Support from Family, were distributed to the freshmen. Pearson's coefficient was employed to describe correlations between variables. The PROCESS macro and slope difference tests were used to explore the moderating role of PsyCap and family support in the relationship between interpersonal sensitivity and depression. The prevalence of depression among freshmen was 30.89% (694/2,247). The correlation analysis revealed that depression negatively related to PsyCap (r = -0.187, p < 0.001) and family support (r = -0.193, p < 0.001) and positively related to interpersonal sensitivity (r = 0.399, p < 0.001). The moderation analysis showed that PsyCap negatively moderated the positive relationship between interpersonal sensitivity and depression (β = -0.159, p < 0.001). We also found that family support played a moderating role in the conditional influence of PsyCap (β = 0.076, p < 0.01). The slope difference test further showed that family support weakened the effect of interpersonal sensitivity on depression in freshmen when they had low PsyCap. More attention should be paid to freshmen's mental health and interpersonal interaction problems. For freshmen with interpersonal sensitivity and depression, mental health departments can conduct PsyCap development interventions to alleviate psychological symptoms. Freshmen themselves should also seek family support in time, but those individuals with high PsyCap should seek an appropriate level of family support to maintain their autonomy.","misc","wim"

SCGs contain high levels of phenolics and other bioactive compounds that make them a potential source of reducing and stabilizing agents for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles. This study investigates the use of SCG extracts as a green strategy to produce silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). SCG extracts were obtained using aqueous ethanol as the solvent and then contacted with a silver nitrate solution under the selected conditions. A central composite design coupled with response surface methodology was used to evaluate the effects of solvent composition (C = 30-70% v/v), silver-to-phenolic ratio (R = 3-7 mol/mol), temperature (T = 25-55 °C) and pH (10-12) on the production of AgNPs. Characterization of AgNPs by DLS, TEM and XRD techniques showed that they were highly crystalline with a narrow size distribution. Under optimal reaction conditions, AgNPs with an average size of about 10 nm and a zeta potential of -30.5 to -20.7 mV were obtained. Overall, the results of this study indicate that SCGs are a promising material for the green synthesis of small-sized and stable AgNPs.","misc","wim"

In this study, a representative sample of plastic- and rubber-containing artificial turf (AT) fields from Stockholm, Sweden, was subjected to total fluorine (TF), extractable organic fluorine (EOF), and target PFAS analysis. TF was observed in all 51 AT samples (ranges of 16-313, 12-310, and 24-661 μg of F/g in backing, filling, and blades, respectively), while EOF and target PFAS occurred in <42% of all samples (<200 and <1 ng of F/g, respectively). A subset of samples extracted with water confirmed the absence of fluoride. Moreover, application of the total oxidizable precursor assay revealed negligible perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) formation across all three sample types, indicating that the fluorinated substances in AT are not low-molecular weight PFAA precursors. Collectively, these results point toward polymeric organofluorine (e.g., fluoroelastomer, polytetrafluoroethylene, and polyvinylidene fluoride), consistent with patent literature. The combination of poor extractability and recalcitrance toward advanced oxidation suggests that the fluorine in AT does not pose an imminent risk to users. However, concerns surrounding the production and end of life of AT, as well as the contribution of filling and blades to environmental microplastic contamination, remain.","misc","wim"

We also investigated chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) to evaluate the quality of life (QOL). Sixty-five patients with advanced NSCLC from 14 participating institutions who had previously undergone one or two cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens were enrolled in this study. The patients received 100 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall objective response rate. CIPN symptoms were prospectively assessed using the Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ) and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The overall response rate (ORR) was 18.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 10.9-29.6%], and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.4 (95% CI: 2.5-4.3) months. Median overall survival (OS) was 8.6 (95% CI: 7.1-10.2) months. The most common non-hematologic grade ≥3 adverse events were infection (7.7%) and hyponatremia (4.6%). Neutropenia was the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event (30.8%), and febrile neutropenia developed in 6.2% patients. The PNQ and CTCAE scores for motor peripheral neuropathy were low (kappa =0.10). The primary endpoint was achieved.

"1915",35966013,"Upregulation of Netrin-1 in the hippocampus mediates the formation of visceral hypersensitivity induced by maternal separation.","Early adverse life events (EALs), such as maternal separation (MS), can cause visceral hypersensitivity, which is thought to be a key pathophysiological mechanism of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Previous studies mainly focused on EALs-induced visceral hypersensitivity in adulthood but did not consider that it may have occurred in the preadult period. We previously found that rats who experienced MS suffered from visceral hypersensitivity starting from the post-weaning period. Moreover, the hippocampus is considered to be critical in regulating the formation of visceral hypersensitivity induced by MS. But the underlying mechanisms throughout different life periods are unclear. In this study, behavioral tests, RNA-seq, lentiviral interference, and molecular biology techniques were applied to investigate the molecular mechanism in the hippocampus underlying MS-induced long-lasting visceral hypersensitivity. It was found that both visceral sensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors were significantly increased in MS rats in post-weaning, prepubertal, and adult periods, especially in the prepubertal period. Subsequently, RNA-seq targeting the hippocampus identified that the expression level of Netrin-1 was significantly increased in all periods, which was further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Knocking-down hippocampal Netrin-1 in the post-weaning period by lentivirus interference alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors of MS rats in the later phase of life. In addition, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), instead of neogenin-1(Neo-1) or uncoordinated (UNC5), was proved to be the specific functional receptor of Netrin-1 in regulating visceral hypersensitivity, whose upregulation may result in the most severe symptoms in the prepubertal period. Furthermore, the activation of the Netrin-1/DCC pathway could enhance long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, probably via recruitment of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, which finally resulted in the formation of visceral hypersensitivity. These novel findings suggest that long-lasting over-expression of Netrin-1 can mediate visceral hypersensitivity and anxiety disorder from the post-weaning period to adulthood by activating DCC/GluA1 pathway in the hippocampus. Moreover, early intervention of Netrin-1 in the post-weaning period could lead to significant symptom relief afterward, which provides evidence that the Netrin-1/DCC/GluA1 signaling pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of visceral hypersensitivity in clinics.","misc","wim"
"942",35958530,"Aortic root replacement in bicuspid versus tricuspid aortic valve patients.","Concomitant replacement of the aortic root and aortic valve is a widely used treatment strategy in elective patients with aortic valve stenosis and root aneurysm. It is also a strategy frequently employed in patients with acute aortic dissection type A (AADA), involving the aortic root. Although more patients have undergone valve sparing procedures over the past decades, the classic 'modified Bentall technique' remains a valid option, particularly for patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). We aimed to compare the results of elective and emergency modified Bentall procedures in patients with bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs). We retrospectively reviewed our database for patients undergoing either elective or emergency modified Bentall procedures between 2000 and 2018 and identified 827 elective cases (44% BAV) and 258 emergency cases (15% BAV). Analysis of intra- and postoperative outcomes and early mortality was performed. Due to inequality of the groups, a matching analysis was performed. We found BAV patients to be significantly younger (elective: 58±18 vs. 65±14, P<0.001; emergency: 49±17 vs. 62±19, P<0.001) and healthier at time of surgery. In the AADA cohort, malperfusion rate was not different between bicuspid and tricuspid patients, however bicuspid AADA patients presented more often with an entry in the aortic root. After matching, procedure times and early outcomes did not differ between the groups, except for significantly higher rates of respiratory failure in elective TAV patients (10% vs. 5%, P=0.033). The 30-day mortality was 2% in elective cases and 22% in emergency AADA surgery. A subgroup analysis of elective patients with aortic diameter <55 mm also showed excellent outcomes. After adjustment for preoperative inequalities, no differences in early mortality and outcomes were found between bicuspid and tricuspid patients receiving elective or emergency modified Bentall surgery.","misc","wim"

Memories that integrate negative interpretations (interpretation-memory) may also contribute to worry, but this remains unexplored. We aimed to investigate how these cognitive processes are associated with worry and anxiety cross-sectionally (Phase 1), and then explore which cognitive processes from Phase 1 would predict worry and anxiety during times of high stress, namely prior to examinations (Phase 2), and after the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (Phase 3). Worry, anxiety, and cognitive processes were assessed in an undergraduate sample (N = 64). We found that whilst greater benign interpretation bias and benign interpretation-memory bias were associated with lower levels of concurrent worry and anxiety, only interpretation bias explained unique variance in worry and anxiety. No cognitive predictor significantly explained unique variance in prospective worry and anxiety prior to examinations. In relation to anxiety and worry during the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, both benign attention bias and benign interpretation-memory bias predicted decreased worry; only benign attention bias predicted decreased anxiety. Findings suggest that cognitive processes can predict changes in worry and anxiety during future stressful contexts.","misc","wim"

The receiver MMIC consists of a low-noise amplifier, double-balanced image-reject mixer, frequency quadrupler, and analog phase shifter. In order to integrate these devices into a compact single chip without affecting the core performance, coupling problems need to be solved. We analyze the influence of coupling effects on the image rejection ratio, and propose corresponding solutions for three different coupling paths. (1) The coupling in the LO-RF path of the mixer is solved by designing a double-balanced mixer with high isolation characteristics. (2) The coupling between the LO chain and the LNA from space and dielectric is suppressed by optimizing the two main transmission lines spacing and adding isolation vias. (3) The coupling caused by the line crossing is restrained by designing a differential line crossover structure. The design and implementation of the MMIC are based on 0.15 µm GaAs pHEMT process. The receiver chip has 6.1~8.7 dB conversion gain in 32~36 GHz, less than 3.5 dB of noise figure, and more than 35 dB of image rejection ratio. The measurement results show that the receiver MMIC is especially suitable for high-sensitivity passive millimeter-wave imaging systems.","misc","wim"

A total of 98 first anterior wall STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention [85 men (86.7%), mean age: 58 ± 12 years] were enrolled. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed 24-72 h after angioplasty and during 3-month follow-up. MW was estimated from the left ventricular pressure-strain loop derived from speckle tracking echocardiography and simultaneous noninvasive brachial artery cuff pressure. The primary endpoint was early LV remodeling, defined as an increase in LV end-diastolic volume ≥20% compared with baseline at 3 months after STEMI. Major adverse cardiac events and combined clinical outcomes were recorded. LV remodeling was present in 32 patients (33%), who exhibited lower global and culprit-regional work index (WI), constructive work (CW), work efficiency (WE), and specifically, greater differences of WE (delta-WE) and CW (delta-CW) between the culprit and non-culprit region than those without LV remodeling both at the acute phase and follow-up (all P < 0.0125). During follow-up, all global and regional WI, CW, and WE were improved (P < 0.0125 compared with baseline), with less improvement in patients with LV remodeling. In multivariate analysis, baseline delta-WE (odds ratio: 2.304; 95% CI: 1.093-4.856, P = 0.028) and peak troponin I level (odds ratio: 1.035; 95%CI: 1.008-1.063, P = 0.010) were independently associated with early LV remodeling. Patients with greater delta-WE at baseline were associated with a higher incidence of heart failure and combined clinical outcomes during follow-up. After reperfused acute anterior STEMI, patients with LV remodeling presented with more inhomogeneous MW distribution. The absolute difference of WE between culprit and non-culprit territory at the acute phase is an independent predictor for early LV remodeling. www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT05107102.","misc","wim"

In this retrospective study, we studied hospitalized COVID-19 patients with data on chest CT scans performed during hospital stay (February 2020-April 2021) in a training dataset (TD) (n = 2,251) and an external validation dataset (eVD) (n = 993). We used the most relevant demographical, clinical, and laboratory variables (n = 25) as potential predictors of COVID-19-related outcomes. The primary and secondary endpoints were the severity of lung involvement quantified as mild (≤25%), moderate (26-50%), severe (>50%), and in-hospital death, respectively. We applied random forest (RF) classifier, a machine learning technique, and multivariable logistic regression analysis to study our objectives. In the TD and the eVD, respectively, the mean [standard deviation (SD)] age was 57.9 (18.0) and 52.4 (17.6) years; patients with severe lung involvement [n (%):185 (8.2) and 116 (11.7)] were significantly older [mean (SD) age: 64.2 (16.9), and 56.2 (18.9)] than the other two groups (mild and moderate). The mortality rate was higher in patients with severe (64.9 and 38.8%) compared to moderate (5.5 and 12.4%) and mild (2.3 and 7.1%) lung involvement. The RF analysis showed age, C reactive protein (CRP) levels, and duration of hospitalizations as the three most important predictors of lung involvement severity at the time of the first CT examination. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed a significant strong association between the extent of the severity of lung involvement (continuous variable) and death; adjusted odds ratio (OR): 9.3; 95% CI: 7.1-12.1 in the TD and 2.6 (1.8-3.5) in the eVD. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the severity of lung involvement is a strong predictor of death. Age, CRP levels, and duration of hospitalizations are the most important predictors of severe lung involvement. A simple prediction model based on available clinical and imaging data provides a validated tool that predicts the severity of lung involvement and death probability among hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","misc","wim"

Loss of the RAS GTPase-activating protein NF1 and subsequent overactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK) signaling exist nearly uniformly in MPNST, making MAPK inhibition a promising therapeutic intervention. However, the efficacy of MEK inhibitor (MEKi) monotherapy was limited in MPNST and the relative mechanisms remained largely unexplored. In this study, we generated three MEKi-resistant cell models and investigated the mechanisms of MEKi resistance using high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing. We discovered that cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by MEKi were rescued in MEKi-resistant cells and the upregulation of LAMA4/ITGB1/FAK/SRC signaling conferred resistance to MEKi. In addition, concurrent inhibition of MAPK signaling and FAK/SRC cascade could sensitize MPNST cells to MEKi.

In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to compare epiphytic bacterial community structures on the intertidal macroalgae Sargassum thunbergii and their receptacles between male and female samples. The epiphytic bacteria on the male and female algal bodies and receptacles had similar community structures with a large number of shared bacteria, but the samples clearly clustered separately, and the abundances of dominant taxa, specific bacteria, and indicator species differed, indicating that epiphytic bacterial communities differed significantly between the male and female S. thunbergii and their receptacles. In addition, the abundance of many predicted functional genes was significantly different between epiphytic bacteria on male and female algal bodies and receptacles, especially metabolism-related genes, and the abundances of predicted functional genes of epiphytic bacteria were significantly higher on both types of male samples than on female samples. Our study confirmed that the sex of the host algae influenced the epiphytic bacterial community structures on algae and algal reproductive tissues, and this role was mainly related to the host metabolism. The results reveal the role of host plant sex in the formation of epiphytic bacterial communities.

However, the mechanism of the Warburg effect is still largely unknown. This research aimed to reveal the effects of BarH-like homeobox 2 (BARX2) in regulating tumor progression and glucose metabolism in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Expression of BARX2 was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in LUAD cell line and tissues, and the tumor-promoting function of BARX2 in LUAD cells was detected in vitro and in vivo xenograft models. The metabolic effects of BARX2 were examined by detecting glucose uptake, the production levels of lactate and pyruvate, and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and luciferase reporter gene assay were used to identify the underlying molecular mechanism of BARX2 regulation of HK2. Further studies showed that transcription factor FOXA1 directly interacts with BARX2 and promotes the transcriptional activity of BARX2. BARX2 was remarkably up-regulated in LUAD tissues and positively linked to advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis. In vitro and in vivo data indicated ectopic expression of BARX2 enhanced cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, whereas BARX2 knockdown suppressed these effects. Metabolic-related experiments showed BARX2 promoted the reprogramming of glucose metabolism. Mechanistically, the BARX2/FOXA1/HK2 axis promoted LUAD progression and energy metabolism reprogramming. In summary, our research first defined BARX2 as a tumor-promoting factor in LUAD and that it may act as a novel prognostic biomarker and new therapeutic target for the disease.","misc","wim"
"1992",35957285,"Strategies for the Accurate Measurement of the Resonance Frequency in QCM-D Systems via Low-Cost Digital Techniques.","In this paper, an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)-based digital architecture for the measurement of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) oscillating frequency of transient responses, i.e., in QCM-D (QCM and Dissipation) applications, is presented. The measurement system is conceived for operations in liquid, with short QCM transient responses due to the large mechanical load. The proposed solution allows for avoiding the complex processing systems typically required by the QCM-D techniques and grants frequency resolutions better than 1 ppm. The core of the architecture is a reciprocal digital frequency meter, combined with the preprocessing of the QCM signal through mixing operations, such as a step-down of the input frequency and reducing the measurement error. The measurement error is further reduced through averaging. Different strategies are proposed to implement the proposed measurement solution, comprising an all-digital circuit and mixed analog/digital ones. The performance of the proposed architectures is theoretically derived, compared, and analyzed by means of experimental data obtained considering 10 MHz QCMs and 200 μs long transient responses. A frequency resolution of about 240 ppb, which corresponds to a Sauerbrey mass resolution of 8 ng/cm2, is obtained for the all-digital solution, whereas for the mixed solution the resolution halves to 120 ppb, with a measurement time of about one second over 100 repetitions.","misc","wim"
"1138",35965572,"Epigenome-wide gene-age interaction study reveals reversed effects of MORN1 DNA methylation on survival between young and elderly oral squamous cell carcinoma patients.","DNA methylation serves as a reversible and prognostic biomarker for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. It is unclear whether the effect of DNA methylation on OSCC overall survival varies with age. As a result, we performed a two-phase gene-age interaction study of OSCC prognosis on an epigenome-wide scale using the Cox proportional hazards model. We identified one CpG probe, cg11676291 MORN1 , whose effect was significantly modified by age (HRdiscovery = 1.018, p = 4.07 × 10-07, FDR-q = 3.67 × 10-02; HRvalidation = 1.058, p = 8.09 × 10-03; HR combined = 1.019, p = 7.36 × 10-10). Moreover, there was an antagonistic interaction between hypomethylation of cg11676291 MORN1 and age (HRinteraction = 0.284; 95% CI, 0.135-0.597; p = 9.04 × 10-04). The prognosis of OSCC patients was well discriminated by the prognostic score incorporating cg11676291 MORN1 -age interaction (HR high vs. low = 3.66, 95% CI: 2.40-5.60, p = 1.93 × 10-09). By adding 24 significant gene-age interactions using a looser criterion, we significantly improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the model at 3- and 5-year prognostic prediction (AUC3-year = 0.80, AUC5-year = 0.79, C-index = 0.75). Our study identified a significant interaction between cg11676291 MORN1 and age on OSCC survival, providing a potential therapeutic target for OSCC patients.","misc","wim"
"62",35958578,"Defining Patient-Level Molecular Heterogeneity in Psoriasis Vulgaris Based on Single-Cell Transcriptomics.","Identifying genetic variation underlying human diseases establishes targets for therapeutic development and helps tailor treatments to individual patients. Large-scale transcriptomic profiling has extended the study of such molecular heterogeneity between patients to somatic tissues. However, the lower resolution of bulk RNA profiling, especially in a complex, composite tissue such as the skin, has limited its success. Here we demonstrate approaches to interrogate patient-level molecular variance in a chronic skin inflammatory disease, psoriasis vulgaris, leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing of CD45+ cells isolated from active lesions. Highly psoriasis-specific transcriptional abnormalities display greater than average inter-individual variance, nominating them as potential sources of clinical heterogeneity. We find that one of these chemokines, CXCL13, demonstrates significant correlation with severity of lesions within our patient series. Our analyses also establish that genes elevated in psoriatic skin-resident memory T cells are enriched for programs orchestrating chromatin and CDC42-dependent cytoskeleton remodeling, specific components of which are distinctly correlated with and against Th17 identity on a single-cell level. Collectively, these analyses describe systematic means to dissect cell type- and patient-level differences in cutaneous psoriasis using high-resolution transcriptional profiles of human inflammatory disease.","misc","wim"

The practical use of SC devices is hindered by their low energy density and poor rate capability due to the binding agents in fabricating electrodes. Herein, we proposed flower-like highly open-structured binder-free ZnCo2O4 micro-flowers composed of nanosheets supported in nickel foam (ZnCoO@NF) with improved rate capability up to 91.8% when current varied from 2 to 20 A·g-1. The ZnCoO@NF electrode exhibited a superior specific capacitance of 1132 F·g-1 at 2 A·g-1 and revealed 99% cycling stability after 7000 cycles at a high current density of 20 A·g-1. The improved performance of the ZnCoO@NF electrode is attributed to the highly stable structure of the micro/nano-multiscale architecture, which provides both the high conduction of electrons and fast ionic transportation paths simultaneously.","misc","wim"
"1894",35965893,"Artificial Intelligence-Aided Mapping of the Structure-Composition-Conductivity Relationships of Glass-Ceramic Lithium Thiophosphate Electrolytes.","Lithium thiophosphates (LPSs) with the composition (Li2S) x (P2S5)1-x are among the most promising prospective electrolyte materials for solid-state batteries (SSBs), owing to their superionic conductivity at room temperature (>10-3 S cm-1), soft mechanical properties, and low grain boundary resistance. Several glass-ceramic (gc) LPSs with different compositions and good Li conductivity have been previously reported, but the relationship among composition, atomic structure, stability, and Li conductivity remains unclear due to the challenges in characterizing noncrystalline phases in experiments or simulations. Here, we mapped the LPS phase diagram by combining first-principles and artificial intelligence (AI) methods, integrating density functional theory, artificial neural network potentials, genetic-algorithm sampling, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. By means of an unsupervised structure-similarity analysis, the glassy/ceramic phases were correlated with the local structural motifs in the known LPS crystal structures, showing that the energetically most favorable Li environment varies with the composition. Based on the discovered trends in the LPS phase diagram, we propose a candidate solid-state electrolyte composition, (Li2S) x (P2S5)1-x (x ∼ 0.725), that exhibits high ionic conductivity (>10-2 S cm-1) in our simulations, thereby demonstrating a general design strategy for amorphous or glassy/ceramic solid electrolytes with enhanced conductivity and stability.","misc","wim"

At present, there is no clear standard for simultaneous cervical lymph node dissection at home and abroad. We summarize the pattern of regional recurrence in glottic cancer after initial TLM and to evaluate the risk factors for neck metastasis. Seventy-five cases with recurrent glottic cancer after TLM between December 2004 and June 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Survival, regional control rate, and neck metastasis were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Univariate analysis was performed with the log-rank test and multivariate analysis was completed using Cox regression. The 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and regional control rate after the first TLM were 73.6%, 89.1%, and 69.7%, respectively. A total of 22 (29.3%) patients developed cervical metastases during long-term follow-up and showed a significant decline in OS and DSS rates. Multivariate analysis indicated that histological grading and type of TLM were both risk factors for neck metastasis. Patients treated with type Vc cordectomy were more likely to develop regional recurrence than patients treated with type III cordectomy [hazard ratio (HR) =14.737, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.117-102.610, P=0.007]. No significant correlation was present between rT stage and neck metastasis. Multivariate analysis indicated that histological grading and type of TLM were both risk factors for neck metastasis. Patients with recurrence after type V cordectomy may have an increased risk of developing cervical lymph node metastasis, especially those with supraglottic spread or high-grade tumors.","misc","wim"

The food allergy prevalence in other parts of the world such as Asia is, however, less well documented. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of cow's milk, egg, and peanut allergies in a general population of Singaporean children below 30 months of age. A total of 4,115 children from the general population who attended well-baby visits between 2011 and 2015 completed standardized questionnaires to elicit a convincing history of food allergy to estimate the population prevalence of food allergies. The prevalence of a convincing history of cow's milk allergy was 0.51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-0.7), hen's egg allergy 1.43% (95% CI, 1.1-1.8), and peanut allergy 0.27% (95% CI, 0.12-0.42). Of the 15 of 59 children with a convincing history of hen's egg allergy who consented, 12 (80%) had corroborative positive skin prick tests. The prevalence of food allergy, in particular peanut allergy, in children below 2 years of age is lower in this South East Asian population than reported in Western cohorts. Further research should focus on deciphering differential risk factors for food allergy across different geographical locations.","misc","wim"
"394",35964309,"Evaluation of a brief universal suicide prevention programme in young people: a cluster-controlled trial in Swiss schools.","Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in young people. Therefore, suicide prevention in this age group is a public health priority. There is increasing evidence of the efficacy of suicide prevention programmes, but robust empirical studies are still needed. More precisely, data are needed for school-aged children, brief interventions and distal outcomes such as psychological distress or suicidal thoughts. In addition, to our knowledge, no study has yet scientifically evaluated a brief universal suicide prevention programme in Switzerland. This study investigated the efficacy and acceptability of a brief universal suicide prevention programme for school-aged youths. Primary outcomes included knowledge on suicide, perceived suicide awareness and knowledge of help-seeking resources. Secondary outcomes included acceptability coping skills, suicide-related behaviours and psychological distress. This non-randomised cluster-controlled trial was conducted in Swiss schools. A 90-minute workshop for universal suicide prevention was delivered to the intervention group (n = 209), and the control group had no intervention (n = 96). Measures were assessed at baseline and after one month. Acceptability was assessed at follow-up in the intervention group only. Data were analysed using three-level mixed effect models with an interaction term between group and time. There were interaction effects between group and time for most outcomes: perceived suicide awareness (p <0.010), knowledge of help-seeking resources (p <0.001), coping planning (p = 0.039), suicidal ideation (p = 0.019) and psychological distress (p = 0.012). There were no interaction effects on suicide-related knowledge (p = 0.312) and coping for social support (p >0.388). Participants found the workshop enjoyable, not upsetting, and worthwhile. This study suggested that a brief suicide prevention programme could be beneficial and safe for school-aged youths. This brief programme may contribute to suicide prevention efforts.","misc","wim"
"894",35964456,"Therapeutic role of Glycyrrhiza Uralensis fisher on benign prostatic hyperplasia through 5 alpha reductase regulation and apoptosis.","Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is an age-related disease in adult men. There are two pharmacological treatments for BPH. However, these synthetic materials have various risks, many studies are being conducted to develop new drugs from natural sources. In this study, we proposed a beneficial effect of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fischer on the development and progression of BPH, focusing on the androgen receptor (AR) and 5α-reductase 2 (5AR2) signaling axis. To explain the therapeutic efficacy of a water extract of G. uralensis (GUWE) for BPH, we used testosterone propionate (TP)-induced BPH rat models and TP-treated RWPE-1 human prostate epithelial cells. In the TP-induced BPH rat models, GUWE reduced the enlarged prostate weight, prostate index, prostate epithelial thickness, and serum DHT levels. In addition, the protein levels of AR and 5AR2 in prostate tissues were significantly decreased by GUWE treatment. Furthermore, GUWE induced apoptosis signaling through an increase of Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), caspase 3, and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and a decrease of B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) in prostate tissues of TP-induced BPH rats. These findings were also confirmed in TP-treated RWPE-1 cells. Fi treatment markedly decreased the sperm count in the epididymis of BPH rats, but GUWE treatment did not affect the sperm count, suggesting less toxicity. These findings suggested that GUWE reduces the development of BPH by inhibiting AR-5AR2 and activating the apoptosis signaling pathway. Furthermore, unlike finasteride, GUWE did not affect sperm count. Therefore, we suggest that GUWE has a potential as a safer alternative option for BPH treatment.","misc","wim"
