3,30680081,Comparing the conventional 15 cm and the C-length approaches for central venous catheter placement.,"Introduction: The present guidelines recommend placing the catheter tip in the superior vena cava (SVC) above the pericardial cephalic reflection. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of two different approaches in locating the tip of the Central venous catheter (CVC) at the suggested vascular zone. Methods: This was an interventional study on two hundred patients undergoing Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) operation who required a central venous cannulation. They were randomly assigned into two groups. In the first group catheter placement was applied through using the conventional 15 cm method. In the second group a C-length method was applied for measuring the depth of catheter tip placement from the preoperative chest radiographs. For statistical analysis Chi-square test and T-test were used. Results: In the first group (15 cm) 100% of the patients had their catheters placed below the C-line (Carina line) and the average distance between the catheter tip and the C-line was +4.22±2.10 cm. In the second (C-Length) group 52% of the catheters were below C-line with an average distance of +0.77±0.5 cm. There was a meaningful difference between the two groups in respect to the catheter location depth and zone of placement (P<0.001). Conclusion: The C-Length approach in comparison to the conventional 15 cm approach resulted in a considerable higher number of catheters above the recommended C-line, thus it can provide a more reliable and safe mode for CVC placement in the SVC.",1,0,1,1
9,30778331,Polychromatic Light Exposure as a Therapeutic in the Treatment and Management of Parkinson's Disease: A Controlled Exploratory Trial.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disorder characterized by loss of dopamine (DA) in the nigro-striatal dopamine (NSD) system with the primary symptoms of bradykinaesia, rigidity, tremor, and altered gate. Secondary symptoms including depression, insomnia, involuntary movement, and psychiatric side effects are also commonly observed. While the treatment focus for the past 50 years has been aimed at replacing deficient DA, to relieve the primary symptoms, more recent studies have suggested that the circadian system plays a critical role in the etiology and treatment of this disorder. Several case studies and open label trials have implemented bright light therapy (BT) in an attempt to repair sleep, depression and even the primary motor symptoms of this disorder, however controlled studies are yet to be fully implemented. In this controlled trial, patients that had been maintained on BT daily for 4 months to 5 years previously were assigned to one of three groups: continued polychromatic light, continued with red light or discontinued polychromatic light for a 2 week period. The Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDSUPDRS), The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), The Beck Depression Inventory II, The Beck Anxiety Inventory, The Epworth Sleep Scale (ESS) and a global rating scale were used to assess patients prior to and at 1 and 2 weeks after commencing the trial. Patients continuing polychromatic BT showed significant improvement on the MDSUPDRS Rating Scale (12 points; p = 0.028), the PDQ-39 (10 points; p = 0.011), ESS (4 points; p = 0.013), and numerous motor and secondary symptoms on a global rating scale. Performance on standardized motor tests also incrementally improved in this group while those exposed to red light and those that discontinued BT treatment deteriorated. These results demonstrate that strategically applied polychromatic light was beneficial in reducing many primary motor and secondary symptoms of PD. Further work investigating the role of light in mitigating PD symptoms and involvement of the circadian system will provide further advances in the treatment of PD.

5,30714388,Promoting resilience through neurocognitive functioning in youth living with HIV.,"Using a phased model of intervention development, we developed an intervention to promote resilience in youth living with HIV via improved neurocognitive resources. First, youth completed a naturalistic prospective memory (PM) task and were randomized into a visualization condition or control condition. Next, 47 of these participants completed another naturalistic PM task and were randomized into Calendaring condition, an Alarm condition, a Combined condition, or a Control condition. Youth with low PM demonstrated observable gains from the visualization technique. Youth in the Combined Calendaring and Alarm condition demonstrated significantly better performance than participants in the Control and Calendaring conditions. In a Proof-of-Concept study with 16 youth, the previous findings were translated into a single session in-person intervention followed by tailored text messaging to improve adherence and viral load via improved neurocognitive resources. The resulting intervention showed a signal of effect with viral load reductions in youth with available data. Targeting compensatory strategies to enhance neurocognitive functioning may promote resilience and health outcomes. A randomized pilot study with a control condition is the next step.",1,0,1,3
2,30680076,Influence of arm position during infraclavicular subclavian vein catheterization in coronary artery bypass graft surgery.,"Introduction: Percutaneous subclavian vein catheterization via infraclavicular approach is one of the most widely used cannulation techniques for inserting catheters into a central vein. The aim of this study was to evaluate influence of arm position during infraclavicular subclavian vein catheterization with landmark-based technique in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Methods: Between September 2017 and June 2018, this prospective randomized clinical trial was performed in 320 patients. The patients were randomly assigned to the Neutral group (the arms kept by the side) or Abduction group (the arm was abducted to 90°). The success and complication rates were compared in the two groups. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. Results: In the first attempt of subclavian vein cannulation, the success rate had no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.185). In the second attempt of catheterization, the success rate in Abduction group (40.5%) was lower than Neutral group (81.2%). The overall success rate in two attempts were (84.4%) in the Abduction group and (96.2%) in the Neutral group. There was a significant difference between two groups in the second and overall success rates (P = 0.0001). In 34 (10.6%) patients, subclavian artery puncture occurred, 30 (18.8%) in the Abduction group and 4 (2.5%) in the Neutral group. There was a significant difference between two groups (P = 0.0001). Pneumothorax was occurred in 15 (9.4%) in the Abduction group and 3 (1.9%) in the Neutral group. There was also a significant difference between two groups (P = 0.004). The differences in other complications on two groups were statistically insignificant. Conclusion: Compared with Abduction group, the Neutral group resulted in higher success rate and fewer subclavian artery puncture and pneumothorax. The incidences of other complications were similar on both groups.",1,0,1,4
4,30693040,The effects of conventional drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis on the serum lipids.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic autoimmune disorder that leads to damage of human joints. There are various treatment approaches in which different drugs are prescribed which have several alterations in serum lipids. This research aimed to study the effect of RA treatments on the serum lipids. Two hundred randomly selected patients with RA were randomly assigned to three different groups. The first group of patients was treated with a combination of prednisolone (PRD) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The second group was treated with three drugs including PRD, HCQ, and methotrexate (MTX). The third group was treated with four medications including PRD, HCQ, MTX, and sulfasalazine. Within each group, the lipid factors such as triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and visual analog scale were measured at the beginning of the experiment and 6 months after exposing the treatments. For each group, we also calculated the Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS-28). The analysis of variance revealed that the overall DAS-28 was significantly different among the three groups. In the first group, the level of TG and TC significantly decreased (P = 0.015 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively). In the second group, the level of TG and LDL significantly decreased (P = 0.009). In the third group, the LDL level increased considerably (P < 0.001). The HDL level significantly increased in all three groups (P = 0.012, P = 0.014, and P = 0.028, respectively). The treatment PRD + HCQ + MTX was more effective in reducing the LDL level and increasing the HDL level. To reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients with RA, it is important to prescribe the combination of drugs which leads and normalizes the lipid profile levels.",1,0,1,5
6,30714984,Corticosteroids versus vestibular rehabilitation in long-term outcomes in vestibular neuritis.,"The management strategy for functional recovery after vestibular neuritis (VN) has not yet been established. Therapeutic choices involve corticosteroids, vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) and the combination of corticosteroids with VRT. The present study aimed to compare the efficacy of corticosteroids, vestibular rehabilitation, and combination of them in terms of subjective and objective improvement in patients with VN. A prospective randomized study was conducted on 60 patients with acute vestibular neuritis within 3 days after symptom onset. The patients were divided into three groups; steroid group treated with corticosteroids (n = 20), VRT group (n = 20) managed with vestibular rehabilitation exercises and combination group (n = 20) received combined (corticosteroids and vestibular exercises). Groups were compared by caloric lateralization, vestibular myogenic potential amplitude asymmetry and Dizziness Handicap Inventory scores, both at presentation and up to 12 months. The study found no statistically significant difference between the three groups of the study at the end of the follow up period. Corticosteroids and VRT seem to be equivalently effective in patients with VN. The study proposes that corticosteroids may accelerate the recovery of VN, with no more beneficial role in the long-term prognosis of the disease.",1,0,1,6
10,30820008,Quality of Life in Adolescent Boys with Idiopathic Short Stature: Positive Impact of Growth Hormone and Aromatase Inhibitors.,"The combination of growth hormone (GH) and aromatase inhibitors (AI) improves linear growth in severely short adolescent boys; however, the effects of this intervention on quality of life (QoL) are unknown. This study assesses whether GH, AI, or their combination impacts the QoL of adolescent males with idiopathic short stature (ISS) from both the adolescent and the parent perspective. A randomized open-label comparator trial was conducted in 76 pubertal males with ISS who received AI, GH, or AI/GH for 24 months. The condition-specific Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth questionnaire was used to assess QoL. QoL scores were low at baseline in the children's and parents' reports. Within-group testing showed that total QoL scores increased significantly at 24 months in the GH and AI/GH group but not the AI group in the children's report, whereas it increased in all of the groups in the parents' report. Increases in QoL scores were associated with an increase in height SDS. Treatment with GH and AI/GH was associated with improved QoL scores as measured from both the patients' and the parents' perspectives, suggesting that the improved growth resulting from the use of these growth-promoting therapies has beneficial psychosocial effects in adolescent males with ISS followed for 24 months.",1,0,1,7
8,30745885,"Bone Status in Obese, Non-diabetic, Antipsychotic-Treated Patients, and Effects of the Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist Exenatide on Bone Turnover Markers and Bone Mineral Density.","Background: Low bone mineral density (BMD) may constitute an underestimated comorbidity in schizophrenia patients undergoing long-term antipsychotic treatment. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are antidiabetic drugs, which may also affect bone turnover. Methods: In planned secondary analyses of a 3 months, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n = 45), we explored effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide 2 mg once-weekly (n = 23), or placebo (n = 22) on bone turnover markers (BTMs) and BMD in chronic, obese, antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Baseline BTMs were compared to sex- and age-adjusted reference values from a Danish population cohort, and T- and Z-scores were calculated for BMD. Results: In women (n = 24), all baseline BTM measurements of procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) and C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) were within reference values. In men (n = 21), 5% displayed lower PINP and 14% displayed lower CTX. One patient displayed BMD Z-score < -2, and 23% of patients (17% of women and 29% of men) displayed -2.5 < T-scores < -1 indicating osteopenia, but none had osteoporosis. After treatment, PINP decreased at trend level significance (P = 0.05), and body mass index BMD increased for L2-L4 (P = 0.016). No changes in bone markers were significant after correction for mean prolactin levels. Conclusions: Sex- and age-adjusted measures of bone status in chronic, obese, antipsychotic-treated patients appeared comparable to the reference population. Subtle changes in bone markers during 3 months exenatide treatment may suggest beneficial effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on bone status in antipsychotic-treated patients, and further studies should consider the potential influence of prolactin.",1,0,1,8
12,31093568,OPTimal IMAging strategy in patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department: chest X-ray or ultra-low-dose CT (OPTIMACT)-a randomised controlled trial chest X-ray or ultra-low-dose CT at the ED: design and rationale.,"Chest X-ray has been the standard imaging method for patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department (ED) for years. Recently, ultra-low-dose chest computed tomography (ULD chest CT) has been introduced, which provides substantially more detailed information on pulmonary conditions that may cause pulmonary disease, with a dose in the order of chest X-ray (0.1 vs. 0.05 mSv). The OPTimal IMAging strategy in patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department: chest X-ray or CT (OPTIMACT) study is a randomized trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of replacing chest X-ray for ULD chest CT in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the ED. Two thousand four hundred patients presenting at the ED with pulmonary complaints and suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease will be enrolled in this multicenter, pragmatic, randomized trial. During randomly assigned periods of one calendar month, either conventional chest X-ray or ULD chest CT scan will be used as the imaging strategy. Randomization will rely on computer-generated blocks of 2 months to control for seasonal effects. Chest X-ray and ULD chest CT will be performed in a standardized way, after obtaining the clinical history and performing physical examination and initial laboratory tests. The primary outcome measure is functional health at 28 days. Secondary outcome measures are mental health, length of hospital stay, mortality within 28 days, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) during the first 28 days, correct diagnoses at ED discharge as compared to the final post hoc diagnosis, and number of patients in follow-up because of incidental findings on chest X-ray or ULD chest CT. In an economic evaluation, we will estimate total health care costs during the first 28 days. This pragmatic trial will clarify the effects of replacing chest X-ray by ULD chest CT in daily practice, in terms of patient-related health outcomes and costs, in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the ED. The OPTIMACT trial is registered in the Netherlands National Trial Register under number NTR6163. The date of registration is December 6, 2016.",0,1,0,9
7,30719013,Adverse Behavioral Changes in Adult Mice Following Neonatal Repeated Exposure to Pain and Sucrose.,"Sucrose is recommended for the treatment of pain during minor procedures in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and is currently used worldwide as the standard of care. We recently reported that adult mice repetitively exposed to sucrose compared to water during the first week of life, irrespective of exposure to an intervention, had significantly smaller brain volumes in large white matter, cortical and subcortical structures (e.g., hippocampus, striatum, fimbria). These structures are important for stress regulation and memory formation. Here, we report the effects of repeated neonatal exposure to pain and sucrose on adult behavior in mice. Neonatal C57BL/6J mice (N = 160, 47% male) were randomly assigned to one of two treatments (sucrose, water) and one of three interventions (needle-prick, tactile, handling). Pups received 10 interventions daily from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P6. A single dose of 24% sucrose or water was given orally 2 min before each intervention. At adulthood (P60-85) mice underwent behavioral testing to assess spatial memory, anxiety, motor function, pain sensitivity, and sugar preference. We found that mice that had received sucrose and handling only, had poorer short-term memory in adulthood compared to water/handling controls (p < 0.05). When exposed to pain, mice treated with repetitive sucrose or water did not differ on memory performance (p = 0.1). A sugar preference test showed that adult mice that received sucrose before an intervention as pups consumed less sugar solution compared to controls or those that received water before pain (p < 0.05). There were no significant group differences in anxiety, motor, or pain sensitivity. In a mouse model that closely mimics NICU care, we show for the first time that memory in adulthood was poorer for mice exposed to pain during the first week of life, irrespective of sucrose treatment, suggesting that sucrose does not protect memory performance when administered for pain. In the absence of pain, early repetitive sucrose exposure induced poorer short-term memory, highlighting the importance of accurate pain assessment.",0,1,0,10
13,31143842,A nested randomised trial of the effect of tranexamic acid on intracranial haemorrhage and infarction in traumatic brain injury (CRASH-3 trial intracranial bleeding mechanistic study): Statistical analysis plan.,"Background: The CRASH-3 trial is a randomised trial on the effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) versus placebo on death and disability in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The CRASH-3 intracranial bleeding mechanistic study (IBMS) is a randomised trial nested within the CRASH-3 trial to examine the effect of TXA versus placebo on intracranial bleeding and infarction. Methods: Patients eligible for the CRASH-3 trial, with a GCS of 12 or less or intracranial bleeding on a pre-randomisation CT scan are eligible for the IBMS. The occurrence of intracranial bleeding, infarction, haemorrhagic oedematous lesions, mass effect and haemorrhage evacuation is examined within 28 days of randomisation using routinely collected brain scans. The primary outcome is the volume of intra-parenchymal bleeding in patients randomised within three hours of injury (adjusted for prognostic covariates). Secondary outcomes include a composite poor outcome, progressive and new intracranial bleeding, intracranial bleeding after neurosurgery and cerebral infarcts seen up to 28 days post-randomisation. All outcomes will be compared between treatment groups. Statistical analyses: The primary outcome will be analysed using a covariate adjusted linear mixed model. The same analysis will be done separately for patients who undergo haemorrhage evacuation post-randomisation. We will express the effect of TXA on the composite outcome, new and progressive bleeding using relative risks and 95% CIs, and on cerebral infarcts using hazard ratios and 95% CIs. We will conduct sensitivity analyses assuming missing data are MCAR or MNAR. Conclusion: The IBMS will provide information on the mechanism of action of TXA in TBI. This pre-specified statistical analysis plan is a technical extension of the published protocol. Trial registration: The CRASH-3 trial was prospectively registered at the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials registry (19 July 2011) and ClinicalTrials.gov (25 July 2011). The registries were updated with details for the IBMS on 20 December 2016.",0,1,0,11
0,30569038,"A novel nano-iron supplement to safely combat iron deficiency and anaemia in young children: The IHAT-GUT double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial protocol.","Background: Iron deficiency and its associated anaemia (IDA) are the leading forms of micronutrient malnutrition worldwide. Here we describe the rationale and design of the first clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of an innovative nano iron supplement, iron hydroxide adipate tartrate (IHAT), for the treatment of IDA in young children (IHAT-GUT trial). Oral iron is often ineffective due to poor absorption and/or gastrointestinal adverse effects. IHAT is novel since it is effectively absorbed whilst remaining nanoparticulate in the gut, therefore should enable supplementation with fewer symptoms. Methods: IHAT-GUT is a three-arm, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial conducted in Gambian children 6-35 months of age. The intervention consists of a 12-week supplementation with either IHAT, ferrous sulphate (both at doses bioequivalent to 12.5 mg Fe/day) or placebo. The trial aims to include 705 children with IDA who will be randomly assigned (1:1:1) to each arm. The primary objectives are to test non-inferiority of IHAT in relation to ferrous sulphate at treating IDA, and to test superiority of IHAT in relation to ferrous sulphate and non-inferiority in relation to placebo in terms of diarrhoea incidence and prevalence. Secondary objectives are mechanistic assessments, to test whether IHAT reduces the burden of enteric pathogens, morbidity, and intestinal inflammation, and that it does not cause detrimental changes to the gut microbiome, particularly in relation to Lactobacillaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. Discussion: This trial will test the hypothesis that supplementation with IHAT eliminates iron deficiency and improves haemoglobin levels without inducing gastrointestinal adverse effects. If shown to be the case, this would open the possibility for further testing and use of IHAT as a novel iron source for micronutrient intervention strategies in resource-poor countries, with the ultimate aim to help reduce the IDA global burden. Registration: This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT02941081).",0,1,0,12
11,30886974,Achieving minimal disease activity in psoriatic arthritis predicts meaningful improvements in patients' health-related quality of life and productivity.,"Although psoriatic arthritis is complex and involves multiple domains, recent advances in treatments have made remission or near-remission of most symptoms a potentially achievable goal for many patients. We sought to evaluate whether achieving minimal disease activity (MDA) criteria represented meaningful improvement from the patient perspective. Data were combined from two randomized, multinational, 24 week clinical studies of ixekizumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody selectively targeting interleukin-17A, in biological drug-naïve or experienced adults. MDA required 5 of 7 of: tender joint count ≤1; swollen joint count ≤1; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index total score ≤ 1 or body surface area ≤ 3%; patient's assessment of pain visual analogue scale (VAS) ≤15; patient's global assessment of disease activity VAS ≤20; Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index ≤0.5; and tender entheseal points ≤ 1. MDA responders and non-responders were compared for mean change from baseline on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), European Quality of Life 5 Dimension 5 Level Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5 L); EQ-5D-5 L VAS; and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP) questionnaire. MDA responders had significantly greater improvements versus non-responders in each SF-36 domain and in the SF-36 physical summary score; improvements were also greater in the EQ-5D-5 L and EQ-5D-5 L VAS, and in 3 of the 4 WPAI-SHP domains. MDA responders were more likely to achieve minimal clinically important differences than non-responders. These findings support MDA response as being strongly associated with achieving improved disease status based on measures of patient reported health-related quality of life and productivity.

1,30674772,"The outcome of combined treatment with ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir, sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin as salvage therapy for Egyptian HCV experienced patients: A single center study.","We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of combination of sofosbuvir with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir ± ribavirin as a retreatment option for experienced Egyptian patients who failed previous sofosbuvir, daclatasvir ± ribavirin therapy. A total of 75 treatment-experienced patients were allocated for the completion of their treatment period according to criteria formed by the national committee for control of viral hepatitis. The enrolled patients were followed up throughout treatment, at the end of treatment and 3 months after the end of the treatment by clinical evaluation and laboratory investigations. 27 patients were treated with sofosbuvir with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks while 48 patients were treated with sofosbuvir with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir without ribavirin for 24 weeks. The per-protocol sustained virological response at week 12 (SVR12) rate was 100% in both groups while the intention-to-treat SVR12 was 93.4% in all patients, 97.9% in the 24 weeks group and 85.2% in the 12 weeks group. The regimen was well tolerated and the most common adverse effects observed across treatment and during follow-up period included fatigue (38.6%) and headache (29.3%), withdrawal due to adverse effects occurred in 6.6%. We can conclude that retreatment with sofosbuvir with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir ± ribavirin is well tolerated and achieved high SVR12 rates in chronic HCV Egyptian patients with previous sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir treatment failure. Ribavirin free regimen for 24 weeks exerted significant lesser adverse effects.",0,1,0,14
