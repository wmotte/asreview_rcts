31,32754669,"ANAMT Technical Guideline (DT 05): prevention of occupational low back pain through back belts, lumbar support or braces.","Low back pain is a considerable global public health problem. Use of back belts in occupational settings arises from the expectation of countless biomechanical benefits, which together would contribute to the prevention of this problem. To orient students, physicians and health institutions on the use of back belts, lumbar support or braces for prevention of low back pain or injury among asymptomatic workers. The present guideline was developed based on a systematic literature review; 809 studies were located in database MEDLINE and 571 in EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL. Evaluating back-belt use as preventive intervention against low back pain demands quantifying benefits, harms and difficulties to implementation, as well as the methodological quality of primary studies. Despite the weak benefits reflected in the individual, partial and isolated results of a few studies, there is no consistent evidence for the use of back belts, lumbar supports or braces for primary prevention of low back pain or occupational low back injury among workers. According to the available evidence, back-belt use is not associated with reduction of absenteeism. Lombalgia é um problema internacional importante de saúde pública. O uso de cinta lombar no meio ocupacional emerge da expectativa de inúmeros benefícios bio-mecânicos que, em conjunto, promoveriam a prevenção desse problema. Orientar estudantes, médicos e estabelecimentos de saúde sobre o uso de cinta lombar, suporte ou órtese lombar como prevenção da lombalgia ou de lesões lombares em trabalhadores sem sintomatologia atual. Ela foi desenvolvida a partir da revisão sistemática da literatura: da base de dados MEDLINE, foram recuperados 809 trabalhos e das bases EMBASE e Central Cochrane, 571. Avaliar a cinta lombar como intervenção preventiva de lombalgia envolve a quantificação de benefícios, malefícios e facilidade de sua implementação, assim como a qualidade metodológica dos estudos primários. Apesar do benefício demonstrado fracamente em resultados individuais, parciais e isolados em poucos estudos, não há evidência consistente que sustente a utilização de cinta lombar, suporte ou órtese lombar na prevenção primária da lombalgia ou de lesões lombares ocupacionais em trabalhadores. As evidências, agrupadas, apontam para ausência de redução de absenteísmo com o uso da cinta lombar.",1,0,1,1
15,30764662,Primary Esophageal Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: A Comparative Review of 15 Cases.,"Primary esophageal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an extremely rare clinicopathologic entity. We report one case from our clinical experience and undertake a review of the previously published cases. A systematic literature search of the medical databases PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted. A total of 15 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The data on patients' characteristics, epidemiology, clinical features, HIV status, gross appearance of the lesion, esophageal location, treatment, and outcome were collected and analyzed. Primary esophageal DLBCL was more common among males, primarily in the fifth and sixth decades of life. Dysphagia was the most common initial clinical presentation. Tissue biopsy with immunohistochemistry was an indispensable diagnostic modality. The mainstay of treatment was chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone regimen, in addition to anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, with or without radiotherapy. This review serves to outline our current understanding of the epidemiology of and risk factors for primary esophageal DLBCL, the pathophysiology of this disorder, and currently available approaches to diagnosis and management.",1,0,1,2

A systematic review of primary studies published in Spanish, English or Portuguese between 2000 and 2017 was carried out. First, a review of the academic production was carried out by continent and type of objective. In a second stage, the studies that experimented with and evaluated the use of geoprocessing in empirical form were selected. Specific and generic benefits, as well as limitations, were reviewed. 134 articles were identified in the first stage of selection, half of them from the Region of the Americas. Only nine studies met the criteria and were reviewed in the second stage. These studies showed that the use of geoprocessing generates benefits that go beyond the technical benefits, with limitations that can be overcome. Although the benefits of using geoprocessing have been widely discussed, few studies have evaluated its implementation in PHC empirically. Practical experiences, which could easily be reproduced in different communities, show that its continued use could increase the capacity to respond to the goals of PHC, as well as to the goals of sustainable development. Revisar as consequências empíricas do uso de geoprocessamento na gestão dos serviços de atenção primária à saúde (APS), com o propósito de difundir os benefícios do uso desta tecnologia, bem como precisar os desafios que devem ser superados para sua contribuição no desenvolvimento da APS.

Foram identificados 134 artigos na primeira etapa de seleção, a metade deles proveniente do continente americano. Nove estudos cumpriram os requisitos da segunda etapa; no entanto, demonstraram que o uso de geoprocesamiento gera benefícios que vão além dos benefícios técnicos, com limitações factíveis de serem superadas. Embora os benefícios do uso de geoprocessamento tenham sido amplamente discutidos, são escassos os estudos que avaliaram sua implementação em APS em forma empírica. Experiências práticas, que poderiam ser facilmente reproduzidas em outras comunidades, demonstram que seu uso contínuo poderia aumentar a capacidade de resposta às metas de APS, bem como às próprias metas do desenvolvimento sustentável.",1,0,1,3
24,31093120,"The associations that income, education, and ethnicity have with birthweight and prematurity: how close are they?","To identify evidence that income, education, or ethnicity might be associated with low birthweight, small-for-gestational-age birth, or preterm birth. A systematic review was conducted using searches in two online databases, PubMed and Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean (LILACS). The searches covered materials published between 1 January 1982 and 5 May 2016. The search terms used were (infant, premature OR infant, small for gestational age OR fetal growth retardation) AND (socioeconomic factors OR ethnic groups OR maternal age). A total of 3 070 references that met the initial selection criteria were analyzed, and 157 relevant studies were fully read. We located 18 studies that investigated associations of family or maternal income, education, or ethnicity with low birthweight, small-for-gestational-age birth, or preterm birth. Of the 18, 10 of them involved high-income countries, and 8 dealt with middle- or low-income countries. Greater evidence was found for an association between ethnicity and the three outcomes studied, particularly for prematurity among children of black mothers. There was little evidence for an association between maternal/family income or education and any of the three outcomes. Income and education weren't determinants for low birthweight, small-for-gestational-age birth, or preterm birth. However, black ethnicity was strongly associated with the three outcomes, especially with prematurity.

26,31093204,Health and other impacts of community food production in Small Island Developing States: a systematic scoping review.,"To explore what is known on community-based food production initiatives (CFPIs) in Small Island Developing States, particularly the health, social, economic, and environmental impacts of and on CFPIs. This was a systematic scoping review using 14 electronic databases to identify articles published from 1997 to 2016 on the topic of CFPIs in Small Island Developing States. From 8 215 articles found, 153 were eligible and abstracted. Analysis focused on geographic location, typology, methodology, study design, theoretical frameworks, and impacts. Most research was conducted in the Pacific or Caribbean (49% and 43% of studies, respectively) and primarily focused on fishing and crop farming (40%, 34%). Findings indicate a predominance of research focusing on the environmental impact of marine and coastal resources on CFPIs, and very limited evidence of CFPI impact on human health, particularly nutrition and diet-related outcomes. There was a lack of explicit theoretical frameworks to explain the impacts of CFPIs. Evidence of impacts of CPFIs in Small Island Developing States is limited and the approaches taken are inconsistent. This review demonstrates the need and provides a basis for developing a coherent body of methods to examine the impacts of CFPIs and provide evidence to guide policy, especially as it relates to health.

23,31093082,[Internet-based alcohol interventions for college students: systematic reviewIntervenciones por Internet para reducir el consumo de alcohol de los estudiantes universitarios: revisión sistemática].,"To identify the main modalities of Internet-based interventions to limit alcohol use among university students, and to describe the effects of these interventions on alcohol use and related consequences. A systematic review of PubMed, PsycINFO, and SciELO was performed using as search terms alcohol drinking AND Internet, without date or language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trial design, focus on college students and on Internet-based interventions, and evaluating the effects of the intervention on alcohol use or alcohol-related consequences. Thirty-six articles were analyzed. Two main intervention modalities were identified: personalized normative feedback (PNF, n=28) and multicomponent interventions (n=8). Twelve studies with PNF reported reductions in alcohol use 3 months after the intervention. Multicomponent interventions reduced alcohol use and related consequences; most studies focused on the website AlcoholEdu, which reduced alcohol consumption and the consequences of alcohol use 6 months after the intervention. FNP and the AlcoholEdu website, the most frequently evaluated interventions among the selected studies, were effective in reducing alcohol use in university students. These strategies are an alternative to increase the access of university students to interventions aimed at limiting alcohol use.

14,30729031,IgG4-related diseases: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines.,"Immunoglobulin G4-related diseases (IgG4-RD) are a group of chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory conditions, characterised by tissue infiltration with lymphocytes and IgG4-secreting plasma cells, fibrosis and a usually favourable response to steroids. In this narrative review, we summarise the results of a systematic literature research, which was performed as part of the European Reference Network ReCONNET, aimed at evaluating existing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and recommendations in IgG4-RD. From 167 publications initially obtained from a systematic literature search, only one was identified as a systematic multispecialist, evidence-based, consensus guidance statement on diagnosis and treatment of IgG4-RD, which may be recommended for use as CPG in IgG4-RD. With the recognition of a limited evidence based in this increasingly recognised disease, the group discussion has identified the following unmet needs: lack of shared classification criteria, absence of formal guidelines on diagnosis, no evidence-based therapeutic recommendations and lack of activity and damage indices. Areas of unmet needs include the difficulties in diagnosis, management and monitoring and the scarcity of expert centres.",1,0,1,7
7,30687173,Psychosocial Suicide Prevention Interventions in the Elderly: A Mini-Review of the Literature.,"In Europe the elderly population is projected to increase from 18.5% (93.9 million) in 2014 to 28.7% (149.1 million) by 2080. In the United States it is estimated that by 2030 more than 20% of the population will be aged 65 years or over. This specific population is at high risk of unrecognized or untreated psychiatric illnesses and suicide. It is well known that completed suicide rate increases with age in both men and women. Although elderly people attempt suicide less often than other age groups, they show a higher completion rate. Generally, the methods chosen by elderly are more lethal, the intent is more serious, they are more determined, and they show fewer warning signs than the younger population. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of psychosocial intervention, following self-harm in adults, found that cognitive behavioral therapy was the most effective therapy in these patients. Unfortunately, there have been few reported trials of other potentially effective interventions. Because the scientific literature on psychosocial suicide prevention interventions in the elderly is still scant, we conducted a mini-review in order to take stock of the situation. Studies were identified through electronic searches of the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, Scopus and the Web of Science databases. PRISMA guidelines were followed and only seven articles met the inclusion criteria. No firm conclusions can be drawn about this topic because there is still very little data and studies use inconsistent outcome measures and designs. Nonetheless, the existing data suggests that psychosocial interventions are promising.",1,0,1,8
16,30766721,Women's heart health at mid-life: what is the role of psychosocial stress?,"Women in mid-life experience unique stressors, including transitions within their family roles, informal caregiving, job stress, and perceived discrimination. The impact of these stressors on cardiovascular health in women during mid-life is of growing interest in both the popular and scientific literature. The objective of this review is to summarize the recent literature on stress and cardiovascular health in mid-life women. We focus on stressors that are relevant to mid-life women, including social stress and discrimination, and long-term risk of CVD events and subclinical CVD measures. We systematically reviewed the literature published between January 2012 and April 2018 for studies examining stress in mid-life and either CVD endpoints or subclinical CVD outcomes. Eligible studies included at least one psychosocial stress exposure, a CVD or subclinical CVD outcome, and either included only female participants, reported sex-stratified analyses or tested for a sex*stress interaction. We identified 37 studies published since 2012 that met our criteria and included women between the ages of 40 and 65, including 3 case-control studies, 15 cross-sectional studies, and 19 prospective cohort studies. Because clinical CVD events typically occur after age 65 in women, only 22 studies were available that evaluated stress and hard CVD events in samples with mid-life women. Results from these studies suggested an increased and significant risk of CVD due to stress. Of the 15 studies that included subclinical CVD outcomes, the majority showed that mid-life women experiencing greater levels of stress had more subclinical CVD, as indicated by carotid intima-media thickness, flow-mediated dilation and arterial stiffness; however, several studies reported null associations. General life stress, including perceived stress and life events, in mid-life was significantly related to later-life CVD risk and mid-life subclinical CVD in the majority of studies published in the past six years. Job stress was inconsistently related to CVD risk in women, and fewer studies examined characteristics of other social roles, such as marriage, motherhood or caregiving. Perceived discrimination also was associated with CVD events and subclinical CVD in some samples of mid-life women. Further investigation into specific stressors relevant to women in mid-life, including caregiving and marital stress, are needed to understand the full extent to which life stress impacts CVD risk in mid-life women.",1,0,1,9
4,30687096,A Review of Resveratrol as a Potent Chemoprotective and Synergistic Agent in Cancer Chemotherapy.,"Background: Cancer has become a major disease endangering human health around the world. Conventional chemotherapy suffers from many side effects including pain, cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and renal toxicity. This review aims to describe a natural product of resveratrol as a chemoprotective and synergistic agent in the modulation of cancer chemotherapy. Methods: The publications were identified by comprehensive searching of SciFinder, PubMed, Web of Science, and our own reference library. Search terms included combinations of resveratrol, cancer, natural products, chemotherapy, and side effects. Selection of material focused on resveratrol reducing the side effects on cancer chemotherapy. Results: Thirty one references were referred in this review to outline resveratrol as a potent chemoprotective and synergistic agent in cancer chemotherapy, including 22 papers for describing the chemoprotective effects, and 9 papers for illustrating the synergistic effects. Conclusion: This study provides a systematic summary of resveratrol serving as a potent chemoprotective and synergistic agent to reduce the associated-side effects and enhance the therapeutic outcomes in cancer chemotherapy. Further studies in terms of resveratrol on a large amount of preclinical tests and clinical trials are highly demanded.",1,0,1,10
9,30697170,Putative Role of Respiratory Muscle Training to Improve Endurance Performance in Hypoxia: A Review.,"Respiratory/inspiratory muscle training (RMT/IMT) has been proposed to improve the endurance performance of athletes in normoxia. In recent years, due to the increased use of hypoxic training method among athletes, the RMT applicability has also been tested as a method to minimize adverse effects since hyperventilation may cause respiratory muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise in hypoxia. We performed a review in order to determine factors potentially affecting the change in endurance performance in hypoxia after RMT in healthy subjects. A comprehensive search was done in the electronic databases MEDLINE and Google Scholar including keywords: RMT/IMT, and/or endurance performance, and/or altitude and/or hypoxia. Seven appropriate studies were found until April 2018. Analysis of the studies showed that two RMT methods were used in the protocols: respiratory muscle endurance (RME) (isocapnic hyperpnea: commonly 10-30', 3-5 d/week) in three of the seven studies, and respiratory muscle strength (RMS) (Powerbreathe device: commonly 2 × 30 reps at 50% MIP (maximal inspiratory pressure), 5-7 d/week) in the remaining four studies. The duration of the protocols ranged from 4 to 8 weeks, and it was found in synthesis that during exercise in hypoxia, RMT promoted (1) reduced respiratory muscle fatigue, (2) delayed respiratory muscle metaboreflex activation, (3) better maintenance of SaO2 and blood flow to locomotor muscles. In general, no increases of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) were described. Ventilatory function improvements (maximal inspiratory pressure) achieved by using RMT fostered the capacity to adapt to hypoxia and minimized the impact of respiratory stress during the acclimatization stage in comparison with placebo/sham. In conclusion, RMT was found to elicit general positive effects mainly on respiratory efficiency and breathing patterns, lower dyspneic perceptions and improved physical performance in conditions of hypoxia. Thus, this method is recommended to be used as a pre-exposure tool for strengthening respiratory muscles and minimizing the adverse effects caused by hypoxia related hyperventilation. Future studies will assess these effects in elite athletes.",1,0,1,11
11,30705668,Metabolomics-A Promising Approach to Pituitary Adenomas.,"Background: Metabolomics-the novel science that evaluates the multitude of low-molecular-weight metabolites in a biological system, provides new data on pathogenic mechanisms of diseases, including endocrine tumors. Although development of metabolomic profiling in pituitary disorders is at an early stage, it seems to be a promising approach in the near future in identifying specific disease biomarkers and understanding cellular signaling networks. Objectives: To review the metabolomic profile and the contributions of metabolomics in pituitary adenomas (PA). Methods: A systematic review was conducted via PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus databases, summarizing studies that have described metabolomic aspects of PA. Results: Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry, which are traditional techniques employed in metabolomics, suggest amino acids metabolism appears to be primarily altered in PA. N-acetyl aspartate, choline-containing compounds and creatine appear as highly effective in differentiating PA from healthy tissue. Deoxycholic and 4-pyridoxic acids, 3-methyladipate, short chain fatty acids and glucose-6-phosphate unveil metabolite biomarkers in patients with Cushing's disease. Phosphoethanolamine, N-acetyl aspartate and myo-inositol are down regulated in prolactinoma, whereas aspartate, glutamate and glutamine are up regulated. Phosphoethanolamine, taurine, alanine, choline-containing compounds, homocysteine, and methionine were up regulated in unclassified PA across studies. Intraoperative use of ultra high mass resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which allows localization and delineation between functional PA and healthy pituitary tissue, may contribute to achievement of complete tumor resection in addition to preservation of pituitary cell lines and vasopressin secretory cells, thus avoiding postoperative diabetes insipidus. Conclusion: Implementation of ultra high performance metabolomics analysis techniques in the study of PA will significantly improve diagnosis and, potentially, the therapeutic approach, by identifying highly specific disease biomarkers in addition to novel molecular pathogenic mechanisms. Ultra high mass resolution MALDI-MSI emerges as a helpful clinical tool in the neurosurgical treatment of pituitary tumors. Therefore, metabolomics appears to be a science with a promising prospect in the sphere of PA, and a starting point in pituitary care.",1,0,1,12
21,30863312,Clinical Trials Focusing on Drug Control and Prevention of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: A Comprehensive Analysis of Trials Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.,"Objective: Clinical trials have emerged as the main force in driving the development of medicine. However, little is known about the current status of clinical trials regarding drug control and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). This study aimed at providing a comprehensive landscape of these trials on the basis of ClinicalTrials.gov. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive study of clinical trials on drug control and prevention of VAP which have been registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov up to 25th August 2018 was conducted. Results: A total of 109 eligible trials were identified. Trials were started from 1998 to 2018, and most trials focused on adult patients. More than half trials were completed, while only 11.9% trials had results available. Sample sizes were relatively large, with a median enrollment of 146. Universities were listed as the primary sponsor for 36.7% trials, industry for 28.4% trials and hospitals for 19.3% trials. Of the 109 VAP trials, 37 trials were from in Europe, 36 in North America and 27 in Asia. Among the 97 interventional trials, 32 were phase 3 trials, 21 were phase 4 trials, and 16 were phase 2 trials. Most interventional trials were randomized trials with a parallel assignment, and 57.7% trials were blinded. Of the 12 observational trials, 9 were cohort studies, and 10 trials were prosepctive studies. Drugs about oral care, preemptive antibiotics and probiotics were most investigated for prevention. A total of 61 trials investigated drugs for the treatment of VAP, mainly focused on antibiotics. A total of 36 kinds of antibiotics were investigated for monotherapy or combination therapy. Beta-lactams were most studied, followed by aminoglycosides and polypeptides. Conclusion: Most clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov about drugs for VAP were interventional trials with the purpose for treatment. A high proportion of interventional trials were randomized, parallel assigned and masked. Our analysis highlights the need for improvement in completeness of study results on the ClinicalTrials.gov.",1,0,0,13
30,32754664,Occupational stress in hospital settings: review of coping strategies of nursing professionals.,"The nursing work process might contribute to the development of occupational stress, as it demands considerable attention and responsibility. Workers have resource to strategies to cope with stressors in the workplace. Coping strategies are ways to manage stress and minimize the effects of stressors to preserve the physical and emotional well-being. To identify through a literature review the strategies to cope with occupational stress adopted by hospital nursing professionals. A literature search was conducted in databases Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) and Nursing Database (BDENF) via Virtual Health Library (VHL) and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO). Twenty-five studies were selected, 14 with quantitative, 9 with qualitative, and 2 with quantitative-qualitative approach. The located coping strategies were categorized according to the Coping with Job Stress (CJS) scale which classifies ways to cope with problems in the workplace under three categories: control, escape and symptom management. On these grounds, our literature review identified 4 control, 8 escape and 7 symptom management strategies. Control strategies were considered efficacious to manage stress.

It is often associated with lack of range of motion and reduced shoulder function. Lack of sleep and difficulties in performing basic daily life activities are common findings. Subacromial Impingement Syndrome (SAIS) has been considered as the most common cause of shoulder pain since it was described in 1852. Charles Neer, in 1972, described the presence of a proliferative spur and ridge on the undersurface of the acromion, which needs to be removed to improve the symptoms (acromioplasty). Neer's impingement hegemony was undisputed for at least 30 years. A more extensive knowledge of the pathogenesis of SAIS, however, has led authors to challenge the role of impingement in the shoulder pain and the role of surgical intervention. The aim of this review was to understand if there is still a role for surgical decompression in patients with SAIS. A literature review was performed in PubMed, PEDro, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using impingement, subacromial space, rotator cuff tears, tendinopathy, and tendinitis as key words. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with long-term follow-up comparing surgical intervention and conservative treatments in SAIS were preferred; however, prospective articles studying the outcome of surgical decompression and physiotherapy were also included. The majority of the studies showed no difference in the outcome between patients randomized to surgical decompression or conservative management. However, some studies reported better results after surgery, especially in the long term. Interpretation of the results is very difficult as most of the studies are of poor quality and have short follow-up. In our opinion, the type of subacromial lesion needs to be considered; this may offer an explanation to the difference in severity of symptoms and to the varying degrees of response to certain treatments, including surgery. Further studies are mandatory to better understand the role of surgery in SAIS.",1,0,0,15
19,30799786,Potent Cytotoxic Natural Flavonoids: The Limits of Perspective.,"Besides the numerous biologic and pharmacologic functions in the human body that act as potent antioxidants, flavonoids (flavones, flavanones, flavonols, flavanols and isoflavones) are noted as cancer preventive or therapeutic agents. This review summarizes the published data using PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus. In this context, recognition and introduction of the most active cytotoxic flavonoids as promising agents for cancer therapy gives insight for further evaluations. However, there are some critical points that may affect the entering of flavonoids as active cytotoxic phytochemicals in the clinical phase. Issues such as the abundance of active species in nature, the methods of extraction and purification, solubility, pharmacokinetic profile, presence of the chiral moieties, method of synthesis, and structure modification may limit the entry of a selected compound for use in humans. Although plenty of basic evidence exists for cytotoxic/antitumor activity of the versatility of flavonoids for entry into clinical trials, the above-mentioned concerns must be considered. This review is an effort to introduce cytotoxic natural flavonoids (IC50< 10 µM) that may have the potential to be used against various tumor cells. Also, active constituents, molecular mechanisms, and related clinical trials have been discussed as well as the limitations and challenges of using flavonoids in clinic.",1,0,0,16
6,30687152,Primary Study Quality in Psychological Meta-Analyses: An Empirical Assessment of Recent Practice.,"As meta-analytic research has come to occupy a sizeable contingent of published work in the psychological sciences, clarity in the reporting of such work is crucial to its interpretability and reproducibility. This is especially true regarding the assessment of primary study quality, as notions of study quality can vary across research domains. The present study examines the general state of reporting practices related to primary study quality in a sample of 382 published psychological meta-analyses, as well as the reporting decisions and motivations of the authors that published them. Our findings suggest adherence to reporting standards has remained poor for assessments of primary study quality and that the discipline remains inconsistent in its reporting practices generally. We discuss several potential reasons for the poor adherence to reporting standards in our sample, including whether quality assessments are being conducted in the first place, whether standards are well-known within the discipline, and the potential conflation of assessing primary study quality with other facets of conducting a meta-analysis. The implications of suboptimal reporting practices related to primary study quality are discussed.",0,1,0,17
22,30972131,Immigrants Psychopathology: Emerging Phenomena and Adaptation of Mental Health Care Setting by Native Language.,"Mental health of immigrants is an important social and clinical issue. Immigrants may report higher rates of mental disorders and lower levels of use of mental health service with respect to natives. The aim of the present work is to review recent findings of the psychopathology of immigrants and analyze how to adapt the mental care settings through the use of mother tongues. We searched the literature to individuate and review the most recent scientific articles focused on the psychopathology of immigrants realized in Europe. Moreover, we summarized the guidelines about immigrants mental health care and we focused on the barriers caused by language. We individuated 15 papers reporting data about mental disorders among immigrants and the related risk and protective factors. The articles reported information about psychosis, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, somatization and suicide rates. Risk and protective factors are individuated mainly among social factors (e.g. ethnic density effect, hosting countries' policies). Furthermore, immigrants encounter language barriers in the use of mental care services. The realization of cross-cultural training and the development of a working alliance between clinicians and interpreters resulted to be effective solutions even if these interventions are not frequently implemented. The extent of migratory flows and the related difficulties experienced by immigrants require attention and well-informed interventions. The high rates of incidence of mental disorder and the strict number of services who implement interventions taking into accounts fundamental aspect as language show that there is still a lot to do.",1,0,0,18
0,30671424,Scoping Review of Pediatric Early Warning Systems (PEWS) in Resource-Limited and Humanitarian Settings.,"Pediatric Early Warning Systems (PEWS) aim to identify hospitalized children at increased risk of deterioration by assigning a score based on vital signs and clinical status and guiding interventions using a response algorithm to improve outcomes. When implemented with quality improvement methodology, these systems have been shown to be effective in high-resource settings and have the potential to improve the care of children in humanitarian and resource-limited settings (RLS). The purpose of this review is to summarize the current evidence for use of PEWS in RLS and identify areas for further research. A review of the current PEWS literature in RLS was performed using Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, Portal Regional da BVS, and TRIP Database. While there is limited research available on this topic, eight studies on the use of PEWS, or a PEWS score in a pediatric population in low- or middle-income countries were identified. Two studies assessed the clinical effect of implementation of PEWS; one reported a reduction in clinical deterioration events and the other a reduction in mortality. The remaining studies assessed the association of a PEWS score with signs of clinical deterioration or mortality without a response algorithm. Further research on the impact of PEWS implementation on inpatient care and outcomes in RLS is needed.",1,0,0,19
1,30680374,A Review of Web Portal Use by Oncology Patients.,"Patient portals and other Internet-based technologies have been increasingly used to improve cancer care coordination. Patient portals may introduce special considerations in oncology populations where longitudinal outpatient care is often more intensive than in most other specialties. This article, which is based upon bibliographic searches in PubMed, reviews the literature on web portal use by cancer patients. Articles published in English from 2000 to August 2018 were identified using the following MeSH search terms and Boolean algebra commands: web portal AND cancer. Information obtained from bibliographic searches (title and topic of article, information in abstract, and keywords) was used to determine whether to retain each article identified in this way. A total of 263 article citations were identified in the bibliographic searches. Of these, 10 met the eligibility criteria. A variety of study designs were used including focus groups, usability testing, in-person interviews, questionnaire surveys, retrospective cohort, and non-randomized trial. Cancer patients had reached modest levels of portal use. Increased portal use has been associated with younger age, white race, and higher socioeconomic status. Most cancer patients used portals to look up testing results and provide notes, but had difficulty in interpreting the results appropriately. Our study adds to the growing evidence that patient portals play a significant role in promoting self-management in cancer survivors. Additional studies are needed to determine factors influencing portal use, so effective interventions can be developed to enhance portal use.",1,0,0,20
5,30687151,Psychosocial and Neurocognitive Factors Associated With Hepatitis C - Implications for Future Health and Wellbeing.,"Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection involves changes not only from the point of view of physical health, but also emotional, and social that have a significant impact on the quality of life of these patients. According to the literature review, it seems that there is an important association between psychosocial factors, in particular on a cognitive level and disease progression. The aim of this mini-review is to summarize recent literature looking at the associations between psychosocial and neurocognitive factors and HCV. Methods: PubMed/Medline was systematically searched for psychosocial and neurocognitive factors associated with hepatitis C, treatment adherence, and patient wellbeing. Results: Patients present with a range of extrahepatic symptoms including fatigue, anxiety, depression, and neurocognitive dysfunction. HCV's impact on quality of life and wellbeing has serious clinical and social implications. Conclusion: Hepatitis C and its management continue to have a profound impact on health and psychologic wellbeing. Considering the serious extrahepatic implications for individuals, it is imperative that healthcare professionals pay close attention to psychosocial and neurocognitive factors. The focus on combined clinical approaches could enhance understanding about the health and social impacts of hepatitis C along the life course.",1,0,0,21
20,30806306,The Role of Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists in the Management of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is associated with increased risk for hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Currently, there is no established treatment to improve the survival of these patients. Aldosterone appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of HFpEF. To discuss the findings of studies that evaluated the effects of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists on the outcome of patients with HFpEF. PubMed was searched for relevant papers. References of retrieved articles were also evaluated for pertinent material. Accumulating data suggest that MR antagonists might be useful in the management of patients with HFpEF. However, existing evidence is limited and conflicting. More studies are needed to clearly define the therapeutic potential of MR antagonists in HFpEF. Given the heterogeneity of this disease and the low specificity of the criteria used for its diagnosis, it is also important to improve the definition of HFpEF and include appropriately selected patients in these studies.",1,0,0,22
13,30727876,The Role of Steroids and NSAIDs in Prevention and Treatment of Postsurgical Cystoid Macular Edema.,"Pseudophakic cystoid macular edema (PCME) remains one of the most common visionthreatening complication of phacoemulsification cataract surgery (PCS). Pharmacological therapy is the current mainstay of both prophylaxis, and treatment of PCME in patients undergoing PCS. We aimed to review pharmacological treatment options for PCME, which primarily include topical steroids, topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), periocular and intravitreal steroids, as well as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. The PubMed and Web Of Science web platforms were used to find relevant studies using the following keywords: cataract surgery, phacoemulsification, cystoid macular edema, and pseudophakic cystoid macular edema. Of articles retrieved by this method, all publications in English and abstracts of non-English publications were reviewed. Other studies were also considered as a potential source of information when referenced in relevant articles. The search revealed 193 publications. Finally 82 articles dated from 1974 to 2018 were assessed as significant and analyzed. Based on the current literature, we found that corticosteroids remain the mainstay of PCME prophylaxis in uncomplicated cataract surgery, while it is still unclear if NSAID can offer additional benefits. In patients at risk for PCME development, periocular subconjunctival injection of triamcinolone acetonide may prevent PCME development. For PCME treatment the authors recommend a stepwise therapy: initial topical steroids and adjuvant NSAIDs, followed by additional posterior sub-Tenon or retrobulbar corticosteroids in moderate PCME, and intravitreal corticosteroids in recalcitrant PCME. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents may be considered in patients unresponsive to steroid therapy at risk of elevated intraocular pressure, and with comorbid macular disease. Therapy with topical corticosteroids and NSAIDs is the mainstay of PCME prophylaxis and treatment, however, periocular and intravitreal steroids should be considered in refractory cases.",1,0,0,23
27,31093570,Dynamic models to predict health outcomes: current status and methodological challenges.,"Disease populations, clinical practice, and healthcare systems are constantly evolving. This can result in clinical prediction models quickly becoming outdated and less accurate over time. A potential solution is to develop 'dynamic' prediction models capable of retaining accuracy by evolving over time in response to observed changes. Our aim was to review the literature in this area to understand the current state-of-the-art in dynamic prediction modelling and identify unresolved methodological challenges. MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science were searched for papers which used or developed dynamic clinical prediction models. Information was extracted on methods for model updating, choice of update windows and decay factors and validation of models. We also extracted reported limitations of methods and recommendations for future research. We identified eleven papers that discussed seven dynamic clinical prediction modelling methods which split into three categories. The first category uses frequentist methods to update models in discrete steps, the second uses Bayesian methods for continuous updating and the third, based on varying coefficients, explicitly describes the relationship between predictors and outcome variable as a function of calendar time. These methods have been applied to a limited number of healthcare problems, and few empirical comparisons between them have been made. Dynamic prediction models are not well established but they overcome one of the major issues with static clinical prediction models, calibration drift. However, there are challenges in choosing decay factors and in dealing with sudden changes. The validation of dynamic prediction models is still largely unexplored terrain.",1,0,0,24

Many studies have discussed the relationship between immune system and AD pathogenesis. Here, the meta-analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes based on microarray data was conducted to study the association between AD and immune system. 9519 target genes of hippocampus in 146 subjects (73 AD cases and 73 controls) from 4 microarray data sets were compiled and DE genes with p < 1.00E - 04 were selected to conduct the pathway-analysis. The results indicated that the DE genes were significantly enriched in the neuro-diseases as well as the immune system pathways.",0,1,0,25
29,31844836,Screening tools for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders among adults living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa: A scoping review.,"Background: People living with HIV are at risk of developing HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) which adversely affects their quality of life. Routine screening of HAND in HIV care is recommended to identify clinically important changes in cognitive functioning and allow for early interventions. However, HAND detection in routine clinical practice has never been reported in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), partly due to a lack of adequately standardized screening tools. This review was conducted to identify the commonly used screening tools for HAND in SSA and document their psychometric properties and diagnostic accuracy. Methods: We searched Ovid Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Sciences databases for empirical studies published from 1/1/1980 to 31/8/2018 on HAND among adults living with HIV in SSA. Results: We identified 14 eligible studies, of which 9 were from South Africa. The International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) was the most frequently reported tool, being used in more than half of the studies. However most studies only reported the diagnostic accuracy of this and other tools, with specificity ranging from 37% to 81% and sensitivity ranging from 45% to 100%. Appropriate data on construct validity and reliability of tools was rarely documented. Although most tools performed well in screening for severe forms of HAND, they lacked sensitivity and specificity for mild forms of HAND. NeuroScreen, one of the newer tools, yielded good diagnostic accuracy in its initial evaluation in South Africa (81% to 93% sensitivity and 71% to 81% specificity). Conclusions: This review identified a lack of adequately standardized and contextually relevant HAND screening tools in SSA. Most screening tools for HAND used in SSA possess inadequate psychometric properties and diagnostic accuracy. There is a need for further validation of existing tools and development of new HAND screening tools in SSA.",1,0,0,26
28,31583279,Risk factors for community-acquired Escherichia coli bacteraemia: a systematic review protocol.,"Introduction: Rates of community-acquired Escherichia coli bacteraemia (ECB) have been consistently rising. As rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly in Gram-negative bacteria, are also increasing, this is of concern both for management of individual patients and healthcare systems. There is currently little data on the risk factors for development of community-acquired ECB: this review aims to identify these risk factors in order to inform community interventions to reduce ECB as well as antibiotic prescribing policy. Methods and analysis: We will search Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Web of Science/Scopus and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for published reports on observational and experimental primary research studies involving patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired ECB. Two reviewers will independently screen the studies for eligibility, perform data collection and assess study quality and risk of bias. Random effects meta-analyses will be performed if appropriate. Ethics and dissemination: No primary data will be collected for this study and so formal ethical approval is not required. We will publish the results of our review in relevant peer-reviewed medical journals, and will also seek to present them at relevant medical conferences.

8,30687633,ALK Inhibitors in the Treatment of ALK Positive NSCLC.,"Background: ALK inhibitors have shown positive advance in the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC. They have achieved better results in prolonging the progression free survival and improving quality of life in comparison to chemotherapy. We have assembled the evidence related to the efficacy and safety of these agents in the treatment of ALK positive NSCLC. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted using electronic databases of PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library to identify the studies involving comparison of ALK inhibitors to chemotherapy and Next generation ALK inhibitors to crizotinib. PFS was the primary outcome while other outcomes like ORR, adverse events, quality of life and OS were also analyzed and compared. Hazard ratios and odds ratios obtained were analyzed using fixed effect or random effects model in Review Manager Software. Results: A total of 12 studies (n = 3,297) met the criteria for inclusion in this review and meta-analysis. ALK inhibitors including crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib revealed significantly better PFS (HR 0.42 [0.35, 0.50; p < 0.00001]), ORR (Overall OR 6.59 [4.86, 8.94; p < 0.00001] as compared to chemotherapy in the first line as well as second line treatment settings. Intracranial response rate was better with ALK inhibitors (ceritinib and alectinib) as compared to chemotherapy OR 6.51 [2.86, 14.83; p < 0.00001]. No significant increase in grade 3 or 4 adverse events was observed with crizotinib (OR 1.21 [0.82, 1.77; p = 0.34]) or ceritinib (OR 1.49 [0.86, 2.57; p = 0.17]) when compared to chemotherapy individually. Quality of life indicators assessed were significantly improved with ALK inhibitors. Next generation agents (ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib) revealed significant improvement in PFS (HR 0.50 [0.43, 0.57; p < 0.00001]), ORR (OR 1.57 [1.21, 2.04; p = 0.0006]) in comparison to crizotinib. Next generation agents (Alectinib and brigatinib) yielded better response intra-cranially than crizotinib in terms of objective response rate (OR 5.87 [3.49, 9.87; p < 0.00001]) and time to CNS progression (HR 0.25 [0.13, 0.46; p < 0.0001]). Alectinib by far resulted in fewer adverse events than chemotherapy or crizotinib. Conclusions: Overall ALK inhibitors are safe and effective treatment option in ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer. Of the ALK inhibitors, Next generation agents in particular alectinib and brigatinib are safer and more effective intra-cranially and can be preferred as first option.",1,0,0,28
2,30684347,[Characterization of chosen pro-angiogenic factors and anti-angiogenic therapies in ovarian cancer].,"Ovarian cancer is a neoplasm characterized by notably malignancy. The poor results of treatment result not only from the lack of screening tests making diagnosis possible at an early stage, but also because of the insufficiently effective treatment methods. High hopes are placed in targeted therapies, using agents such as angiogenesis inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors or anticancer vaccines. The aim of the work is to present the latest results of research on antiangiogenic drugs. Databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov were used. Antiangiogenic drugs are substances of various structure, the common feature of which is the influence on signaling pathways associated with such factors as VEGF, PDGF or Ang1 / 2. Bevacizumab is an antibody directed against VEGF-A. It is the first anti-angiogenic drug with proven efficacy, expressed in the extension of overall survival. This was demonstrated both in the group of patients with newly diagnosed advanced disease and in the situation of relapse. Other anti-angiogenic agents, such as trebananib, nintedanib or pazopanib, currently have not been proven to possess comparably high efficacy in the treatment of ovarian cancer. There are no known causes of disease progression despite maintenance therapy. The potential for combining bevacizumab with other targeted drugs such as PD-L1 inhibitors is currently being investigated.",1,0,0,29
3,30686987,Shared and Distinct Neural Bases of Large- and Small-Scale Spatial Ability: A Coordinate-Based Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Spatial ability is vital for human survival and development. However, the relationship between large-scale and small-scale spatial ability remains poorly understood. To address this issue from a novel perspective, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies to determine the shared and distinct neural bases of these two forms of spatial ability. Methods: We searched Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar for studies regarding spatial ability published within the last 20 years (January 1988 through June 2018). A final total of 103 studies (Table 1) involving 2,085 participants (male = 1,116) and 2,586 foci were incorporated into the meta-analysis. Results: Large-scale spatial ability was associated with activation in the limbic lobe, posterior lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, right anterior lobe, frontal lobe, and right sub-lobar area. Small-scale spatial ability was associated with activation in the parietal lobe, occipital lobe, frontal lobe, right posterior lobe, and left sub-lobar area. Furthermore, conjunction analysis revealed overlapping regions in the sub-gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, right superior parietal lobule, right middle occipital gyrus, right superior occipital gyrus, left inferior occipital gyrus, and precuneus. The contrast analysis demonstrated that the parahippocampal gyrus, left lingual gyrus, culmen, right middle temporal gyrus, left declive, left superior occipital gyrus, and right lentiform nucleus were more strongly activated during large-scale spatial tasks. In contrast, the precuneus, right inferior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, left supramarginal gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, right inferior occipital gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus were more strongly activated during small-scale spatial tasks. Our results further indicated that there is no absolute difference in the cognitive strategies associated with the two forms of spatial ability (egocentric/allocentric). Conclusion: The results of the present study verify and expand upon the theoretical model of spatial ability proposed by Hegarty et al. Our analysis revealed a shared neural basis between large- and small-scale spatial abilities, as well as specific yet independent neural bases underlying each. Based on these findings, we proposed a more comprehensive version of the behavioral model.",1,0,0,30
12,30705884,Panax ginseng for Frailty-Related Disorders: A Review.,"This review aims to understand the clinical efficacy of Panax ginseng (PG) for managing frailty-related disorders by reviewing meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized clinical trial data. PG is widely used in traditional medicine, mainly in East Asia. It has traditionally been indicated for the collapse of qi or for abandoned conditions that manifest as shallow breathing, shortness of breath, cold limbs, profuse sweating, a low pulse rate, or weakness. In accordance with these indications, PG is used for managing conditions such as aging, inflammation, and cancer. PG is also used in some functional foods or supplements. Some studies have shown the effects of ginsenosides, which are the major constituents of PG. With regard to pharmacological activities of ginseng saponins, it has been presumed that these ginsenosides are metabolized into active forms by human intestinal microbiota after being taken orally. Therefore, we focused on reviewing the data of clinical studies on PG. Although there has been no study that directly investigated the effect of PG on frailty, a number of clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of PG and its interactions with other modern ginseng medications and ginseng-containing formulas. We searched the randomized controlled trial data from 1995 to 2018 and reviewed the potential effects of PG on frailty-related disorders. We reviewed the effects of PG on glucose metabolism, fatigue, hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal function, cognitive function, and immune function. Our review showed some evidence for the usefulness of ginseng, which suggests that it has the potential to be used for the management of aging-related and frailty symptoms, such as fatigue and hypertension. The main limitation of this review is that no study has directly investigated the effect of PG on frailty. Instead we investigated frailty-related disorders, and the limitations of the available studies were small sample sizes and a poor methodological quality; besides, only a few studies targeted elderly people, and few included placebo controls. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to determine the effect of PG on frailty in the future.",1,0,0,31
