30687151	Psychosocial and Neurocognitive Factors Associated With Hepatitis C - Implications for Future Health and Wellbeing.	Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection involves changes not only from the point of view of physical health, but also emotional, and social that have a significant impact on the quality of life of these patients. According to the literature review, it seems that there is an important association between psychosocial factors, in particular on a cognitive level and disease progression. The aim of this mini-review is to summarize recent literature looking at the associations between psychosocial and neurocognitive factors and HCV. Methods: PubMed/Medline was systematically searched for psychosocial and neurocognitive factors associated with hepatitis C, treatment adherence, and patient wellbeing. Results: Patients present with a range of extrahepatic symptoms including fatigue, anxiety, depression, and neurocognitive dysfunction. HCV's impact on quality of life and wellbeing has serious clinical and social implications. Conclusion: Hepatitis C and its management continue to have a profound impact on health and psychologic wellbeing. Considering the serious extrahepatic implications for individuals, it is imperative that healthcare professionals pay close attention to psychosocial and neurocognitive factors. The focus on combined clinical approaches could enhance understanding about the health and social impacts of hepatitis C along the life course.	0	1
30687173	Psychosocial Suicide Prevention Interventions in the Elderly: A Mini-Review of the Literature.	In Europe the elderly population is projected to increase from 18.5% (93.9 million) in 2014 to 28.7% (149.1 million) by 2080. In the United States it is estimated that by 2030 more than 20% of the population will be aged 65 years or over. This specific population is at high risk of unrecognized or untreated psychiatric illnesses and suicide. It is well known that completed suicide rate increases with age in both men and women. Although elderly people attempt suicide less often than other age groups, they show a higher completion rate. Generally, the methods chosen by elderly are more lethal, the intent is more serious, they are more determined, and they show fewer warning signs than the younger population. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of psychosocial intervention, following self-harm in adults, found that cognitive behavioral therapy was the most effective therapy in these patients. Unfortunately, there have been few reported trials of other potentially effective interventions. Because the scientific literature on psychosocial suicide prevention interventions in the elderly is still scant, we conducted a mini-review in order to take stock of the situation. Studies were identified through electronic searches of the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, Scopus and the Web of Science databases. PRISMA guidelines were followed and only seven articles met the inclusion criteria. No firm conclusions can be drawn about this topic because there is still very little data and studies use inconsistent outcome measures and designs. Nonetheless, the existing data suggests that psychosocial interventions are promising.	1	0
30697170	Putative Role of Respiratory Muscle Training to Improve Endurance Performance in Hypoxia: A Review.	Respiratory/inspiratory muscle training (RMT/IMT) has been proposed to improve the endurance performance of athletes in normoxia. In recent years, due to the increased use of hypoxic training method among athletes, the RMT applicability has also been tested as a method to minimize adverse effects since hyperventilation may cause respiratory muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise in hypoxia. We performed a review in order to determine factors potentially affecting the change in endurance performance in hypoxia after RMT in healthy subjects. A comprehensive search was done in the electronic databases MEDLINE and Google Scholar including keywords: RMT/IMT, and/or endurance performance, and/or altitude and/or hypoxia. Seven appropriate studies were found until April 2018. Analysis of the studies showed that two RMT methods were used in the protocols: respiratory muscle endurance (RME) (isocapnic hyperpnea: commonly 10-30', 3-5 d/week) in three of the seven studies, and respiratory muscle strength (RMS) (Powerbreathe device: commonly 2 × 30 reps at 50% MIP (maximal inspiratory pressure), 5-7 d/week) in the remaining four studies. The duration of the protocols ranged from 4 to 8 weeks, and it was found in synthesis that during exercise in hypoxia, RMT promoted (1) reduced respiratory muscle fatigue, (2) delayed respiratory muscle metaboreflex activation, (3) better maintenance of SaO2 and blood flow to locomotor muscles. In general, no increases of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) were described. Ventilatory function improvements (maximal inspiratory pressure) achieved by using RMT fostered the capacity to adapt to hypoxia and minimized the impact of respiratory stress during the acclimatization stage in comparison with placebo/sham. In conclusion, RMT was found to elicit general positive effects mainly on respiratory efficiency and breathing patterns, lower dyspneic perceptions and improved physical performance in conditions of hypoxia. Thus, this method is recommended to be used as a pre-exposure tool for strengthening respiratory muscles and minimizing the adverse effects caused by hypoxia related hyperventilation. Future studies will assess these effects in elite athletes.	1	0
30729031	IgG4-related diseases: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines.	Immunoglobulin G4-related diseases (IgG4-RD) are a group of chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory conditions, characterised by tissue infiltration with lymphocytes and IgG4-secreting plasma cells, fibrosis and a usually favourable response to steroids. In this narrative review, we summarise the results of a systematic literature research, which was performed as part of the European Reference Network ReCONNET, aimed at evaluating existing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and recommendations in IgG4-RD. From 167 publications initially obtained from a systematic literature search, only one was identified as a systematic multispecialist, evidence-based, consensus guidance statement on diagnosis and treatment of IgG4-RD, which may be recommended for use as CPG in IgG4-RD. With the recognition of a limited evidence based in this increasingly recognised disease, the group discussion has identified the following unmet needs: lack of shared classification criteria, absence of formal guidelines on diagnosis, no evidence-based therapeutic recommendations and lack of activity and damage indices. Areas of unmet needs include the difficulties in diagnosis, management and monitoring and the scarcity of expert centres.	1	0
31093204	Health and other impacts of community food production in Small Island Developing States: a systematic scoping review.	To explore what is known on community-based food production initiatives (CFPIs) in Small Island Developing States, particularly the health, social, economic, and environmental impacts of and on CFPIs. This was a systematic scoping review using 14 electronic databases to identify articles published from 1997 to 2016 on the topic of CFPIs in Small Island Developing States. From 8 215 articles found, 153 were eligible and abstracted. Analysis focused on geographic location, typology, methodology, study design, theoretical frameworks, and impacts. Most research was conducted in the Pacific or Caribbean (49% and 43% of studies, respectively) and primarily focused on fishing and crop farming (40%, 34%). Findings indicate a predominance of research focusing on the environmental impact of marine and coastal resources on CFPIs, and very limited evidence of CFPI impact on human health, particularly nutrition and diet-related outcomes. There was a lack of explicit theoretical frameworks to explain the impacts of CFPIs. Evidence of impacts of CPFIs in Small Island Developing States is limited and the approaches taken are inconsistent. This review demonstrates the need and provides a basis for developing a coherent body of methods to examine the impacts of CFPIs and provide evidence to guide policy, especially as it relates to health. Explorar las iniciativas de producción de alimentos basadas en la comunidad (CFPI, por sus siglas en inglés) en los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo, en particular su impacto sanitario, social, económico y ambiental. Se realizó una revisión sistemática exploratoria usando 14 bases de datos electrónicas para identificar artículos publicados entre 1997 y 2016 sobre las CFPI en los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo. De 8 215 artículos encontrados, 153 fueron elegibles y resumidos. El análisis se centró en la ubicación geográfica, el tipo de iniciativa, la metodología, el diseño del estudio, el marco teórico y el impacto. La mayoría de las investigaciones se realizaron en el Pacífico o el Caribe (49% y 43% de los estudios, respectivamente) y se centraron principalmente en la pesca y el cultivo (40%, 34%). Los hallazgos indican un predominio de investigaciones centradas en el impacto ambiental de los recursos marinos y costeros en las CFPI, y una evidencia muy limitada del impacto de las CFPI en la salud humana, en particular en resultados relacionados con la nutrición y la dieta. Faltan marcos teóricos explícitos para explicar el impacto de las CFPI. La evidencia del impacto de las CPFI en los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo es limitada y los enfoques adoptados son inconsistentes. Esta revisión demuestra la necesidad de efectuar estudios y proporciona una base para desarrollar métodos coherentes para examinar el impacto de las CFPI y proporcionar evidencia para guiar las políticas, especialmente las relacionadas con la salud.

32754669	ANAMT Technical Guideline (DT 05): prevention of occupational low back pain through back belts, lumbar support or braces.	Low back pain is a considerable global public health problem. Use of back belts in occupational settings arises from the expectation of countless biomechanical benefits, which together would contribute to the prevention of this problem. To orient students, physicians and health institutions on the use of back belts, lumbar support or braces for prevention of low back pain or injury among asymptomatic workers. The present guideline was developed based on a systematic literature review; 809 studies were located in database MEDLINE and 571 in EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL. Evaluating back-belt use as preventive intervention against low back pain demands quantifying benefits, harms and difficulties to implementation, as well as the methodological quality of primary studies. Despite the weak benefits reflected in the individual, partial and isolated results of a few studies, there is no consistent evidence for the use of back belts, lumbar supports or braces for primary prevention of low back pain or occupational low back injury among workers. According to the available evidence, back-belt use is not associated with reduction of absenteeism. Lombalgia é um problema internacional importante de saúde pública. O uso de cinta lombar no meio ocupacional emerge da expectativa de inúmeros benefícios bio-mecânicos que, em conjunto, promoveriam a prevenção desse problema. Orientar estudantes, médicos e estabelecimentos de saúde sobre o uso de cinta lombar, suporte ou órtese lombar como prevenção da lombalgia ou de lesões lombares em trabalhadores sem sintomatologia atual. Ela foi desenvolvida a partir da revisão sistemática da literatura: da base de dados MEDLINE, foram recuperados 809 trabalhos e das bases EMBASE e Central Cochrane, 571. Avaliar a cinta lombar como intervenção preventiva de lombalgia envolve a quantificação de benefícios, malefícios e facilidade de sua implementação, assim como a qualidade metodológica dos estudos primários. Apesar do benefício demonstrado fracamente em resultados individuais, parciais e isolados em poucos estudos, não há evidência consistente que sustente a utilização de cinta lombar, suporte ou órtese lombar na prevenção primária da lombalgia ou de lesões lombares ocupacionais em trabalhadores. As evidências, agrupadas, apontam para ausência de redução de absenteísmo com o uso da cinta lombar.	1	0
