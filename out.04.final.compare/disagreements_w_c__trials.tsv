30675151	Acute Exercise as an Intervention to Trigger Motor Performance and EEG Beta Activity in Older Adults.	Acute bouts of exercise have been shown to improve fine motor control performance and to facilitate motor memory consolidation processes in young adults. Exercise effects might be reflected in EEG task-related power (TRPow) decreases in the beta band (13-30 Hz) as an indicator of active motor processing. This study aimed to investigate those effects in healthy older adults. Thirty-eight participants (65-74 years of age) were assigned to an experimental (EG, acute exercise) or a control group (CG, rest). Fine motor control was assessed using a precision grip force modulation (FM) task. FM performance and EEG were measured at (1) baseline (immediately before acute exercise/rest), (2) during practice sessions immediately after, (3) 30 minutes, and (4) 24 hours (FM only) after exercise/rest. A marginal significant effect indicated that EG revealed more improvement in fine motor performance immediately after exercise than CG after resting. EG showed enhanced consolidation of short-term and long-term motor memory, whereas CG revealed only a tendency for short-term motor memory consolidation. Stronger TRPow decreases were revealed immediately after exercise in the contralateral frontal brain area as compared to the control condition. This finding indicates that acute exercise might enhance cortical activation and thus, improves fine motor control by enabling healthy older adults to better utilize existing frontal brain capacities during fine motor control tasks after exercise. Furthermore, acute exercise can act as a possible intervention to enhance motor memory consolidation in older adults.	1	0
30687193	Attention Improves During Physical Exercise in Individuals With ADHD.	The present study examined the effects of physical exercise on attentional processes in individuals diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), compared to healthy controls. Unlike previous studies typically comparing performance on baseline measures with post-exercise performance, this study examined the effects of physical exercise on attention while participants were engaged in a continuous performance task. Fourteen individuals diagnosed with ADHD (71% females, mean age = 24.8) and 17 controls (76% females, mean age = 22.6) completed the Conners Continuous Auditory Test of Attention (CATA). All participants completed the test twice, at baseline in a sitting position and while walking on the treadmill at a speed of 5 km/h. The order of administration was counterbalanced for each group. A 2 × 2 ANOVA with repeated measures detected a group by activity interaction on several measures of the CATA. Specifically, compared to baseline, the ADHD group demonstrated faster reaction times during physical exercise (25.4 ms faster) and decreased omission errors (1.5% better), whereas controls showed the opposite pattern (15.9 ms slower and 0.88% worse, respectively). Importantly, the ADHD group's overall relatively lower performance on these measures was only evident in the resting condition, attaining scores similar to controls during exercise. These results suggest a possibly hypoactive attentional system in ADHD that could potentially be enhanced by arousal through engagement in physical exercise.	0	1
30693828	Outcome of children with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and single-system involvement: A retrospective study at a single center in Shanghai, China.	This is a descriptive review of the clinical patterns and outcomes of children with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and single-system involvement (SS-LCH) treated at Shanghai Children's Medical Center. 60 evaluable newly diagnosed patients (37 boys, 23 girls) with a median age of 3.9 years (range: 0.3-15.3 years) and histiopathology-confirmed SS-LCH were enrolled from 2010 to 2014. All patients received systemic chemotherapy using either the DAL HX-83 or LCH-II protocol as determined by the physician. Bone was the most frequently affected organ (56/60, 93.3%). Of the 56 patients suffering from SS-bone disease, 35 (62.5%) had unifocal disease and 21 (37.5%) had multifocal disease. CNS-risk lesions were seen in nine patients (16.1%, 9/56) at diagnosis. Thirty-two patients were treated with the LCH-II protocol and 28 received the DAL HX-83 protocol. No patient received intralesional steroid injection at the time of surgery. CNS-risk lesion correlated with an inferior event-free survival (EFS) for patients with bone disease (62.5 ± 17.1% vs. 90.7 ± 4.5%; p = 0.039). The difference in the 5-year EFS between patients with unifocal and multifocal SS-bone LCH did not reach the statistical significance (93.8 ± 4.3% vs. 75.0 ± 9.7%; p = 0.074). No deaths were observed, leading to a 5-year OS of 100% in the present cohort of patients. Permanent consequences and secondary malignancies were not observed but were also limited by short follow-up. Optimal therapy for patients with SS-bone LCH has not been established. Less toxic therapeutic approaches should be considered for these patients and tested in prospective trials.	0	1
30705885	Preservation of Ejaculatory Function After Postchemotherapy Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection (PC-RPLND) in Patients With Testicular Cancer: Template vs. Bilateral Resection.	Background: Post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) plays a crucial role in treatment of metastatic non-seminomatous germ cell cancer. Objective: To evaluate the functional outcome regarding the preservation of ejaculatory function comparing a bilateral vs. unilateral template resection in PC-RPLND patients. In addition, oncological safety and perioperative complications of the unilateral template resection was compared to the full bilateral one. Design/Setting/Participants: Between 2003 and 2018, 504 RPLNDs have been performed in 434 patients. The database of consecutive patients was queried to identify 171 patients with PC-RPLND after 1st line chemotherapy for a non-seminoma with or without bilateral template resection. Re-Do's, late relapse, salvage patients, and thoraco-abdominal approaches were excluded. Indication for a template resection was a unilateral residual mass mainly <5 cm as published (1). Outcome, Measurement, and Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics were used to report preoperative features, postoperative outcomes and patterns of recurrence, on the overall population and after stratification for the type of resection (bilateral vs. unilateral). Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to describe recurrence- and cancer-specific mortality-free survival rates at different time points. Results and Limitations: Overall, 90 and 81 patients underwent unilateral and bilateral radical resection, respectively. Median size of residual mass was 7 cm for bilateral and 4 cm for unilateral template resection. Clinical stage II and III were present in 31 and 69% of patients, respectively. Median follow-up was 14.5 months (IQR 3.3-37.6). The 1- and 2-year recurrence-free survival rates were 91 and 91%, and 77 and 72% for patients treated with unilateral template and bilateral resection, respectively (p = 0.0078). Median time to recurrence was 9.5 and 9 months in template and bilateral resection group, respectively. Adjunctive procedures were performed in 56 patients (33%) and were significantly more frequent in the bilateral resection group (43 vs. 23%, p = 0.006). The overall high-grade complication rate (Clavien-Dindo ≥ III) was 6, 3, and 9% in unilateral template and bilateral resection group, respectively (p = 0.6). The rate of preservation of antegrade ejaculation was significantly higher in the unilateral group. Conclusions: Antegrade ejaculation in patients undergoing unilateral template resection with a residual mass <5 cm can be preserved at a much higher rate. Moreover, this surgical procedure is oncologically safe in terms of mid-term recurrence and CSM-free survival rates. This data undermines the growing evidence of limited PC-RPLND being justifiable in strictly unilateral residual mass <5 cm. This data has to be confirmed with a longer follow-up regarding in-field and retroperitoneal recurrences.	0	1
30714388	Promoting resilience through neurocognitive functioning in youth living with HIV.	Using a phased model of intervention development, we developed an intervention to promote resilience in youth living with HIV via improved neurocognitive resources. First, youth completed a naturalistic prospective memory (PM) task and were randomized into a visualization condition or control condition. Next, 47 of these participants completed another naturalistic PM task and were randomized into Calendaring condition, an Alarm condition, a Combined condition, or a Control condition. Youth with low PM demonstrated observable gains from the visualization technique. Youth in the Combined Calendaring and Alarm condition demonstrated significantly better performance than participants in the Control and Calendaring conditions. In a Proof-of-Concept study with 16 youth, the previous findings were translated into a single session in-person intervention followed by tailored text messaging to improve adherence and viral load via improved neurocognitive resources. The resulting intervention showed a signal of effect with viral load reductions in youth with available data. Targeting compensatory strategies to enhance neurocognitive functioning may promote resilience and health outcomes. A randomized pilot study with a control condition is the next step.	1	0
30721200	[Clinical and functional results of bifocal IOLs implanted during combined cataract and glaucoma surgery].	At present, implantation of multifocal IOLs in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) remains questionable. To comparatively analyze the clinical and functional effectiveness of bifocal IOLs implanted during combined cataract and glaucoma surgery. The prospective study included 41 patients (75 eyes) with presbyopia and POAG who underwent one-stage cataract phacoemulsification with implantation of a multifocal IOL and non-penetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) with lens capsule. Group 1 included 24 patients (44 eyes) with implantation of diffractive-refractive IOL. Group 2 consisted of 17 patients (31 eyes) who were implanted aspheric diffractive IOL with asymmetric optics. Mean IOP in both groups was 18.1±2.9 mmHg, and the difference with the preoperative parameters (26.1±2.8) was statistically significant (p<0.05). On average, the patients received 1.3±0.5 antihypertensive drugs compared to 2.4±0.61 before surgery (0.05<p<0.1). Near uncorrected visual acuity (nUCVA) in group 1 was 0.51±0.12 (p=0.009), in group 2 - 0.53±0.1 (p=0.01). Distant uncorrected visual acuity (dUCVA) was 0.59±0.09 (p=0.043) In group 1, and 0.57±0.04 (p=0.021) in group 2. Near best corrected visual acuity (nBCVA) in group 1 was 0.64±0.07, and 0.64±0.09 in group 2. In all studied groups postoperative nBCVA after 1 year of observation was significantly higher than before the surgery (p=0.006 and p=0.009 respectively). The main study goal (dBCVA=1.0 at 1 year after surgery) was achieved in 31.8% of cases in group 1 and in 29.1% of cases in group 2 (p>0.1). Implantation of multifocal IOLs in combination cataract and glaucoma surgery is a safe and effective surgical intervention for the described group of patients. В настоящее время остается дискутабельным вопрос о целесообразности имплантации мультифокальной интраокулярной линзы (ИОЛ) у пациентов с первичной открытоугольной глаукомой (ПОУГ). Цель - сравнительный анализ клинико-функциональных результатов имплантации бифокальных ИОЛ в ходе комбинированной хирургии катаракты и глаукомы. Материал и методы. В проспективное открытое исследование вошел 41 пациент (75 глаз) с пресбиопией и ПОУГ, которым проведена одномоментная факоэмульсификация катаракты с имплантацией мультифокальных ИОЛ и непроникающей глубокой склерэктомией с дренированием собственной капсулой хрусталика. В 1-ю группу вошли 24 пациента (44 глаза) с имплантацией дифракционно-рефракционной ИОЛ, во 2-ю - 17 пациентов (31 глаз), которым имплантировали дифракционную асферичную ИОЛ с асимметричной оптикой. Результаты. Средний уровень внутриглазного давления (ВГД) в обеих группах составил 18,1±2,9 мм рт.ст., при этом разница с дооперационными показателями (26,1±2,8 мм рт.ст.) была статистически значима (p<0,05). В среднем пациенты принимали 1,3±0,5 гипотензивных препаратов по сравнению с 2,4±0,61 до операции (0,05<p<0,1). Некорригированная острота зрения вблизи (НКОЗб) в 1-й группе составила 0,51±0,12 (p=0,009), во 2-й - 0,53±0,1 (p=0,01). В 1-й группе НКОЗ вдаль (НКОЗд) составила 0,59±0,09 (p=0,043), во 2-й - 0,57±0,04 (p=0,021). Максимально корригированная острота зрения вблизи (МКОЗб) в 1-й группе составила 0,64±0,07, во 2-й - 0,64±0,09. Во всех исследуемых группах послеоперационная МКОЗб через 1 год наблюдений была значимо выше, чем до операции (p=0,006 и p=0,009 соответственно). Заключение. Основной конечный показатель исследования (МКОЗд=1,0 через 1 год после операции) достигнут в 31,8% случаев в 1-й группе и в 29,1% случаев - во 2-й (p>0,1). Имплантация мультифокальных ИОЛ в ходе комбинированной хирургии катаракты и глаукомы относится к безопасным и эффективным вмешательствам у данной категории пациентов.	0	1
30723421	Primary Clinical Evaluation of Photodynamic Therapy With Oral Leukoplakia in Chinese Patients.	Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has demonstrated promising results in the treatment of oral leukoplakia. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy and side effects of PDT in the treatment of Chinese patients with oral leukoplakia. Methods: Twenty-nine patients with oral leukoplakia were enrolled in this study, including patients with both homogenous and non-homogenous lesions and various dysplastic tissues. All patients received PDT using a 632 nm laser at 500 mW/cm2 power density at a dosage of 90-180 J/cm2 and with aminolevulinic acid (ALA) used as a photosensitizer. A fixing and restricting complex as well as high laser power density for PDT in oral cavity was applied. Results: An overall response rate of 86.2% was achieved in this study, including 55.2% complete remission and 31.0% partial remission. The only adverse events observed in subjects were transient local ulcer and pain. It is observed the PDT utilizing ALA showed strong effectiveness in patients with moderate to severe dysplasia, as less treatment time per cm2 of lesion is required. Conclusion: Topic ALA-PDT is effective to treat oral leukoplakia, especially for that with the presence of dysplasia. A fixing and restricting complex as well as high laser power density for PDT in oral cavity should be considered as an optimal choice.	1	0
30737921	[Chemotherapy in colon cancer].	The aim of the study is to improve the overall survival rates of patients with colon cancer, analyzing the results of chemotherapy in municipal institution «Precarpathian Clinical Oncology Center» and determining the appropriate scheme of chemotherapy in correlation with the stage of the disease. Materials and methods: The basis of the study was the results of the observation of 973 patients with colon cancer (CC). The direct and long-term results of chemotherapy of colon cancer were studied and evaluated. All patients were divided according to the stage of the disease (TNM system). Patients with Stage II, III and IV colon cancer were included into the study. Within each stage of CC patients were divided into groups, depending on the received chemotherapy (FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, XELOX, Mejo, or phthorafurum). The overall survival rate of patients was determined within each stages of colon cancer, the treatment received and the total number of patients. Results: In patients with Stage IV CC, FOLFIRI and FOLFOX prevailed in chemotherapy - 40.7& and 37.3& respectively. 8.5& of patients received XELOX and 6.8& of patients received Mejo. The same percentage of patients received monotherapy with phthorafurum. In chemotherapy most of the patients with Stage III CC received FOLFOX - 42.9&, FOLFIRI and Mejo- 18.1& and 27.6& of patients respectively. Another 10.5& of patients received mono-chemotherapy with phthorafurum. In chemotherapy of patients with Stage II CC, most patients received Mejo and mono-chemotherapy with phthorafurum.- 28.8& and 32.2& of patients. FOLFOX was received by 18.4& of patients, FOLFIRI - by 13.8&, and XELOX - by 5.9& of patients. Conclusions: In patients with Stage II CC Mejo was the most effective PCT scheme - the highest percentage of patients who survived in a 5- year observation. In patients with StageIII CC, the same index is the best in the group of patients who received FOLFOX. In patients with Stage IV CC FOLFIRI was the most effective (the highest percentage of patients who survived) in a one-, two- and three-year observation.	0	1
30739891	Research Advocacy Training Program Benefits Diverse Older Adults in Participation, Self-Efficacy and Attitudes toward Research.	Developing a Research Participation Enhancement and Advocacy Training Program for Diverse Seniors (DREAMS) is a two-part health education (part 1 [DP1]) and research advocacy training (part 2 [DP2]) program grounded in CBPR principles designed to address underrepresentation of socioeconomically disadvantaged and/or minority older adults in research. We examine the effects of DREAMS on health literacy, psychosocial function, beliefs/attitudes toward research, and self-efficacy in diverse older adults age 65 and older who completed only part 1 of DREAMS (n = 51) versus those who completed both parts 1 and 2 (DREAMS Team [DT]; n = 24). We hypothesized that benefits would be observed in both groups, with greater benefits seen among DT completers versus those who completed only part 1. Participants completed pre- and post-course questionnaires, including a satisfaction survey. DREAMS versus DT data were analyzed and compared using t tests, χ2 tests, analyses of variance/repeated measures analyses of variance, and Mann-Whitney U tests as appropriate. Themes were identified from open-ended survey questions and provide context for quantitative data. Findings showed significant group × time interaction in depression, participation/autonomy, and physical composite scores as well as trends toward improved attitudes toward research participation (P = .07), decreased depression (P &lt; .001), and increased participation (P = .03) of the DT group. Results from the satisfaction questionnaire indicated that both programs were well-received. Findings provide strong evidence of DREAMS and particularly the DT's success in achieving our key objectives.	0	1
30740067	Decision-Making Deficits Are Associated With Learning Impairments in Female College Students at High Risk for Anorexia Nervosa: Iowa Gambling Task and Prospect Valence Learning Model.	This study investigated deficits in decision-making ability in female college students at high risk for anorexia nervosa (AN) using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the prospect valence learning (PVL) model. Based on scores on the Korean version of the Eating Attitude Test-26 (KEAT-26), participants were assigned to either the high risk for AN group (n = 42) or the control group (n = 43). The high risk for AN group exhibited significantly lower total net scores and block net scores on the third, fourth, and fifth blocks of the IGT than the control group did. The high risk for AN group selected cards significantly more often from the disadvantageous A and B decks and less often from the advantageous D deck than the control group did. In addition, the block net scores of the high risk for AN group did not differ across the five blocks, whereas those of the control group increased as the trials progressed. There was a significant negative correlation between IGT total net score and total score on the KEAT-26. The high risk for AN group had significantly lower values than the control group on the learning and response consistency parameters of the PVL model. These results indicate that female college students at high risk for AN have deficits in decision-making ability, and that these deficits are related to difficulties in remembering experience obtained from earlier trials and applying it to later trials. These difficulties further lead them to make decisions randomly.	1	0
30760189	Real World Patient-reported Outcomes in HIV-infected Adults Switching to EVIPLERA®, Because of a Previous Intolerance to cART. PRO-STR Study.	To investigate the impact of switching from stable Combined Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) to single-tablet regimen (RPV/FTC/TDF=EVIPLERA® /COMPLERA®) on patient- reported outcomes in HIV-infected adults who cannot tolerate previous cART, in a real-world setting. PRO-STR is a 48-week observational, prospective, multicenter study. Presence and magnitude of symptoms (main endpoint), health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), adherence, satisfaction with treatment and patient preferences were assessed. Three hundred patients with 48-week follow-up, who switched to EVIPLERA® (mean age: 46.6 years; male: 74.0%; 74.7% switched from a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase-inhibitor, 25.3% from a protease inhibitor + ritonavir) were included. There was no statistical difference in median CD4+ cell count (baseline: 678.5 cells/mm3; 48-week: 683.0 cells/mm3) neither in virological suppression (≤50 copies/mL) (baseline: 98.3%; 48-week: 95.3%). The most frequent reasons for switching were neuropsychiatric (62.3%), gastrointestinal (19.3%) and biochemical/metabolic (19.3%) events. Only 7.7% of patients permanently discontinued therapy. At 48-week, all outcomes showed an improvement compared to baseline. Overall, there was a significant decrease (pvalue≤ 0.05) in number and magnitude of symptoms, while HRQoL, satisfaction and adherence improved significantly. Most patients prefered EVIPLERA® than previous cART. According to the type of intolerance, HRQoL was improved, but only significantly in patients with neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms. Adherence improved significantly in patients with metabolic disturbances and satisfaction with EVIPLERA® was higher in the three groups. Switching to EVIPLERA® from non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase-inhibitor or protease inhibitor-based regimens due to toxicity, improved the presence/magnitude of symptoms, HRQoL, and preference with treatment. EVIPLERA® maintained a virological response, CD4+ cell count and maintained or improved adherence.	0	1
30775609	Influence of internal mammary artery retractor on postoperative patient comfort and quality of life.	Patients experience muscle, joint and shoulder pain after heart surgery. We aimed to compare quality of life in 2 groups of patients, one group having an internal mammary artery (IMA) retractor during surgery, the second group undergoing non-coronary heart surgery. Group 1 was composed of 39 patients receiving an IMA retractor whereas in group 2 there were 29 patients. Patients in groups were compared for postoperative quality of life, shoulder pain, functional status, strength and patient satisfaction. Visual analog scale (VAS) assessment, pain localization, quality of life SF-36 form, and University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) functional shoulder scoring were applied in both groups. Mean VAS score in group 1 was significantly higher than in group 2. Only the vitality measure mean score was not significantly different in SF-36 assessment; however, in group 2 physical function and mental health scale mean scores were higher and the pain scale mean score was lower than in group 1. The total UCLA score and UCLA subgroups of pain, function, active flexion angle and strength revealed a statistically significant difference between groups. Patients in whom an IMA retractor was not utilized during surgery exhibited better results in physical functions, emotional status, and shoulder pain in the postoperative period.	0	1
30778398	Treatment Effects following Residential Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Adolescents with Borderline Personality Disorder.	Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an empirically supported treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD) in adults, however fewer studies have examined outcomes in adolescents. This study tested the effectiveness of an intensive 1-month, residential DBT treatment for adolescent girls meeting criteria for BPD. Additionally, given well-established associations between BPD symptoms and childhood abuse, the impact of abuse on treatment outcomes was assessed. Participants were female youth (n = 53) aged 13-20 years (M = 17.00, SD = 1.89) completing a 1-month residential DBT program. At pre-treatment, participants were administered a diagnostic interview and self-report measures assessing BPD, depression, and anxiety symptom severity. Following one month of treatment, participants were re-administered the self-report instruments. Results showed significant pre- to post-treatment reductions in both BPD and depression symptom severity with large effects. However, there was no significant change in general anxious distress or anxious arousal over time. The experience of childhood abuse (sexual, physical, or both) was tested as moderator of treatment effectiveness. Although experiencing multiple types of abuse was related to symptom severity, abuse did not moderate the effects of treatment. Collectively, results indicate that a 1-month residential DBT treatment with adolescents may result in reductions in BPD and depression severity but is less effective for anxiety. Moreover, while youth reporting abuse benefitted from treatment, they were less likely to achieve a clinically significant reduction in symptoms.	0	1
30839859	Treatment for HIV prevention study in southwestern areas of China.	China has ambitious to achieve significant reductions in HIV transmission and HIV-related mortality by adopting the World Health Organization's Treat All approach. Such a prevention strategy is needed future study on regional scale. An observational cohort study of HIV epidemiology and treatment databases was used to study the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy on the transmission of HIV in serodiscordant couples in Guangxi of China. A total of 7713 couples were entered into the cohort study analysis which included 1885 couples in the treatment-naive cohort and 5828 couples in the treated cohort. During the follow-up of 18985.29 person-years from 2003 to 2014, the average incidence of HIV was 2.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI 2.1-2.6). HIV seroincidence rate was significantly higher among the treatment naive group (4.2 per 100 person-years, 3.7-4.8) compared with the on treatment group (1.6 per 100 person-years, 1.3-1.8). An overall 45% reduction in risk of HIV transmission among serodiscordant couple was associated with ART treatment (adjusted Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.55, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.44-0.69). Treatment prevention had significantly effectiveness for most baseline characteristics of index partners, such as for male, female, age above 25 years, education below high school, farmer, infected by heterosexual intercourse. Treatment-as-prevention can be implemented in the real-world on a national or regional scale, but ART adherence and comprehensive harm reduction while implementing this strategy require further study.	0	1
30859156	The effects of short-term use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on bone metabolism in child cancer patients.	The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is the most commonly used hematopoietic growth factor recombinant DNA technology. It affects bone metabolism by modulating both osteoclast and osteoblast functions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of short-term use of G-CSF on bone metabolism in children with leukemia and solid tumors. Thirty-six patients with a malignancy who received G-CSF therapy according to chemotherapy protocols and another 20 growth factor-free cancer patients who were enrolled as controls were included in the study. The serum osteocalcin and urinary free deoxypyridinoline levels were measured before the start of G-CSF therapy, on day 3 after treatment, and 7 days after G-CSF therapy was discontinued. In the control group, the measurements were made during corticosteroid and methotrexate-free chemotherapy. The mean osteocalcin level (8.6±2.3 ng/mL) from before the onset of treatment decreased significantly (7.7±2.3 ng/mL) on day 3 of G-CSF therapy and significantly increased after 7 days of G-CSF therapy (7.9±2.2 ng/mL) (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively), which was still significantly lower than the pre-G-CSF values (p<0.001). The urinary free deoxypyridinoline level significantly increased on day 3 of G-CSF treatment (25.6±6.5 nmol/mmol Cr) and significantly decreased after 7 days of G-CSF therapy (22.6±6.4 nmol/mmol Cr) (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively), which was still significantly higher than the values recorded before G-CSF therapy (p<0.001). The findings show that the short-term use of G-CSF in children with cancer can affect bone metabolism and can play a role in metabolic changes. Decreased osteoblastic activity and increased osteoclastic activity suggest that osteoporosis may be associated with bone pain in these patients.	0	1
31191954	Electrical stimulation devices for the prevention of venous thromboembolism: Preliminary studies of physiological efficacy and user satisfaction.	Electrical stimulation could provide an alternative method for preventing venous thromboembolism in stroke patients. The purpose of this preliminary study was to explore the effects of electrical stimulation and intermittent pneumatic compression on enhancing lower limb venous return in healthy and chronic stroke patients and also to evaluate patient and nurse satisfaction. We investigated the effectiveness of two electrical stimulation devices: Geko (Firstkind Ltd, High Wycombe, UK) and Orthopaedic Microstim 2V2 (Odstock Medical Ltd, Salisbury, UK); and one intermittent pneumatic compression device: Huntleigh Flowstron Universal (Huntleigh Healthcare Ltd, Cardiff, UK). We recruited 12 healthy and 5 chronic stroke participants. The devices were fitted sequentially, and Doppler ultrasound measurements were taken. Eight patients and nurses were also recruited for a separate usability evaluation. The electrical stimulation devices emulated the blood flow characteristics of intermittent pneumatic compression in both healthy and stroke participants provided that the intensity of electrical stimulation was sufficient. Patients and nurses also felt that the electrical stimulation devices were acceptable. Electrical stimulation may offer benefit as an alternative method for venous thromboembolism prevention in stroke patients. The apparent benefit is sufficient to warrant further investigation in a full powered randomised controlled trial.	1	0
31431966	An investigation of contextual factors in the application of multisensory illusions for analgesia in hand osteoarthritis.	Emerging evidence suggests that multisensory illusions can modulate pain and can lead to changes in body perception. The aim of this study was to investigate whether contextual factors could explain the analgesic effects of multisensory body illusions on pain and body perception in people with hand OA (HOA). In a crossover study, 28 individuals with painful HOA viewed their most affected hand in and outside of a real-time mediated reality system, with illusory stretching of the hand and changes in sensory input. The outcome measures were pain ratings, pressure pain thresholds, hand function and the subjective experience of the illusion. Stretching the hand both inside and outside the virtual environment led to a reduction in subjective pain ratings (all P < 0.05). Virtual stretching led to changes in body perception (P < 0.05) with no changes in pressure pain threshold (all P > 0.05). Higher pain at baseline predicted susceptibility to the stretch illusion and mean susceptibility ratings were greatest after the stretch illusion. The current study highlights the importance of the context in which pain occurs and in which potential treatments may be applied. In this case, virtual and physical stretching modulated pain, but not viewing the hand alone. The research opens important implications for future research, including the use of contextual control conditions and the development of visual feedback interventions for a range of similarly visible chronic conditions for which pain, body image disturbances and body dissatisfaction may be apparent.	1	0
