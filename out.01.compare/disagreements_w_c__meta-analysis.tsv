30686251	Efficacy and Safety of Addition of Anti-PD1 to Chemotherapy in Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	Patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have limited treatment options. A novel treatment based on programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors has emerged as promising therapeutic options for advanced NSCLC. We assessed oncological outcomes of PD-L1 antibody versus docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to analyse the oncological outcomes of anti-PD1 to chemotherapy in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. Overall survival (OR=0.68,95%CI=0.61-0.75, P<0.00001) and progression-free survival (OR=0.84,95%CI=0.77-0.92, P=0.0002) were longer with anti-PD1 than with docetaxel in NSCLC. Anti-PD1 was associated with even greater objective response rate than docetaxel (OR=1.61,95%CI=1.16-2.24, P=0.004). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3-5 did favor anti-PD1 over docetaxel (OR=0.21,95%CI=0.10-0.42, P<0.00001). Among patients with advanced NSCLC, we found that there was a superior survival benefit and with a favorable safety profile with anti-PD1 than with docetaxel. More large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to identify relevant biomarkers that have an effect on predicting the population that would most likely benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 for pretreated advanced NSCLC patients.	1	0
30687152	Primary Study Quality in Psychological Meta-Analyses: An Empirical Assessment of Recent Practice.	As meta-analytic research has come to occupy a sizeable contingent of published work in the psychological sciences, clarity in the reporting of such work is crucial to its interpretability and reproducibility. This is especially true regarding the assessment of primary study quality, as notions of study quality can vary across research domains. The present study examines the general state of reporting practices related to primary study quality in a sample of 382 published psychological meta-analyses, as well as the reporting decisions and motivations of the authors that published them. Our findings suggest adherence to reporting standards has remained poor for assessments of primary study quality and that the discipline remains inconsistent in its reporting practices generally. We discuss several potential reasons for the poor adherence to reporting standards in our sample, including whether quality assessments are being conducted in the first place, whether standards are well-known within the discipline, and the potential conflation of assessing primary study quality with other facets of conducting a meta-analysis. The implications of suboptimal reporting practices related to primary study quality are discussed.	0	1
30687237	Increased Risk of Thyroid Dysfunction Among Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.	Background: Thyroid dysfunction seems to be common among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, but the risk of thyroid dysfunction in RA has not been well-defined. Methods: We performed a case-control study of 65 RA patients and 550 matched non-RA subjects to assess the risk of thyroid dysfunction among Chinese RA patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis was also conducted to comprehensively define the relationship between RA and thyroid dysfunction. Results: The case-control study indicated that the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction was significantly higher in RA patients than controls (OR = 2.89, P < 0.001). Further subgroup analyses revealed positive correlations of RA with hypothyroidism (OR = 2.28, P = 0.006) and hyperthyroidism (OR = 8.95, P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed an independent association between RA and thyroid dysfunction (Adjusted OR = 2.89, 95%CI 1.63-5.12, P < 0.001). Meta-analysis of 15 independent studies also showed an obviously increased risk of thyroid dysfunction among RA patients (RR = 2.86, 95%CI 1.78-4.58, P < 0.001). Further subgroup analysis showed RA could obviously increase risk of hyperthyroidism (RR = 2.73, 95%CI 1.29-5.77, P = 0.043) and hypothyroidism (RR = 2.02, 95%CI 1.49-2.74, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study provides strong evidence for the increased risk of thyroid dysfunction among RA patients. Screening of thyroid dysfunction may be recommended for RA patients.	1	0
30705616	Relationship Between Alzheimer's Disease and the Immune System: A Meta-Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative diseases (neuro-diseases) which is prevalent in the elderly and seriously affects the lives of individuals. Many studies have discussed the relationship between immune system and AD pathogenesis. Here, the meta-analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes based on microarray data was conducted to study the association between AD and immune system. 9519 target genes of hippocampus in 146 subjects (73 AD cases and 73 controls) from 4 microarray data sets were compiled and DE genes with p < 1.00E - 04 were selected to conduct the pathway-analysis. The results indicated that the DE genes were significantly enriched in the neuro-diseases as well as the immune system pathways.	0	1
30740061	Comprehensive Analysis of the Association Between the rs1138272 Polymorphism of the GSTP1 Gene and Cancer Susceptibility.	Background: We obtained conflicting results regarding the relationship between the genetic role of the rs1138272 C/T polymorphism of the GSTP1 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi) gene and the risk of various cancers. Methods: Using the presently available data, a meta-analysis was conducted to comprehensively evaluate the genetic relationship between the GSTP1 rs1138272 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility. Results: A total of 43 studies including 15,688 cases and 17,143 controls were recruited into our quantitative synthesis. In the overall population, we observed an increased risk of overall cancer cases, compared with unrelated controls, in the genetic models of allele T vs. allele C (P-association = 0.007, OR = 1.17), carrier T vs. carrier C (P-association = 0.035, OR = 1.11), TT vs. CC (P-association = 0.002, OR = 1.45), TT vs. CC+CT (P-association = 0.009, OR = 1.42), and CT+TT vs. CC (P-association = 0.027, OR = 1.13). We detected similar positive results within the Asian population. Additionally, there was a significant increase in the incidence of cancer for Africans under all genetic models (all P-association < 0.05, OR > 1). When targeting the Caucasian population, we detected a positive association with the TT vs. CC and TT vs. CC+CT models in the Colorectal cancer (P-association < 0.05, OR < 1) and Head and neck cancer (P-association < 0.05, OR > 1) subgroups. For the Lung cancer subgroup, we observed a slightly increased risk in Caucasians under the models of allele T vs. allele C, carrier T vs. carrier C, CT vs. CC, and CT+TT vs. CC (P-association < 0.05, OR > 1). Conclusion: The TT genotype of the GSTP1 rs1138272 polymorphism is likely related to the susceptibility to overall cancer in the Asian and African populations and, specifically, Colorectal and Head and neck cancers in the Caucasian population. In addition, the CT genotype of the GSTP1 rs1138272 polymorphism may be linked to the risk of lung cancer in Caucasians. Additional evidence is required to confirm this conclusion.	1	0
30763017	The role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures.	Background: Ultrasonography is widely utilized by emergency physicians and radiologists to diagnose various orthopaedic diseases, including fractures. We aim to derive a definitive estimate of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in clinically suspected scaphoid fractures. Methods: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of included diagnostic cohort studies that discussed the use of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures. We searched the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence database using the Healthcare Databases Advanced Search tool. In addition, we utilized the PubMed database to search the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health and Allied and Complimentary Medicine databases. Studies were included if they discuss the role of ultrasound imaging in the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures based on cortical interruption, radio-carpal effusion and scapho-trapezium-trapezoid effusion. Quality assessment was performed using the methodological index for non-randomized studies scoring system. Results: 6 non-randomized control studies met the inclusion criteria. Collectively, these included 236 patients with a mean age ranging from 18 to 41.2 years. The quality of these articles ranged between moderate and high based on the methodological index for non-randomized studies score. The mean sensitivity was 88.95% (standard deviation 10.03) and mean specificity was 89.50% (standard deviation 12.21). Conclusion: The current literature reveals high sensitivity and specificity in the use of ultrasonography in scaphoid fracture diagnosis. However, multiple factors including technical differences in ultrasound machines and probes, small sample sizes and variability of subsequent confirmatory tests have created a challenge in determining the ultimate reliability of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures. Considering these factors and limitations, large-sample and high-quality clinical trials are needed to adequately assess its reliability for this purpose. One stop clinics, in the authors' opinion, would be an ideal setting for its introduction as well as for future trials.

31093565	Systematic reviews and meta-analyses addressing comparative test accuracy questions.	While most relevant clinical questions are comparative, most diagnostic test accuracy studies focus on the accuracy of only one test. If we combine these single-test evaluations in a systematic review that aims to compare the accuracy of two or more tests to indicate the most accurate one, the resulting comparative accuracy estimates may be biased. Systematic reviews comparing the accuracy of two tests should only include studies that evaluate both tests in the same patients and against the same reference standard. However, these studies are not always available. And even if available, they may still be biased. For example because they included a specific patient group that would not have been tested with two or more tests in actual practice. Combining comparative and non-comparative studies in a comparative accuracy meta-analysis requires novel statistical approaches. In order to improve decision-making about the use of test in practice, better designed and reported primary diagnostic studies are needed. Meta-analytic and network-type approaches available for therapeutic questions need to be extended to comparative diagnostic accuracy questions.	0	1
