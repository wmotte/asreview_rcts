30569036	Evaluation of a multi-level intervention to improve postpartum intrauterine device services in Rwanda.	Background. The copper intrauterine device is one of the most safe, effective, and cost-effective methods for preventing unintended pregnancy. It can be used postpartum irrespective of breastfeeding to improve birth spacing and reduce unintended pregnancy and maternal-child mortality. However, this method remains highly underutilized. Methods. We developed a multi-level intervention to increase uptake of the postpartum intrauterine device (PPIUD, defined as insertion up to six weeks post-delivery) in Kigali, Rwanda. High-volume hospitals and health centers were selected for implementation of PPIUD counseling and service delivery. Formative work informed development of a PPIUD counseling flipchart to be delivered during antenatal care, labor and delivery, infant vaccination visits, or in the community. Two-day didactic counseling, insertion/removal, and follow-up trainings were provided to labor and delivery and family planning nurses followed by a mentored practicum certification process. Counseling data were collected in government clinic logbooks. Insertions and follow-up data were collected in logbooks created for the implementation. Data were collected by trained government clinic staff and abstracted/managed by study staff. Stakeholders were involved from intervention development through dissemination of results. Results. Two hospitals (and their two associated health centers) and two additional health centers were selected. In 6-months prior to our intervention, 7.7 PPIUDs/month were inserted on average at the selected facilities. From August 2017-July 2018, we trained 83 counselors and 39 providers to provide PPIUD services. N=9,020 women received one-on-one PPIUD counseling after expressing interest in family planning who later delivered at a selected health facility. Of those, n=2,575 had PPIUDs inserted (average of 214.6 insertions/month), a 29% uptake. Most PPIUDs (62%) were inserted within 10 minutes of delivery of the placenta. Conclusions. This successful, comprehensive intervention has the potential to make a significant impact on PPIUD uptake in Rwanda. The intervention is scalable and adaptable to other sub-Saharan African countries.	1	0
30569038	A novel nano-iron supplement to safely combat iron deficiency and anaemia in young children: The IHAT-GUT double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial protocol.	Background: Iron deficiency and its associated anaemia (IDA) are the leading forms of micronutrient malnutrition worldwide. Here we describe the rationale and design of the first clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of an innovative nano iron supplement, iron hydroxide adipate tartrate (IHAT), for the treatment of IDA in young children (IHAT-GUT trial). Oral iron is often ineffective due to poor absorption and/or gastrointestinal adverse effects. IHAT is novel since it is effectively absorbed whilst remaining nanoparticulate in the gut, therefore should enable supplementation with fewer symptoms. Methods: IHAT-GUT is a three-arm, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial conducted in Gambian children 6-35 months of age. The intervention consists of a 12-week supplementation with either IHAT, ferrous sulphate (both at doses bioequivalent to 12.5 mg Fe/day) or placebo. The trial aims to include 705 children with IDA who will be randomly assigned (1:1:1) to each arm. The primary objectives are to test non-inferiority of IHAT in relation to ferrous sulphate at treating IDA, and to test superiority of IHAT in relation to ferrous sulphate and non-inferiority in relation to placebo in terms of diarrhoea incidence and prevalence. Secondary objectives are mechanistic assessments, to test whether IHAT reduces the burden of enteric pathogens, morbidity, and intestinal inflammation, and that it does not cause detrimental changes to the gut microbiome, particularly in relation to Lactobacillaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. Discussion: This trial will test the hypothesis that supplementation with IHAT eliminates iron deficiency and improves haemoglobin levels without inducing gastrointestinal adverse effects. If shown to be the case, this would open the possibility for further testing and use of IHAT as a novel iron source for micronutrient intervention strategies in resource-poor countries, with the ultimate aim to help reduce the IDA global burden. Registration: This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT02941081).	0	1
30671260	Short-Term Effects of Overnight Orthokeratology on Corneal Sensitivity in Chinese Children and Adolescents.	To assess the effects of the 3-month period of orthokeratology (OK) treatment on corneal sensitivity in Chinese children and adolescents. Thirty subjects wore overnight OK lenses in both eyes for 3 months and were assessed at baseline, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the treatment. Changes in corneal sensitivity were measured by the Cochet-Bonnet (COBO) esthesiometer at the corneal apex and approximately 2 mm from the temporal limbus. Changes in refraction and corneal topography were also measured. Central corneal sensitivity suffered a significant reduction within the first month of the OK treatment period but returned to the baseline level at three months (F = 3.009, P=0.039), while no statistically significant difference occurred in temporal sensitivity (F = 2.462, P=0.074). The baseline of central corneal sensitivity correlated with age (r = -0.369, P=0.045). A marked change in refraction (uncorrected visual acuity, P < 0.001; spherical equivalent, P < 0.001) and corneal topographical condition (mean keratometry reading, P < 0.001; eccentricity value, P < 0.001; Surface Regularity Index, P < 0.001) occurred, but none of these measurements were correlated with corneal sensitivity. A 3-month period OK treatment causes a reduction in central corneal sensitivity in Chinese children and adolescents but with a final recovery to the baseline level, which might be because neuronal adaptation occurred earlier in children and adolescents than in adults.	1	0
30671261	Longitudinal Change in Peripheral Anterior Chamber Depth of Eyes with Angle Closure after Laser Iridotomy.	To investigate longitudinal changes in peripheral anterior chamber depth (pACD) of eyes with angle closure after laser iridotomy (LI) and factors related to prognosis. Retrospective cohort study. Eyes with primary angle closure (PAC), acute PAC, or chronic angle closure glaucoma (CACG) that underwent LI (LI group) and eyes that underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens insertion (PEA + IOL group) were employed. Longitudinal changes in pACD were evaluated with a scanning peripheral anterior chamber depth analyzer (SPAC) in addition to routine ophthalmic examination. Forty-eight eyes of LI groups (69.8 ± 8.5 years) and 21 eyes of PEA + IOL group (65.6 ± 12.7 years) were enrolled. Mean follow-up times of LI group and PEA + IOL group were 43.4 ± 12.7 months and 36.5 ± 2.5 months, respectively. LI significantly increased pACD as indicated by the SPAC grade change from 3.8 ± 1.1 to 4.6 ± 1.2 (p < 0.001). However, SPAC grade was gradually reduced and reached the pre-LI level by the third year of follow up. PEA + IOL also significantly increased SPAC grade from 6.7 ± 1.6 to 8.7 ± 2.0 (p < 0.001), but no time-related change was observed. Twenty-three cases of LI group presented with deterioration of glaucoma control. The type of angle closure, plateau iris configuration, peripheral anterior synechia, and glaucomatous visual field defects were significantly associated with prognosis of glaucoma after LI. Peripheral ACD is temporarily deepened by LI, but returns to the pre-LI level in approximately three years. The type of angle closure and some factors may be related to glaucoma prognosis after LI.	1	0
30671456	Kirschner Wire Temporary Intramedullary Fixation Combined with a Locking Anatomical Plate versus a Reconstruction Plate in the Treatment of Comminuted Clavicular Fractures: A Retrospective Study.	We investigate the clinical efficacy of Kirschner wire temporary intramedullary fixation combined with a locking anatomical plate for the treatment of comminuted clavicular fractures. We retrospectively studied 112 patients [80 (71%) men] treated between February 2007 and February 2014. The patients were allocated to treatment with Kirschner wire temporary intramedullary fixation combined with a locking anatomical plate [minimally invasive group (GM)] or a reconstruction plate [traditional group (GT)]. The 112 patients were followed up for 12-48 months (mean, 14 months). The operation time was significantly shorter in GM than in GT. Intraoperative blood loss was significantly less in GM than in GT. The total incision length was significantly shorter and the visual analog scale pain score 24 h after surgery was significantly lower in GM than in GT. Fracture healing time was significantly shorter and the complication rate was significantly lower in GM than in GT. No significant difference in shoulder function score was observed between groups. We recommend Kirschner wire temporary intramedullary fixation combined with a locking anatomical plate as the treatment of choice for comminuted clavicular fractures because of the shorter operation time, lesser intraoperative blood loss, easier reduction of the operation, quicker fracture healing, and lower postoperative complication rate.	1	0
30674762	En bloc resection for intra-abdominal/retroperitoneal desmoid-type fibromatosis with adjacent organ involvement: A case series and literature review.	Surgical treatment for intra-abdominal/retroperitoneal desmoid-type fibromatosis (IA/RPDF) is still controversial. Studies regarding en bloc resection in IA/RPDF with adjacent organ involvement are scanty. This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of en bloc resection in IA/RPDF with adjacent organ involvement. This retrospective clinical study included 21 patients who were diagnosed with IA/RPDF and underwent tumor resection at a single center between March 2013 and June 2018. All patients included in the study underwent surgery with curative intent, and IA/RPDF with adhesive organs was removed en bloc. The safety of surgical treatment was verified by the analysis of intraoperative bleeding, postoperative morbidity and perioperative mortality. The efficacy of surgical treatment was evaluated based on the status of tumor infiltration of adjacent organs and patient follow-up results. Complete macroscopic (R0 or R1) resection was achieved in all cases. A median of 2 (range, 1-7) organs were resected. The median operating time was 300 (90-650) minutes. The median intraoperative bleeding was 300 (20-4,500) milliliters. For postoperative pathological diagnosis at our center, tumor infiltrated at least one organ in each patient. Infiltration was noted in 45 resected organs (45/57, 78.9%). Grade III-V postoperative morbidity developed in one patient (4.8%). During the follow-up, one patient developed local recurrence. No DF-related death was noted during the follow-up. The 3-year disease-free survival rate was 94.1% (95% confidence interval: 83.6-100%). Therefore, en bloc resection of the tumor and involved adjacent organs is a safe and effective treatment modality for IA/RPDF.	1	0
30675151	Acute Exercise as an Intervention to Trigger Motor Performance and EEG Beta Activity in Older Adults.	Acute bouts of exercise have been shown to improve fine motor control performance and to facilitate motor memory consolidation processes in young adults. Exercise effects might be reflected in EEG task-related power (TRPow) decreases in the beta band (13-30 Hz) as an indicator of active motor processing. This study aimed to investigate those effects in healthy older adults. Thirty-eight participants (65-74 years of age) were assigned to an experimental (EG, acute exercise) or a control group (CG, rest). Fine motor control was assessed using a precision grip force modulation (FM) task. FM performance and EEG were measured at (1) baseline (immediately before acute exercise/rest), (2) during practice sessions immediately after, (3) 30 minutes, and (4) 24 hours (FM only) after exercise/rest. A marginal significant effect indicated that EG revealed more improvement in fine motor performance immediately after exercise than CG after resting. EG showed enhanced consolidation of short-term and long-term motor memory, whereas CG revealed only a tendency for short-term motor memory consolidation. Stronger TRPow decreases were revealed immediately after exercise in the contralateral frontal brain area as compared to the control condition. This finding indicates that acute exercise might enhance cortical activation and thus, improves fine motor control by enabling healthy older adults to better utilize existing frontal brain capacities during fine motor control tasks after exercise. Furthermore, acute exercise can act as a possible intervention to enhance motor memory consolidation in older adults.	1	0
30677274	[The detection of cortisol level in blood plasma of patients with arterial hypertension at resistance to stress impacts of various degree.]	The analysis was applied to the results of detection of level of cortisol in pre-operational period before planned arthroscopy in 63 patients (aged from 45 to 50 years) with hypertension disease stage I and II with different stress resistance. The stress resistance was detected using such tests as Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). In most of patients, the analysis of results of testing demonstrated an average level of stress and and average anxiety before the operation. 20 stress resistant patients and 43 stress non-resistant patients were picked out. The level of cortisol in pre-operational period turned out reliably higher in patients with low stress resistance. The data analysis according results of day monitoring of blood pressure prior to implementation of arthroscopy established that in stress non-resistant patients a more expressed increasing of velocity of morning rising of systolic and diastolic blood pressure as compared to stress resistant patients. After surgical intervention, velocities of morning rising of systolic and diastolic blood pressure also were higher in stress non-resistant patients. They also had lower values of day index of systolic blood pressure (non-dipper). In stress resistant patients, day index of systolic blood pressure before and after was within the limits of standard values. The average values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure registered within limits of on standard values. However, they were higher in pre- and post-operational periods among patients with low stress resistance. The received results reflect alteration of function of cardio-vascular system in response to psychological stress that is more expressed in patients with low stress resistance.	1	0
30680229	Radical prostatectomy performed via robotic, transperitoneal and extraperitoneoscopic approaches: functional and early oncological outcomes.	Oncological remission along with high postoperative functionality [continence and erectile function (EF)] are the main aspects of prostate cancer (PCa) treatment. The aim of this study was to compare functional and oncological treatment results achieved after a nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (RP) via transperitoneal (TPRP), extraperitoneal (EPRP) and robot-assisted (RARP) approach. From March 2015 to March 2016, 507 RP were performed at the Institute for Urology and Reproductive Health (Moscow, Russia). A total of 264 patients with localized (cТ1а-2с) prostate cancer [prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <20 ng/ml, Gleason score ≤7], intact prostate capsule (according to MRI), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) ≥19 and a life expectancy >10 years were included into the retrospective study. All the surgeries were performed by a single surgeon. The outcomes were evaluated after urethral catheter removal and 3-6-12 months after RP. Nerve preservation (NP) was performed for 153 patients without significant distinctions in time (р = 0.064) and blood loss (р = 0.073). The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-SF) score was lower for NP: 9.23 ±6.59 and 3.86 ±5.38 after 3 and 12 months respectively compared with continence after RP without nerve preservation (NP): 14.27 ±5.1 vs. 6.15 ±4.76 (р <0.001). Continent was 52.2% vs. 83.3% vs. 81.8% in TPRP, RARP and EPRP groups; р <0.001. IIEF-5 scores were 14.67 ±9.4, 4.2 ±4.26 and 4.0 ±2.07 after RARP, TPRP and EPRP respectively (р = 0.002). After 12 months the PSA: TPRP = 0.11 ±0.19, RARP = 0.03 ±0.05 and EPRP = 0.53 ±1.87 ng/ml (р <0.001). Outcomes depend on surgical approach and was better in the RARP-group (AUC = 0.768 ±0.034 (CI 95% 0,701-0.834; р <0.001). We suggest RARP with NP as a method of choice for treatment of prostate cancer in patients interested in preservation of EF and quality of life in general.	1	0
30684325	Chronic systemic inflammation in the pathogenesis of comorbid pathology and it's correction.	Introduction: The paper presents the findings of our own study on the changes of the systemic inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) during the combination treatment with metformin and pioglitazone. The aim of the paper is to define the dynamics of the systemic inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease in combination treatment with metformin and pioglitazone. Meterials and methods: 95 patients with IHD concomitant with DM2 have been treated. Patients, enrolled into study, have been randomized into 2 groups: the comparison group (n=37) treated with metformin andsulphonylureas, and the study group (n=58) treated with metformin and pioglitazone. The proposed course of therapy lasted 6 months. Results and conclusions: Before, after 3 and 6 months of treatment the control over the state of inflammatory responses was made and C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Interleukin-6 was assessed. The resulting data confirmed a statistically significant reduction under the effect of the combined treatment with the proposed combination of marker drugs and the degree of chronic systemic inflammation that is specific for IHD and DM2, which has a positive impact on the development and progress of IHD in DM2 patients, is well tolerated and can be considered as a pathogenic factor in the therapy of the presented comorbid nosologies.	1	0
30684331	Evaluation of the effects of physical therapy on everyday functioning in stroke patients.	Introduction: Stroke is one of the most important health problems of our time. The aim: The aim of the study was to assess the functional status of stroke patients and the effects of physical therapy on patient functioning. Material and methods: The study included 28 patients (10 women, 18 men) after ischaemic stroke. The patients underwent kinesitherapy , verticalisation, gait training, and physical therapy. Results: 1. After treatment, patients showed functional improvements in all the activities of daily living assessed in the study. 2. The improvement depended on the time from stroke, with the most dynamic changes occurring in the first 3 months after stroke. Conclusions: 1. Appropriate patient-specific physical therapy plays an extremely important role in rehabilitation. It may prevent a number of complications and reduce disability. 2. Physical therapy and rehabilitation constitute the basis for stroke patient treatment.	1	0
30687193	Attention Improves During Physical Exercise in Individuals With ADHD.	The present study examined the effects of physical exercise on attentional processes in individuals diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), compared to healthy controls. Unlike previous studies typically comparing performance on baseline measures with post-exercise performance, this study examined the effects of physical exercise on attention while participants were engaged in a continuous performance task. Fourteen individuals diagnosed with ADHD (71% females, mean age = 24.8) and 17 controls (76% females, mean age = 22.6) completed the Conners Continuous Auditory Test of Attention (CATA). All participants completed the test twice, at baseline in a sitting position and while walking on the treadmill at a speed of 5 km/h. The order of administration was counterbalanced for each group. A 2 × 2 ANOVA with repeated measures detected a group by activity interaction on several measures of the CATA. Specifically, compared to baseline, the ADHD group demonstrated faster reaction times during physical exercise (25.4 ms faster) and decreased omission errors (1.5% better), whereas controls showed the opposite pattern (15.9 ms slower and 0.88% worse, respectively). Importantly, the ADHD group's overall relatively lower performance on these measures was only evident in the resting condition, attaining scores similar to controls during exercise. These results suggest a possibly hypoactive attentional system in ADHD that could potentially be enhanced by arousal through engagement in physical exercise.	1	0
30687224	Gadolinium-Enhanced Extracranial MRA Prior to Mechanical Thrombectomy Is Not Associated With an Improved Procedure Speed.	Objectives: To assess whether performing a pre-intervention gadolinium-enhanced extracranial magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) in addition to intracranial vascular imaging is associated with improved thrombectomy time metrics. Methods: Consecutive patients treated by MT at a large comprehensive stroke center between January 2012 and December 2017 who were screened using pre-intervention MRI were included. Patients characteristics and procedural data were collected. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to compare MT speed, efficacy, complications, and clinical outcomes between patients with and without pre-intervention gadolinium-enhanced extracranial MRA. Results: A total of 912 patients were treated within the study period, including 288 (31.6%) patients with and 624 (68.4%) patients without extracranial MRA. Multivariate analysis showed no significant difference between groups in groin puncture to clot contact time (RR = 0.93 [0.85-1.02], p = 0.14) or to recanalization time (RR = 0.92 [0.83-1.03], p = 0.15), rates of successful recanalization (defined as a mTICI 2b or 3, RR = 0.93 [0.62-1.42], p = 0.74), procedural complications (RR = 0.81 [0.51-1.27], p = 0.36), and good clinical outcome (defined by a mRS ≤ 2 at 3 months follow-up, RR = 1.05 [0.73-1.52], p = 0.79). Conclusion: Performing a pre-intervention gadolinium-enhanced extracranial MRA in addition to non-contrast intracranial MRA at stroke onset does not seem to be associated with a delay or shortening of procedure times.	1	0
30687230	Changes in Blood microRNA Expression and Early Metabolic Responsiveness 21 Days Following Bariatric Surgery.	Background: Early metabolic responses following bariatric surgery appear greater than expected given the initial weight loss and coincide with improvement in diabetes. We hypothesized that small non-coding microRNA changes might contribute to regulating mechanisms for metabolic changes and weight loss in patients with severe obesity and diabetes. Methods: Twenty-nine type 2 patients with severe obesity (mean BMI 46.2 kg/m2) and diabetes underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Clinical measurements and fasting blood samples were taken preoperatively and at day 21 postoperatively. Normalization of fasting glucose and HbA1c following bariatric surgery (short-term diabetes remission) was defined as withdrawal of anti-diabetic medication and fasting glucose < 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) or HbA1c < 6.0%. MicroRNA expression was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and tested for significant changes after surgery. Results: BMI decreased by 3.8 kg/m2 21 days postoperatively. Eighteen of 29 RYGB (62%) had short-term diabetes remission. Changes from pre- to post-surgery in 32 of 175 microRNAs were nominally significant (p < 0.05). Following multiple comparison adjustment, changes in seven microRNAs remained significant: miR-7-5p, let-7f-5p, miR-15b-5p, let-7i-5p, miR-320c, miR-205-5p, and miR-335-5p. Four pathways were over-represented by these seven microRNAs, including diabetes and insulin resistance pathways. Conclusion: Seven microRNAs showed significant changes 21 days after bariatric surgery. Functional pathways of the altered microRNAs were associated with diabetes-, pituitary-, and liver-related disease, with expression in natural killer cells, and pivotal intestinal pathology suggesting possible mechanistic roles in early diabetes responses following bariatric surgery.	1	0
30687552	Vulnerability and Resilience in Patients with Chronic Pain in Occupational Healthcare: A Pilot Study with a Patient-Centered Approach.	The aim of this pilot study was to describe vulnerability and resilience and possible subgroups in patients with chronic work related musculoskeletal pain in occupational healthcare. A second aim was to evaluate a patient-centered approach. This study was based on consecutive patients with chronic pain, seen by the same physician and sick-listed full or part time three months or longer. They were included during a period of three months. Patient reported outcome measures (PROM) were administered at baseline and at follow-up after 8 months. A patient-centered approach was applied where the patient's whole situation was taken into account. A dominance of an insecure dismissing attachment pattern and a subnormal sense of coherence (SOC) was reported both at baseline and at follow-up. The patients (n=38) reported significant improvement of pain severity (p=0.01), pain interference (p=0.001), life control (p=0.01), affective distress (p=0.02), and dysfunction (p=0.001) on the multidimensional pain inventory (MPI) and fewer patients were sick-listed full time at follow-up (13 patients versus 21). By means of multivariate data analyses this change in MPI was confirmed and was also correlated with a significant increase in health related quality of life (HRQoL). Moreover subgroups with different outcome at follow-up were identified according to attachment pattern and subgroups on MPI. A patient-centered approach may be of value for patients with chronic pain in occupational healthcare, improving pain and dysfunction. Patients with chronic pain are a heterogeneous group where outcome of treatment might be influenced by individual resilience and/or vulnerability.	0	1
30687715	Laparoscopic Reversal of Tubal Sterilization; A Retrospective Study Over 135 Cases.	Objectives: To evaluate the pregnancy and delivery rates of laparoscopic tubal reanastomosis. Study Design: From 2003 to 2013, 135 laparoscopic tubal reversals were performed according to the four stitch technique. The parameters studied, included positive pregnancy test, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, term delivery, post-operative time to conception, post-operative hysterosalpingography, and spermogram. Results: From the 135 patients operated, 93 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The age of patients varied from 27 to 47 years old. All ages combined, positive β-HCG blood sample rate was 75.3% (95% CI: 65.0-83.4%) and term delivery 52.7% (95%CI: 42.1-3.0%). The age-adjusted pregnancy and delivery rates were as follows: 27-35 y.o. (n = 23) 95.7% (95%CI: 76.0-99.8%) and 73.9% (95%CI: 51.3-88.9%),36-39 y.o. (n = 40) 77.5% (95%CI: 61.1-88.6%) and 47.5% (95%CI: 31.8-63.7%),40-42 y.o. (n = 19) 68.4% (95%CI: 43.5-86.4%) and 52.6% (95%CI: 29.5-74.8%),43-47 y.o. (n = 11) 36.4% (95%CI: 12.4-68.4%) and 27.3% (95%CI: 7.3-60.7%). Conclusions: In our series the pregnancy and delivery rates after laparoscopic reversal of tubal sterilization is estimated at 75.3 and 52.7%, respectively. For women with tubal sterilization and no other infertility factors, reanastomosis can restore anterior natural fertility related to age. Laparoscopic reversal should be proposed systematically to patients and performed by well-trained laparoscopists, avoiding potentially the inconvenient and adverse outcomes of an IVF treatment. Although, it may seem a more cost-effective technique compared to robotically assisted reversal, a prospective randomized trial could answer this question.	1	0
30687765	Intravenous Cyclophosphamide Therapy for Anti-IFN-Gamma Autoantibody-Associated Mycobacterium abscessus Infection.	Anti-interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) autoantibodies are increasingly recognized as a cause of adult-onset immunodeficiency (AOID) worldwide. These patients are susceptible to various intracellular pathogens especially nontuberculous mycobacteria. Most of the patients have a refractory clinical course. Herein, we report the use of immunotherapy with pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY) in patients who had progressive, refractory Mycobacterium abscessus infection. We included patients, seen at Srinagarind Hospital, Thailand, infected with M. abscessus, who had received ≥3 courses of parenteral antibiotics within the last 12 months and who received pulse IVCY with a tapering dose of prednisolone. There were 8 AOID patients who met the criteria and received pulse IVCY between January 2011 and December 2015. One patient was lost to follow-up after 5 courses of IVCY: he had died at home 3 months later. Five patients had favorable outcomes: 2 were able to discontinue NTM therapy, and 3 had stable disease and were on NTM treatment without hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics. Two patients relapsed and needed hospitalization. The IFN-γ Ab titers among the 7 patients were significantly decreased during treatment, and the median initial antibody titer started at 200,000 and then decreased to 5,000 after 2 years of treatment (P < 0.0001). The antibody titer reduction among responsive vs. nonresponsive patient was significantly different after 6 months of treatment: the median antibody titer was 5,000 and 100,000, respectively (P = 0.0467). IVCY therapy might be an alternative treatment for AOID patients infected with M. abscessus and refractory to antimycobacterial therapy.	1	0
30692906	EEG Phase Synchronization in Persons With Depression Subjected to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.	Aim: The main objective of this work was to study the impact of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) treatment on brain activity in 8 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 10 patients with bipolar disorder (BP). Changes due to rTMS stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were investigated considering separately responders and non-responders to therapy in each of both groups. The aim of the research is to determine whether non-responders differ from responders suffered from both diseases, as well as if any change occurred due to rTMS across consecutive rTMS sessions. Methods: The graph-theory-based connectivity analysis of non-linearity measure of phase interdependencies-Phase Locking Value (PLV)-was examined from EEG data. The approximately 15-min EEG recordings from each of participants were recorded before and after 1st, 10th, and 20th session, respectively. PLV calculated from data was analyzed using principal graph theory indices (strength and degree) within five physiological frequency bands and in individual channels separately. The impact of rTMS on the EEG connectivity in every group of patients evaluated by PLV was assessed. Results: Each of four groups reacted differently to rTMS treatment. The strength and degree of PLV increased in gamma band in both groups of responders. Moreover, an increase of indices in beta band for BP-responders was observed. While, in MDD-non-responders the indices decreased in gamma band and increased in beta band. Moreover, the index strength was lower in alpha band for BP- non-responders. The rTMS stimulation caused topographically specific changes, i.e., the increase of the activity in the left DLPFC as well as in other brain regions such as right parieto-occipital areas. Conclusions: The analysis of PLV allowed for evaluation of the rTMS impact on the EEG activity in each group of patients. The changes of PLV under stimulation might be a good indicator of response to depression treatment permitting to improve the effectiveness of therapy.	1	0
30692939	Photobiomodulation by Led Does Not Alter Muscle Recovery Indicators and Presents Similar Outcomes to Cold-Water Immersion and Active Recovery.	Purpose: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) on muscle recovery based on inflammation (interleukin-10 [IL-10]; tumor necrosis factor-α [TNFα]), muscle damage markers (creatine kinase [CK]; lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]), delay onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and countermovement jump performance (CMJ) after two sprint interval training (SIT) sessions compared with a placebo condition (part-I), as well as to compare the effectiveness of PBMT with active recovery (AR) and cold-water immersion (CWI) (part-II). Methods: Part-I was conducted as a double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled study and part-II as a parallel-group study. Thirty-six men participated in the studies (12 participants in part-I and 36 participants in part-II). Volunteers performed two SITs interspaced by 24-h (SIT1 and SIT2) to mimic the effect of accumulating 2 consecutive days of SIT. In part-I, only after SIT2, PBMT [Total energy: 600J (300J per leg in 5 spots); wavelength: 660-850 nm] or placebo interventions were performed, while in part-II PBMT (part-I data), AR (15-min; 50% of the maximal aerobic power), or CWI (10-min; 10°C) were carried out, also after SIT2. Blood samples were collected before (i.e., baseline), and 0.5, 1, 24, 48, and 72-h after SIT2, while CMJ and DOMS were measured before, 24, 48, and 72-h after SIT2. Results: In part-I, there were no interactions between PBMT and placebo conditions for any blood markers (P ≥ 0.313), DOMS (P = 0.052), and CMJ (P = 0.295). However, an effect of time was found with increases in LDH, CK, and IL-10 (P ≤ 0.043) as well as a decrease in DOMS at 72-h compared with 24-h (P = 0.012). In part-II, there were no interactions between the PBMT, AR, and CWI groups for any markers at the same moments (P ≥ 0.189) and for the peak and integral values (P ≥ 0.193), for DOMS (P = 0.314) and CMJ (P = 0.264). However, an effect of time was found with an increase in CK and IL-10 (P = 0.003), while DOMS decreased at 48 and 72-h compared with 24-h (P = 0.001). Conclusion: In summary, PBMT had no effect on inflammation, muscle damage, CMJ performance, or DOMS after two consecutive sprint interval training sessions compared to placebo, CWI, and AR strategies.	1	0
30693046	Effect of livergol on the improvement of fatty liver in patients with cancer undergoing irinotecan- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimen.	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Livergol on the improvement of fatty liver in patients with cancer undergoing irinotecan- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimen. This was an add-on nonrandomized clinical trial study on thirty selected eligible cancer patients undergoing irinotecan (8 patients) and oxaliplatin (22 patients) with diagnosed fatty liver disease-based liver ultrasonography, as well as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Patients in each group received Livergol at a dose of 140 mg daily for 1 month. ALT and AST levels as well as grade of fatty liver were evaluated before and after intervention. In the oxaliplatin/Livergol group, 40% and 44.4% of patients who were in Grade 2 and 3 before intervention were altered to Grades 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.005), and in irinotecan/Livergol group, the mentioned percentages were 80% and 66.7% (P = 0.014). The mean levels of ALT and AST enzymes were decreased in both groups after tacking Livergol; however, the observed decreases were not significantly different between groups. It was concluded that the adding of Livergol to oxaliplatin and irinotecan regimens significantly improved the fatty liver of patients and none of them was superior.	1	0
30693103	Dexamethasone Intravitreal Implant (Ozurdex) for Long-Term Macular Edema after Epiretinal Membrane Peeling Surgery.	To investigate the functional and anatomical outcome of the 0.7 mg dexamethasone (Ozurdex) intravitreal implant (IVD) in eyes with long-term macular edema after macular epiretinal membrane removal. We enrolled 40 eyes with persistent macular edema at least 12 months after epiretinal membrane removal. Twenty eyes in the IVD group received IVD and the other 20 eyes were in the control group. The main outcome measures were change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central foveal thickness (CFT). For eyes in the IVD group, the mean BCVA improved by 3.45 lines to 0.47 logMAR one month after IVD. However, the mean BCVA improved by only 0.14 lines to 0.74 logMAR at the same time in eyes in the control group. Six months later, the mean BCVA improved to 0.31 and 0.74 logMAR in the IVD and control groups, respectively. In the IVD group, the mean CFT decreased rapidly by 116.8 μm to 333.9 μm one month after IVD. Thereafter the CFT decreased at a slower pace. In the control group, the CFT remained static during the follow-up period. However, in the IVD group, 6 months after IVD, the CFT seemed to have a tendency to increase. Single IVD could significantly decrease macular edema and improve visual outcome for eyes with persistent long-term macular edema after macular ERM removal and the effect can be sustained as long as 6 months after the initial injection. However, in order to maintain the visual and anatomical outcome, repeat IVD might be considered if macular edema recurs.	1	0
30693109	Efficacy of the Treatment of Elderly Trauma Patients Requiring Intensive Care.	To evaluate the effectiveness of intensive care for the elderly trauma patients aged 80 years and older. Trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) through the emergency room (ER) at our hospital between January 2013 and December 2016 were analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups: patients aged 80 and older (group E) and <80 years old (group Y). Clinical courses and the total treatment costs were compared between the two groups. Data are shown as median (interquartile range). A hundred and seven trauma patients were included in the study. There were 26 patients in group E and 81 patients in group Y. There was no significant difference in Injury Severity Score (ISS) (group E, 19 (13, 32); group Y, 17 (14, 25); p=0.708); however, the probability of survival (Ps) was significantly lower in group E (group E, 0.895 (0.757, 0.950); group Y, 0.955 (0.878, 0.986); p=0.004). The duration of ICU stay (days) was significantly longer in group E (10 (5, 23)) than in group Y (4 (3, 9); p=0.001), and the total hospital stay (days) was longer in group E (33 (13, 57)) than in group Y (22 (12, 42); p=0.179). The hospital mortality was higher in group E (11.5%) than in group Y (6.2%) without a significant difference (p=0.365). The total treatment costs were significantly higher in group E ($23,558 (12,456, 42,790) with $1 = ¥110.57) than in group Y ($16,538 (7,412, 25,422); p=0.023). Elderly trauma patients require longer-term treatment including ICU stay and greater cost with higher hospital mortality compared with young trauma patients.	0	1
30693271	Is Proton Therapy a Pro for Breast Cancer? A Comparison of Proton vs. Non-proton Radiotherapy Using the National Cancer Database.	Background: Limited data exists demonstrating the clinical benefit of proton radiotherapy (PRT) in breast cancer. Using the National Cancer Database, we evaluated predictors associated with PRT use for patients with breast cancer. An exploratory analysis also investigates the impact of PRT on overall survival (OS). Methods: Patients with non-metastatic breast cancer treated with adjuvant radiotherapy from 2004 to 2014 were identified. Patients were stratified based on receipt of PRT or non-PRT (i.e., photons ± electrons). A logistic regression model was used to determine predictors for PRT utilization. For OS, Multivariable analysis (MVA) was performed using Cox proportional hazard model. Results: A total of 724,492 patients were identified: 871 received PRT and 723,621 received non-PRT. 58.3% of the PRT patients were group stage 0-1. Median follow-up time was 62.2 months. On multivariate logistic analysis, the following factors were found to be significant for receipt of PRT (all p < 0.05): academic facility (odds ratio [OR] = 2.50), South (OR = 2.01) and West location (OR = 12.43), left-sided (OR = 1.21), ER-positive (OR = 1.59), and mastectomy (OR = 1.47); pT2-T4 disease predicted for decrease use (OR = 0.79). PRT was not associated with OS on MVA for all patients: Hazard Ratio: 0.85, p = 0.168. PRT remained not significant on MVA after stratifying for subsets likely associated with higher heart radiation doses, including: left-sided (p = 0.140), inner-quadrant (p = 0.173), mastectomy (p = 0.095), node positivity (p = 0.680), N2-N3 disease (p = 0.880), and lymph node irradiation (LNI) (p = 0.767). Conclusions: Receipt of PRT was associated with left-sided, ER+ tumors, mastectomy, South and West location, and academic facilities, but not higher group stages or LNI. PRT was not associated with OS, including in subsets likely at risk for higher heart doses. Further studies are required to determine non-OS benefits of PRT. In the interim, given the high cost of protons, only well-selected patients should receive PRT unless enrolled on a clinical trial.	1	0
30693828	Outcome of children with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and single-system involvement: A retrospective study at a single center in Shanghai, China.	This is a descriptive review of the clinical patterns and outcomes of children with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and single-system involvement (SS-LCH) treated at Shanghai Children's Medical Center. 60 evaluable newly diagnosed patients (37 boys, 23 girls) with a median age of 3.9 years (range: 0.3-15.3 years) and histiopathology-confirmed SS-LCH were enrolled from 2010 to 2014. All patients received systemic chemotherapy using either the DAL HX-83 or LCH-II protocol as determined by the physician. Bone was the most frequently affected organ (56/60, 93.3%). Of the 56 patients suffering from SS-bone disease, 35 (62.5%) had unifocal disease and 21 (37.5%) had multifocal disease. CNS-risk lesions were seen in nine patients (16.1%, 9/56) at diagnosis. Thirty-two patients were treated with the LCH-II protocol and 28 received the DAL HX-83 protocol. No patient received intralesional steroid injection at the time of surgery. CNS-risk lesion correlated with an inferior event-free survival (EFS) for patients with bone disease (62.5 ± 17.1% vs. 90.7 ± 4.5%; p = 0.039). The difference in the 5-year EFS between patients with unifocal and multifocal SS-bone LCH did not reach the statistical significance (93.8 ± 4.3% vs. 75.0 ± 9.7%; p = 0.074). No deaths were observed, leading to a 5-year OS of 100% in the present cohort of patients. Permanent consequences and secondary malignancies were not observed but were also limited by short follow-up. Optimal therapy for patients with SS-bone LCH has not been established. Less toxic therapeutic approaches should be considered for these patients and tested in prospective trials.	1	0
30697508	Positive association between the cross-sectional area of the rhomboid muscle, and the range of shoulder abduction after neck dissection surgery.	To evaluate the association between the cross-sectional area of selected shoulder and scapular muscles and the range of shoulder abduction, early after neck dissection surgery. Twenty-seven patients (contributing 34 upper limbs), who had undergone neck dissection surgery for head and neck malignancy, were enrolled into the study. Loss of strength of the trapezius muscle at 1-month post-surgery was quantified by the change in active range of shoulder abduction (%A-ROM), measured by hand-held goniometry in a standing position, from baseline, before surgery. The cross-sectional area of the following muscles were measured on unenhanced computed tomography images after surgery: trapezius, rhomboid, serratus anterior, pectoralis major, deltoid, and biceps brachii. There was a significant positive correlation between the %A-ROM and the cross-sectional area of the rhomboid muscle. Greater active shoulder abduction early after surgery is associated with a greater cross-sectional area of the rhomboid muscle. This muscle should be included in intensive programs for rehabilitation of upper limb movement after neck dissection surgery.	1	0
30697510	Patients 10 years after total hip arthroplasty have the deficits in functional performance, physical activity, and high fall rate compared to healthy adults.	Background Long-term results in muscle strength, physical activity (PA), and functional improvement after total hip arthroplasty (THA) have not been studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the deficits in functional performance, PA, and high fall rate in patient 10 years after THA compared to healthy adults. Methods The subjects were 58 patients who underwent primary THA for unilateral hip osteoarthritis 10 years, and 46 healthy adults. Hip abductor strength, balance function (single-leg stance time), Maximal Walking Speed (MWS), fall rate, and PA (IPAQ short ver.) were evaluated. The unpaired t-test and χ2 test were used to assess differences between the groups. Statistical significance was set at p value <0.05. Results Compared to healthy adults, THA patients had 9.5% less hip abductor muscle strength on the operated side, 42.1% shorter single-leg stance time on the operated side, 14.8% slower MWS, 2.0 times less High-PA group, and 2.8 times higher fall rate (p<0.05). Conclusion This study showed that hip abductor muscle strength, gait speed, balance function, and PA were significantly lower in patients 10 years after THA than in healthy adults. Additionally, the fall rate was significantly higher in patients 10 years post-THA than in healthy adults.	1	0
30701215	Surgical treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours combined with imatinib treatment: a retrospective cohort analysis.	Targeted therapies changed the treatment concepts of gastrointestinal stromal tumours significantly. As only possibility to cure surgical resection is the cornerstone of therapy. Thus it is necessary to find out which patients will benefit most regarding modality (neo- or adjuvant) and duration of chemotherapy. In a retrospective cohort analysis the medical records of all consecutive patients treated in the department of general and visceral surgery of the university hospital Tübingen between 2004 and 2015 were investigated. Recurrence and survival outcomes were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Tumor location of GIST was gastric in 32, small bowel in 14, rectum in 3 and extraintestinal in 3 patients. Median tumor size was 46 mm. Median mitotic index was 4 per 50 hpf. Resection was achieved R0 in 46 patients, R1 in 4 patients and R2 in 2 patients. Mean overall survival was 58.9 months (range, 46-73 months). Mean recurrence free survival was 45.6 months (range, 36-57 months). Mean overall survival was 58.9 months (range, 46-73 months). Risk factors for recurrence were tumor location and high mitotic index Ki-67. The prognosis of GIST after surgical resection is favourable. Survival prognosis are excellent. Analysis of KI-67 mitotic index predicted best oncologic outcome.	1	0
30702223	[Evaluation of inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction's biomarkers in patients with hypertension at achieving the target blood pressure.]	The target organs damage in hypertension is mainly realized through an endothelial dysfunction. The present study investigated the inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction's biomarkers in patients with hypertension before and after the achieving the target level of blood pressure. We've performed clinical and laboratory study of 44 patients (17 men, 27 women, mean age 58.59 ± 10.57 years) with the hypertension stage II, degrees2-3, high and very high risk of cardiovascular complications, not reaching the target level of blood pressure at the previous therapy. All patients received standardized therapy with a fixed combination of amlodipine / indapamide / perindopril in an individually selected dosage. The duration of the follow-up was 6 months. The levels of pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6), anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and vasculoendothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured. All patients achieved the target blood pressure level at the end of the study (systolic blood pressure was 125.1 ± 6.9 mm Hg, diastolic - 82.2 ± 5 mm Hg, p < 0.001). After 6 months, there was no significant dynamics of inflammatory biomarkers. The level of sVCAM-1, as an indicator of endothelial dysfunction, decreased (898.67 ± 433.5 ng / ml vs. 1063.5 ± 442.4 ng / ml at the start of treatment, p < 0.001). Thus, it is possible to use vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 as a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction in patients with hypertension. Adequate therapy of hypertension with achievement of target blood pressure levels improves vascular endothelial function, significantly reducing sVCAM-1 expression.	1	0
30702379	Opioid-Sparing Effects of Topical Ketamine in Treating Severe Pain From Decubitus Ulcers.	Pain from pressure ulcers can severely impact a patient's quality of life. Evidence-based treatment of ulcer-related pain typically relies on systemic opioids with limiting side effects. Literature exists on the use of topical ketamine for neuropathic pain, but not for tissue injury in general and for decubitus ulcer pain specifically. Ketamine has a number of actions including blocking of the glutamate NMDA ionophore in the periphery. Preclinical evidence suggests that NMDA receptors located on peripheral sensory afferent terminals may play a role in initiating pain signaling in inflamed tissues. Topical ketamine, therefore, has the potential to provide analgesia when applied to decubitus ulcers. Here a case is reported of a 54-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who during a critical period in her illness experienced gangrene leading to chronic bilateral stage IV decubitus heel ulcers. The severe pain reported by the patient was poorly managed using high doses of systemic opioids and resulted in intermittent systemic side effects. Adding a compounded ketamine gel to her wound dressings twice daily over an interval of several months drastically reduced her opioid use and, more important, her pain, with minimal side effects.	0	1
30705623	The Effect of Dual Task on Attentional Performance in Children With ADHD.	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder without validated objective markers. Oculomotor behavior and executive motor control could potentially be used to investigate attention disorders. The aim of this study was to explore an oculomotor and postural dual task in children with ADHD. Forty-two children were included in the study, gathering children with ADHD (n = 21) (mean 8.15 age ± years 0.36) and sex-, age-, and IQ-matched typically developing children (TD). Children performed two distinct fixation tasks in three different postural conditions. Eye movements and postural body sway were recorded simultaneously, using an eye tracker and a force platform. Results showed that children with ADHD had poor fixation capability and poor postural stability when compared to TD children. Both groups showed less postural control on the unstable platform and displayed more saccades during the fixation task. Surprisingly, in the dual unstable platform/fixation with distractor task, the instability of children with ADHD was similar to that observed in TD children. Top-down dys-regulation mediated by frontal-striatal dysfunction could be at the origin of both poor inhibitory oculomotor deficits and impaired body stability reported in children with ADHD. Finally, we could assume that the fact both groups of children focused their attention on a secondary task led to poor postural control. In the future it could be interesting to explore further this issue by developing new dual tasks in a more ecological situation in order to gain more insight on attentional processes in children with ADHD. HIGHLIGHTS - Children with ADHD showed poor fixation capability when compared to TD children. - Top-down dys-regulation mediated by frontal-striatal dysfunction could be at the origin of both poor inhibitory oculomotor deficits and impaired body stability reported in children with ADHD. - Both groups of children focused their attention on the visual fixation task leading to poor postural control. - In the future it could be interesting to develop new dual tasks in an ecological situation in order to gain more insight on attentional processes in children with ADHD.	1	0
30705885	Preservation of Ejaculatory Function After Postchemotherapy Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection (PC-RPLND) in Patients With Testicular Cancer: Template vs. Bilateral Resection.	Background: Post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) plays a crucial role in treatment of metastatic non-seminomatous germ cell cancer. Objective: To evaluate the functional outcome regarding the preservation of ejaculatory function comparing a bilateral vs. unilateral template resection in PC-RPLND patients. In addition, oncological safety and perioperative complications of the unilateral template resection was compared to the full bilateral one. Design/Setting/Participants: Between 2003 and 2018, 504 RPLNDs have been performed in 434 patients. The database of consecutive patients was queried to identify 171 patients with PC-RPLND after 1st line chemotherapy for a non-seminoma with or without bilateral template resection. Re-Do's, late relapse, salvage patients, and thoraco-abdominal approaches were excluded. Indication for a template resection was a unilateral residual mass mainly <5 cm as published (1). Outcome, Measurement, and Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics were used to report preoperative features, postoperative outcomes and patterns of recurrence, on the overall population and after stratification for the type of resection (bilateral vs. unilateral). Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to describe recurrence- and cancer-specific mortality-free survival rates at different time points. Results and Limitations: Overall, 90 and 81 patients underwent unilateral and bilateral radical resection, respectively. Median size of residual mass was 7 cm for bilateral and 4 cm for unilateral template resection. Clinical stage II and III were present in 31 and 69% of patients, respectively. Median follow-up was 14.5 months (IQR 3.3-37.6). The 1- and 2-year recurrence-free survival rates were 91 and 91%, and 77 and 72% for patients treated with unilateral template and bilateral resection, respectively (p = 0.0078). Median time to recurrence was 9.5 and 9 months in template and bilateral resection group, respectively. Adjunctive procedures were performed in 56 patients (33%) and were significantly more frequent in the bilateral resection group (43 vs. 23%, p = 0.006). The overall high-grade complication rate (Clavien-Dindo ≥ III) was 6, 3, and 9% in unilateral template and bilateral resection group, respectively (p = 0.6). The rate of preservation of antegrade ejaculation was significantly higher in the unilateral group. Conclusions: Antegrade ejaculation in patients undergoing unilateral template resection with a residual mass <5 cm can be preserved at a much higher rate. Moreover, this surgical procedure is oncologically safe in terms of mid-term recurrence and CSM-free survival rates. This data undermines the growing evidence of limited PC-RPLND being justifiable in strictly unilateral residual mass <5 cm. This data has to be confirmed with a longer follow-up regarding in-field and retroperitoneal recurrences.	1	0
30706056	Group versus individual antenatal and first year postpartum care: Study protocol for a multi-country cluster randomized controlled trial in Kenya and Nigeria.	Background: Antenatal care (ANC) in many low- and middle-income countries is under-utilized and of sub-optimal quality. Group ANC (G-ANC) is an intervention designed to improve the experience and provision of ANC for groups of women (cohorts) at similar stages of pregnancy. Methods: A two-arm, two-phase, cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) (non-blinded) is being conducted in Kenya and Nigeria. Public health facilities were matched and randomized to either standard individual ANC (control) or G-ANC (intervention) prior to enrollment. Participants include pregnant women attending first ANC at gestational age <24 weeks, health care providers, and sub-national health managers. Enrollment ended in June 2017 for both countries. In the intervention arm, pregnant women are assigned to cohorts at first ANC visit and receive subsequent care together during five meetings facilitated by a health care provider (Phase 1). After birth, the same cohorts meet four times over 12 months with their babies (Phase 2). Data collection was performed through surveys, clinical data extraction, focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews. Phase 1 data collection ended in January 2018 and Phase 2 concludes in November 2018. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used to evaluate primary outcomes for Phases 1 and 2: health facility delivery and use of a modern method of family planning at 12 months postpartum, respectively. Data analysis and reporting of results will be consistent with norms for cRCTs. General estimating equation models that account for clustering will be employed for primary outcome analyzes. Results: Overall 1,075 and 1,013 pregnant women were enrolled in Nigeria and Kenya, respectively. Final study results will be available in February 2019. Conclusions: This is the first cRCT on G-ANC in Africa. It is among the first to examine the effects of continuing group care through the first year postpartum.

30714388	Promoting resilience through neurocognitive functioning in youth living with HIV.	Using a phased model of intervention development, we developed an intervention to promote resilience in youth living with HIV via improved neurocognitive resources. First, youth completed a naturalistic prospective memory (PM) task and were randomized into a visualization condition or control condition. Next, 47 of these participants completed another naturalistic PM task and were randomized into Calendaring condition, an Alarm condition, a Combined condition, or a Control condition. Youth with low PM demonstrated observable gains from the visualization technique. Youth in the Combined Calendaring and Alarm condition demonstrated significantly better performance than participants in the Control and Calendaring conditions. In a Proof-of-Concept study with 16 youth, the previous findings were translated into a single session in-person intervention followed by tailored text messaging to improve adherence and viral load via improved neurocognitive resources. The resulting intervention showed a signal of effect with viral load reductions in youth with available data. Targeting compensatory strategies to enhance neurocognitive functioning may promote resilience and health outcomes. A randomized pilot study with a control condition is the next step.	1	0
30714984	Corticosteroids versus vestibular rehabilitation in long-term outcomes in vestibular neuritis.	The management strategy for functional recovery after vestibular neuritis (VN) has not yet been established. Therapeutic choices involve corticosteroids, vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) and the combination of corticosteroids with VRT. The present study aimed to compare the efficacy of corticosteroids, vestibular rehabilitation, and combination of them in terms of subjective and objective improvement in patients with VN. A prospective randomized study was conducted on 60 patients with acute vestibular neuritis within 3 days after symptom onset. The patients were divided into three groups; steroid group treated with corticosteroids (n = 20), VRT group (n = 20) managed with vestibular rehabilitation exercises and combination group (n = 20) received combined (corticosteroids and vestibular exercises). Groups were compared by caloric lateralization, vestibular myogenic potential amplitude asymmetry and Dizziness Handicap Inventory scores, both at presentation and up to 12 months. The study found no statistically significant difference between the three groups of the study at the end of the follow up period. Corticosteroids and VRT seem to be equivalently effective in patients with VN. The study proposes that corticosteroids may accelerate the recovery of VN, with no more beneficial role in the long-term prognosis of the disease.	1	0
30714985	Evaluation of the effectiveness of a Virtual Reality-based exercise program for Unilateral Peripheral Vestibular Deficit.	Recently, two types of movement sensors have been introduced into Virtual Reality (VR) therapy: motion trackers and force-plate platforms. Combining these two methods could produce better rehabilitation outcomes. Such devices, encompassing motion trackers and force platforms, are referred to as hybrid VR units. To assess the effectiveness of a low-cost hybrid VR based vestibular rehabilitation programMETHODS: A prospective, non-randomized, controlled group study comparing training using a hybrid VR unit (Group 1 n = 25) vs. static posturography with visual feedback (Group 2 n = 25) in patients with peripheral vestibular dysfunction was conducted. The subjects underwent 10 training sessions over 10 days (30 minute sessions). All were examined on a posturography platform at the start and 1 month after rehabilitation and completed the Vertigo Symptom Scale - Short Form (VSS-SF) questionnaire. Both groups demonstrated improvement in posturographic parameters, which were statistically significant, but when comparing results between both groups there were no differences. The patients reported improvement in their subjective perception of symptoms on the VSS-SF scale, which were statistically significant in both groups, but greater in the VR group. Both methods reduce postural sway, however subjective reduction of symptoms was greater in the VR group.	1	0
30721200	[Clinical and functional results of bifocal IOLs implanted during combined cataract and glaucoma surgery].	At present, implantation of multifocal IOLs in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) remains questionable. To comparatively analyze the clinical and functional effectiveness of bifocal IOLs implanted during combined cataract and glaucoma surgery. The prospective study included 41 patients (75 eyes) with presbyopia and POAG who underwent one-stage cataract phacoemulsification with implantation of a multifocal IOL and non-penetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) with lens capsule. Group 1 included 24 patients (44 eyes) with implantation of diffractive-refractive IOL. Group 2 consisted of 17 patients (31 eyes) who were implanted aspheric diffractive IOL with asymmetric optics. Mean IOP in both groups was 18.1±2.9 mmHg, and the difference with the preoperative parameters (26.1±2.8) was statistically significant (p<0.05). On average, the patients received 1.3±0.5 antihypertensive drugs compared to 2.4±0.61 before surgery (0.05<p<0.1). Near uncorrected visual acuity (nUCVA) in group 1 was 0.51±0.12 (p=0.009), in group 2 - 0.53±0.1 (p=0.01). Distant uncorrected visual acuity (dUCVA) was 0.59±0.09 (p=0.043) In group 1, and 0.57±0.04 (p=0.021) in group 2. Near best corrected visual acuity (nBCVA) in group 1 was 0.64±0.07, and 0.64±0.09 in group 2. In all studied groups postoperative nBCVA after 1 year of observation was significantly higher than before the surgery (p=0.006 and p=0.009 respectively). The main study goal (dBCVA=1.0 at 1 year after surgery) was achieved in 31.8% of cases in group 1 and in 29.1% of cases in group 2 (p>0.1). Implantation of multifocal IOLs in combination cataract and glaucoma surgery is a safe and effective surgical intervention for the described group of patients. В настоящее время остается дискутабельным вопрос о целесообразности имплантации мультифокальной интраокулярной линзы (ИОЛ) у пациентов с первичной открытоугольной глаукомой (ПОУГ).

Средний уровень внутриглазного давления (ВГД) в обеих группах составил 18,1±2,9 мм рт.ст., при этом разница с дооперационными показателями (26,1±2,8 мм рт.ст.) была статистически значима (p<0,05). В среднем пациенты принимали 1,3±0,5 гипотензивных препаратов по сравнению с 2,4±0,61 до операции (0,05<p<0,1). Некорригированная острота зрения вблизи (НКОЗб) в 1-й группе составила 0,51±0,12 (p=0,009), во 2-й - 0,53±0,1 (p=0,01). В 1-й группе НКОЗ вдаль (НКОЗд) составила 0,59±0,09 (p=0,043), во 2-й - 0,57±0,04 (p=0,021). Максимально корригированная острота зрения вблизи (МКОЗб) в 1-й группе составила 0,64±0,07, во 2-й - 0,64±0,09. Во всех исследуемых группах послеоперационная МКОЗб через 1 год наблюдений была значимо выше, чем до операции (p=0,006 и p=0,009 соответственно). Заключение. Основной конечный показатель исследования (МКОЗд=1,0 через 1 год после операции) достигнут в 31,8% случаев в 1-й группе и в 29,1% случаев - во 2-й (p>0,1). Имплантация мультифокальных ИОЛ в ходе комбинированной хирургии катаракты и глаукомы относится к безопасным и эффективным вмешательствам у данной категории пациентов.	1	0
30723421	Primary Clinical Evaluation of Photodynamic Therapy With Oral Leukoplakia in Chinese Patients.	Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has demonstrated promising results in the treatment of oral leukoplakia. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy and side effects of PDT in the treatment of Chinese patients with oral leukoplakia. Methods: Twenty-nine patients with oral leukoplakia were enrolled in this study, including patients with both homogenous and non-homogenous lesions and various dysplastic tissues. All patients received PDT using a 632 nm laser at 500 mW/cm2 power density at a dosage of 90-180 J/cm2 and with aminolevulinic acid (ALA) used as a photosensitizer. A fixing and restricting complex as well as high laser power density for PDT in oral cavity was applied. Results: An overall response rate of 86.2% was achieved in this study, including 55.2% complete remission and 31.0% partial remission. The only adverse events observed in subjects were transient local ulcer and pain. It is observed the PDT utilizing ALA showed strong effectiveness in patients with moderate to severe dysplasia, as less treatment time per cm2 of lesion is required. Conclusion: Topic ALA-PDT is effective to treat oral leukoplakia, especially for that with the presence of dysplasia. A fixing and restricting complex as well as high laser power density for PDT in oral cavity should be considered as an optimal choice.	1	0
30723717	Effects of High Carbohydrate vs. High Protein Pre-exercise Feedings on Psychophysiological Responses to High Intensity Interval Exercise in Overweight Perimenopausal Women.	Objective: To investigate (a) the acute effect of a bout of high intensity interval exercise (HIIE) on mood, cognitive function, and blood pressure in overweight perimenopausal women and (b) to compare the effects of high carbohydrate vs. high protein pre-HIIE feedings on exercise capacity, mood and cognitive function in this population. Methods: Twelve, overweight, perimenopausal women (age; 45.5 ± 2.3 years, body fat; 32.2 ± 2.1%) completed a bout of HIIE under 3 pre-exercise feedings (HCHO: high-carbohydrate-low-protein; LCHP: low-carbohydrate-high-protein; control: fasted) in a randomized crossover design. HIIE consisted of 4 intervals of 4 min walking at 85-90% of maximum heart rate and 3 min recovery. Before and after HIIE, the shortened version of the profile of mood state questionnaire, the exercise-induced feeling inventory questionnaire and three cognitive function tests (Stroop test, Shift Stroop test, n-back test) were administered. Blood pressure was measured pre- and post-exercise. Following HIIE a performance test to volitional fatigue was conducted. Results: A single bout of HIIE resulted in significant reductions in blood pressure and improvements in cognitive capacity (p < 0.05). Both the HCHO and LCHP feedings led to significantly longer exercise performance compared to CON (422 ± 71 s and 340 ± 46 vs. 240 ± 32 s, respectively, p < 0.01), with a 1.22-fold greater increase in performance time in HCHO compared to LCHP, although not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Only the HCHO trial improved total mood disturbance and positive engagement 1 h-post-exercise compared to CON (p < 0.05). HCHO and LCHP improved physical exhaustion and revitalization feelings post-exercise vs. CON (p < 0.01). Conclusions: A single HIIE session improves cognitive function and blood pressure in overweight perimenopausal women. High-carbohydrate pre-HIIE feedings can result in greater enhancements in mood and positive engagement to exercise and may improve exercise performance compared to a high-protein meal.	1	0
30724627	Radiofrequency endometrial ablation for treating heavy menstrual bleeding in women with chronic renal failure.	The study objective was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency endometrial ablation in treating heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women with chronic renal failure (CRF). Fifty-eight patients with CRF undergoing radiofrequency endometrial ablation in our hospital between January 2013 and July 2017 and for whom complete follow-up data were available were included. Outcome measures included amenorrhea, treatment failure and operative complications. The mean patient age was 41.4 ± 7.7 years, the mean preoperative hemoglobin level was 69.6 ± 19.3 g/dL, the mean preoperative serum creatinine level was 879.1 ± 415.4 µmol/L, and the mean urea level was 18.2 ± 7.1 mmol/L. The mean treatment time for radiofrequency endometrial ablation was 61.7 ± 18.8 s. The median volume of estimated blood loss during the procedure was 10 mL (a range of 2-50 mL). On average, the study subjects were monitored for 24.4 months (a range of 6-60 months). The average amenorrhea rate was 89.7%. Only 2 (3.4%) patients required additional gynecologic surgery after endometrial ablation. Intra- and postoperative complications were not observed. Radiofrequency endometrial ablation was demonstrated to be safe and effective for the treatment of HMB in women with CRF.	1	0
30731463	Intra-Arterial Thrombolysis Improves the Prognosis of Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients without Large Vessel Occlusion.	Intravenous thrombolysis is known as the only effective reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by small branches occlusion. However, it is still unclear whether intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) is safe and effective for patients without detectable arterial occlusion. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of IAT in these patients. Data were collected on consecutive patients from December 2012 to February 2017 at the Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. AIS patients without large artery occlusion during digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were divided into 2 groups: (1) Intra-arterial urokinase thrombolysis group (UK group): received intra-arterial urokinase thrombolysis treatment; (2) Control group: cerebral angiography examination only. The primary outcome was 3-month favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2). A total of 48 patients received urokinase thrombolysis, and 34 patients underwent DSA examination only. The UK group had more frequent favorable functional outcomes (70.8 vs. 50%, p = 0.032) at 3-month follow-up and higher score of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement on the second day (p = 0.007). One patient (2%) had symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and 3 patients (6.3%) had asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (asICH) in the UK group. One patient (3.3%) had asICH in the control group. There were no significant differences about ICH. AIS caused by small branches occlusion could benefit from intra-arterial urokinase thrombolysis, and the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage was not significantly higher.	1	0
30737920	[Evaluation of the therapeutic impact of selected physiotherapy treatments on the treatment of lymphoedema and the assessment of the state of knowledge on risk factors, information acquisition and prophylaxis against women after surgical treatment of breast cancer].	Introduction: Breast cancer is a disease with high incidence. In Poland, it is the most common cause of death among cancer in women. A common method of treatment is a breast-saving procedure or its radical removal along with nearby lymph nodes. The most common complication after resection is lymphoedema. The aim: The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of a selected series of physiotherapy treatments to reduce lymphoedema in women after surgical treatment of breast cancer, assessment of risk factors in women after surgical treatment of breast cancer, assessment of how women collect information on the prevention of lymphoedema, evaluation of women after mastectomy surgery to prevent the formation of lymphoedema. Materials and methods: The study involved 43 patients with lymphoedema after surgical treatment of breast cancer. Patients' own questionnaire was performed and two upper limb circumferences were measured (before and after the end of a series of physiotherapy treatments). Results: In 43 examined women (100&) after the surgery associated with the occurrence of breast cancer, lymphatic edema of the upper limb on the operated side occurred. Edema of the entire limb appeared in 25 subjects (58.14&), and in the arm and forearm, 10 patients (23.26&), arm and forearm in 8 women (18.60&). Edema occurred in different period from the time of surgery and affected a different area. After the therapy, the patients were found to have reduced limb circumferences of the operated side at all levels. The largest decrease was observed at level III (10 cm below the elbow) on average by 1.75 cm, and the smallest at level I (in the medial part of the metacarpus excluding the thumb). Conclusions: Physiotherapy treatments have a significant impact on the reduction of lymphatic edema in women after surgical treatment of breast cancer. In women after mastectomy, there is no basic knowledge about risk factors for lymphoedema. Physicians have the largest share in the education of women after mastectomy. The most common actions in the field of anti-oedematous prophylaxis are kinesitherapy, automassage and proper posture position with high laying of the upper limb on the operated side.	1	0
30737921	[Chemotherapy in colon cancer].	The aim of the study is to improve the overall survival rates of patients with colon cancer, analyzing the results of chemotherapy in municipal institution «Precarpathian Clinical Oncology Center» and determining the appropriate scheme of chemotherapy in correlation with the stage of the disease. Materials and methods: The basis of the study was the results of the observation of 973 patients with colon cancer (CC). The direct and long-term results of chemotherapy of colon cancer were studied and evaluated. All patients were divided according to the stage of the disease (TNM system). Patients with Stage II, III and IV colon cancer were included into the study. Within each stage of CC patients were divided into groups, depending on the received chemotherapy (FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, XELOX, Mejo, or phthorafurum). The overall survival rate of patients was determined within each stages of colon cancer, the treatment received and the total number of patients. Results: In patients with Stage IV CC, FOLFIRI and FOLFOX prevailed in chemotherapy - 40.7& and 37.3& respectively. 8.5& of patients received XELOX and 6.8& of patients received Mejo. The same percentage of patients received monotherapy with phthorafurum. In chemotherapy most of the patients with Stage III CC received FOLFOX - 42.9&, FOLFIRI and Mejo- 18.1& and 27.6& of patients respectively. Another 10.5& of patients received mono-chemotherapy with phthorafurum. In chemotherapy of patients with Stage II CC, most patients received Mejo and mono-chemotherapy with phthorafurum.- 28.8& and 32.2& of patients. FOLFOX was received by 18.4& of patients, FOLFIRI - by 13.8&, and XELOX - by 5.9& of patients. Conclusions: In patients with Stage II CC Mejo was the most effective PCT scheme - the highest percentage of patients who survived in a 5- year observation. In patients with StageIII CC, the same index is the best in the group of patients who received FOLFOX. In patients with Stage IV CC FOLFIRI was the most effective (the highest percentage of patients who survived) in a one-, two- and three-year observation.	1	0
30737926	[An assessment of the effectiveness of comprehensive neurorehabilitation in patients after ischemic stroke].	Introduction: Comprehensive rehabilitation after stroke is to help the patient recover optimal physical and mental condition. The multidirectional approach to the patient implemented by a multidisciplinary team: physicians, physiotherapists, neurologopedians and neuropsychologists allows the best use of the patient's potential. The aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of comprehensive neurological rehabilitation of patients after ischemic stroke. Materials and methods: The 90 patients after ischemic stroke were examined. The first examined group (45 people) consisted of patients rehabilitated at the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the WAM University Hospital in Lodz. The second examined group number (45 people) consisted of patients waiting for admission to the Department of Rehabilitation, who were rehabilitated in environmental conditions. The patients were examined twice: first before the rehabilitation (study I) and then at the end of rehabilitation program (study II). The ADL Index by Barthel was used to assess the functional status of the patients. In addition, speech disorders (SODA scale) and emotional state (Beck Depression Scale) were assessed in patients. Results: Both individuals after stroke rehabilitated in hospital and those rehabilitated in environmental conditions achieved a significant improvement in activities of daily living and improvement in speech - symptoms of aphasia were withdrawn. However, only stroke patients rehabilitated in hospital conditions achieved a significant improvement in the emotional state. Conclusions: Stroke patients rehabilitated in hospital conditions have significantly improved their functional status and emotional state compared to patients rehabilitated in environmental conditions.	1	0
30739891	Research Advocacy Training Program Benefits Diverse Older Adults in Participation, Self-Efficacy and Attitudes toward Research.	Developing a Research Participation Enhancement and Advocacy Training Program for Diverse Seniors (DREAMS) is a two-part health education (part 1 [DP1]) and research advocacy training (part 2 [DP2]) program grounded in CBPR principles designed to address underrepresentation of socioeconomically disadvantaged and/or minority older adults in research. We examine the effects of DREAMS on health literacy, psychosocial function, beliefs/attitudes toward research, and self-efficacy in diverse older adults age 65 and older who completed only part 1 of DREAMS (n = 51) versus those who completed both parts 1 and 2 (DREAMS Team [DT]; n = 24). We hypothesized that benefits would be observed in both groups, with greater benefits seen among DT completers versus those who completed only part 1. Participants completed pre- and post-course questionnaires, including a satisfaction survey. DREAMS versus DT data were analyzed and compared using t tests, χ2 tests, analyses of variance/repeated measures analyses of variance, and Mann-Whitney U tests as appropriate. Themes were identified from open-ended survey questions and provide context for quantitative data. Findings showed significant group × time interaction in depression, participation/autonomy, and physical composite scores as well as trends toward improved attitudes toward research participation (P = .07), decreased depression (P &lt; .001), and increased participation (P = .03) of the DT group. Results from the satisfaction questionnaire indicated that both programs were well-received. Findings provide strong evidence of DREAMS and particularly the DT's success in achieving our key objectives.	1	0
30740067	Decision-Making Deficits Are Associated With Learning Impairments in Female College Students at High Risk for Anorexia Nervosa: Iowa Gambling Task and Prospect Valence Learning Model.	This study investigated deficits in decision-making ability in female college students at high risk for anorexia nervosa (AN) using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the prospect valence learning (PVL) model. Based on scores on the Korean version of the Eating Attitude Test-26 (KEAT-26), participants were assigned to either the high risk for AN group (n = 42) or the control group (n = 43). The high risk for AN group exhibited significantly lower total net scores and block net scores on the third, fourth, and fifth blocks of the IGT than the control group did. The high risk for AN group selected cards significantly more often from the disadvantageous A and B decks and less often from the advantageous D deck than the control group did. In addition, the block net scores of the high risk for AN group did not differ across the five blocks, whereas those of the control group increased as the trials progressed. There was a significant negative correlation between IGT total net score and total score on the KEAT-26. The high risk for AN group had significantly lower values than the control group on the learning and response consistency parameters of the PVL model. These results indicate that female college students at high risk for AN have deficits in decision-making ability, and that these deficits are related to difficulties in remembering experience obtained from earlier trials and applying it to later trials. These difficulties further lead them to make decisions randomly.	1	0
30740192	Sustained Intervention Effects on Older Adults' Attitudes Towards Alcohol and Medication Interactions.	Older adults are at risk for experiencing alcohol and medication interactions (AMI) given concomitant alcohol and medication use. However, there have been limited efforts to develop and evaluate AMI prevention interventions. The current study examined sustained intervention effects on older adults' attitudes, awareness, and intentions regarding AMI. A sample of N = 134 older adults completed assessments before and after exposure to AMI risk educational materials (Times 1 and 2). N = 97 participants (72%) were reached for a three-month follow-up phone call (Time 3). There was a positive linear trend over time in the number of identified AMI side effects. While knowledge of intervention messages remained high and stable over time, quadratic trends for perceived importance of AMI messages indicated positive short-term effects that did not sustain over time. Few differences by drinking status were found. This intervention had positive short-term effects on AMI awareness, intentions, and perceived messaging importance, but these short-term effects were only maintained over time for awareness. This study provides Certified Health Education Specialists with a model for planning and evaluating a brief intervention to prevent AMI among older adults.	1	0
30745885	Bone Status in Obese, Non-diabetic, Antipsychotic-Treated Patients, and Effects of the Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist Exenatide on Bone Turnover Markers and Bone Mineral Density.	Background: Low bone mineral density (BMD) may constitute an underestimated comorbidity in schizophrenia patients undergoing long-term antipsychotic treatment. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are antidiabetic drugs, which may also affect bone turnover. Methods: In planned secondary analyses of a 3 months, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n = 45), we explored effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide 2 mg once-weekly (n = 23), or placebo (n = 22) on bone turnover markers (BTMs) and BMD in chronic, obese, antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Baseline BTMs were compared to sex- and age-adjusted reference values from a Danish population cohort, and T- and Z-scores were calculated for BMD. Results: In women (n = 24), all baseline BTM measurements of procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) and C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) were within reference values. In men (n = 21), 5% displayed lower PINP and 14% displayed lower CTX. One patient displayed BMD Z-score < -2, and 23% of patients (17% of women and 29% of men) displayed -2.5 < T-scores < -1 indicating osteopenia, but none had osteoporosis. After treatment, PINP decreased at trend level significance (P = 0.05), and body mass index BMD increased for L2-L4 (P = 0.016). No changes in bone markers were significant after correction for mean prolactin levels. Conclusions: Sex- and age-adjusted measures of bone status in chronic, obese, antipsychotic-treated patients appeared comparable to the reference population. Subtle changes in bone markers during 3 months exenatide treatment may suggest beneficial effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on bone status in antipsychotic-treated patients, and further studies should consider the potential influence of prolactin.	1	0
30756094	Economic evaluation plan of a randomised controlled trial of intra-nodular injection of anti-TNF and placebo among patients with early Dupuytren's disease: Repurposing Anti-TNF for Treating Dupuytren's Disease (RIDD).	Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a common fibroproliferative condition of the palmar and digital fascia of the hand; however, there is currently no approved treatment for early stage DD. The objective of this paper is to describe the methods applied to assess the cost-effectiveness of adalimumab injections compared to usual care for controlling the progression of early stage DD in the Repurposing Anti-TNF for Treating Dupuytren's Disease (RIDD) trial. Measure of effectiveness and resource use will be obtained from a randomised clinical trial, carried out in three healthcare centres, and recruiting a minimum of 138 patients aged 18 years and above with a diagnosis of early stage DD. Resource use and utility measures (quality-adjusted life years) will be collected at 3, 6, 9, 12 (primary outcome endpoint) and 18 months post-randomisation. A within-trial cost-utility analysis (CUA) will be conducted at 12 months and if the intervention is effective, a decision analytic model will be applied to estimate the lifetime effectiveness and costs. The analysis will be performed from a health system (National Health Service and personal social services) perspective. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess the robustness of the results. RIDD is the first randomised controlled trial with an economic evaluation conducted among patients with early stage DD. The protocol described here records our intent to conduct both a within-trial CUA alongside the RIDD study and a lifetime CUA using decision-analytic modelling.	0	1
30760189	Real World Patient-reported Outcomes in HIV-infected Adults Switching to EVIPLERA®, Because of a Previous Intolerance to cART. PRO-STR Study.	To investigate the impact of switching from stable Combined Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) to single-tablet regimen (RPV/FTC/TDF=EVIPLERA® /COMPLERA®) on patient- reported outcomes in HIV-infected adults who cannot tolerate previous cART, in a real-world setting. PRO-STR is a 48-week observational, prospective, multicenter study. Presence and magnitude of symptoms (main endpoint), health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), adherence, satisfaction with treatment and patient preferences were assessed. Three hundred patients with 48-week follow-up, who switched to EVIPLERA® (mean age: 46.6 years; male: 74.0%; 74.7% switched from a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase-inhibitor, 25.3% from a protease inhibitor + ritonavir) were included. There was no statistical difference in median CD4+ cell count (baseline: 678.5 cells/mm3; 48-week: 683.0 cells/mm3) neither in virological suppression (≤50 copies/mL) (baseline: 98.3%; 48-week: 95.3%). The most frequent reasons for switching were neuropsychiatric (62.3%), gastrointestinal (19.3%) and biochemical/metabolic (19.3%) events. Only 7.7% of patients permanently discontinued therapy. At 48-week, all outcomes showed an improvement compared to baseline. Overall, there was a significant decrease (pvalue≤ 0.05) in number and magnitude of symptoms, while HRQoL, satisfaction and adherence improved significantly. Most patients prefered EVIPLERA® than previous cART. According to the type of intolerance, HRQoL was improved, but only significantly in patients with neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms. Adherence improved significantly in patients with metabolic disturbances and satisfaction with EVIPLERA® was higher in the three groups. Switching to EVIPLERA® from non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase-inhibitor or protease inhibitor-based regimens due to toxicity, improved the presence/magnitude of symptoms, HRQoL, and preference with treatment. EVIPLERA® maintained a virological response, CD4+ cell count and maintained or improved adherence.	1	0
30761009	A Novel Approach to Better Characterize Medication Adherence in Oral Anticancer Treatments.	Purpose: This study aims to describe a 12-month medication adherence with oral anticancer medications (OAMs) in a routine care medication adherence program, and to better characterize non-persistence. Patients and methods:In this observational, one-centered, longitudinal study, medication adherence was monitored electronically while patients were taking part in a medication adherence program for 12 months or until treatment stop. Patients were >18 years and starting or taking one of the following OAMs: letrozole, exemestane, imatinib, sunitinib, capecitabine, or temozolomide. Non-persistence was defined as any premature treatment interruption due to patient's unilateral decision or to a medical decision because of adverse effects. The Kaplan Meier survival function estimate was used to characterize persistence, and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were adopted to fit implementation. Statistical analyses were performed using the R software package. Results: Forty-three outpatients with various tumor entities were enrolled. Reasons for quitting the medication adherence program and/or OAM medication were characterized as OAM discontinuation due to adverse effects or toxicity (n = 5), planned OAM completion time (n = 10), OAM failure (cancer relapse) (n = 5) and non-compliance to the adherence program (n = 3). In persistent patients, the implementation rates were high (from 98% at baseline to 97% at 12 months). The probability of being persistent at 12 months was estimated at 85%. Conclusion: A better characterization of both persistence and implementation to OAMs in real life settings is crucial for understanding and optimizing medication adherence to OAMs. The complex identification of non-persistence underlines the need to carefully and prospectively assess OAM interruption or treatment switch reasons. The GEE analysis for describing implementation to OAMs will allow researchers and professionals to take advantage of the richness of longitudinal real-time data, to avoid reducing such data through thresholds and to put them into perspective with OAM blood levels.	0	1
30761186	Impact of Rental Assistance on Modifiable Health Risk Factors and Behaviors in Adults.	Housing may influence health through various mechanisms and is recognized as a social determinant of health. This study investigated the influence of rental assistance on modifiable health risk factors and behaviors using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Participants receiving rental assistance were compared with participants not receiving rental assistance on body mass index (BMI), obesity, smoking, alcohol use and physical activity. Participants (N=1374) were age 18 to 62, head of household, and had not received rental assistance for four years prior to baseline. Treatment group participants (N=116) received rental assistance between baseline and the two-year follow-up. Comparison group participants (N=1258) were eligible for rental assistance two years after baseline but did not receive assistance. Models estimated the average treatment effect on treated (ATET) for each health indicator in each follow-up year. Participants were matched on age, race-ethnicity, gender, education, disability status, employment, household income and number of children in the household. At the two-year follow-up, smoking was significantly higher among treatment group participants. A sensitivity analysis excluding permanently disabled participants showed significantly higher obesity in the treatment group two years after baseline. No significant differences were found four or six years after baseline on any outcome. Rental assistance was associated with increased smoking and obesity two years after baseline, but did not influence BMI, alcohol consumption, or physical activity. Interventions to reduce smoking and obesity may improve the health of individuals who receive rental assistance.	0	1
30767481	[Incidence of adverse events associated with the peripheral venous catheter in a Tunisian university hospital].	To determine the incidence of peripheral venous catheters-related adverse events (PVCAEs). We conducted a prospective observational study in the cardiology department over a period of 3 months. All inserted PVCs were monitored (every 12 hours) from insertion to up to 48 hours after removal. Data were analyzed for 148 patients with a mean age of 63.37±12.26 years and male predominance (n=76, 51.4%). The most common medical history was high blood pressure (56.1%) followed by obesity (39.2%). Intake of antibiotics was noted in 16.2% of cases where amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most prescribed molecule (4.1%). A total of 210 PVCs was studied (794 PVC-days). The mean maintenance time was 5.36±3.95 days. 38 PVCs resulted in 70 AEs with an incidence of 33.33 % (8.81 per 1000 PVC-days). The most common complication was pain (n=35, 50%), followed by mechanical PVCAEs (n=22, 31.42%). The incidence of PVCAEs remains high. The analysis of the main risk factors for these AEs would make better the identification of the preventive actions that should be undertaken.	1	0
30774976	Accumulated or continuous exercise for glycaemic regulation and control: a systematic review with meta-analysis.	To compare the effectiveness of accumulating exercise in multiple bouts of at least 10 min throughout a day with exercise completed in a single bout (continuous or interval), or no exercise, on glycaemic control and regulation in inactive people without diagnosed glycaemic dysfunction. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Seven electronic databases were searched: CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane Library, EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE 1948-(Ovid), SCOPUS (Elsevier), SPORTDiscus (EBSCO) and Web of Science (ISI) with no restrictions on date and included all titles indexed up to February 2018. Articles reporting insufficiently active adults (19 to 64 years) without metabolic dysfunction, measuring glycaemic control or regulation following at least 6 weeks of aerobic exercise. Only one study compared accumulated exercise to single-bout exercise with no significant effect on fasting glucose (95% CI: -0.04 to 0.24 mmol·L-1) or fasting insulin (95% CI: -1.79 to 9.85 pmol·L-1) reported 48 hours after the final bout. No studies compared accumulated exercise with no-exercise. Compared with no-exercise, single-bout exercise reduces insulin resistance (mean difference (MD): -0.53 pmol·L-1; 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.13). Insulin resistance was clearly reduced with moderate-intensity (-0.68 (-1.28 to -0.09)) but not with high-intensity (-0.38 (-1.20 to 0.44)) exercise. Single-bout exercise was not statistically more beneficial than no-exercise for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD: -0.11 %; 95% CI: -0.24 to 0.02) in metabolically healthy individuals. The glycaemic response to accumulated exercise or single-bout exercise might not be different, however exercise intensity might influence the mechanisms generating the response. CRD42015025042.	1	0
30775606	Autogenously derived regenerative cell therapy for venous leg ulcers.	Venous leg ulcers (VLUs), which arise from chronic venous insufficiency in the lower limbs, are a major cause of morbidity and significantly negatively impact patients' health-related quality of life. Treatment of venous ulcers can be either conservative or surgical. Despite appropriate treatment, VLUs can be resistant to healing. Clinical results of treatment of venous foot ulcers with adipose-derived autologous stem cells, which did not improve despite the surgical treatment of the underlying venous pathology in the following case series, are reported. Between April 2015 and January 2016, a total of 31 patients who had undergone surgery for underlying venous pathology but the venous ulcer had not healed were included in the study. The mean venous ulcer size was 3.6-6.2 cm (range: 2 to 8 cm by 3 to 9 cm). All patients were treated with adipose-derived autologous stem cells prepared using the MyStem Regenerative Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Purification Kit (MyStem LLC, USA). The ulcer diameter was measured and recorded in the third, sixth and twelfth months. The follow-up time was 12 months after ulcer healing. Eighteen ulcers demonstrated complete healing at the 12th month. Thirteen ulcers exhibited serious contraction and epithelialization even though the ulcer was not completely closed. At the 12th month, the ulcer size was reduced by 96.00 ±1.74% in these patients. The reduction in the ulcer area based on the month analyzed was significant (p = 0.001; p < 0.01). After the ulcers healed, the patients were followed for recurrence for one year. Recurrent ulcers were observed at the treated sites in 3 of 31 patients (9%). No adverse events, such as infection, inflammation, or tissue reactions, were observed. Application of cell therapy in venous leg ulcer is currently used exclusively in patients not responding to the standard treatment. Autogenously derived regenerative cell therapy for VLUs can be considered as an additional treatment to primary surgical therapy.	1	0
30775609	Influence of internal mammary artery retractor on postoperative patient comfort and quality of life.	Patients experience muscle, joint and shoulder pain after heart surgery. We aimed to compare quality of life in 2 groups of patients, one group having an internal mammary artery (IMA) retractor during surgery, the second group undergoing non-coronary heart surgery. Group 1 was composed of 39 patients receiving an IMA retractor whereas in group 2 there were 29 patients. Patients in groups were compared for postoperative quality of life, shoulder pain, functional status, strength and patient satisfaction. Visual analog scale (VAS) assessment, pain localization, quality of life SF-36 form, and University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) functional shoulder scoring were applied in both groups. Mean VAS score in group 1 was significantly higher than in group 2. Only the vitality measure mean score was not significantly different in SF-36 assessment; however, in group 2 physical function and mental health scale mean scores were higher and the pain scale mean score was lower than in group 1. The total UCLA score and UCLA subgroups of pain, function, active flexion angle and strength revealed a statistically significant difference between groups. Patients in whom an IMA retractor was not utilized during surgery exhibited better results in physical functions, emotional status, and shoulder pain in the postoperative period.	0	1
30777831	Does Traction Decrease the Need for Open Reduction in Femoral Shaft Fractures Treated Within 24 Hours?	This study evaluates whether preoperative skeletal traction reduces the need for open reduction in femoral shaft fractures treated with intramedullary nailing (IMN) within 24 hours. A retrospective review was conducted of femoral shaft fractures undergoing IMN within 1 day of admission. Primary outcome was an open reduction at the time of IMN. Secondary outcomes were blood loss and transfusion requirements. One hundred eighty-four patients were analyzed, 106 in the knee immobilizer group and 78 in the skeletal traction group. Skeletal traction did not reduce the need for an open reduction. The knee immobilizer group required open reduction in 13% (14/106) compared with 14% (11/78) in the skeletal traction group, which was not significant (p $=$ .89). Blood loss and transfusion rates were similar between groups. Skeletal traction does not appear to reduce the need for open reduction at the time of IMN for femoral shaft fractures treated within 1 day of admission.

30778398	Treatment Effects following Residential Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Adolescents with Borderline Personality Disorder.	Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an empirically supported treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD) in adults, however fewer studies have examined outcomes in adolescents. This study tested the effectiveness of an intensive 1-month, residential DBT treatment for adolescent girls meeting criteria for BPD. Additionally, given well-established associations between BPD symptoms and childhood abuse, the impact of abuse on treatment outcomes was assessed. Participants were female youth (n = 53) aged 13-20 years (M = 17.00, SD = 1.89) completing a 1-month residential DBT program. At pre-treatment, participants were administered a diagnostic interview and self-report measures assessing BPD, depression, and anxiety symptom severity. Following one month of treatment, participants were re-administered the self-report instruments. Results showed significant pre- to post-treatment reductions in both BPD and depression symptom severity with large effects. However, there was no significant change in general anxious distress or anxious arousal over time. The experience of childhood abuse (sexual, physical, or both) was tested as moderator of treatment effectiveness. Although experiencing multiple types of abuse was related to symptom severity, abuse did not moderate the effects of treatment. Collectively, results indicate that a 1-month residential DBT treatment with adolescents may result in reductions in BPD and depression severity but is less effective for anxiety. Moreover, while youth reporting abuse benefitted from treatment, they were less likely to achieve a clinically significant reduction in symptoms.	1	0
30788374	Periodontal therapy as an adjunctive modality for HbA1c reduction in type-2 diabetic patients.	This study aimed to evaluate the role of nonsurgical periodontal therapy in improving glycemic control among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Adult T2DM patients with mild-to-moderate periodontal disease, reporting to a tertiary care diabetes center in South India, from January to June 2014, were enrolled in the study. Medical management of T2DM along with diet and physical exercise was an inclusion criterion. Patients with factors affecting periodontal health and an inability to follow-up were excluded from the study. All patients underwent nonsurgical periodontal therapy (scaling, root planing, and irrigation of chlorhexidine [0.12%]). Periodontal status and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were assessed preoperatively and 6 months posttreatment. Dental status, diabetic history, and demographic characteristics were recorded to evaluate confounding roles. A total of 266 T2DM patients (91 females/175 males; mean age 47.65 ± 5.93 years/range 25-55 years), fulfilling the inclusion criteria, were enrolled. The mean pre- and post-treatment HbA1c levels were respectively, 8.44 ± 1.87 and 7.98 ± 1.81, with a mean reduction of 0.46 ± 0.26 (P < 0.001). Significant HbA1c reduction (P < 0.001) was observed in patients with good pretreatment glycemic control (0.54 ± 0.26; 7.9%), regular follow-up (0.51 ± 0.28; 6.2%), and good oral hygiene (0.60 ± 0.49; 8.0%). Nonsurgical periodontal therapy is associated with significant HbA1c reduction among T2DM patients with mild-to-moderate periodontitis after a 6-month follow-up period.	1	0
30799895	Assessment of psychological disorders in Egyptian children with hearing impairment.	Impairment of hearing is a common birth defect which may be associated with varieties of psychological abnormalities in childhood. Knowledge and research of such issue are much lacking in Egypt; so the aim of the current study was to characterize and assess various psychological co-morbidities which could occur among hearing-impaired children. This prospective study has been conducted on a total of 40 male children, with age range between 7 and 12 years, divided into two groups. Group I included 20 children with different degrees of hearing impairment (HI), and Group II included 20 age-matched, healthy children with normal hearing. The studied children have been recruited from two schools (Al Amal School for the Deaf and Dumb, and Copts School) at Minia City, Minia Governorate, Egypt. Psychometric assessment, electroencephalography (EEG), and audiological evaluation were done for all included children. EEG abnormalities and anxiety scores were significantly higher in patients group compared with controls (p < 0.05); however, intelligence quotient did not differ. The present study revealed that HI is associated with psychological and EEG abnormalities. Early management of these children is expected to improve their quality of life.	0	1
30800006	The effect of inhaled steroids on the intraocular pressure.	Steroids are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, but little is known about the effect of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there is a clinically significant association between inhalational steroids and intraocular pressure (IOP). This was a cross-sectional, case-control study performed at St John's Medical College, Bengaluru, India, from October 2013 to July 2015 of 200 patients using 800 mcg of budesonide or its equivalent dose of ICS and 200 healthy controls not using any form of steroids. Patients using ICS for a period of at least 6 months with no usage of oral or topical steroids within the last 3 months were included as cases. Age- and sex-matched controls were recruited from among the general patient population of the ophthalmological department. IOP and central corneal thickness (CCT) were analyzed. Cases were divided into two subgroups. Group 1 had IOP of <21 mm Hg and cup-to-disc ratio of <0.5. Group 2 had IOP of ≥21 mm Hg or cup-to-disc ratio of ≥0.5 or cup-disc asymmetry ≥0.2. These two subgroups were analyzed to determine whether there was an increased risk of developing ocular hypertension or glaucoma with extended use of ICS. A total of 400 subjects participated, with 200 in each group. The mean IOP of cases was 15.31 ± 3.27 mm Hg, statistically significantly higher than the mean of 13.39 mm Hg ± 1.95 in controls (P < 0.001). The mean CCT in cases was 522.02 ± 30.47 μm, lower than the mean of 528.73 ± 29.09 μm of the control group (P > 0.001). Of the 200 cases, 11 (5.5%) had ocular hypertension and 2 (1%) had open-angle glaucoma. There was no statistically significant correlation between duration of inhaled steroids usage and increase in IOP (P = 0.62). There was no development of ocular hypertension or glaucoma among the controls. Our findings suggest a probable association between ICS and IOP and that it may be advisable to measure baseline IOPs and CCT and to follow patients on ICS at regular intervals.	1	0
30800193	Prostate artery embolisation: an initial experience from an Indian perspective.	The study aims to report our very early experience with prostate artery embolisation in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) in an Indian setting. This prospective study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Review Board, and informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Four patients with lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia underwent prostate embolisation. Embolisation was performed using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL) score, postvoid residual volume, and prostate volume was recorded in each patient for 12 months. No major complications were seen in any patient. Four patients with a mean age of 74.2 years underwent prostate artery embolisation. It was successful in all the cases. Bilateral embolisation was performed in three patients and unilateral approach in one patient. Clinical improvement was characterised by a mean prostate volume reduction of 22% and mean IPSS reduction of 30% at 12-month follow-up. The initial experience with prostate embolisation has been very rewarding and is a great alternative treatment for BPH. It is a very safe and effective procedure and can be an ideal procedure from an Indian perspective.	1	0
30804822	Influencing Side-Effects to Medicinal Treatments: A Systematic Review of Brief Psychological Interventions.	Background: Nocebo effects contribute to a large proportion of the non-specific side-effects attributed to medications and are mainly generated through negative expectations. Previous reviews show that interventions designed to change participants' expectations have a small effect on pain experience. They are also effective in reducing side-effects caused by exposure to sham medications. To date, there has been no review of the influence of such interventions on symptoms attributed to real medicinal treatments. Objective: To review studies using a randomized controlled design testing the effect of brief psychological interventions compared to usual practice on the side-effect experience to medicinal treatments in healthy volunteers and patients. Methods: We searched Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Cochrane CENTRAL using search terms for randomized controlled trials along with nocebo, placebo effect, medication, side-effects, and associated terms. Studies were eligible if they studied a human population, used an active medicine, delivered a brief psychological intervention intended to influence side-effect reporting compared to usual care or no intervention, and used a randomized controlled design. Because of the heterogeneity of the literature we used a narrative synthesis and assessed evidence quality using the GRADE approach. Results: Our database search and supplementary search of the reference sections of included studies retrieved 50,140 citations. After screening, full text review and manual reference searches, 27 studies were included. The quality of the studies and evidence was judged to be low. The strongest and most consistent effect came from omitting side-effect information, although surprisingly de-emphasizing side-effects did not affect side-effect reporting. Other techniques, including priming, distraction, and altering the perception of branding, produced mixed results. Conclusion: Brief psychological interventions can influence side-effect reporting to active medications. Research is currently investigating new ways to de-emphasize side-effects whilst still upholding informed consent, but larger confirmatory trials with suitable control groups are needed. The literature in this area would be improved by more detailed reporting of studies.	0	1
30815114	Investigating a Needle-Based Epidural Procedure in Obstetric Anesthesia.	This study investigates the safety and efficacy of a large-dose, needle-based epidural technique in obstetric anesthesia. The technique differs from a standard, catheter-based approach in that the anesthetic dose is administered through an epidural needle prior to insertion of the epidural catheter. Using a data-driven informatics and machine learning approach, our findings show that the needle-based technique is faster and more dose-effective in achieving sensory level. We also find that injecting large doses in the epidural space through the epidural needle is safe, with complication rates similar to those reported in published literature for catheter-based technique. Further, machine learning reveals that if the needle dose is kept under 18 ml, the resulting hypotension rate will be significantly lower than published results. The machine learning framework can predict the incidence of hypotension with 85% accuracy. The findings from this investigation facilitate delivery improvement and establish an improved clinical practice guideline for training and for dissemination of safe practice.	1	0
30815426	Changes in the size of the thyroid in patients with benign non-toxic multinodular goiter after radioactive iodine therapy.	Background: Multinodular goiter (MNG) is regarded as one of the most common causes of hyperthyroidism, particularly in areas of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency. The present study aims to explore the effects of the radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy on benign non-toxic MNG and evaluate its side effects. Methods: Patients with benign non-toxic MNG entered the study. Ultrasonography was applied to calculate the percentage of the decrease in the size of the thyroid before and six months minimum after the treatment. Chi-square, Mann-Whiteny-U and T-test were done using SPSS v.18.0 (p<0.05). Results: The volumes of the thyroid lobes and nodules decreased significantly due to RAI therapy (p<0.001). The total volume of the thyroid, volume of the right nodule, and volume of the left nodule decreased by 77.8%, 40.7%, and 34.6% respectively. Conclusion: According to the results of the current study, RAI therapy is an effective treatment method although it has short-term side effects. This treatment option is recommended for patients with benign non-toxic MNG, notably those who cannot be a candidate for surgery. This treatment affects the size of the thyroid and its nodules significantly and decreases almost all of the complications.	1	0
30820008	Quality of Life in Adolescent Boys with Idiopathic Short Stature: Positive Impact of Growth Hormone and Aromatase Inhibitors.	The combination of growth hormone (GH) and aromatase inhibitors (AI) improves linear growth in severely short adolescent boys; however, the effects of this intervention on quality of life (QoL) are unknown. This study assesses whether GH, AI, or their combination impacts the QoL of adolescent males with idiopathic short stature (ISS) from both the adolescent and the parent perspective. A randomized open-label comparator trial was conducted in 76 pubertal males with ISS who received AI, GH, or AI/GH for 24 months. The condition-specific Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth questionnaire was used to assess QoL. QoL scores were low at baseline in the children's and parents' reports. Within-group testing showed that total QoL scores increased significantly at 24 months in the GH and AI/GH group but not the AI group in the children's report, whereas it increased in all of the groups in the parents' report. Increases in QoL scores were associated with an increase in height SDS. Treatment with GH and AI/GH was associated with improved QoL scores as measured from both the patients' and the parents' perspectives, suggesting that the improved growth resulting from the use of these growth-promoting therapies has beneficial psychosocial effects in adolescent males with ISS followed for 24 months.	1	0
30839859	Treatment for HIV prevention study in southwestern areas of China.	China has ambitious to achieve significant reductions in HIV transmission and HIV-related mortality by adopting the World Health Organization's Treat All approach. Such a prevention strategy is needed future study on regional scale. An observational cohort study of HIV epidemiology and treatment databases was used to study the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy on the transmission of HIV in serodiscordant couples in Guangxi of China. A total of 7713 couples were entered into the cohort study analysis which included 1885 couples in the treatment-naive cohort and 5828 couples in the treated cohort. During the follow-up of 18985.29 person-years from 2003 to 2014, the average incidence of HIV was 2.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI 2.1-2.6). HIV seroincidence rate was significantly higher among the treatment naive group (4.2 per 100 person-years, 3.7-4.8) compared with the on treatment group (1.6 per 100 person-years, 1.3-1.8). An overall 45% reduction in risk of HIV transmission among serodiscordant couple was associated with ART treatment (adjusted Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.55, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.44-0.69). Treatment prevention had significantly effectiveness for most baseline characteristics of index partners, such as for male, female, age above 25 years, education below high school, farmer, infected by heterosexual intercourse. Treatment-as-prevention can be implemented in the real-world on a national or regional scale, but ART adherence and comprehensive harm reduction while implementing this strategy require further study.	0	1
30852569	Management and Outcome of Ventricular Septal Rupture Complicating Acute Myocardial Infarction: What Is New in the Era of Percutaneous Intervention?	Postinfarction ventricular septal rupture (PI-VSR) is a rare but devastating complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Risk stratification in the acute phase is crucial for decision-making, and this study analyzed the risk factors for early mortality and the effects of various management options on the outcome of PI-VSR patients in the era of percutaneous intervention. A total of 96 patients with PI-VSR were identified and divided into an acute-phase survivor group (n = 46, survived ≥2 weeks after admission) and a nonsurvivor group (n = 50, died within 2 weeks after admission). Percutaneous closure was considered in acute-phase survivors. Patients were followed up for a mean 47 (quartiles 15-71) months by clinical visit or telephone interview. The overall acute-phase (i.e., < 2 weeks after the diagnosis of PI-VSR) mortality rate was 52%. Female sex and Killip Class III-IV at admission were associated with an increased risk of acute-phase death. Of the 46 patients who survived ≥2 weeks, 20 underwent interventional occlusion and the procedure was successful in 19. Percutaneous closure in the acute-phase survivor group improved the immediate (21% in-hospital mortality rate) and long-term (53% mortality) outcomes. Patients with PI-VSR are at a high risk of acute-phase mortality. Female sex and severe cardiac dysfunction at admission are linked with a high rate of acute-phase deaths. Percutaneous closure in acute-phase survivors results in favorable short- and long-term benefits for PI-VSR patients.	1	0
30859156	The effects of short-term use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on bone metabolism in child cancer patients.	The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is the most commonly used hematopoietic growth factor recombinant DNA technology. It affects bone metabolism by modulating both osteoclast and osteoblast functions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of short-term use of G-CSF on bone metabolism in children with leukemia and solid tumors. Thirty-six patients with a malignancy who received G-CSF therapy according to chemotherapy protocols and another 20 growth factor-free cancer patients who were enrolled as controls were included in the study. The serum osteocalcin and urinary free deoxypyridinoline levels were measured before the start of G-CSF therapy, on day 3 after treatment, and 7 days after G-CSF therapy was discontinued. In the control group, the measurements were made during corticosteroid and methotrexate-free chemotherapy. The mean osteocalcin level (8.6±2.3 ng/mL) from before the onset of treatment decreased significantly (7.7±2.3 ng/mL) on day 3 of G-CSF therapy and significantly increased after 7 days of G-CSF therapy (7.9±2.2 ng/mL) (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively), which was still significantly lower than the pre-G-CSF values (p<0.001). The urinary free deoxypyridinoline level significantly increased on day 3 of G-CSF treatment (25.6±6.5 nmol/mmol Cr) and significantly decreased after 7 days of G-CSF therapy (22.6±6.4 nmol/mmol Cr) (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively), which was still significantly higher than the values recorded before G-CSF therapy (p<0.001). The findings show that the short-term use of G-CSF in children with cancer can affect bone metabolism and can play a role in metabolic changes. Decreased osteoblastic activity and increased osteoclastic activity suggest that osteoporosis may be associated with bone pain in these patients.	1	0
30859158	Bradyarrhythmia development and permanent pacemaker implantation after cardiac surgery.	Bradyarrhythmia is one of the complications that may develop after cardiac surgery. Only a few studies have previously dealt with this concern, and in our study, we investigated the factors affecting the development of atrioventricular block or sinus node dysfunction and the requirement of permanent pacemaker following cardiac surgery. A total of 62 patients who developed the atrioventricular (AV) block or sinus node dysfunction and required a permanent pacemaker following cardiac surgery were included in the study. Among these, 31 patients were evaluated prospectively, and the information regarding 31 patients was evaluated retrospectively based on hospital records. Demographic, clinical, and surgical information was recorded. Patients were grouped according to the types of procedures, including the coronary artery bypass graft, valve surgery, congenital heart disease, and combinations of these. Patients were evaluated by standard 12-lead electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiography preoperatively. The postoperative development of bradyarrhythmia and requirement of permanent pacemaker were evaluated. The mean age of patients with preoperative conduction abnormality and wide QRS was statistically significantly higher than those without these disorders. The odds ratio for preoperative conduction abnormality risk in patients over 70 years of age was found as 4.429 (95% confidence interval, 1.40-13.93). There was no gender-related statistically significant difference in terms of left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular dilatation, interventricular septum thickness, the time interval from operation to the development of AV block, concomitant diseases, and complication rates. Preoperative conduction abnormality and wide QRS in patients over 70 years of age was determined as a risk factor.	1	0
30859166	Daytime sleepiness, functionality, and stress levels in chronic neck pain and effects of physical medicine and rehabilitation therapies on these situations.	To evaluate the relationship between symptom severity, daytime sleepiness, and perceived stress levels and the impact of physical medicine & rehabilitation (PMR) therapies on these situations in chronic neck pain (CNP) conditions. The study included 54 patients with CNP and 20 healthy control individuals. Patients with CNP were divided into two groups: the PMR therapy group (n=34) and the CNP control group (n=20). The PMR therapy programs of the patients included TENS, hot packs, therapeutic ultrasound, and exercises. Visual analog scale (VAS) at activity and resting for neck pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, chin-manubrium distances (CMD), and tragus-wall distances (TWD) values were evaluated before and after the treatment programs. Significant differences were found between the CNP patients and healthy controls regarding PSS, TWD, and CMD values. Furthermore, significant differences were detected between the PMR group and the CNP control group in the final evaluation of the VASresting, VASactivity, PSS, and NDI levels. Evaluation of CNP from a single point of view can leave clinically missing points. Patients with CNP should be assessed for daytime sleepiness, stress levels, and functionality, and PMR therapies can be effective in relieving pain and psychological stress in patients with CNP.	1	0
30886962	Prevalence of chronic widespread pain in a population-based cohort of patients with spondyloarthritis - a cross-sectional study.	Chronic pain, regional or widespread, is a frequent and multidimensional symptom in arthritis. There is still limited information on chronic pain in spondyloarthritis, which is important to recognize for adequate diagnosis and treatment. Our objective was to study differences in prevalence of chronic widespread pain in two spondyloarthritis subgroups: ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and undifferentiated spondyloarthritis (USpA). A population-based postal survey involving questions on the duration, distribution, and intensity of pain was answered by 940 patients with AS (ICD-10 M45.9) or USpA (ICD-10 M46.1-0, M46.8-9). The patients were categorized as having chronic widespread pain, chronic regional pain, or no chronic pain, and prevalence estimates for the pain groups were calculated, including age- and sex-adjusted prevalence. The prevalence of chronic widespread pain was 45.3% in AS vs. 49.3% in USpA, and that of chronic regional pain was 17.7% vs. 21.9% (p = 0.033). More women than men reported having chronic widespread pain (54.1% vs. 41.2%, p ≤ 0.001), while the sex distribution for chronic regional pain was equal. Reports of pain intensity were equal in AS and USpA, with no significant difference in pain intensity between women and men who had chronic regional pain or chronic widespread pain. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, chronic widespread pain was associated to female sex, being an ever-smoker, and having a higher body mass index, controlled for SpA subgroup and disease duration. The prevalence of chronic widespread pain in patients with AS and USpA is high, and with a female predominance, but with no difference in pain intensity between women and men. Chronic pain can complicate the clinical evaluation in patients with SpA, and highlights the need for a thorough clinical examination, including evaluation of inflammation and an accurate pain analysis, to individualize non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment decisions.	0	1
30891243	Endovenous Celon radiofrequency-induced thermal therapy of great saphenous vein: A retrospective study with a 3-year follow-up.	Our main objective was to evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy of Celon radiofrequency-induced thermal therapy for endovenous treatment of incompetent great saphenous vein. The secondary objectives were to report on possible short-term side effects and complications. This was a retrospective study of 112 consecutive patients included between 2013 and June 2015. These patients were treated (146 great saphenous vein, C2-C6) either at the hemodynamic room using local anesthesia or at the operating theater under general anesthesia with or without phlebectomy. All patients received radiofrequency-induced thermal therapy at 18 W power, 1 s/cm pullback rate and 5-7 pullbacks per segment of 10 cm (i.e. maximum 10 pullbacks). A clinical follow-up via ultrasound monitoring was done at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years. The 3-year survival occlusion rate was 96.71% and 98% for overall and radiofrequency-induced thermal therapy patients, respectively. No major side effects were observed. A case of endovenous heat-induced thrombosis was reported. Slight neurological disorders were reported (0.88%). Our unit's endovenous Celon radiofrequency-induced thermal therapy of incompetent great saphenous vein was efficient, well tolerated, without major side effects. Moreover, in order to reduce possible neurological disorders, we advise multiple pullbacks at 1 s/cm and using tumescence anesthesia.	1	0
30918550	Applicability and outcome of laparoscopic adrenalectomy for large tumours.	Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has been shown to be as safe and effective as conventional open surgery for small and benign adrenal lesions. With increasing experience with laparoscopic adrenalectomy, this approach has become the procedure of choice for the majority of patients requiring adrenalectomy. In our department, from 2011 to 2016, a total of 28 patients with 31 adrenal tumours underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy regardless of tumour size. Our policy in the department is to exclude adrenal tumours that are potentially malignant or metastatic adrenal tumours for laparoscopic resection. In this a retrospective study, we divided patients into two groups according to tumour size: < 5 or ≥ 5 cm, which was considered as the definition of large adrenal tumours. We compared demographic data and per- and postoperative outcomes. There was no statistical difference between the two groups for per-operative complications (16,6% vs 18,75% , P = 0.71), postoperative complications (16,6% vs 18,75% , P = 0.71), postoperative length of hospital stay (5 vs 8 days P = 0.40), mortality (0% vs 0%) or oncologic outcomes: recurrence and metastasis (8.3% vs 6.25% P = 0.70). The only statistical difference was the operating time, at a mean (SD) 194 (60) vs 237 (71) min (P = 0.039) and the conversion rate (0% vs 12.5% P < 0.01). Laparoscopic adrenalectomy can be done for all patients with adrenal tumours regardless of tumour size, even it needs more time for large tumour but appears to be safe and feasible when performed by experienced surgeons.	1	0
30988828	Effect of Montelukast 10 mg in Elderly Patients with Mild and Moderate Asthma Compared with Young Adults. Results of a Cohort Study.	The clinical characteristics and physio-pathogenic mechanisms of asthma in patients older than 60 years appear to differ from the behavior described for other age groups. Therefore, the effectiveness of medications for elderly patients with asthma should not be extrapolated from studies conducted on teenagers or young adults. The study aimed to establish the clinical effect of montelukast 10 mg in elderly patients with mild and moderate asthma compared to its effect on young adults. A prospective cohort study was conducted during 12 weeks of follow-up, which consecutively included the total population of adult patients attended by a group of 21 general practitioners, between July and December 2016. Young adults (18-59 years) and older adults were included (60 years or older) with mild or moderate asthma, which, according to the criteria of his treating physician, had been prescribed montelukast 10 mg/day. The variables of interest were: use of inhaled corticosteroids during the last month, use of inhaled beta-2 adrenergic agonists as a rescue in the last month, having attended the emergency service during the last month due to an asthma attack, presence of wheezing in the physical examination, the number of attacks in the last month and the number of days without symptoms in the last month. A total of 126 patients entered the cohort and 104 completed the follow-up, of which 29% were older adults. On admission, 65.4% of patients (68/104) had used rescue inhaled beta2 in the last month and had been using schemes with corticosteroids. After 12 weeks of follow-up, 58.1% (43/74) of the young adults required treatment schedules with corticosteroids, while in the elderly, only 36.7% of the patients (11/30) required this treatment scheme (p-value: 0.047). Regarding the use of rescue inhaled beta-2 at 12 weeks, 55% of young adults reported using them, compared to 33.3% of older adults (p-value: 0.041). In this cohort of patients, treated with montelukast 10 mg/day for 12 weeks, there was a reduction of broncho-obstructive symptoms and exacerbations of the disease. In older adults compared to young adults, a greater reduction in the use of beta2 agonists rescue medications and in the concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroid schemes was documented.	1	0
31037206	[Surgical treatment of intracranial meningiomas in Nouakchott, Mauritania].	Meningiomas are frequently encountered tumours in neurosurgery. However, there is a paucity of data concerning their epidemiology, their clinical characteristics and their treatment compared to gliomas. This study aims to identify the epidemiological profile and to assess the quality of treatment of intracranial meningiomas (ICM) at the National Hospital Center in Nouakchott, Mauritania. We conducted a retrospective study of patients who had undergone surgery for the treatment of ICM between September 2013 and September 2016. Thirty-two patients had undergone surgery for the treatment of ICM (26.6%). The average age was 45.12 (± 13.8 years) among whom 75% were women. The average length of stay in hospital had been 13 days (± 7 days). The mean time between symptom onset and diagnosis had been 10 months (±5months). The mean size of ICM had been 5.07cm (±2.00cm) ranging from 2.5cm to 10.5cm. Complementary MRI had been performed in 46.8% of patients after brain CT scan. In our series, 38% of ICM had grown on brain convexity. The mean surgical time had been 23.91 days (±17days). The quality grade of surgical resection assigned according to Simpson score was Grade I (66%), Grade II (19%), Grade III (6%), Grade IV (9%). The histological grade assigned according to the 2007 WHO classification was Grade I (93%), Grade II-III (7%). The overall operative mortality was (n=3, 9.4%). The development of technical equipment in the department of neurosurgery, radiology and of equipment in anesthesia and intensive care will contribute to improve outcomes and to reduce mortality rates.	1	0
31093359	Investigating adherence to Australian nutritional care guidelines in patients with head and neck cancer.	Significant weight loss and malnutrition are common in patients with head and neck cancer, despite advances in treatment and development of evidenced-based guidelines. The aim of this study was to assess adherence to evidenced-based guidelines and investigate nutrition outcomes during and post radiation treatment in head and neck cancer patients. This was a two-year retrospective cohort study of 209 head and neck cancer patients (85% male) treated with ≥20 fractions of radiation (mean dose = 64.8 Gy delivered over 31.9 fractions) at an Australian tertiary hospital. Regarding guideline adherences, 80% of patients were seen by a dietitian weekly during treatment and 62% of patients were seen bi-weekly for six-weeks post-treatment. Average weight loss was 6.7% during treatment and 10.3% three-months post treatment. At the end of treatment, oropharyngeal and oral cavity patients had lost the most weight (8.8, 10.9%), with skin cancer and laryngeal patients losing the least weight (4.8, 2.9%). Gastrostomy patients (n = 60) had their tube in-situ for an average of 150 days and lost an average of 7.7 kg (9.4%) during treatment and 11.5 kg (13.5%) from baseline to three-months post treatment. The number of malnourished patients increased from 15% at baseline to 56% at the end of treatment, decreasing to 30% three-months post treatment. Despite high adherence to evidenced-based guidelines, large discrepancies in weight loss and nutritional status between tumor sites was seen. This highlights the opportunity for further investigation of the relationship between tumor site, nutritional status and nutrition interventions, which may then influence future evidenced-based guidelines.	1	0
31093568	OPTimal IMAging strategy in patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department: chest X-ray or ultra-low-dose CT (OPTIMACT)-a randomised controlled trial chest X-ray or ultra-low-dose CT at the ED: design and rationale.	Chest X-ray has been the standard imaging method for patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department (ED) for years. Recently, ultra-low-dose chest computed tomography (ULD chest CT) has been introduced, which provides substantially more detailed information on pulmonary conditions that may cause pulmonary disease, with a dose in the order of chest X-ray (0.1 vs. 0.05 mSv). The OPTimal IMAging strategy in patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department: chest X-ray or CT (OPTIMACT) study is a randomized trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of replacing chest X-ray for ULD chest CT in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the ED. Two thousand four hundred patients presenting at the ED with pulmonary complaints and suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease will be enrolled in this multicenter, pragmatic, randomized trial. During randomly assigned periods of one calendar month, either conventional chest X-ray or ULD chest CT scan will be used as the imaging strategy. Randomization will rely on computer-generated blocks of 2 months to control for seasonal effects. Chest X-ray and ULD chest CT will be performed in a standardized way, after obtaining the clinical history and performing physical examination and initial laboratory tests. The primary outcome measure is functional health at 28 days. Secondary outcome measures are mental health, length of hospital stay, mortality within 28 days, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) during the first 28 days, correct diagnoses at ED discharge as compared to the final post hoc diagnosis, and number of patients in follow-up because of incidental findings on chest X-ray or ULD chest CT. In an economic evaluation, we will estimate total health care costs during the first 28 days. This pragmatic trial will clarify the effects of replacing chest X-ray by ULD chest CT in daily practice, in terms of patient-related health outcomes and costs, in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the ED. The OPTIMACT trial is registered in the Netherlands National Trial Register under number NTR6163. The date of registration is December 6, 2016.	0	1
31143842	A nested randomised trial of the effect of tranexamic acid on intracranial haemorrhage and infarction in traumatic brain injury (CRASH-3 trial intracranial bleeding mechanistic study): Statistical analysis plan.	Background: The CRASH-3 trial is a randomised trial on the effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) versus placebo on death and disability in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The CRASH-3 intracranial bleeding mechanistic study (IBMS) is a randomised trial nested within the CRASH-3 trial to examine the effect of TXA versus placebo on intracranial bleeding and infarction. Methods: Patients eligible for the CRASH-3 trial, with a GCS of 12 or less or intracranial bleeding on a pre-randomisation CT scan are eligible for the IBMS. The occurrence of intracranial bleeding, infarction, haemorrhagic oedematous lesions, mass effect and haemorrhage evacuation is examined within 28 days of randomisation using routinely collected brain scans. The primary outcome is the volume of intra-parenchymal bleeding in patients randomised within three hours of injury (adjusted for prognostic covariates). Secondary outcomes include a composite poor outcome, progressive and new intracranial bleeding, intracranial bleeding after neurosurgery and cerebral infarcts seen up to 28 days post-randomisation. All outcomes will be compared between treatment groups. Statistical analyses: The primary outcome will be analysed using a covariate adjusted linear mixed model. The same analysis will be done separately for patients who undergo haemorrhage evacuation post-randomisation. We will express the effect of TXA on the composite outcome, new and progressive bleeding using relative risks and 95% CIs, and on cerebral infarcts using hazard ratios and 95% CIs. We will conduct sensitivity analyses assuming missing data are MCAR or MNAR. Conclusion: The IBMS will provide information on the mechanism of action of TXA in TBI. This pre-specified statistical analysis plan is a technical extension of the published protocol. Trial registration: The CRASH-3 trial was prospectively registered at the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials registry (19 July 2011) and ClinicalTrials.gov (25 July 2011). The registries were updated with details for the IBMS on 20 December 2016.	0	1
31191944	Strong relations of elbow excursion and grip strength with post-stroke arm function and activities: Should we aim for this in technology-supported training?	To investigate the relationships between an extensive set of objective movement execution kinematics of the upper extremity and clinical outcome measures in chronic stroke patients: at baseline and after technology-supported training at home. Twenty mildly to severely affected chronic stroke patients participated in the baseline evaluation, 15 were re-evaluated after six weeks of intensive technology-supported or conventional arm/hand training at home. Grip strength, 3D motion analysis of a reach and grasp task, and clinical scales (Fugl-Meyer assessment (FM), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and Motor Activity Log (MAL)) were assessed pre- and post-training. Most movement execution parameters showed moderate-to-strong relationships with FM and ARAT, and to a smaller degree with MAL. Elbow excursion explained the largest amount of variance in FM and ARAT, together with grip strength. The only strong association after training was found between changes in ARAT and improvements in hand opening (conventional) or grip strength (technology-supported). Elbow excursion and grip strength showed strongest association with post-stroke arm function and activities. Improved functional ability after training at home was associated with increased hand function. Addressing both reaching and hand function are indicated as valuable targets for (technological) treatment applications to stimulate functional improvements after stroke.	1	0
31191948	Neurorehabilitation therapy of patients with severe stroke based on functional electrical stimulation commanded by a brain computer interface.	Brain computer interface is an emerging technology to treat the sequelae of stroke. The purpose of this study was to explore the motor imagery related desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythms of stroke patients and to assess the efficacy of an upper limb neurorehabilitation therapy based on functional electrical stimulation controlled by a brain computer interface. Eight severe chronic stroke patients were recruited. The study consisted of two stages: screening and therapy. During screening, the ability of patients to desynchronize the contralateral oscillatory sensorimotor rhythms by motor imagery of the most affected hand was assessed. In the second stage, a therapeutic intervention was performed. It involved 20 sessions where an electrical stimulator was activated when the patient's cerebral activity related to motor imagery was detected. The upper limb was assessed, before and after the intervention, by the Fugl-Meyer score (primary outcome). Spasticity, motor activity, range of movement and quality of life were also evaluated (secondary outcomes). Desynchronization was identified in all screened patients. Significant post-treatment improvement (p < 0.05) was detected in the primary outcome measure and in the majority of secondary outcome scores. The results suggest that the proposed therapy could be beneficial in the neurorehabilitation of stroke individuals.	1	0
31191954	Electrical stimulation devices for the prevention of venous thromboembolism: Preliminary studies of physiological efficacy and user satisfaction.	Electrical stimulation could provide an alternative method for preventing venous thromboembolism in stroke patients. The purpose of this preliminary study was to explore the effects of electrical stimulation and intermittent pneumatic compression on enhancing lower limb venous return in healthy and chronic stroke patients and also to evaluate patient and nurse satisfaction. We investigated the effectiveness of two electrical stimulation devices: Geko (Firstkind Ltd, High Wycombe, UK) and Orthopaedic Microstim 2V2 (Odstock Medical Ltd, Salisbury, UK); and one intermittent pneumatic compression device: Huntleigh Flowstron Universal (Huntleigh Healthcare Ltd, Cardiff, UK). We recruited 12 healthy and 5 chronic stroke participants. The devices were fitted sequentially, and Doppler ultrasound measurements were taken. Eight patients and nurses were also recruited for a separate usability evaluation. The electrical stimulation devices emulated the blood flow characteristics of intermittent pneumatic compression in both healthy and stroke participants provided that the intensity of electrical stimulation was sufficient. Patients and nurses also felt that the electrical stimulation devices were acceptable. Electrical stimulation may offer benefit as an alternative method for venous thromboembolism prevention in stroke patients. The apparent benefit is sufficient to warrant further investigation in a full powered randomised controlled trial.	1	0
31234179	A Long-Term Follow-Up Study on Disclosing Genetic Risk Information (APOE) to Promote Healthy Lifestyles in Finland.	This observational follow-up study was designed to assess the long-term behavioural and clinical effects of receiving personal genetic risk information. The information disclosed was the carrier status of the apolipoprotein E (APOE)alleles, which differentially contribute to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease. This study forms a continuum with a previous 1-year intervention (2010-2011) monitoring the effects of disclosing the carrier status of the APOE ε4risk allele. The follow-up measurements, performed 5.5 years post-intervention, included clinical measurements (blood values and anthropomorphic parameters) and questionnaires (psychological and behavioural factors). The participants were healthy adult volunteers, aged 26-73 years (n = 70) who had participated in the previous intervention, and received their APOE allele status either at the beginning (former test group) or the end of the intervention (former control group). Personal genetic risk information resulted in a moderate health-conscious change in diet and had a slight positive long-term effect on clinical factors, particularly the serum lipids. These improvements were subsequent to the disclosure of genetic information and occurred mainly in the APOE ε4-positive members of the former control group, that is, those who were at increased genetic risk for CVD but had not been informed of their status before the end of the intervention. In contrast, changes in the values and health behaviour of the APOE ε4-positive individuals in the former test group, who had already changed their health behaviour during the previous intervention as a result of being informed of their carrier status, varied more: some continued to improve, some remained at their previously improved level, and some relapsed slightly. Both groups had nonetheless displayed an improvement immediately subsequent to the disclosure of their personal genetic risk. Receiving information on increased personal genetic risk (carrier status of APOE ε4)for CVD provided the motivation for improvements in health behaviour. The resulting changes, while modest, in most cases remained visible even after a number of years.	1	0
31304309	Wearable activity monitors to assess performance status and predict clinical outcomes in advanced cancer patients.	An objective evaluation of patient performance status (PS) is difficult because patients spend the majority of their time outside of the clinic, self-report to providers, and undergo dynamic changes throughout their treatment experience. Real-time, objective activity data may allow for a more accurate assessment of PS and physical function, while reducing the subjectivity and bias associated with current assessments. Consenting patients with advanced cancer wore a wearble activity monitor for three consecutive visits in a prospective, single-cohort clinical trial. Provider-assessed PS (ECOG/Karnofsky) and NIH PROMIS® patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed at each visit. Associations between wearable activity monitor metrics (steps, distance, stairs) and PS, clinical outcomes (adverse events, hospitalizations, survival), and PROs were assessed using correlation statistics and in multivariable logistic regression models. Thirty-seven patients were evaluated (54% male, median 62 years). Patients averaged 3700 steps, 1.7 miles, and 3 flights of stairs per day. Highest correlations were observed between average daily steps and ECOG-PS and KPS (r = 0.63 and r = 0.69, respectively p < 0.01). Each 1000 steps/day increase was associated with reduced odds for adverse events (OR: 0.34, 95% CI 0.13, 0.94), hospitalizations (OR: 0.21 95% CI 0.56, 0.79), and hazard for death (HR: 0.48 95% CI 0.28-0.83). Significant correlations were also observed between activity metrics and PROs. Our trial demonstrates the feasibility of using wearable activity monitors to assess PS in advanced cancer patients and suggests their potential use to predict clinical and patient-reported outcomes. These findings should be validated in larger, randomized trials.	1	0
31304314	Exploratory study examining the at-home feasibility of a wearable tool for social-affective learning in children with autism.	Although standard behavioral interventions for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are effective therapies for social deficits, they face criticism for being time-intensive and overdependent on specialists. Earlier starting age of therapy is a strong predictor of later success, but waitlists for therapies can be 18 months long. To address these complications, we developed Superpower Glass, a machine-learning-assisted software system that runs on Google Glass and an Android smartphone, designed for use during social interactions. This pilot exploratory study examines our prototype tool's potential for social-affective learning for children with autism. We sent our tool home with 14 families and assessed changes from intake to conclusion through the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), a facial affect recognition task (EGG), and qualitative parent reports. A repeated-measures one-way ANOVA demonstrated a decrease in SRS-2 total scores by an average 7.14 points (F(1,13) = 33.20, p = <.001, higher scores indicate higher ASD severity). EGG scores also increased by an average 9.55 correct responses (F(1,10) = 11.89, p = <.01). Parents reported increased eye contact and greater social acuity. This feasibility study supports using mobile technologies for potential therapeutic purposes.	1	0
31431966	An investigation of contextual factors in the application of multisensory illusions for analgesia in hand osteoarthritis.	Emerging evidence suggests that multisensory illusions can modulate pain and can lead to changes in body perception. The aim of this study was to investigate whether contextual factors could explain the analgesic effects of multisensory body illusions on pain and body perception in people with hand OA (HOA). In a crossover study, 28 individuals with painful HOA viewed their most affected hand in and outside of a real-time mediated reality system, with illusory stretching of the hand and changes in sensory input. The outcome measures were pain ratings, pressure pain thresholds, hand function and the subjective experience of the illusion. Stretching the hand both inside and outside the virtual environment led to a reduction in subjective pain ratings (all P < 0.05). Virtual stretching led to changes in body perception (P < 0.05) with no changes in pressure pain threshold (all P > 0.05). Higher pain at baseline predicted susceptibility to the stretch illusion and mean susceptibility ratings were greatest after the stretch illusion. The current study highlights the importance of the context in which pain occurs and in which potential treatments may be applied. In this case, virtual and physical stretching modulated pain, but not viewing the hand alone. The research opens important implications for future research, including the use of contextual control conditions and the development of visual feedback interventions for a range of similarly visible chronic conditions for which pain, body image disturbances and body dissatisfaction may be apparent.	0	1
31447979	Fertility sparing surgery for ovarian sex cord stromal tumors: a nine case series.	Ovarian Sex Cord Stromal Tumors (SCST) are a rare disease carrying a good prognosis. They generally affect young women; therefore fertility preservation is a critical issue. Fertility Sparing Surgery (FSS) showed promising results in both oncologic safety and fertility preservation. A retrospective case series involving 9 patients diagnosed with SCST and treated with fertility sparing surgery at our institution was conducted between January 2000 and May 2015. The median age was 24 years old (10 to 39). The main clinical manifestation was pelvic pain seen in seven patients. Five patients complained about menstrual cycle disorders. The nine patients went through fertility sparing surgery; seven had conservative staging and the other two had a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Three patients out of nine had a pelvic unilateral lymphadenectomy. Two patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Only two patients presented locoregional recurrence that occurred respectively after 7 and 192 months. The treatment combined chemotherapy and surgery based on mass resection. One patient achieved a natural pregnancy after the treatment. FSS seems to be a suitable approach for SCST. However, more case series and meta-analysis should be conducted.	1	0
31516437	Treatment adherence and short-term outcomes of smoking cessation outpatient clinic patients.	Previous studies have shown that adherence to treatment is fundamental to success in smoking cessation. However, smoking cessation medication regimens are limited significantly by the struggle to adhere to them. This study was conducted to evaluate the factors associated with treatment adherence and quitting success in a group of patients that applied to our smoking cessation outpatient clinic (SCC). Patients that applied to SCC between April 2015 and December 2016 who were evaluated, found suitable for smoking cessation interventions and started pharmacological treatment were included in this study. Only those who could be reached by phone three months after their first application became participants. Those who had used the prescribed treatment for at least 30 days were grouped as treatment-adherent. In total, data for 346 patients were evaluated. Mean (±SD) age was 44.3±13.9 years; most of them were male (63%), primary school graduated (36.1%), self-employed (43.7%), and had no comorbid diseases (71%). Bupropion was started in 52% of the patients, that rate was 35.8% for varenicline and 12.1% for a combination of the nicotine patch and gum. Mean days for treatment use was 20.9±18.5; 59% of the patients were non-adherent to their treatment and 51.7% had only one control visit number. Adverse reactions due to treatment were recorded in 25% of participants, and at their third month 37.9% of them had quit smoking. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, increase in control visit number, absence of adverse reaction, and varenicline use, were each associated with higher treatment adherence (p<0.001) and only being in the treatment-adherent group was associated with quit success (OR=3.01, 95% CI: 1.88-4.81, p=0.001). This study showed that most patients did not use their prescribed SC treatments adequately; a main factor that affects quit success is treatment adherence. There is a need for closer monitoring and follow-up to ensure adequate use of treatment of patients.	0	1
31516442	Exploring the impact of efficacy messages on cessation-related outcomes using Ecological Momentary Assessment.	Observational studies indicate that cigarette package inserts with efficacy messages about the benefits of quitting (i.e. response efficacy) and recommendations for successful cessation increase smokers' self-efficacy to quit and promote sustained cessation. However, the effects of inserts with such efficacy messages have not been studied using experimental designs. This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess smokers' responses to efficacy inserts. In a randomized case-crossover study among smokers from the United States (n=23), participants received a one-week supply of cigarettes with efficacy inserts and a one-week supply without any inserts, and were randomized to use the packs with inserts on either the first or second week of the study. For 14 consecutive days, participants used a smartphone to answer brief surveys on cessation-related variables during smoking sessions and at the beginning of each day. Multilevel mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models compared responses during the insert period to those of the non-insert period. The insert period was associated with greater desire to quit (b=0.21, p=0.012), motivation to quit (b=0.18, p=0.001), self-efficacy to cut down (b=0.26, p<0.001) and to quit (b=0.28, p<0.000), and response efficacy/perceived benefits of quitting (b=0.13, p=0.012). Insert exposure was not significantly associated with forgoing cigarettes (OR=1.9, p=0.2). Results from this EMA study suggest that inserts with efficacy messages may promote determinants of smoking cessation. This is consistent with observational research in Canada, which is the only country to use inserts with efficacy messages as well as pictorial warnings about smoking risks on the outside of packs. Future studies should assess the extent to which efficacy inserts can not only be used to communicate health information to smokers but also work in synergy with pictorial warnings.	1	0
31516443	Effects of smoking on disease risk among South Korean adults.	Tobacco smoking is currently considered to be the main preventable cause of death and disability worldwide. We examined the magnitude of cigarette smoking effects on major smoking-related diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension (HTN) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), among South Korean adults using nationwide and representative survey data. We used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which was conducted over a 9-year period from 2007 to 2015 by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between smoking status and all outcomes of interest. A total of 24072 participants ≥40 years of age were sampled in the current study. The study results were as follows: 1) Current and former smoking is associated with lower socioeconomic status; 2) The prevalence of major smoking-related diseases was significantly higher in former and current smokers compared to non-smokers; 3) The odd ratios of developing COPD were 3.49 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.44-5.00], 2.41 (95% CI: 1.68-3.45) and 3.45 (95% CI: 2.20-5.40) among male current smokers, male ex-smokers and female current smokers, respectively. The odd ratio of developing CVD was 2.01 (95% CI: 1.05-3.86) in male ex-smokers. Otherwise, no significant associations between smoking and other diseases were observed after controlling the sociodemographic and clinical factors; and 4) The risk for COPD tends to be related to the smoking amount and weaning after quitting smoking. Our study showed that COPD had the strongest association with current and former smoking in both male and female smokers after controlling for all potential confounding factors among major smoking-related diseases.	0	1
31516468	Receiving support to quit smoking and quit attempts among smokers with and without smoking related diseases: Findings from the EUREST-PLUS ITC Europe Surveys.	Having a chronic disease either caused or worsened by tobacco smoking does not always translate into quitting smoking. Although smoking cessation is one of the most cost-effective medical interventions, it remains poorly implemented in healthcare settings. The aim was to examine whether smokers with chronic and respiratory diseases were more likely to receive support to quit smoking by a healthcare provider or make a quit attempt than smokers without these diseases. This population-based study included a sample of 6011 adult smokers in six European countries. The participants were interviewed face-to-face and asked questions on sociodemographic characteristics, current diagnoses for chronic diseases, healthcare visits in the last 12 months and, if so, whether they had received any support to quit smoking. Questions on smoking behavior included nicotine dependence, motivation to quit smoking and quit attempts in the last 12 months. The results are presented as weighted percentages with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and as adjusted odds ratios with 95% CI based on logistic regression analyses. Smokers with chronic respiratory disease, those aged 55 years and older, as well as those with one or more chronic diseases were more likely to receive smoking cessation advice from a healthcare professional. Making a quit attempt in the last year was related to younger age, high educational level, higher motivation to quit, lower nicotine dependence and having received advice to quit from a healthcare professional but not with having chronic diseases. There were significant differences between countries with smokers in Romania consistently reporting more support to quit as well as quit attempts. Although smokers with respiratory disease did indeed receive smoking cessation support more often than smokers without disease, many smokers did not receive any advice or support to quit during a healthcare visit.	0	1
31826042	In search of clinically relevant parameters to monitor successful omalizumab therapy in allergic asthma.	Omalizumab is approved as add-on therapy for the treatment of severe uncontrolled allergic asthma. Increase in quality of life and decrease of exacerbations and hospital admission, as well as immunmodulatory effects have been described with omalizumab therapy. However, to date there are few parameters to monitor success and to evaluate the individual advantage of this therapy for the patient. Furthermore, no reliable parameter to predict response to treatment exists so far. The aim of this study was to define an easily applicable parameter for response to treatment with omalizumab. 43 patients with allergic asthma were treated with omalizumab at a dose of at least 0,016 mg/kg/IgE every 4 weeks. Before, and 12 weeks after initiation of therapy, bodyplethysmography including airway resistance was performed. Efficacy of treatment was judged by the attending physician on the basis of a five point chart. Furthermore, a differential blood count was performed before, and 12 weeks after initiation of treatment. Total and specific IgE against all relevant antigens were determined before start of therapy. Airway resistance in patients with response to treatment with omalizumab (responders) was significantly decreased in comparison to patients without clinical benefit (non-responder). The number of eosinophil granulocytes in the peripheral blood was decreased in both groups without significant difference. Response to therapy was associated with younger age and lower levels of specific IgE against the allergen with the highest sIgE-level (seasonal and perennial), but not with the sIgE level of the perennial allergens in general. Measurement of airway resistance might be an additional parameter for monitoring response to therapy with omalizumab. High specific IgE levels, for both perennial and concomitant seasonal allergens as well as increasing age, seem to predict less favorable treatment outcomes.	1	0
